# Analyzing Trends of Music Lyrics and Features Throughout the Decades

---

## Problem
Analyzing the most popular songs of the last decades and understanding how the songs change throughout the
years in terms of genres, features, generations, lyrics, etc.

---

## Summary
The main goal of this project is to understand and analyze how the most popular songs change throughout
the years. Starting from the 1960s, we focused on each yearâ€™s the most popular songs and try to answer
questions such as:
- How do the most frequent words in the songs change with decades?
- How do popular genres change throughout the years?
- Can we explain these changes by the sociopolitical status of the related era? How are these
changes related to real life?

The real-world application of this project is: it can help us understand the music trends and the changes in genres better. Also, it can provide some insights for other people who are in need to do feature extraction, model training, and recommendation systems in this field, etc.

In conclusion, this project looks for relations between genres, intertextual connections, acoustic
phenomena (track features), and the time.

## Methodology
1. We created our dataset using Billboard, Lyrics Genius, and Spotify APIs. (More details in the next section.)

2. Cleaned the data, removed corrupted data-lyrics.

3. Conducted preliminary data analysis, recognised the data and explored some fun facts

4. Analyzed the most popular songs of the last decades

5. Understood how the songs change throughout the years in terms of genres, features, generations, lyrics, etc. 

6. Found trends, changes, and interesting facts about the world's music taste in the last 60 years.

## Data Source
In this project, our analyses are based on Billboard Hot 100 charts of the years between 1960-2020. 
We also analyzed lyrics and song characteristics. To build our dataset we used these Python packages:

- billboard
	
- lyricsgenius
	
- spotipy

Using the python packages we have built our dataset from the scratch. We first pulled the data for the Billboard Hot 100 list. Then we merged lyrics data using LyricsGenius API. Finally, we merged Spotify features to our main data using spotipy Python API.

---

## Installation

```shell
$ pip3 install billboard.py
```

```python
import lyricsgenius
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

#Connect to LyricsGenius
genius = lyricsgenius.Genius("Your_ID_goes_here")

#Connect to Spotify API
## You need to get your Spotify API clientid and password, details are in the source codes.
client_credentials_manager = SpotifyClientCredentials(client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret)
sp = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=client_credentials_manager)

#setup nltk library
import nltk
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## Codes:

### Project Jupyter Notebook:
- [Final_Plots.ipynb](../master/Final_Plots.ipynb) : A summary of the plots

### Data Extraction and Preparation:
 - [c_01_data_data_extract.py](../master/source_codes/c_01_data_data_extract.py) : **Get Billboard Hot 100 and Lyrics Genius Data**
 	- This code creates the main data frame of our project. To run this code you should import pandas, billboard and lyricsgenius Python packages, when you run the code it automatically connects to APIs, gets Billboard Hot 100 data, merges lyrics to it and saves the data to the existing directory. It creates a different csv for each different year and stores them under '/data/newVersionOfLyrics'. The output data include columns like artist_names, title, lyrics
 - [c_02_data_spotify_song_features.py](../master/source_codes/c_02_data_spotify_song_features.py) : **Get Spotify song features using Billboard hotlist**
 	- To run this code you should import spotipy package and also you should read your spotify credentials to the code. The way to do this is presented in the code. Also; pandas, numpy, and difflib libraries are required. This code uses the output of c_01_data_data_extract.py. For each csv that is located in '/data/newVersionOfLyrics' it finds the Spotify features using spotipy and stores them under 'data\spotify_features_csvs'. The csv names and dataframe ids are the same as '/data/newVersionOfLyrics'. 
	- You should also provide some folder paths to this code, these paths are the paths to the folders in the project Git repo. For example:
	git_path = os.getcwd(),
	hot_list_path = '/data/newVersionOfLyrics/',
	target_path = '/spotify_features_csvs/'
	- The output data include columns like artist_names, title, lyrics, acousticness, tempo, valence, genre
 - [c_03_data_combine_hotlist_and_spotify.py](../master/source_codes/c_03_data_combine_hotlist_and_spotify.py) : **Combine Billboard and Spotify data**
 	- To run this code you should import langdetect, nltk on top of previous packages. This code uses the outputs of the previous two codes, merges them, and stores them under 'data\combined_dataset'. This code also conducts a usability check on the data and labels if the record is valid or not.
 - [c_04_data_dataprep_genre_sentiment.py](../master/source_codes/c_04_data_dataprep_genre_sentiment.py) : **Extract genres, create genre mapping, create sentiment feature**
 	- To run this code you should import vaderSentiment, textblob on top of the previous libraries. This code creates a mapping between spotify genres and known genres. There are too many genres in the Spotify data, thus we are projecting them onto a lower-dimensional space. This code also conducts sentiment analysis on the lyrics. It uses the files under 'data\combined_dataset' and updates the same files. Similar to c_02_data_spotify_song_features.py you should again specify your paths.

### Analysis:
 - [c_05_analysis_hotlist_analysis.py](../master/source_codes/c_05_analysis_hotlist_analysis.py) : **Analysis of our raw data, understanding the data**
 	- This code includes many functions that allow us to make plots and data manipulations. Example use and import of this code can be found in our Jupyter notebook.
 - [c_06_analysis_artist_popularity.py](../master/source_codes/c_06_analysis_artist_popularity.py) : **Analysis of artist popularities**
 	- Functions to analyze artist popularity, you can import the functions and use them as we did for c_05_analysis_hotlist_analysis.py
 - [c_07_analysisfun_fact_syp.py](../master/source_codes/c_07_analysisfun_fact_syp.py) : **Some fun facts about the dataset**
 	- Functions to analyze our data, extract fun facts, you can import the functions and use them as we did for c_05_analysis_hotlist_analysis.py
 - [c_08_analysis_get_top_genre.py](../master/source_codes/c_08_analysis_get_top_genre.py) : **A basic analysis on genres**
 	- Functions to analyze Spotify genres, you can import the functions and use them as we did for c_05_analysis_hotlist_analysis.py
 - [c_09_analysis_genreacous.py](../master/source_codes/c_09_analysis_genreacous.py) : **Functions to plot song features**
 	- To run this code you need to import plotly and wordcloud packages. It includes the functions to do feature time series plots. The example use of this code can be found in our Jupyter notebook.
 - [c_10_analysis_generation_wordcloud.py](../master/source_codes/c_10_analysis_generation_wordcloud.py) : **Wordcloud plots for different decades**
 	- To run this code you need to import plotly and wordcloud packages. It includes the functions to do wordcloud plots. The example use of this code can be found in our Jupyter notebook.
 - [c_11_analysis_genre_sentiment_analysis.py](../master/source_codes/c_11_analysis_genre_sentiment_analysis.py) : **Plots about genres in years-decades, related plotting and data read functions**
 	- Data reading and genre plotting functions. The example use of this code can be found in our Jupyter notebook.
