[Refrain]
Snoop
Snoop

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes? See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear
Talkin' all that raspy shit, tryin' to ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second (Ding)
Matter fact, you should take four, b
And think before you fuck with lil Skateboard P

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a DJ
""Two, one, yep, three!""
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a livin' room full of fine dime brizzles
Waitin' on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Chizzle
G's to the bizzack—now, ladies, here we gizzo!

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a bad boy, with a lot of hoes
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that!
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you, I'm only here to twist you
Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue
Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose!

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot

After I done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast baby now I can't find you
Oooh!
I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk but it seems like it can't come through
All them lies like you could satisfy me
Now I see where believing you got me
Gave you the wheel, but you can't drive me

Oooh!
Two things I don't like when I tryin' to get my groove
Is a partna that meets me only half way and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction
Oooh!
You understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you
You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
I know the difference of a man and an adolescent
It ain't you, boo, so get to steppin'!

8,Breakaway,"[Verse 1]
Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)

[Verse 2]
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray) I could break away

[Chorus 1]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

[Verse 3]
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
And breakaway

[Chorus 1]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

[Bridge]
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

[Chorus 2]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Welcome to the fallout
Welcome to resistance
The tension is here
Tension is here
Between who you are and who you could be
Between how it is and how it should be, yeah

I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor

Maybe forgiveness is right where you fell
Where can you run to escape from yourself?
Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna go?
Salvation is here

Yo, these niggas can't breathe when I come through

Look look, they hearts racing, they start chasing
But I'm so fast when I blow past that they can't (breathe)
In the presence of the man
Your future look better than your past if you present with the man
You better (breathe)

[Verse 1]
You niggas can't share my air
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear
And I'm getting better year by year, like they say wine do
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the K-9's through
And I pace myself
I know these money-hungry bitches wanna taste my wealth
But I keep em on a diet
Embrace they health, or either keep em on the quiet
And space myself and just take a deep breath
I got em grabbing they chest
Cause it's hurting them to see Fab in his best
And they in they worst
They'd rather see me lay in a hearse than lay in the 'Bach
And I ain't just laying a verse, I'm saying the facts
I came back with some sicker stones
That got these broke niggas looking at me
Like they choking on a chicken bone
Every chick I bone can't leave the dick alone
So I know it's one of them every time I flip my phone

I see them on the block when I passes
Looking like they need oxygen mask-es
I make it hard to (breathe)
But I keep the Glocks in the stashes
Cause the cops wanna lock and harass us
And make it hard to (breathe)
They has to react, like having an asthma attack
When they see the plasma in back
You dudes are wheezing behind me
My flow is like a coupe, breezing at ninety
That's the reason they signed me
The slick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
Feels something like hard punches to the gut
How I address the haters and underestimaters
And ride up on em like they escalators
They shook up and hooked up to respirators
On they last breath talking to investigators
I'm a breath of fresh air in a fresh pair
Face it boo and do it till your face get blue
And then (breathe)

[Verse 3]
Yo these niggas can't...
When the crew walk in it, pop a few corks in it
As quick as a tick in a New York minute
Catch a breath, 'fore you catch a left
Even worse, catch a Tef', only way you catch an F
To the A-B, it's in the May-B, rolling with my baby
Gripping on a toy that you won't find at KB
I rhyme slick on ya
They gon' have to put the Heimlich on ya
What you know bout letting dimes lick on ya
While you inhale the weed
And it won't stop till they inhale your seed
And it don't stop till I tell 'em to breathe
Like a doctor with a stethoscope
I don't see no fucking hope
Unless these motherfuckers breathe

A yo.. the crib got your friends working
We travel to France for french curtains
You was there when I was on the bench hurtin'
Now that I own my team
Its only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can't let her get lost now
She carries the money, the hammer, and material across town
And understand she fine
Understand she mine
She understand the grind
Cooks, clean, and irons
And whatever shes wanna push I'mma cosign
And if I ain't got it already than I'mma go find it
I guess I'mma lucky don, and shes a lucky queen
Cause her jewelry box look likes Lucky Charms
All color stones
And she know that I'm in the hood, but she also knows that I'm coming home
Mr. Raspy, thought I was in love with money
'Til the first time we getting nasty

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Uh yo, Whatever the road to paradise is we on it
Gave you your income tax checks so I can get on with
Those were the days, these are the times
You held me down with nearly damn near everything, even my rhymes
I will play a song for you
And you will let me know exactly how the ladies will respond from a womens
Point of view
And that's why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin' in the bed with a Pearl Long Vickie
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she's real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel
The sex was crazy then and crazy still
And you know I'm from the streets so its crazy ill
And we waiting on the new island
We been to all them 4, 5 times come on mommy you whilin

Come hold me, come feel me, come take me anyway you wanna baby

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
A yo the money is great but what we got is more better
We got the four letters when it comes from the heart its more pleasure
And for the fact that you trust me still
Thus far I appreciate what we build
All the minks that I bought you that dragged the floor
And all the nights you sat up and bagged the roar
Damn I'm thinking that you gotta hate it
But yet and still you tolerate it
That's why ma we gotta make it

I can't keep my eyes off ya
I can tell why them other guys lost ya

And that's why I can offer, similarities in our characters
Haven't you heard the word 'round town? How I get down
They gon' whistle, everybody part is official
And that ass wit' you, got my dick as hard as a missile
Don't hop on top, cause I ride around with a pistol
If they pull us over, I'll be out of town with an issue
If you was mine, I'd introduce you to mama girl
You're stylin' in your boots and Gabbana, I'm so used to your Prada
I take trips cause out in Houston it's hotter
Throw in that Al Green and juice the Impala
Make my jewels and my collar
You had me feelin' like a fool when I hollered

So I'mma leave it at that, take a hint and put in my math
I imagine, you probably look twice as good in the bath
And I'm buggin' cause I can see you right in the hood when I pass
I'm never stable cause business is on my ass
But you could be the one that I visit before I dash
And I admit, I've been the type to hit and split
But you can't blame me for the females that I been gettin' with
Cause, most of these broads has had they eyes on my grit
To the eager shit, and learned to be satisfied with the dick

And pop a Listerine strip in, before you get all up in a bitch face

Çünkü bu partiyi doğru sete koymaya geldik
Hadi geri dönelim bu gece!
Ve eğer en öne geçmemize izin vermezlerse;
Biz yan taraftan dolanacağız
Çünkü bu oyundan asla çıkmak istemiyorum
En azından ''Güle güle'' demeden önce..
Yani, solumda ki bütün hayranlarım
Ve sağımdaki bütün hayranlarım; son bir kez sallayıııın!


[Giriş: Eminem]
Doktor için kıçınızı kaldırın! Son bir kez dahaaa
Doktor için kıçını kaldır, hadi şuan da!
Işte gidiyoruz, çekişme, bu başka bir ''club banger!''
Koltuk kenarlarında oturun,  aşağıya iniiin

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Eminem]

Zaman doldu, oyun bitti, kaybettin, ben kazandım!
Burada, bu salaklara nasıl karşılaştığımızı göster
Oh evet, yeni yıl, bir sonraki aşama başlıyor..
Bakın kim var(?)  sen yine deliriyorsun
Ben bir trendim, her girişimde bir tane ayarlıyorum
Dışarı çıkıyorum ve tam bir daire ile geri geliyorum
Sen heveslisin, bu zaten sahip olduğumuz bir şey anlamına geliyor
Ama sen gittikten sonra geri dönemeyeceksin

Çok kötü, şimdi haritadan çıktın ve radar seni bulamıyor bile
Öğütmeye devam ediyoruz, sen kay, seni dışarı öğütüyoruz
Sinirle etrafta dolanıyorsun, öfkenin seni kör etmesine izin veriyorsun
Sadece oyun oynuyoruz, keman sesleri arkandalar
Tüm sidik ve iniltiler şarap içip şikayet etmek için yeterli
Otur ve gözlemle, dinleyin, eğer dikkatini verirsen öğreneceksin
Neden 10 multi-platin albümden sonra 3 elmas ?!
Dünya çapında, tek mermiyle grafiklerdeyiz ve hala tırmanıyoruz..

Dr Dre ''Delirin'' dediğinde delireceksin

DELİRİN!  DELİR!  DELİR!  DELİR!

Ve 50 Cent ''Zıplayın'' dediğinde
Tek ayağını kaldır ve zıpla

ZIPLA!  ZIPLA!  ZIPLA!  ZIPLA!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]

Uğultu muazzam! Hepinizi hissetmek için düşüyoruz
Onu teşvik etmem gerekmiyor çünkü Doc 'un bench 'in dışında olduğunu biliyorsunuz

Partiyi menteşelerinden sürdürüyoruz
Gösteriş yapmayacağız, sadece popüler fikir birliğine gidiyoruz

Ancak eleştirmenler Doc 'un yumuşak olduğunu söylüyor, o konuşuyor;
Doctor hepsini yıkamış, becermiş, Doc' un lanet izlenimi kimdir?
Doctor bu, doctor o, yanlış izlenime sahipsin!
Doc un horozunda olmalısın çünkü doc hepinizi tatmin ediyordu
Bu yüzden DJ, iğneyi al ve sadece plağın üzerine bırak. Ne?!
Biz sıçrayacak ve bu orospu çocuğuna ikinci kez vuracağız, Vur! (bam-bam)
İşte bu yüzden daima sondaki en iyi kesimden tasarruf ediyoruz
Size Scratch yaptıracak ve kaşıntı yapacak taze kesilmiş çimler gibi

Çünkü biz köpekbalıkları ile yüzdük, timsahlarla güreştik
Kızgın genç nesil için konuşuyoruz
Kimse rap için köprü olmasaydı eğer
Boşluklar ırkçı yetiştirmek için yükseltilirdi
Yüzlerimizi hiç görmemiş olabilir
Rolling Stone sayfalarının kapaklarını derecelendirdi
Dil ve ırk bariyerlerini aştı
Sadece pelerinli haçlıları ara ve ben ve Dre 'ye bırak
Mikrofona geçmek için bütün gün ileri-geri oynayabiliriz
''Hot patato'' oyunu gibi işte bu yüzden geldik ...

[Verse 3: 50 Cent, Dr. Dre & Eminem]

Şimdi dans edin, ellerinizi kaldırın, nasıl yaptığımızı biliyorsun
Gittiğimiz her yerde klübün sıçramasını sağlıyoruz
Bu bir sır değil, herkes biliyor..
Dre işin içine dahil ise çok fazla para var!

Ve bolca bal içeren güneşli bir pazar ile palmiye ağaçları
California! Sadece her gün başka bir parti
Vadilerden onlara dek gidiyor, tüm 8 Mile sokakları

Hadi Ralli yapalım! Büyük final için ellerini kaldır
Şimdi koltuğunu yükselt dr dre konuşuyor
Bir kilo otu yakıp haftanın altı gününe karıştır

Beni stüdyoda yakalayabilirsin
Beat ritimleri sana sunmak için vuruyor
Isıyla birlikte hoparlörlerinizi yakmaya devam ediyor

Yani asla ''Asla'' deme çünkü Shady / Aftermath birlikte!
G-unit Records hediyeler ile birlikte
Doc ve Shady'nin dönüşünü sunuyor
Hiç kimse daha iyisini yapamaz, bu klübü yıkıyoruz!
Ve bir parça delil bırakmadan ayrılıyoruz ..

Evet, haha! Hala AFTERMATH, 2006!
Ve ''Detox'' albümü hakkında endişelenmeyin, o geliyor ..
Dre'nin yaptığını yapıyoruz! Hahaha! 50 Cent!

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

25,Some Beach,"[Verse 1]
Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car driving dude with the road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone

[Chorus]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and a warm breezes a blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 2]
I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in

[Chorus 2]
Some beach, somewhere
There's nowhere to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot señioritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 3]
I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You’re not going to feel a thing we'll give you some Novocain
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb

[Chorus 3]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up that atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evening air

26,Charlene,"[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning found a letter that she wrote
She said she's tired that I'm always on the road
Too hard to swallow being alone
She needs someone at night that she can hold
She must have told me a thousand times before
Silent cries I use to ignore
God knows I love her
Didn't mean to hurt her

[Chorus]
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

[Verse 2]
She knows I really love this old music thing
Since I was a child it's been my dream
I can support her treat her and spoil her
You know buy her the finer things
But I forgot about loving her
Damn the money, diamonds, and pearls
What about the hard day she had with the baby
All she need is for me to love her

[Chorus]
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

[Bridge]
Promise I can't live without her
God knows I need her loving
And it hurts so bad that's she gone away
I pray that she'll come back one day
In my life

I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end

With mayo and tomato

We got too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life

Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke

When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew

Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

I love my records
Black, shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played 'em all
Country, soul and rock-n-roll
What happened to those times

I am reading Street Slang For Dummies
'Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money

Let East Coast bang, let West Coast bang
And Rule gon' bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushing through in the sky blue
Back with the Gods, you now, preferably the four pound
Slugs flying at the speed of sound
Tryin to catch the ears of niggas that's running their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the running's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airing our prey out
Leaving 'em layed out, dead, in just a sport
'Cause we ain't playing up here in New York

Nigga, I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find God
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talking crazy how they're AK spit
But we done did some investigating, and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth, homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw, nigga, Joe gon' let 'em loose on me""
True Story, I'm bringing the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to Lean Back
My nigga Dre said, ""grind, Cook""
Now we killing them hard

Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn

Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gon' die, you might get missed
For maybe two or three hours, 'til they light they spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken, and you know they say that you deserved it
Whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold the title, 'cause I'm in the hood
Like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doing shit for nothin', it's so spiteful, ha, I'm just like you
Word that niggas wanna murk you is in the air
A double shot of 'gac and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment

[Verse 1]
Lights go down, it's dark, the jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart, a feeling so much stron-
-ger than a thought, your eyes are wide and though your soul
It can't be bought, your mind can wander

Hello, hello! (¡Hola!)

It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something
I can feel
Feel

The night is full of holes as bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold, they twinkle as the boys
Play rock and roll, they know that they can't dance
At least they know
I can't stand the beats, I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music, swinging to the music
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's grateful dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
God damn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him
With no pen, just draw off inspira-tion-tion
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him
With cheap imitations for these generations

Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?

From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 45, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

Do you ever feel out of place

Do you lock yourself in your room

That no one hears your screaming?

Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more
Before your life is over?
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding

And no one ever stabbed you in the back

If I gave it all away for one thing

A little worried, kinda wondering what i did
I said lord please forgive me for my sins

You're going if i have to drag your butt to church

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
Made it throught the sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beers, watched the game and cooked some steaks
My little brother had a big fight with his wife
My poor mother sat between them both all night

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

We said a prayer for cousin micheal in iraq
We're all aware he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he wanted to be a soldier more than most

I laid in bed that night and thought about the day
And how my life was like a rollercoaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way
It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight
You can't really smile until you've shed some tears
I could die today or i might live on for years

Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop… pajama time!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Come here, little kiddies! On my lap!
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know; who'd hear it?
Give a little ""poot poot,"" it's okay
(*fart*) Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

43,Lean Back,"[Intro: Fat Joe]
Owwwwww! Yeah! My niggas, ahah
Throw your hands in the air right now, man!
Feel this shit right here, Scott Storch, nigga
Yeah Khaled, I see you nigga, show Big Pun love
Uh, yeah, uh, yo

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York; shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think, muh'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

[Verse 2: Remy Martin]
R to the Ezzy, M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride 'til I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a V.I.P section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thang, nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed, now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway

Lean back, lean back (come on!)

Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla: to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K Crip walkin' like, ""That's what's up!""
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship

She hit the door 6:55 sack full of groceries split down the side
Can goods scattered all the way to the curb
Look on her face saying don't say a word
So, it's me and her and a can of beans sitting there on the front porch swing
Western sky all turning red
Head on my shoulder she sighed and said

Coffee maker, Copy repairman

Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals
Dancing backwards in high heels

She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you

[Verse 2]
She said the girl I was with the business degree probably wouldn't recognize me
I was gonna run the bank
I was gonna run the math
Now all I want to run is a bubble bath
Back then you know I had this plan
Before all of this reality set in
Here comes life boy ready or not
Hey I wanted it all and that's what I got

Because I'm gophering, chauffeuring, company chairman

47,Nothing On But The Radio,"I sure do hope this is a long night
Cause I have never felt one so right
Each look into your eyes, I'm falling
A little more and more

Looks like we started us a fire
Wrapped up in flames of desire
With every touch, they're burning higher
Two shadows dancing on the wall

With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

We'll fall asleep here in the moonlight
In tangled sheets, we'll be here all night
And when we wake up in the morning
We might stay like this all day

Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With every tender little kiss

Nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better

The thing that kept me strong
Is the one thing that is always on my mind

When he said all the things I wanted to hear

And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires

Stake out a little piece of shoreline

Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear

And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires

If you feel so happy, then why do you cry
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense
Like an ocean liner shouldn't float on the sea
A pearl in an oyster or a circus of fleas
Someone so perfect can't be fallin' for me
Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense

Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusin'
You can win when you're losin'
Stand when you're fallin'

57,Bless The Broken Road,"[Verse 1]
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yes, he did)

[Verse 2]
I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

[Chorus]
Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms

So I can call you later on,on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do, cause tonight we cutting, gut busting
I'm digging in your walls something viscious
With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut someting serious

With your pretty brown skin, like almond joys and kisses

In and out of your jaws, I was beating down your walls
Had your ass breaking laws for a player was the cause
And every time you seen a G you was slipping off your drawers, I recall
I met your ass at the mall, in the fall
You the one with the dress on, let me take you home
Show your ass how to buss a nut, up in the guts

69,Come Home Soon,"I put away the groceries
And I take my daily bread
I dream of your arms around me
As I tuck the kids in bed

I don't know what you're doin'
And I don't know where you are
But I look up at that great big sky
And I hope you're wishin' on that same
Bright star

I wonder, I pray

(Chorus:)
And I sleep alone
I cry alone
And it's so hard livin' here on my own
So please, come home soon
(Come home soon)

I know that we're together
Even though we're far apart
And I'll wear our lucky penny 'round my neck
Pressed to my heart

I wonder, I pray

(Repeat Chorus)

(Bridge:)
I still imagine your touch
It's beautiful missing something that much
But sometimes love needs a fighting chance
So I'll wait my turn until it's our turn to dance

I wonder, I pray

(Second Chorus:)
I sleep alone
I cry alone
Without you this house is not a home
So please, come home soon

(Third Chorus:)
I walk alone
I try alone
I'll wait for you, don't want to die alone
So please, come home soon

Come home soon

70,Caught Up,"[Verse 1]
I'm the kind of brother
Who been doing it my way, getting my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life, I've hit, love and left the tears
Without a care

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I can't figure it out, why...

I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold on me

[Break 1]
Let me go, baby
Now, listen...

[Verse 2]
My mama told me
Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around
Same old song
But I was so sure
That it wouldn't happen to me 'cause I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This girl was mean, she really turned me out
Her body was so tight, I'm looking for her in the daytime with a flashlight
My homies say this girl is cramping my style
And I can't figure it out, but...

I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted

Since you've been gone
I've been alone here
I've grown old
I fall to pieces, I'm falling
Fell to pieces and I'm still falling

Every time I'm falling down
All alone I fall to pieces

I keep a journal of memories
I'm feeling lonely, I can't breathe
I fall to pieces, I'm falling
Fell to pieces and I'm still falling

All the years I've tried
With more to go
Will the memories die
I'm waiting

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh baby, oh yeah
I remember when I met you on Crenshaw
I almost crashed my truck and spilled my Hen' dawg
Yes you, God blessed you, I was trying to get next to you
Your homegirls was hating, but I didn't care
You said you had a man, I was like, ""Where?""
It was something so different about you
I felt so gifted around you
Even though you had a man and all
I took the chance to call, we held hands at the mall
That day was so special to me
Your man left you at Mickey D's
You called me, I scooped you up
I seen fear in your eyes, the tears in your eyes
He can't hug you how I hug you
Better yet love you like this thug do
You're so special, you're the one but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish, I could replace him
'Cause I know that baby you're the one
I'm having the time of my life felt the world on wheels
You and your homegirl got some skills
Nobody make me feel like you do
Or better yet real like you, I messed around and killed dude
I seen homegirly just flossin', we made eye contact
Dude always is flossin', me never
You and B L A C K forever
Tattered on my neck in green letters
Late night eating Hagen-daz, watching Uncut
And me sitting there, playing wit your butt
Took off your clothes, I hit it on the couch
Even though mom's in the house
Nothing could replace this feeling
It's like winning 2 million, our bond closer than Sicilians
I know old boy, won't leave you alone
I know you love him, but our love is strong
You're so special, you're the one but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish, I could replace him
'Cause I know that baby you're the one
I couldn't leave well enough alone, hell I had to hit ya cell phone
I left you a message, it went like this, ""I love you, muah""
I guess it's my luck, I goes to the Magic
Damn, ain't that his truck?
I guess you wit him, screw him
If it wasn't for you, I'd have to do him
You seen 'em at Jack In The Box
He was mackin' a lot, to some rats in a drop
Now you call The Beat and The Power
Dedicate songs every hour all Hell done
Broke loose he got your pass code
To your cell and my Nextel shirt too
I guess it's time for you to decide
Which one of us you want in your ride?
You're so special, you're the one but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish, I could replace him
'Cause I know that baby you're the one
You're so special, you're the one but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feeling

Well I was 22 working double overtime
I was spending dollars and making dimes
We were overdrawn, yea and barely hanging on

With tears in your eyes and an EPT and said

Was some people standin' in between us
I had to go over there so I could meet him I had him
Pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin'
If he, crush me then trust me it's a guarantee that he's not leavin'
Told me he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin'
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress
I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes

Then you pull in the drive and you hit the chair
And the one you love is waitin' there

Hey, That's what it's all about

And they eat their food
They Cry, and they Fuss and you can't Cuss

Where they running right up on you in that black on black
So move - better - bounce like a mother

When he ordered up his third one he looked around
Then he looked at me, said I do believe I'll have one more
He said I hate this bar and I hate to drink
But on second thought tonight I think I hate everything

[Verse 2]
Then he opened up his billfold and threw a 20 down
And the faded photograph fell out and hit the ground
And I picked it up, he said thank you bud, I put it in his hand
He said I probably ought to throw this one away
Cause she's the reason I feel this way, I hate everything

[Chorus]
I hate my job, I hate my life and if it weren't for my two kids I'd hate my ex-wife
I know I should move on and try to start again
But I just can't get over her leaving me for him
Then he shook his head and looked down at his ring and said I hate everything

[Verse 3]
He said one bedroom apartment where I get my mail
Is really not a home, it's more like a jail
With a swimming pool and a parking lot view, man that's just great
I hate summer, winter, fall and spring
Red and yellow, purple, blue and green, I hate everything

Call, call my name
Call it, call my name

[Verse 1]
I've heard your voice this morning
Calling out my name
It had been so long, since I've heard
That it didn't sound quite the same, no
But it let me know that my name
Had never really been spoken before
Before the day I carried you
Through the bridal path door
And ever since that day I haven't wanted, anyone but you
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth, that I

[Chorus]
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do

[Verse 2]
I heard a voice on the news saying
People want to stop the war
If they had a love as sweet as you
They'd forget what they were fighting for
What's the matter with the world today?
The land of the free, somebody lied
They can bug my phone and peep around my home
They'll only see you and me making love inside

[Chorus]
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do

[Verse 3]
I've never seen the moon look so lovely
As the night I saw it with you
Let me know I'd never seen the moon before
So many speak of the moon
As though it had no flaws
But to compare it to a beauty like yours
Would give one pause
Nothing about you is false
That's why your love is real
That's why your love is real love
God forbid if you belonged to another
I'd have to steal you
I'd have to take you from your man
I might be tempted to break the law round here
Because your beauty it gives one pause
It slows me down

[Chorus]
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do

She was in the backyard
They say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pick-up truck
Her folks shoulda seen it coming
It was only just a matter of time
Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
She stuck a note on the screen door
""Sorry, but I got to go""
That was all she wrote
Her mama's heart was broke
That was all she wrote
Or so the story goes

[Chorus 1]
Now her daddy's in the kitchen
Staring out the window
Scratching and a-racking his brains
How could 18 years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line

[Verse 2]
Now, don't you wonder
What the preacher's gonna preach about Sunday morning
Nothing quite like this has happened here before
Well, he must have been a looker
A smooth talking son of a gun
For such a grounded girl to just up and run
Course you can't fence time
And you can't stop love

[Chorus 2]
Now all the biddies in the beauty shop gossip
Going non-stop
Sipping on pink lemonade
How could 18 years just up and walk away?

Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line

She's got her pretty little bare feet
Hanging out the window
And they're heading up to Vegas tonight

Big cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)
Any day they could dig your grave
Shit, so big is my inspiration, dig?
No reward unless the risk is taken
In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places
I, on the other hand, relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it, you wouldn't recognize it
From the time that I bought it, I just replaced it
I risk cases for shit like this

Word to my Uncle Ray, who gave his life for some shit like this

See I ain't never been a fronter

I used to living luxurious, I don't wanna live here
The walls is gray, the clothes is orange
The phones is broke, the food is garbage
Lotta niggas is living with these circumstances
S.P.'s the same, I still merk your mans-es
Drug money to rap money, work advances
Niggas ran and told, I should've merked to Kansas
Got popped for a murder attempt
Knock me on D-Block when I was burnin' the hemp
Had a brick in the stash

100,Bridging The Gap,"[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Nas talking]
The light is there

[Intro: Olu Dara singing]
See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive

[Verse 1: Nas]
Let's go!...
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey --
Chuck Berry of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging the gap, from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo

[Olu Dara singing]
See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive
Greatest man alive (Yeah, turn it up!)
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!

[Verse 2: Nas]
The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, ""Mr. Jones please come get your child
Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild""

[Olu Dara singing]
I was born in Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Moved to New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive
Greatest man - The great-greatest man alive

[Verse 3: Nas]
Hey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu
Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to

[Olu Dara singing]
I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique
Madagascar, Paris, Greece
The Middle Africa is where we lived
Better known as Queenbridge
[Nas]
Nas, Nas you don't stop
Olu Dara in the house, you don't stop
Muddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't stop
From the Blues to Street Hop you don't stop
Tell 'em Pop

[Outro: Olu Dara singing / Nas adlibbing]
See I come from Mississippi (Let 'em know)
I was young and runnin' wild (Runnin' wild)
Ended up in New York City (Yeah!)
Where I had my first child (That's me)
I named the boy Nasir (Yeah, Daddy!)
All the boys call him Nas (Luh ya, boy)
I told him as a youngster
He'll be the greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)

She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied

Why can't you understand that anything I'm offering
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguing
From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again
Even if flipped out on at the mall again

Why my niggas ain't get that cake
Why is a brother up North better than Jordan
That ain't get that break
Why you ain't stackin' instead of tryin' to be fly
Why is rattin' at an all time high
Why are you even alive
Why they kill 2Pac n' Chris
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin Crist'
Why them bullets have to hit that door
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw
Why he kiss that whore
Why

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
All that I been givin'
Is this thing that I've been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that
Try'd to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why, oh why
Why they gotta do me like that
[Jadakiss]
Why would niggas push pounds and powder
Why did bush knock down the towers
Why you around them cowards
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari
Why he take that bike
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail
Why they stop lettin' niggas get degreez in jail
Why you gotta do eighty-five percent of your time
And why do niggas lie in eighty-five percent of they rhymes
Why a nigga always want what he can't have
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag
Why did crack have to hit so hard
Even though it's almost over
Why niggas can't get no jobs
Why they come up wit the witness protection
Why they let the terminator win the election
Come on, pay attention
Why sell in the stores what you can sell in the streets
Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least

[Chorus]
[Jadakiss]
Uh, yea, yo
Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it
Why they didn't make the CL6 wit a clutch
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reachin' for my dutch
Why rap, cause I need air time
Why be on the curb wit a ""why lie I need a beer"" sign
Why all the young niggas is dyin'
Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they livin' wit iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for aids
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days
Why you screamin' like it's slug, it's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York
Why you forcin' you to be hard
Why ain't you a thug by choice
Why the whole world love my voice
Why try to tell 'em that it's the flow son
And you know why they made the new twenties
Cause I got all my old ones
That's why

Cause I'm fresh in my white tee, they glance at my white tee
And I got that hat that match my pants and my white tee
Whoever that you might see, I know they got a white tee

Or you can throw-back this, but partner check my knot
And all my ghetto gangstas white tee, laws gone hate ya
With street game and a little fame them hoes gonna chase ya
Can't escape bro, this white done covered the map

Come to the hood you can find me trapping in my white tee
Standing with a full grill niggas might try me

Haters try to bite me, some try to dislike me

Look, I know you wanna chill wit a player
But all you got to do is keep it real wit a player
Just answer your phone whenever I call
Cause I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball
I like them short and tall but not too thick
I just walk in the spot and take my pick
And they wanna roll cause they like my style
And when I pop my collar I make them smile
I need a lady in the streets but a freak in the sheets
That know how to cook cause a nigga like to eat
Spaghetti, shrimp and steak and I'll adore you
I'll treat you like milk, I'll do nothing but spoil you

These silly little wounds will never mend

And I will not be back here again

Wrote my injuries all in the dust

120,If Nobody Believed In You,"I watched him take the two strike call
He hadn't tried to swing at all
I guess he had all he could take
He walked away for goodness sake
His father's voice was loud and mean
""You won't amount to anything""

That little boy quit trying
He just walked away
There were tear drops on his face
Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you

That old man said, ""One more try
I know I'm not too old to drive
I promise son, I'll do my best
This time I'm gonna pass the test""
""Give me the keys dad and get in""
His father never drove again

That old man quit trying
He just turned away
There were tear drops on his face
Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you

We take his name out of schools
The lawyers say it breaks the rules
Pledge of allegiance can not be read
And under God should not be said
I wonder how much he will take
I just pray it's not too late

What if God quit trying
He just turned away
There were tear drops on his face
Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you

Miracles (what)
True blessings (what)
All because of love

True stories (what)
Miracles (what)
True blessings (what)
All because of love

I was riding in my car one day (oh)
In the express lane rolling down the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings
Then I reached down beside me
Then I looked on the floor felt, on the back seat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before I knew it
Here comes this truck now
The doctor said I don't think he's gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said unto me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
And for 10 years I've been straight

Chorus:
You saved me(woah) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me

Now I've been sitting in the chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone would call me with a job opening
Cause its been so hard for me month to month
Struggling to eat but still there was no answer(no answer)
I stopped believing in his word And got so mad at him
When somebody say Gods good I just laugh at them(oh yeah)
And in the nick of time his blessing rained on me
By his grace the phone ring a lady says were hiring
And that's when I knew

Chorus:
You saved me(saved) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me

Now I was 18 out on the block selling drugs
With a gun at my waist And for people had no love
See the streets was my home and family and friends were gone
Had no one to trust and deep inside I was all alone
And then a deal went bad one day and it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before I knew it I was on my knees
(Blood gushing out my body my hearts beatin fast
I don't know what I'm a do I don't think I'm gonna last)
Then I began to flash back on the thing I've done in my past
(Then I heard a small voice that said to me I'll give you peace if u believe)
I accepted Christ that day hallelujah now I'm free

Chorus:
You saved me(saved) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me

I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering where did it come from
(I got tested)and the results came back and the doctor said I'm sorry but you got cancer
I could not believe it so I called up my mama to calm my nerve
(mama)she got down on her knees (mama)she said a prayer for me
(mama) said just keep on thanking Jesus (mama)he'll give you all you need
That was five years ago don't have that pain no mo
Doc says you can go home cause all your caners gone

Says he wants you, he says he needs you
It's real talk, then why not make him wait for you?
If he really wants you, if he really needs you
Really got to have you
Take your time and feel him out
When he's a good boy, I mean a really, really good boy
Why not let him lay with you?
That's when you give it to him good

Meet him at the door with nothin' on
Take him by the hand, let him know it's on

Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh
Baby girl, the way you pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I might stop to shop and cop you things
You know I drop the top and hop that thang
Sometimes I stop my bop to pop my thing
You sure know how to make a man say, ""Oh""
And how in the world can a man say, ""No""
When you grind it up on the wall, wind it up like a doll
And you know I Bacardi, lime it up till you fall
Line it up 'till you spoiled
And have those other chicks throwin' vomit up
When they can't find it up in the mall
Like most men, I love to catch up with a model
But I ain't used to movin' slow like ketchup in a bottle
And the best things come to those who wait for it
But I'mma be straight for before it's too late for it
I want you to dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out and make me say, ""Oh""

Somebody listen please
It used to be so hard being me

Living in a nightmare
A never-ending sleep
But now that I am wide awake
My chains are finally free
Don't feel sorry for me

All the days collided
One less perfect than the next
I was stuck inside someone else's life and always second best
Oh, I love you now 'cause now I realize
That it's safe outside to come alive in my identity

So if you're listening
There's so much more to me you haven't seen

Living in the shadow

Trying to find a hand to hold, but every touch felt cold to me
Living in a nightmare

But now that I am wide awake
Then I can finally see
Don't feel sorry for me

I was living in the shadow of someone else's dream
Trying to find a hand to hold, but every touch felt cold to me
I'm living in a new day, I'm living it for me

Yeah, I can finally be
So don't feel sorry for me

The West Coast never fell off, I was 'sleep in Compton

Nate Dogg doing his thing, DPG still popping
I got ""California Love,"" fuckin' bitches to that 'Pac shit
And Westside Connection been had it locked, bitch
I'm in the rear-view, my guns is cocking
I put red dots on a nigga head like Rodman
All Stars, fat laces, gun charge, court cases
Fought that, not guilty, I'm back, niggas hate me
Been there, done that, sold crack, got jacked
Got shot, came back, jumped on Dre's back
Payback, homie, I'm bringing C.A. back
And I don't do button-up shirts or drive Maybachs
All you old record labels tryna advance

Like Snoop Dogg C-walkig on top of the Devil's roof
Rap critics wanna converse about this and that
'Cause red strings in his Converse, and this a Dre track
Keep jibbing and jabbing, I pull the .38 Magnum
Magnum and get to clickin' and clacking
Your homies wanna know what happened
Come to Compton, see Thriller like Mike Jackson
I might be Spike Lee of this gun clappin'
Prior to rapping, I was drug trafficking
In the dope spot, playing John Madden

You wanna die? Run up on that black 7-45

131,Feels Like Today,"[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
With this feeling inside me that I can't explain
Like a weight that I've carried been carried away, away
But I know something is coming
I don't know what it is, but I know it's amazing
You save me
My time is coming
And I'll find my way out of this longest drought

I know it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing I'm wishing
The last sacred blessing, and hey
It feels like today
Feels like today

[Verse 2]
You treat life like a picture
But it's not a moment that's frozen in time
It's not gonna wait 'til you make up your mind, at all
So while this storm is breaking
While there's light at the end of the tunnel
Keep running towards it
Releasing the pressure, that's my heartache
Soon this dam will break

[Chorus]
It feels like today, I know
I know it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing you're wishing

I know it feels like today, I'm sure

Cut throater, have you like a brand new virgin
It's like when you get used of it then you start serving
Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jerking
Slow down for me, a-you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm tryna grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and I'ma make you get on me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark let me bury my bone
I got four or five bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick
That outside dick keep them hoes sick like

If you going through your cycle, I ain't with it, I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth baby, you know they was wrong
Now, make it official, wind up some of that dome
I don't mind buying blue, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together, I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know
And Juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the 'Nolia get a chance with it?
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping she don't leave my dick broken
With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting, she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya I'ma see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting, slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'ma deal with ya

I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful?

How you said them words it had to be love
Basically it had to be us
Against the world not giving two fucks

Kept shit smooth even when it got rough
But, I don't see that no more
Got one half our wait hope he sore
What the fuck is hopin' for
When I can't be the man I used to be no more
No time, we don't go out to eat no more
Barely home, you don't see me before you sleep no more
You love me, and I know you ain't playin
Cuz the first week gone, you callin' me sayin'

[Verse 3]
Business got good, but we got bad
Money got happy, but we got sad
But in the midst we had a daughter
Evern though we floatin' clear like ocean water
Came home two bags of Fendi
It was gone that started to offend me
Child support hit, that really offend me
Puffy was right it's all about the benjie's
Bitter now cuz the loves still in me
In my boxers on couch, sippin' Remy
Thinkin' that she need to be killed like Kennedy
Then I listen to I got the remedy
After all I still give you what you need, cuz we got a daughter to feed
Though you supposed to be here at least you sold me that
Why the fuck did I listen when you told me that stupid

I've been waiting all day here for ya babe
So won't you come and sit and talk to me
And tell me how we're gonna be together, always?
Hope you know that when it's late at night
I hold on to my pillow tight
And think of how you promised me forever

Could make me feel this way, oh
(Now that you're here, boy, all I want)
Is just a chance to say

It's too late (now!) and I can't wait for you to be gone

But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)

Tell me why you're looking so confused
When I'm the one who didn't know the truth
How could you ever be so cold?
To go behind my back and call my friend
Boy, you must have gone and bumped your head
Because you left her number on your phone

I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct

I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays
Talkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time
Asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news
Man what ya do
And he says

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Verse 2]
He said I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all the sudden goin' fishing
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again
And then

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Bridge]
Like tomorrow was a gift and you've got eternity
To think about what you do with it
What could you do with it, what can
I do with with it, what would I do with it

[Chorus 2]
Sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying

""Jack and Diane"" painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

[Chorus]
I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Driving my first love out to the levee
Living life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

[Verse 2]
I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rocking Me Baby""
Frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

[Chorus]
And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

[Chorus]
So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir
Singing bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song
I go back

[Verse 3]
I go back
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back (I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back (I go back)

Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all

I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 1]
Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creeping with, creeping with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keeping it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way

I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all

But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 2]
Sitting here, stuck on stupid, trying to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinking, contemplating
Be a man and get it over with, over with
I'm riding in my whip, racing to her place
Talking to myself, preparing to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me
I said ""one second, baby, please hear me""

This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do

That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions",Usher,Usher,2004,"[48, 44, 30, 26, 23, 17, 11, 8, 7, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 5, 8, 9, 11, 14, 17, 28, 48]",25
147,U Should've Known Better,"[Verse 1]
I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didn't need the shopping spree in LA or Melrose
Boy, if you didn't know it, well, now you know
I didn't need the furs or the jewelry
Because material things, it don't mean much to me
And ever since you've been gone
I've been holding us down, on my own and no, ...

[Pre-Chorus]
I never ever cheated, I never ever lied
So you can stop askin', askin' me why
Why I never left you
And why I kept it real
And why I'm still with you

[Chorus]
You should've known better
Than to think I would leave
You should've known better
Than to doubt me (me)
It don't matter if you're up
Matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around
You should've known that
I would stay by your side
Should've known your girl
Was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter
If you're rich or poor, out or in doin' 5 to 10
You should've known better

[Verse 2]
What makes you think
That I would forget about ya?
Think about it, who comes to see ya?
Every Saturday and Monday I was on that receiver
It's me (me) your girl (girl), your life (life), your world (world)
My family and friends, they just don't understand
They say, I should leave you alone
But I say, that they all should just leave us alone
Don't you get it?

[Pre-Chorus]
I never ever cheated, I never ever lied
So you can stop askin', askin' me why
Why I never left you
And why I kept it real
And why I'm still with you

[Chorus]
You should've known better
Than to think I would leave
You should've known better
(Don't you doubt me) Than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up
Matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around
You should've known that
I would stay by your side
Should've known your girl
Was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter (don't matter to me, babe)
If you're rich or poor, out or in doin' 5 to 10
You should've known better

[Instrumental breakdown]

[Chorus]
You should've known better
Than to think I would leave
You should've known better
Than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up
Matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around
You should've known that
I would stay by your side

But things aren't always what they seem

This may come as a shock to you

Girls lie, too

We learn from you
Girls lie, too

We can't wait to hear about your round of golf
We love to see deer heads hanging on the wall
And we like Hooters for their hotwings too
Other guys never cross our minds
We don't wonder what it might be like
How could it be any better than it is with you

Yeah, girls lie, too
We always forgive and forget
The cards and flowers you never sent
Will never be brought up again

Old gray sweatpants turn us on
We like your friends and we love your mom

But now that you're here, I just feel like I'm constantly dreaming
'Cause something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good

[Verse 1]
For 48 hours, I don't think that we left my hotel room
Should show you the sights 'cause I'm sure that I said that I would
We gotta make love just one last time in the shower
Well, something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good

[Chorus]
And it's like, every time I turn around
I fall in love and find my heart face down and
Where it lands is where it should

It's better kept inside than left for good

151,Whiskey Lullaby,"[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
She put him out
Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night...

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss ]
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her 'til I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa

[Verse 2: Alison Krauss]
The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night...

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

Fumbling his confidence
And wondering why the world has passed him by
Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments
And failed attempts to fly, fly

Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside
We were meant to live for so much more

And whether mice or men have second tries
Maybe we've been livin with our eyes half open
Maybe we're bent and broken, broken

THIRD DRAFT PARAMOUNT PICTURES
1 Gulf and Western Plaza
March 29, 1971 New York, New York 10019

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black
Background. There is a moment's hesitation, and then the
Simple words in white lettering:

THE GODFATHER

While this remains, we hear: ""I believe in America.""
Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a
Man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great
Emotion.

BONASERA
America has made my fortune.

As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.

BONASERA
I raised my daughter in the American
Fashion; I gave her freedom, but
Taught her never to dishonor her
Family. She found a boy friend,
Not an Italian. She went to the
Movies with him, stayed out late.
Two months ago he took her for a
Drive, with another boy friend.
They made her drink whiskey and
Then they tried to take advantage
Of her. She resisted; she kept her
Honor. So they beat her like an
Animal. When I went to the hospital
Her nose was broken, her jaw was
Shattered and held together by
Wire, and she could not even weep
Because of the pain.

He can barely speak; he is weeping now.

BONASERA
I went to the Police like a good
American. These two boys were
Arrested and brought to trial. The
Judge sentenced them to three years
In prison, and suspended the
Sentence. Suspended sentence!
They went free that very day. I
Stood in the courtroom like a fool,
And those bastards, they smiled at
Me. Then I said to my wife, for
Justice, we must go to The Godfather.

By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office
In his home.

The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with
Patterned shadows. We are watching BONASERA over the
Shoulder of DON CORLEONE. TOM HAGEN sits near a small
Table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands
Impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a
Glass of wine. We can HEAR music, and the laughter and
Voices of many people outside.

DON CORLEONE
Bonasera, we know each other for
Years, but this is the first time
You come to me for help. I don't
Remember the last time you invited
Me to your house for coffee...even
Though our wives are friends.

BONASERA
What do you want of me? I'll give
You anything you want, but do what
I ask!

DON CORLEONE
And what is that Bonasera?

BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.

DON CORLEONE
No. You ask for too much.

BONASERA
I ask for Justice.

DON CORLEONE
The Court gave you justice.

BONASERA
An eye for an eye!

DON CORLEONE
But your daughter is still alive.

BONASERA
Then make them suffer as she
Suffers. How much shall I pay you.

Both HAGEN and SONNY react.

DON CORLEONE
You never think to protect yourself
With real friends. You think it's
Enough to be an American. All
Right, the Police protects you,
There are Courts of Law, so you
Don't need a friend like me.
But now you come to me and say Don
Corleone, you must give me justice.
And you don't ask in respect or
Friendship. And you don't think to
Call me Godfather; instead you come
To my house on the day my daughter
Is to be married and you ask me to
Do murder...for money.

BONASERA
America has been good to me...

DON CORLEONE
Then take the justice from the
Judge, the bitter with the sweet,
Bonasera. But if you come to me
With your friendship, your loyalty,
Then your enemies become my enemies,
And then, believe me, they would
Fear you...

Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.

BONASERA
Be my friend.

DON CORLEONE
Good. From me you'll get Justice.

BONASERA
Godfather.

DON CORLEONE
Some day, and that day may never
Come, I would like to call upon you
To do me a service in return.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight. There
Are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard
And gardens. There is music and laughing and dancing and
Countless tables covered with food and wine.

DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a
Son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of
The wedding party. He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the
Hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the
Children, and makes them all welcome. They in turn carry
With them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked
Bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.

The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,
MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN
And his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the
Bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI. As they move into
The pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.

DON CORLEONE
Where's Michael?

SONNY
He'll be here Pop, it's still early.

DON CORLEONE
Then the picture will wait for him.

Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves
Back to the house. SONNY gives a delicious smile in the
Direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI. She returns
It. Then he moves to his wife.

SONNY
Sandra, watch the kids. They're
Running wild.

SANDRA
You watch yourself.

HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine
Barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait. TOM
Crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is
Next, straightens, and follows HAGEN.

EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)

Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,
Working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out
Of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers
Down in their notebooks. We HEAR the music and laughter
Coming from the party in the distance.

A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.

BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the
Watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to
Embrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.

The MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another
Number in the notebook. A shiney new Cadillac with wooden
Bumpers.

PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping
Bellies with the ladies.

CLEMENZA
Paulie...wine...WINE.

He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.
PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings
It to him.

PAULIE
You look terrif on the floor!

CLEMENZA
What are you, a dance judge? Go do
Your job; take a walk around the
Neighborhood... see everything is
Okay.

PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps
Back into the dance.

The MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another
Number in the notebook.

TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-
OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his
Enormous brown shoes.

The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out
Of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by
CLEMENZA and PAULIE.

SONNY
Buddy, this is a private party.

The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the
Sedan. SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.
The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,
Without saying a word. SONNY steps back, spits on the
Ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,
And another TWO MEN. He doesn't say a thing for most of the
Walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.

SONNY
Goddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the
Dark study.

NAZORINE
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured
By the American Army, and sent to
New Jersey as a prisoner of war...

DON CORLEONE
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I
Can do.

NAZORINE
Now that the war is over, Enzo,
This boy is being repatriated to
Italy. And you see, Godfather...
(he wrings his hands,
Unable to express himself)
He...my daughter...they...

DON CORLEONE
You want him to stay in this country.

NAZORINE
Godfather, you understand everything.

DON CORLEONE
Tom, what we need is an Act of
Congress to allow Enzo to become a
Citizen.

NAZORINE
(impressed)
An Act of Congress!

HAGEN
(nodding)
It will cost.

The DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE
Nods.

NAZORINE
Is that all? Godfather, thank
You...
(backing out, enthusiastically)
Oh, wait till you see the cake I
Made for your beautiful daughter!

NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.
DON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.

HAGEN
Who do I give this job to?

The DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.

DON CORLEONE
Not to one of our paisans...give it
To a Jew Congressman in another
District. Who else is on the list
For today?

The DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting
To see him.

HAGEN
Francesco Nippi. His nephew has
Been refused parole. A bad case.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

WHAT HE SEES:

NIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.

HAGEN (O.S.)
His father worked with you in the
Freight yards when you were young.

LUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.

HAGEN (O.S.)
He's not on the list, but Luca
Brasi wants to see you.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

The DON turns to HAGEN.

DON CORLEONE
Is it necessary?

HAGEN
You understand him better than
Anyone.

The DON nods to this. Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

WHAT HE SEES:

MICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain,
Leads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally
Stopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

The DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds,
Following them.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

MICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces
Her to his GIRL.

EXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945)

The DON's eyes peering through the blinds.

EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

KAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding,
Burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine. She
Is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and
The vitality.

KAY
I've never seen anything like it.

MICHAEL
I told you I had a lot of relatives.

KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.
We see what she sees:

Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine
Barrels.

KAY
(amused)
Michael, what are those men doing?

MICHAEL
They're waiting to see my father.

KAY
They're talking to themselves.

MICHAEL
They're going to talk to my father,
Which means they're going to ask
Him for something, which means they
Better get it right.

KAY
Why do they bother him on a day
Like this?

MICHAEL
Because they know that no Sicilian
Will refuse a request on his
Daughter's wedding day.

EXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945)

CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her
Overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI. He
Is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.
She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from
Him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white
Envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she
Holds. In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one
Of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,
Where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.
CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the
Bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the
Things hold.

Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.

CARLO
(whispered)
Cut it out, Connie.

The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,
Is fat with money.

PAULIE (O.S.)
What do you think? Twenty grand?

A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a
Prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking
Eyes from the purse.

PAULIE
Who knows? Maybe more. Twenty,
Thirty grand in small bills cash in
That silk purse. Holy Toledo, if
This was somebody else's wedding!

SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY
MANCINI, the Maid of Honor. Every once in a while he
Glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with
Some WOMEN.

He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.

SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.

WOMAN
Is it true what they say about your
Husband, Sandra?

SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and
Further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.
Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.
SONNY and LUCY are gone.

INT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945)

The empty hallway. The bathroom door opens and LUCY
Surreptitiously steps out.

She looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing,
Motioning for her to come up.

She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.

EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

KAY and MICHAEL.

KAY
(in a spooky low tone)
Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a
Relative?

She has picked out LUCA BRASI.

MICHAEL
No. His name is Luca Brasi. You
Wouldn't like him.

KAY
(Excited)
Who is he?

MICHAEL
(Sizing her up)
You really want to know?

KAY
Yes. Tell me.

MICHAEL
You like spaghetti?

KAY
You know I love spaghetti.

MICHAEL
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll
Tell you a Luca Brasi story.

She starts to eat her spaghetti.

She begins eating, looking at him eagerly.

MICHAEL
Once upon a time, about fifteen
Years ago some people wanted to
Take over my father's olive oil
Business. They had Al Capone send
Some men in from Chicago to kill my
Father, and they almost did.

KAY
Al Capone!

MICHAEL
My Father sent Luca Brasi after
Them. He tied the two Capone men
Hand and foot, and stuffed small
Bath towels into their mouths.
Then he took an ax, and chopped one
Man's feet off...

KAY
Michael...

MICHAEL
Then the legs at the knees...

KAY
Michael you're trying to scare me...

MICHAEL
Then the thighs where they joined
The torso.

KAY
Michael, I don't want to hear
Anymore...

MICHAEL
Then Luca turned to the other man...

KAY
Michael, I love you.

MICHAEL
...who out of sheer terror had
Swallowed the bath towel in his
Mouth and suffocated.

The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a
Tall story.

KAY
I never know when you're telling me
The truth.

MICHAEL
I told you you wouldn't like him.

KAY
He's coming over here!

LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near
Their table.

MICHAEL
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay
Adams.

KAY
(having survived LUCA)
How do you do.

MICHAEL
My brother, Tom Hagen.

HAGEN
Hello Kay. Your father's inside,
Doing some business.
(privately)
He's been asking for you.

MICHAEL
Thanks Tom.

HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously
Following.

KAY
If he's your brother, why does he
Have a different name?

MICHAEL
My brother Sonny found him living
In the streets when he was a kid,
So my father took him in. He's a
Good lawyer.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE at the window. He has seen the intimacy of the
YOUNG COUPLE.

LUCA (O.S.)
Don Corleone...

THE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves
Forward to kiss his hand. He takes the envelope from his
Jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes
A formal speech.

LUCA
(with difficulty)
Don Corleone...I am honored, and
Grateful...that you invited me to
Your home...on the wedding day of
Your...daughter.
May their first child...be a
Masculine child. I pledge my never
Ending loyalty.
(he offers the envelope)
For your daughter's bridal purse.

DON CORLEONE
Thank you, Luca, my most valued
Friend.

THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so
Tightly we might imagine it to be painful.

LUCA
Let me leave you, Don Corleone. I
Know you are busy.

He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with
The same formality he entered with. DON CORLEONE breathes
More easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.

DON CORLEONE
I'm sure it's the most generous
Gift today.

HAGEN
The Senator called--apologized for
Not coming personally, but said
You'd understand. Also, some of
The Judges...they've all sent gifts.
And another call from Virgil
Sollozzo.

DON CORLEONE is not pleased.

HAGEN
The action is narcotics. Sollozzo
Has contacts in Turkey for the
Poppy, in Sicily for the plants to
Process down to morphine or up to
Heroin. Also he has access to this
Country. He's coming to us for
Financial help, and some sort of
Immunity from the law. For that we
Get a piece of the action, I
Couldn't find out how much.
Sollozzo is vouched for by the
Tattaglia family, and they may have
A piece of the action. They call
Sollozzo the Turk.
He's spent a lot of time in Turkey
And is suppose to have a Turkish
Wife and kids. He's suppose to be
Very quick with the knife, or was,
When he was younger. Only in
Matters of business and with some
Reasonable complaint. Also he has
An American wife and three children
And he is a good family man.

THE DON nods.

HAGEN
He's his own boss, and very
Competent.

DON CORLEONE
And with prison record.

HAGEN
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the
United States. He's known to the
Government as a top narcotics man.
That could be a plus for us; he
Could never get immunity to testify.

DON CORLEONE
When did he call?

HAGEN
This morning.

DON CORLEONE
On a day like this. Consiglero, do
You also have in your notes the the
Turk made his living from
Prostitution before the war, like
The Tattaglias do now. Write that
Down before you forget it. The
Turk will wait.

We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers
From outside. In Italian, with unmistakable style.

DON CORLEONE
What that? It sounds like Johnny.

He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the
Room with light.

DON CORLEONE
It is Johnny. He came all the way
From California to be at the wedding.

HAGEN
Should I bring him in.

DON CORLEONE
No. Let the people enjoy him. You
See? He is a good godson.

HAGEN
It's been two years. He's probably
In trouble again.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

JOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and
Excitement of the wedding GUESTS.

KAY
I didn't know your family knew
Johnny Fontane.

MICHAEL
Sure.

KAY
I used to come down to New York
Whenever he sang at the Capitol and
Scream my head off.

MICHAEL
He's my father's godson; he owes
Him his whole career.

JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.
They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.

DON CORLEONE
My Godson has come three thousand
Miles to do us honor and no one
Thinks to wet his throat.

At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who
Takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.

JOHNNY
I kept trying to call you after my
Divorce and Tom always said you
Were busy. When I got the Wedding
Invitation I knew you weren't sore
At me anymore, Godfather.

DON CORLEONE
Can I do something for you still?
You're not too rich, or too famous
That I can't help you?

JOHNNY
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather,
And...my career, I'm almost washed
Up...

He's very disturbed. The GODFATHER indicates that he come
With him to the office so no one will notice. He turns to
HAGEN.

DON CORLEONE
Tell Santino to come in with us.
He should hear some things.

They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

HAGEN glances up the staircase.

HAGEN
Sonny?

Then he goes up.

INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

SONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her
Gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing
Against the door. Her face peeks out from the layers of
Petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.

LUCY
Sonnyeeeeeeee.

Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his
Body. But there is a knocking as well. They stop, freeze
In that position.

HAGEN (O.S.)
Sonny? Sonny, you in there?

INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)

Outside, HAGEN by the door.

HAGEN
The old man wants you; Johnny's
Here...he's got a problem.

SONNY (O.S.)
Okay. One minute.

HAGEN hesitates. We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the
Door again. TOM leaves.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE
ACT LIKE A MAN! By Christ in
Heaven, is it possible you turned
Out no better than a Hollywood
Finocchio.

Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing. The DON
Smiles. SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still
Adjusting his clothes.

DON CORLEONE
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me
About this Hollywood Pezzonovanta
Who won't let you work.

JOHNNY
He owns the studio. Just a month
Ago he bought the movie rights to
This book, a best seller. And the
Main character is a guy just like
Me. I wouldn't even have to act,
Just be myself.

The DON is silent, stern.

DON CORLEONE
You take care of your family?

JOHNNY
Sure.

He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as
He can.

DON CORLEONE
You look terrible. I want you to
Eat well, to rest. And spend time
With your family. And then, at the
End of the month, this big shot
Will give you the part you want.

JOHNNY
It's too late. All the contracts
Have been signed, they're almost
Ready to shoot.

DON CORLEONE
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough
To hurt.

DON CORLEONE
Now go back to the party and leave
It to me.

He closes the door, smiling to himself. Turns to HAGEN.

DON CORLEONE
When does my daughter leave with
Her bridegroom?

HAGEN
They'll cut the cake in a few
Minutes...leave right after that.
Your new son-in-law, do we give him
Something important?

DON CORLEONE
No, give him a living. But never
Let him know the family's business.
What else, Tom?

HAGEN
I've called the hospital; they've
Notified Consiglere Genco's family
To come and wait. He won't last
Out the night.

This saddens the DON. He sighs.

DON CORLEONE
Genco will wait for me. Santino,
Tell your brothers they will come
With me to the hospital to see
Genco. Tell Fredo to drive the big
Car, and ask Johnny to come with us.

SONNY
And Michael?

DON CORLEONE
All my sons.
(to HAGEN)
Tom, I want you to go to California
Tonight. Make the arrangements.
But don't leave until I come back
From the hospital and speak to you.
Understood?

HAGEN
Understood.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over
The entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels
In a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most
Extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument
Of his gratitude. The CROWD is favorably impressed: they
Begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,
In the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and
Kiss the Groom. Louder and louder, five hundred forks
Hitting five hundred glasses.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

Silence.

HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day. The GUESTS are gone. A
Single black car is in the courtyard. FREDDIE is behind the
Driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who
Sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.

DON CORLEONE
Will your girl friend get back to
The city all right?

MICHAEL
Tom said he'd take care of it.

The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through
The gate of the great Corleone Mall.

INT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)

A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can
See a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but
All plump and dressed in black.

DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end. But then the
DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder. MICHAEL
Stops and turns toward his FATHER. The two looks at one
Another for some time. SILENCE. DON CORLEONE then lifts
His hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's
Uniform.

DON CORLEONE
What was this for?

MICHAEL
For bravery.

DON CORLEONE
And this?

MICHAEL
For killing a man.

DON CORLEONE
What miracles you do for strangers.

MICHAEL
I fought for my country. It was my
Choice.

DON CORLEONE
And now, what do you choose to do?

MICHAEL
I'm going to finish school.

DON CORLEONE
Good. When you are finished, come
And talk to me. I have hopes for
You.

Again they regard each other without a word. MICHAEL turns,
And continues on. DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then
Follows.

INT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR
VIEW. He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.

DON CORLEONE
(whispered)
Genco, I've brought my sons to pay
Their respects. And look, even
Johnny Fontane, all the way from
Hollywood.

GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man. DON CORLEONE
Takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around
His bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.

GENCO
Godfather, Godfather, it's your
Daughter's wedding day, you cannot
Refuse me. Cure me, you have the
Power.

DON CORLEONE
I have no such power...but Genco,
Don't fear death.

GENCO
(with a sly wink)
It's been arranged, then?

DON CORLEONE
You blaspheme. Resign yourself.

GENCO
You need your old Consigliere. Who
Will replace me?
(suddenly)
Stay with me Godfather. Help me
Meet death. If he sees you, he
Will be frightened and leave me in
Peace. You can say a word, pull a
Few strings, eh? We'll outwit that
Bastard as we outwitted all those
Others.
(clutching his hand)
Godfather, don't betray me.

The DON motions all the others to leave the room. They do.
He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and
Whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.

INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

FADE IN:

The interior of a non-stop Constellation. HAGEN is one of
The very few passengers on this late flight. He looks like
Any young lawyer on a business trip. He is tired from the
Difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed
During the wedding. On the seat next to him is an enormous,
Bulging briefcase. He closes his eyes.

INT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)

The honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE. CARLO is in his
Undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the
Envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the
Contents. CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble
Bathroom. She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and
Tries to get his interest.

INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE in his office. LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.

DON CORLEONE
Luca, I am worried about this man
Sollozzo. Find out what you can,
Through the Tattaglias. Let them
Believe you could be tempted away
From the Corleone Family, if the
Right offer was made. Learn what
He has under his fingernails...

INT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)

The hallway of an apartment building. SONNY enters, climbs
Two steps at a time. He knocks, and then whispers.

SONNY
It's me, Sonny.

The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling
Him into the apartment.

INT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)

LUCA BRASI's tiny room. He is partly dressed. He kneels
And reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked
Trunk. He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof
Vest. He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then
Puts on his shirt and jacket. He takes his gun, quickly
Disassembles, checks, and reassembles it. And leaves.

INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

A CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.

INT NIGHT: MOVING TRAIN (SUMMER 1945)

MICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New
Hampshire.

INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

LUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty
Subway train.

INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

HAGEN on the Constellation. He reaches into his briefcase,
And takes out several pictures and papers.

One photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm
In arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a
Lovely young child star to his immediate right.

HAGEN considers other papers.

INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.
He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.

DON CORLEONE
Remember my new Consigliere, a
Lawyer with his briefcase can steal
More than a hundred men with guns.

EXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)

JACK WOLTZ ESTATE. HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,
Armed only with his briefcase. A GATEMAN opens the gate,
And TOM enters.

EXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)

HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal
Gardens, martinis in hand.

WOLTZ
You should have told me your boss
Was Corleone, Tom, I had to check
You out. I thought you were just
Some third rate hustler Johnny was
Running in to bluff me.
(a piece of statuary)
Florence, thirteenth century.
Decorated the garden of a king.

They cross the garden and head toward the stables.

WOLTZ
I'm going to show you something
Beautiful.

They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a
Huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: ""KHARTOUM.""
TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they
Rise as WOLTZ approaches.

WOLTZ
You like horses? I like horses, I
Love 'em. Beautiful, expensive
Racehorses.

The animal inside is truly beautiful. WOLTZ whispers to him
With true love in his voice.

WOLTZ
Khartoum...Kartoum...You are
Looking at six hundred thousand
Dollars on four hoofs. I bet even
Russian Czars never paid that kind
Of dough for a single horse. But
I'm not going to race him I'm going
To put him out to Stud.

INT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,
Attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS. Great paintings hang on the
Walls. The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.

HAGEN
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.
That is very close, a very sacred
Religious relationship.

WOLTZ
Okay, but just tell him this is one
Favor I can't give. But he should
Try me again on anything else.

HAGEN
He never asks a second favor when
He has been refused the first.
Understood?

WOLTZ
You smooth son of a bitch, let me
Lay it on the line for you, and
Your boss. Johnny Fontane never
Gets that movie. I don't care how
Many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball
Goombahs come out of the woodwork!

HAGEN
I'm German-Irish.

WOLTZ
Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny
Will never get that part because I
Hate that pinko punk and I'm going
To run him out of the Movies. And
I'll tell you why. He ruined one
Of Woltz Brothers' most valuable
Proteges. For five years I had
This girl under training; singing
Lessons! Acting lessons! Dancing
Lessons! We spent hundreds of
Thousands of dollars--I was going
To make her a star. I'll be even
More frank, just to show you that
I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it
Wasn't all dollars and cents. That
Girl was beautiful and young and
Innocent and she was the greatest
Piece of ass I've ever ad and I've
Had them all over the world. Then
Johnny comes along with that olive
Oil voice and guinea charm and she
Runs off. She threw it all away to
Make me look ridiculous. A MAN IN
MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE
MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!

EXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)

An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott
Street with a large old sign: ""GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,
INC."" next to an open-faced fruit market.

A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we
Cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters
The building. This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.

INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps
Before he actually rises into view. He is a small man, very
Dark, with curly black hair. But wiry, and tight and hard,
And obviously very dangerous. He is greeted at the head of
The stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,
Introducing himself. For a moment, there is a complex of
Handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful
Introductions. Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's
Glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.
They are very respectful of one another. Folding chairs are
Brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around
In a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,
CLEMENZA and TESSIO. The DON is the slightest bit foolish
With all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no
One. Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear
That this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.

SOLLOZZO
My business is heroin, I have poppy
Fields, laboratories in Narseilles
And Sicily, ready to go into
Production. My importing methods
Are as safe as these things can be,
About five per cent loss. The risk
Is nothing, the profits enormous.

DON CORLEONE
Why do you come to me? Why do I
Deserve your generosity?

SOLLOZZO
I need two million dollars in
Cash...more important, I need a
Friend who has people in high
Places; a friend who can guarantee
That if one of my employees be
Arrested, they would get only light
Sentences. Be my friend.

DON CORLEONE
What percentages for my family?

SOLLOZZO
Thirty per cent. In the first year
Your share would be four million
Dollars; then it would go up.

DON CORLEONE
And what is the percentage of the
Tattaglia family?

SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.

SOLLOZZO
My compliments. I'll take care of
Them from my share.

DON CORLEONE
So. I receive 30 per cent just for
Finance and legal protection. No
Worries about operations, is that
What you tell me?

SOLLOZZO
If you think two million dollars in
Cash is just finance, I congratulate
You Don Corleone.

There is a long silence; in which each person present feels
The tension. The DON is about to give his answer.

DON CORLEONE
I said I would see you because I've
Heard you're a serious man, to be
Treated with respect...
(pause)
But I'll say no to you.

We feel this around the room.

DON CORLEONE
I'll give you my reasons. I have
Many, many friends in Politics.
But they wouldn't be so friendly if
My business was narcotics instead
Of gambling. They think gambling
Is something like liquor, a harmless
Vice...and they think narcotics is
Dirty business.

SOLLOZZO takes a breath.

DON CORLEONE
No...how a man makes his living is
None of my business. But this
Proposition of yours is too risky.
All the people in my family lived
Well the last ten years, I won't
Risk that out of greed.

SOLLOZZO
Are you worried about security for
Your million?

DON CORLEONE
No.

SOLLOZZO
The Tattaglias will guarantee your
Investment also.

This startles SONNY; he blurts out.

SONNY
The Tattaglia family guarantees our
Investment?

SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face
Him. Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out
Of line.

DON CORLEONE
Young people are greedy, and they
Have no manners. They speak when
They should listen. But I have a
Sentimental weakness for my
Children, and I've spoiled them, as
You see. But Signor Sollozzo, my
No is final.

SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal. He
Glances one last time at SONNY. He rises; all the others do
As well. He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally
Takes his leave. When the footsteps can no longer be heard:

The DON turns to SONNY.

DON CORLEONE
Santino, never let anyone outside
The family know what you are
Thinking. I think your brain is
Going soft from all that comedy you
Play with that young girl.

TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display
With the word ""THANK YOU"" spelled out in flowers.

DON CORLEONE
What is this nonsense?

HAGEN
It's from Johnny. It was announced
This morning. He's going to play
The lead in the new Woltz Brothers
Film.

INT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)

It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,
Presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping. Soft light bathes the room
From the large windows. We move closer to him until we see
His face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ. He turns uncomfortably;
Mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets. Something
Wet.

He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.
He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood. He is
Frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on
His sheets and pajamas. He grunts, pulls the puddle of
Blood in his bed. He feels his own body frantically,
Moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face
With the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of
His bed. Just blood from the hacked neck. White reedy
Tendons show. He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle
Of blood to see more clearly. Froth covers the muzzle, and
The enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered
With blood.

WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot. No sound comes out.
Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure
Terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and
Knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.

INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

CLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER. Nodding.

DON CORLEONE
Send Johnny my congratulations.

----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED)

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945)

Fifth Avenue in the snow. Christmas week. People are
Bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents.

KAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store,
Carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.

KAY
We have something for your mother,
For Sonny, we have the tie for
Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the
Reynolds pen...

MICHAEL
And what do you want for Christmas?

KAY
Just you.

They kiss.

INT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

CLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music. THE VIEW PANS
AROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight.

MICHAEL (O.S.)
We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony
At the City Hall, no big fuss, no
Family, just a couple of friends as
Witnesses.

The two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on
The two single beds that they have pushed together.

KAY
What will your father say?

MICHAEL
As long as I tell him beforehand he
Won't object. He'll be hurt, but
He won't object.

KAY
What time do they expect us?

MICHAEL
For dinner. Unless I call and tell
Them we're still in New Hampshire.

KAY
Michael.

MICHAEL
Then we can have dinner, see a
Show, and spend one more night.

He moves to the telephone.

MICHAEL (CONT'D.)
Operator. Get me
(fill in number)

KAY
Michael, what are you doing?

MICHAEL
Shhh, you be the long distance
Operator. Here.

KAY
Hello...this is Long Distance. I
Have a call from New Hampshire. Mr.
Michael Corleone. One moment please.

She hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.

MICHAEL
Hello, Tom? Michael. Yeah...
Listen, we haven't left yet. I'm
Driving down to the city with Kay
Tomorrow morning. There's something
Important I want to tell the old
Man before Christmas. Will he be
Home tomorrow night?

INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

HAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office. In the background,
Through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in
His office. TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.

HAGEN (O.S.)
Sure. Anything I can do for you.

MICHAEL (O.S.)
No. I guess I'll see you Christmas.
Everyone's going to be out at Long
Beach, right?

HAGEN
Right.

He smiles. MICHAEL has hung up. He looks at the piles of
Work, and can't face it. He rises, puts on his coat and
Hat, and continues out.

He peeks into the DON's office.

HAGEN
Michael called; he's not leaving
New Hampshire until tomorrow
Morning. I've got to go, I promised
Theresa I'd pick up some toys for
The kids.

The DON smiles and nods.

TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.
FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the
Afternoon paper. He puts aside the papers the office
Manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE,
Raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the
Paper.

DON CORLEONE
Tell Paulie to get the car from the
Lot; I'll be ready to go home in a
Few minutes.

FREDO
I'll have to get it myself; Paulie
Called in sick this morning.

DON CORLEONE
That's the third time this month.
I think maybe you'd better get a
Healthier bodyguard for me. Tell
Tom.

FREDO
(going)
Paulie's a good kid. If he's sick,
He's sick. I don't mind getting
The car.

FREDDIE leaves. He slowly puts on his jacket. Looks out
His window.

EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

FREDDIE crosses the street.

INT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

OFFICE MANAGER
Buon Watale, Don Corleone.

The MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat. Once again, the
DON glances out his window.

The black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.

DON CORLEONE
Merry Christmas.
(handing the MANAGER
An envelope)

And he starts down the stairs.

EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail. When
FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the
Driver's seat. The DON moves to the car, and is about to
Get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open
Fruit stand near the corner.

The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him. The DON walks among
The trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular
Piece of fruit. As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the
Pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag. The DON
Pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then
Turns back to the car.

EXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945)

TOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift
Wrapped. He continues past the windows. As he walks,
Someone walks right in his way. He looks up. It is SOLLOZZO.

He takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him.

SOLLOZZO
(quietly)
Don't be frightened. I just want
To talk to you.

A car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.

SOLLOZZO
(urgently)
Get in; I want to talk to you.

HAGEN pulls his arm free. He is frightened.

HAGEN
I haven't got time.

TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.

SOLLOZZO
Get in the car. If I wanted to
Kill you you'd be dead already.
Trust me.

HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving
Our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story
Of Hansel and Gretel. We HEAR the car doors shut, and the
Car drive off.

EXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945)

RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show. KAY and
MICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and
She sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex. KAY
Nostalgically hums ""The Bells of Saint Mary's,"" as they walk
Arm in arm.

KAY
Would you like me better if I were
A nun?

MICHAEL
No.

KAY
Would you like me better if I were
Ingrid Bergman?

They have passed a little enclosed newsstand. KAY sees
Something that terrifies her. She doesn't know what to do.
MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.

KAY
(a little voice)
Michael?

MICHAEL
I'm thinking about it.

KAY
Michael...

MICHAEL
No, I would not like you better if
You were Ingrid Bergman.

She cannot answer him. Rather she pulls him by the arm,
Back to the newsstand, and points. His face goes grave.

The headlines read: ""VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED
DOWN.""

MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a
Dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them. KAY
Knows to remain silent.

MICHAEL
(desperately)
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the
Car, when TWO MEN step from the corner. Suddenly, the DON
Drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness
Toward the parked car.

DON CORLEONE
Fredo, Fredo!

The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins
Rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.

Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain,
And continues toward the car.

The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking
Over an entire case of fruit.

The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.

Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit. There are
More GUNSHOTS.

FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car;
Having difficulty opening the door. He rushes out, a gun
Trembling in his hand; his mouth open. He actually drops
The gun.

The gun falls amid the rolling fruit.

The GUNMEN are panicked. They fire once more at the downed
DON CORLEONE. His leg and arm twitch where they are hit;
And pools of blood are beginning to form.

The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion;
They disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.

The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared:
Rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely
From around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from
Windows. But the street itself is now empty.

FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great
Puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and
Face down in them.

FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying
Something we cannot understand. He begins to weep profusely.

INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

LUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night. He
Gets off.

He emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.

EXT NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)

LUCA walks down the late night street. He approaches an
Elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still
Winking this late at night. He waits and watches. Then the
Sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.

INT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless
Glistening wooden floors. Now, at this late time, the
Chairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR
Is waxing them. A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her
Receipts. LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at
The bar. ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves
Behind the bar.

MAN
Luca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

LUCA
I know.

LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.

SOLLOZZO
Do you know who I am?

LUCA Nods.

SOLLOZZO
You've been talking to the
Tattaglias. They thought we could
Do business.

LUCA listens.

SOLLOZZO
I need somebody strong to protect
My operation, physically. I've
Heard you're not happy with your
Family, you might make a switch.

LUCA
If the money is good enough.

SOLLOZZO
On the first shipment, I can
Guarantee you fifty thousand dollars.

LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.

SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,
Rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.
BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter
Magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette. Then,
He does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and
Puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.

INT NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

The telephone in SONNY's house is ringing. He approaches
It, obviously fresh from a nap.

SONNY
Yeah.

VOICE (O.S.)
Do you recognize my voice?

SONNY
I think so. Detective squad?

VOICE (O.S.)
Right. Don't say my name, just
Listen. Somebody shot your father
Outside his place fifteen minutes
Ago.

SONNY
Is he alive?

VOICE (O.S.)
I think so, but I can't get close
Enough. There's a lot of blood.
I'll try to find out more.

SONNY
Find out anything you can...you got
A Grand coming.
(click)

SONNY cradles the phone. An incredible rage builds up in
Him, his face actually turning red. He would like to rip
The phone to pieces in his bare hands. Then he controls it.
Quickly, he dials another number.

SONNY
Theresa, let me talk to Tom. Not
Yet? Have him call me as soon as
He gets home.

He hangs up.

SANDRA (O.S.)
Sonny? Sonny, who is it?
(she enters the room)
What is it?

SONNY
(calmly)
They shot the old man.

SANDRA
Oh God...

SONNY
Honey...don't worry. Nothing else
Is going to happen.

There is a POUNDING on the door. A BABY starts crying.

SANDRA
(really frightened)
SONNY?

SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and
Moves quickly. He opens the front door quickly. It is
CLEMENZA. He enters, SONNY closes the door. SANDRA goes to
Look after the baby.

CLEMENZA
(excited)
You heard about your father?

SONNY
Yeah.

CLEMENZA
The word is out in the streets that
He's dead.

SONNY
Where the hell was Paulie, why
Wasn't he with the Don?

CLEMENZA
Paulie's been a little sick all
Winter...he was home.

SONNY
How many times did he stay home the
Last couple of months?

CLEMENZA
Maybe three, four times. I always
Asked Freddie if he wanted another
Bodyguard, but he said no. Things
Have been so smooth the last ten
Years...

SONNY
Go get Paulie, I don't care how
Sick he is. Pick him up yourself,
And bring him to my father's house.

CLEMENZA
That's all? Don't you want me to
Send some people over here?

SONNY
No, just you and Paulie.

CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the
Couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.

SONNY
A couple of our people will come to
Stay here. Do whatever they say;
I'm going over to the main house.
If you want me, use Pop's special
Phone.

The telephone rings again. SONNY answers it.

SONNY
Hello.

SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
Santino Corleone?

SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is. SONNY
Indicates that she be quiet.

SONNY
Yeah.

SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
We have Tom Hagen. In about three
Hours he'll be released with our
Proposition. Don't do anything
Until you've heard what he has to
Say. You can only cause a lot of
Trouble. What's done is done.
(a pause)
Don't lose that famous temper of
Yours.

SONNY
(quietly)
I'll wait.

EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL. It is night, but the
Courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the
Tops of all the houses. It is very cold. We see the figure
Of SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.

INT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house. Then he calls
Out.

SONNY
Ma? Ma, where are you.

The kitchen door swings open. He moves quickly and takes
Her by the arm. He is deliberately calm.

SONNY
Ma, I just got a call. Pop's
Hurt...I don't know how bad.

MAMA
(quietly)
Santino? Have they killed him?

SONNY
(almost in tears)
We don't know yet, Ma.

MAMA
I'll get dressed. In case we can
See him...

She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs. SONNY
Turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying. He
Takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil,
And sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his
Father's office.

INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

He switches the lights on in the DON's office. The massive
Desk dominates the room. SONNY moves quickly to the
Telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk,
And dials a number.

SONNY
Tessio...This is Santino Corleone.
I want fifty reliable men out here.

TESSIO (O.S.)
I heard, Sonny...but what about
Clemenza's regime?

SONNY
I don't want to use Clemenza's
People right now. Understood?

He hangs up. He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the
Dial, and removes a small notebook. He takes it back to the
Desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.
We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA
BRASI. SONNY dials the number. There is no answer.

SONNY
Luca.

INT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)

The interior of an abandoned building. SEVERAL MEN in suits
And ties sit around in the booths.

HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.

SOLLOZZO
I know you're not in the muscle end
Of the family--so I don't want you
To be afraid. I want you to help
The Corleones and I want you to
Help me.

HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette
In his mouth. ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye
To the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered
China cup. HAGEN sips gratefully.

SOLLOZZO
Your boss is dead...

HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.
SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.

SOLLOZZO
(pushing the bottle)
Have some more. We got him outside
His office, just before I picked
You up. You have to make the peace
Between me and Santino.

HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.

SOLLOZZO
Sonny was hot for my deal, right?
You know it's the smart thing to
Do, too. I want you to talk Sonny
Into it.

HAGEN
(pulling himself together)
Sonny will come after you with
Everything he's got.

SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.

SOLLOZZO
That's going to be his first
Reaction. You have to talk some
Sense into him. The Tattaglia
Family stands behind me with all
Their people. The other New York
Families will go along with anything
That prevents a full scale war.

He leans close to HAGEN.

SOLLOZZO
The Don was slipping; in the old
Days I could never have gotten to
Him. Now he's dead, nothing can
Bring him back. Talk to Sonny,
Talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza
And Tessio...it's good business.

HAGEN
Even Sonny won't be able to call
Off Luca Brasi.

SOLLOZZO
I'll worry about Luca. You take
Care of Sonny and the other two kids.

HAGEN
I'll try...It's what the Don would
Want us to do.

SOLLOZZO
(lifting his hands in
An expression of harmlessness)
Good...then you can go...
(he escorts him to
The door)
I don't like violence. I'm a
Businessman, and blood is a big
Expense.

He opens the door; they step out together.

EXT NITE: BUILDING

HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.

But a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.
He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to
SOLLOZZO in private.

Then SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression. He opens the
Door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.

SOLLOZZO
The old man is still alive. Five
Bullets in his Sicilian hide and
He's still alive.
(he gives a fatalistic
Shrug)
Bad luck for me, bad luck for you.

EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL driving during the night. There is a little fog in
The air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making
It difficult to see well. The wipers move across the view,
As the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still
Decorated for Christmas. The courtyard is bathed with white
Floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look. The
Narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link
Chain. There are strange cars parked along the curving
Cement walk. SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and
Chain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.

MAN
Who're you?

ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and
Then turns.

MAN 2
It's the Don's kid; take the car,
I'll bring him inside.

The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.

INT NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)

The Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL
Doesn't recognize. They pay little attention to him. Most
Of them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.

INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas
Tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.

THERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a
Cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water
Glass half filled with whiskey. On the other side of the
Sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is
Sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black
With his saliva. PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the
Other side of the room. CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at
Him.

CLEMENZA
Your mother's at the hospital with
The old man: He's gonna pull through.

MICHAEL nods his relief.

MICHAEL
Thanks.

He moves to THERESA.

MICHAEL
(gently)
You heard from Tom yet?

Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and
Trembles. Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the
Room; everyone speaks in a whisper.

MICHAEL
(taking her hand)
C'mon.

He leads her into his father's office without knocking.

INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

SONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad. They look
Up, startled.

SONNY
Don't worry, Theresa; they just
Want to give Tom the proposition,
Then they're going to turn him loose.

He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise,
He kisses him on the cheek.

SONNY
I was worried when we couldn't get
In touch with you in that hick town.

MICHAEL
How's Mom?

SONNY
Good. She's been through it before.
Me too. You were too young to know
About it. You better wait outside;
There're some things you shouldn't
Hear.

MICHAEL
I can help you out...

SONNY
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be
Sore as hell if I let you get mixed
Up in this.

MICHAEL
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.

SONNY
Theresa.

She understands, and leaves them alone.

SONNY
All right, Mikey...who do we have
To hit, Clemenza or Paulie?

MICHAEL
What?

SONNY
One of them fingered the old man.

MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on
Trial for their lives.

MICHAEL
Clemenza? No, I don't believe it.

SONNY
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay.
It was Paulie.

MICHAEL
How can you be sure?

SONNY
On the three days Paulie was sick
This month, he got calls from a
Payphone across from the old man's
Building. We got people in the
Phone company.
(he shrugs)
Thank God it was Paulie...we'll
Need Clemenza bad.

MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the
Situation.

MICHAEL
Is it going to be all-out war, like
Last time?

SONNY
Until the old man tells me different.

MICHAEL
Then wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.

SONNY
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't
Care what it costs. I don't care
If we have to fight all the five
Families in New York. The Tattaglia
Family's going to eat dirt. I
Don't care if we all go down
Together.

MICHAEL
(softly)
That's not how Pop would have
Played it.

SONNY
I know I'm not the man he was. But
I'll tell you this and he'll tell
You too. When it comes to real
Action, I can operate as good as
Anybody short range.

MICHAEL
(calmly)
All right, Sonny. All right.

SONNY
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.

MICHAEL
Is it like they say? Is he that
Good?

Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief.
Then open the door and rush out.

Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped
In a tight embrace with his WIFE.

HAGEN
If I plead before the Supreme
Court, I'll never do better than I
Did tonight with that Turk.

EXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

The windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's
Study. It stands out against the cold, dark night.

INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

The living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on
The edge of the sofa. The clock reads: 4:00 a.m.

INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted,
In shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep. It is four in the
Morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many
Snacks. They can barely talk anymore.

HAGEN
Is the hospital covered?

SONNY
The cops have it locked in and I
Got my people there visiting Pop
All the time. What about the hit
List.

HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.

HAGEN
Too much, too far, too personal.
The Don would consider this all
Purely a business dispute: Get rid
Of Sollozzo, and everything falls
In line. YOU don't have to go
After the Tattaglias.

CLEMENZA nods.

HAGEN
What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't
Seem worried about Luca. That
Worries me.

SONNY
If Luca sold out we're in real
Trouble.

HAGEN
Has anyone been able to get in
Touch with him?

SONNY
No, and I've been calling all night.
Maybe he's shacked up.

HAGEN
Luca never sleeps over with a broad.
He always goes home when he's
Through. Mike, keep ringing Luca's
Number.

MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the
Number once again. He can hear the phone ringing on the
Other end but no one answers. Then hangs up.

HAGEN
Keep trying every fifteen minutes.
(exhausted)

SONNY
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what
Do we do if the old man dies?

HAGEN
Without your father's political
Contacts and personal influence,
The Corleone family loses half its
Strength. Without your father, the
Other New York families might wind
Up supporting Sollozzo, and the
Tattaglias just to make sure there
Isn't a long destructive war. The
Old days are over, this is 1946;
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore. If
Your father dies...make the deal,
Sonny.

SONNY
(angry)
That's easy to say; it's not your
Father.

HAGEN
(quietly)
I was as good a son to him as you
Or Mike.

SONNY
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it
That way.

HAGEN
We're all tired...

SONNY
OK, we sit tight until the old man
Can give us the lead. But Tom, I
Want you to stay inside the Mall.
You too, Mike, no chances. Tessio,
You hold your people in reserve,
But have them nosing around the
City. The hospital is yours; I
Want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours
A day.

There is a timid knock on the door.

SONNY
What is it?

PAULIE GATTO looks in.

CLEMENZA
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...

PAULIE
The guy at the gate's outside...says
There's a package...

SONNY
Tessio, see what it is.

TESSIO gets up, leaves.

PAULIE
You want me to hang around?

SONNY
Yeah. Hang around.

PAULIE
Outside?

CLEMENZA
Outside.

PAULIE
Sure.

He closes the door.

SONNY
Clemenza. You take care of Paulie.
I don't ever want to see him again.
Understood?

CLEMENZA
Understood.

SONNY
Okay, now you can move your men
Into the Mall, replace Tessio's
People. Mike, tomorrow you take a
Couple of Clemenza's people and go
To Luca's apartment and wait for
Him to show. That crazy bastard
Might be going after Sollozzo right
Now if he's heard the news.

HAGEN
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up
In this so directly. You know the
Old man doesn't want that.

SONNY
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.

MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected. He dials Luca
Brasi's number once again. The ring repeats, but no one
Answers.

TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest
In his hand. He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped
Inside.

CLEMENZA
A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi
Sleeps with the fishes.

INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

LUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we
Remember him. BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.
LUCA looks up at him.

Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.
LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both
Clamp down as hard as they can. Suddenly, a garrote is
Thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight. His
Face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally
Purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a
Far more extreme way than a normal tongue could. His eyes
Bulge.

ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's
Strength leaves him.

BRUNO
(making an ugly face)
Oh Christ...all over the floor.

SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his
Face.

LUCA falls to the floor.

SOLLOZZO
The Godfather is next.

----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb. There are rows of
Pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block. A
Dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a
Noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell. This
Is ROCCO LAMPONE. The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,
Talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the
Side of the house. ROCCO moves to the garage, which is
Specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work
Washing a shiny brand new Lincoln. LAMPONE admires the car.

LAMPONE
Nice.

CLEMENZA
Crazy Detroit delivered it with a
Wooden bumper. They're going to
Send me the chrome bumpers in a
Couple months. I waited two years
For this car to come with wooden
Bumpers!

He scrubs and polishes with great affection.

CLEMENZA
Today you make your bones on Paulie.
You understand everything?

LAMPONE
Sure.

As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it,
Unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.

CLEMENZA
.22 soft-nosed load. Accurate up
To five feet.

LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away. GATTO's car pulls into
The driveway, and he sounds the horn.

The two men walk to the car. GATTO is driving, a bit
Nervous, like he doesn't know what is up. LAMPONE gets in
The rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of
Recognition. He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting
To chide PAULIE for being late. PAULIE flinches a little
When he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:

PAULIE
Rocco, sit on the other side. A
Big guy like you blocks my rearview
Mirror.

CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.

CLEMENZA
Goddamn Sonny. He's running scared.
He's already thinking of going to
The mattresses. We have to find a
Place on the West Side. Paulie,
You know a good location?

PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook
He was on. Also there's the money he can make by selling
Sollozzo any secret location.

PAULIE
I'll think about it.

CLEMENZA
(grunting)
Drive while you thinking; I wanna
Get to the City this month!

The car pulls out.

EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)

Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump. OUR
VIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.

EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

The Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter
Light.

INT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

Inside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.
He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of
Him.

CLEMENZA
Pay attention!

EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

The car is parked in the City. PAULIE comes down from an
Available apartment and gets back into the car.

PAULIE
Good for ten men...

CLEMENZA
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm
Suppose to call when I found
Somethin'.

The car pulls off.

EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

New part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.
CLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.

CLEMENZA
You wait; I'll call.

He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the
Corner and enters the Luna Restaurant.

INT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

CLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.
The WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some
Bread--and then a plate of veal on his table. He eats.

EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

CLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants;
He is well fed.

We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to
Expect has happened to Paulie.

There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel,
LAMPONE in the rear seat. CLEMENZA steps in.

CLEMENZA
He talked my ear off. Want us to
Go back to Long Beach; have another
Job for us. Rocco, you live in the
City, can we drop you off?

LAMPONE (O.S.)
Ah, I left my car at your place.

CLEMENZA
OK, then you gotta come back.

The car pulls out. By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and
Secure.

PAULIE
You think we'll go for that last
Place?

CLEMENZA
Maybe, or you gotta know now.

PAULIE
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.

EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)

The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.
Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.

CLEMENZA
Paulie, pull over. I gotta take a
Leak.

The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds. CLEMENZA
Steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.

He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer
See the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting
The ground. We wait on this for a moment; and then there
Are two GUNSHOTS. CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and
Turns, moving back to the car.

PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind
Him are shattered.

CLEMENZA
Leave the gun.

LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few
Feet where there is another car. They get in, and drive off.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL. It is late afternoon. Many strange
Cars are parked on the nearby streets. We can see the group
Of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries
With concealed weapons.

MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.

He is bundled in a warm marine coat. He looks at the
Strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe. They
Look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the
Respect of his position. He is like an exile Prince. He
Wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.

A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground
Equipment. The basketball ring now half coming off. This
Is where he was a child. Then a shout.

CLEMENZA (O.S.)
Mike. Hey Mikey; telephone.

CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window. MICHAEL
Hurries into the house.

INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

CLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.
He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the
Hook.

CLEMENZA
Some dame.

MICHAEL picks it up.

MICHAEL
Hello. Kay?

KAY (O.S.)
How is your father?

MICHAEL
He'll be OK.

KAY (O.S.)
(pause)
I love you.

He glances at the THUGS in the kitchen. Tries to shield the
Phone.

KAY (O.S.)
I LOVE YOU.

MICHAEL
Yeah Kay, I'm here.

KAY (O.S.)
Can you say it?

MICHAEL
Huh?

KAY (O.S.)
Tell me you love me.

MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table. He curls
Up in a corner, and in a quarter voice:

MICHAEL
I can't...

KAY (O.S.)
Please say it.

MICHAEL
Look. I'll see you tonight, OK?

KAY (O.S.)
OK.
(click)

CLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all
The button men stationed around the house.

CLEMENZA
How come you don't tell that nice
Girl you love her...here, learn
Something... you may have to feed
Fifty guys some day. You start
With olive oil...fry some garlic,
See. And then fry some sausage...or meat
Balls if you like...then you throw
In the tomatoes, the tomato
Paste...some basil; and a little
Red wine...that's my trick.

SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.

SONNY
You take care of Paulie?

CLEMENZA
You won't see Paulie anymore. He's
Sick for good this winter.

MICHAEL starts to leave.

SONNY
Where are you going?

MICHAEL
To the city.

SONNY
(to Clemenza; dipping
Bread into the sauce)
Send some bodyguards.

MICHAEL
I don't need them, Sonny. I'm just
Going to see Pop in the hospital.
Also, I got other things.

CLEMENZA
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.

SONNY
OK, but be careful.

EXT NITE: CAR

MICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven
Into the city. THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front
Seat.

INT NITE: HOTEL LOBBY

MICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying
To book rooms.

INT NITE: HOTEL

MICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel. He is
Preoccupied, she's concerned.

MICHAEL
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty.
I'll just sit with him; I want to
Show respect.

KAY
Can I go to the hospital with you?

MICHAEL
I don't think so. You don't want
To end up on page 3 of the Daily
News.

KAY
My parents don't read the Daily
News. All right, if you think I
Shouldn't. I can't believe the
Things the papers are printing.
I'm sure most of it's not true.

MICHAEL
I don't think so either.
(silence)
I better go.

KAY
When will I see you again?

MICHAEL
I want you to go back to New
Hampshire...think things over.

He leans over her; kisses her.

KAY
When will I see you again?

MICHAEL
Goodbye.

Quietly, he moves out the door.

KAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:

KAY
Goodbye.

EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with
A neon sign ""HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY."" MICHAEL steps out, pays
The fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.

MICHAEL looks.

He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted. He
Is the only one on the street. There are gay, twinkling
Christmas decorations all over the building. He walks,
Slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps. He
Hesitates, looks around. This area is empty. He checks the
Address on a scrap of paper. It is correct. He tries the
Door, it is empty.

He walks in.

INT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital
Lobby. He looks to the right; there is a long, empty
Corridor. To the left: the same.

HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated
Building lit by eerie green neon lighting. All we hear are
His sole footsteps.

He walks up to a desk marked ""INFORMATION"". No one is there.
He moves quickly to a door marked ""OFFICE""; swings into it;
No one is there. He looks onto the desk: There is half a
Sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.

MICHAEL
Hello? Hello?

Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,
Alertly. MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all
Alone. The floors have just been mopped. They are still wet.

INT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS

Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several
Flights.

INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

He steps out onto the fourth floor. He looks. There are
Merely empty corridors. He takes out his scrap of paper;
Checks it. ""Room 4A."" Now he hurries, trying to follow the
Code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker
And quicker they flash by him. Now he stops, looks up ""4A--
Corleone"".

There is a special card table set up there with some
Magazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the
Ashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.

INT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A

Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he
Will find. He looks. Lit by the moonlight through the
Window, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the
Room, and under a transparent oxygen tent. All that can be
Heard is the steady though strained breathing. Slowly
MICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,
Securely asleep. Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the
Bed, and run to his nose and mouth.

VOICE (O.S.)
What are you doing here?

This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around. It is a
NURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.

NURSE
You're not supposed to be here now.

MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.

MICHAEL
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my
Father. What happened to the
Detectives who were guarding him?

NURSE
Oh your father just had too many
Visitors. It interfered with the
Hospital service. The police came
And made them all leave just ten
Minutes ago.
(comfortingly)
But don't worry. I look in on him.

MICHAEL
You just stand here one minute...

Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.

MICHAEL
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm
Down at the hospital. I came down
Late. There's no one here. None
Of Tessio's people--no detectives,
No one. The old man is completely
Unprotected.

SONNY (O.S.)
All right, get him in a different
Room; lock the door from the inside.
I'll have some men there inside of
Fifteen minutes. Sit tight, and
Don't panic.

MICHAEL
(furiously, but kept inside)
I won't panic.

He hangs up; returns to the NURSE...

NURSE
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.

MICHAEL
(coldly)
You and I are going to move my
Father right now...to another room
On another floor...Can you
Disconnect those tubes so we can
Wheel the bed out?

NURSE
Absolutely not! We have to get
Permission from the Doctor.

MICHAEL
You've read about my father in the
Papers. You've seen that no one's
Here to guard him. Now I've just
Gotten word that men are coming to
This hospital to kill him. Believe
Me and help me.

NURSE
(frightened)
We don't have to disconnect them,
We can wheel the stand with the bed.

She does so...and they perform the very difficult task of
Moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.

INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

They roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently
Down the corridor. We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.
MICHAEL hears them, stops.

MICHAEL
Hurry, into there.

They push it into the first available room. MICHAEL peeks
Out from the door. The footsteps are louder; then they
Emerge. It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet
Of flowers.

MICHAEL
(stepping out)
Who is it?

ENZO
Michael...do you remember me, Enzo,
The baker's helper to Nazorine, now
His son-in-law.

MICHAEL
Enzo, get out of here. There's
Going to be trouble.

A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.

ENZO
If there...will be trouble...I stay
With you, to help. I owe it to the
Godfather.

MICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.

MICHAEL
Go outside; stand in front...I'll
Be out in a minute.

INT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

They part. MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they
Put his FATHER.

NURSE
(frightened)
He's awake.

MICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he
Cannot speak. MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.

MICHAEL
Pop...Pop, it's me Michael. Shhhh,
Don't try to speak. There are men
Who are coming to try to kill you.
But I'm with you...I'm with you
Now...

The OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot. MICHAEL tenderly
Puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.

EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)

Outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,
Pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only
Weapon. MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him. They
Both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.
They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,
Lights it. ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.

MICHAEL
Get rid of those and look like
You've got a gun in your pocket.

The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas
Decorations.

MICHAEL
Listen...

We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming. MICHAEL
And ENZO look with fear in their eyes. Then MICHAEL takes
The bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.
They stand, hands in their pockets.

A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.
MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive. The car
Seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.
MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved. MICHAEL looks down; the
BAKER's hands are shaking. He looks at his own, and they
Are not.

Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of
Police sirens. They are clearly coming toward the hospital,
Getting louder and louder. MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.

In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of
The hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed
POLICE and DETECTIVES. He smiles his relief and starts
Toward them. TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his
Arms while ANOTHER frisks him. A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,
Spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,
With beefy red face and white hair seems furious. This is
McCLUSKEY.

MCCLUSKEY
I thought I got all you guinea
Hoods locked up. Who the hell are
You and what are you doing here?

ANOTHER COP standing nearby:

COP
He's clean, Captain.

MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.

MICHAEL
(quietly)
What happened to the detectives who
Were supposed to be guarding my
Father?

MCCLUSKEY
(furious)
You punk-hood. Who the hell are
You to tell me my business. I
Pulled them off. I don't care how
Many Dago gangsters kill each other.
I wouldn't lift a finger to keep
Your old man from getting knocked
Off. Now get the hell out of here;
Get off this street you punk, and
Stay away from this hospital.

MICHAEL stands quiet.

MICHAEL
I'll stay until you put guards
Around my father's room.

MCCLUSKEY
Phil, lock this punk up.

A DETECTIVE
The Kid's clean, Captain...He's a
War hero, and he's never been mixed
Up in the rackets...

MCCLUSKEY
(furious)
Goddam it, I said lock him up. Put
The cuffs on him.

MICHAEL
(deliberately, right
To McCLUSKEY's face,
As he's being handcuffed)
How much is the Turk paying you to
Set my father up, Captain?

Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL
Squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.
MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw. He looks at
McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and
He falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S
MEN arrive.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

HIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL. The gateway now has a
Long black car blocking it. There are more BUTTON MEN
Stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying
Rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN
Standing by open windows. It is clear that the war is
Escalating. A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,
MICHAEL and HAGEN. MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged. He
Stops and looks up at the open window. We can see MEN
Holding rifles.

MICHAEL
Christ, Sonny really means business.

They continue walking. TESSIO joins them. The various
BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.

CLEMENZA
How come all the new men?

TESSIO
We'll need them now. After the
Hospital incident, Sonny got mad.
We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock
This morning.

INT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY

They enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

SONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.

SONNY
I've got a hundred button men on
The streets twenty-four hours a day.
If Sollozzo shows one hair on his
Ass he's dead.

He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,
Kiddingly.

SONNY
Mikey, you look beautiful!

MICHAEL
Cut it out.

SONNY
The Turk wants to talk! The nerve
Of that son of a bitch! After he
Craps out last night he wants a meet.

HAGEN
Was there a definite proposal?

SONNY
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to
Meet him to hear his proposition.
The promise is the deal will be so
Good we can't refuse.

HAGEN
What about that Tattaglias? What
Will they do about Bruno?

SONNY
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out
What they did to my father.

HAGEN
We should hear what they have to say.

SONNY
No, no Consiglere. Not this time.
No more meetings, no more
Discussions, no more Sollozzo
Tricks. Give them one message: I
WANT SOLLOZZO. If not, it's all
Out war. We go to the mattresses
And we put all the button men out
On the street.

HAGEN
The other families won't sit still
For all out war.

SONNY
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.

HAGEN
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't
Want to hear this. This is not a
Personal thing, this is Business.

SONNY
And when they shot me father...

HAGEN
Yes, even the shooting of your
Father was business, not personal...

SONNY
No no, no more advice on how to
Patch it up Tom. You just help me
Win. Understood?

HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.

HAGEN
I found out about this Captain
McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.
He's definitely on Sollozzo's
Payroll, and for big money.
McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's
Bodyguard. What you have to
Understand is that while Sollozzo
Is guarded like this, he's
Invulnerable. Nobody has ever
Gunned down a New York Police
Captain. Never. It would be
Disastrous. All the five families
Would come after you Sonny; the
Corleone family would be outcasts;
Even the old man's political
Protection would run for cover. So
Just...take that into consideration.

SONNY
(still fuming)
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk
Forever. We'll wait.

MICHAEL
We can't wait. No matter what
Sollozzo say about a deal, he's
Figuring out how to kill Pop. You
Have to get Sollozzo now.

SONNY
The kid's right.

HAGEN
What about McCluskey?

MICHAEL
Let's say now that we have to kill
McCluskey. We'll clear that up
Through our Newspaper contacts later.

SONNY
Go on Mike.

MICHAEL
They want me to go to the conference
With Sollozzo. Set up the meeting
For two days from now. Sonny, get
Our informers to find out where the
Meeting will be held.
Insist it has to be a public place:
A bar or restaurant at the height
Of the dinner hour. So I'll feel
Safe. They'll check me when I meet
Them so I won't be able to carry a
Weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a
Way to have one planted there for
Me.
(pause)
Then I'll kill them both.

Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.
Silence. SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter. He points
A finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.

SONNY
You? You, the high-class college
Kid. You never wanted to get mixed
Up in the family business. Now you
Wanta gun down a police Captain and
The Turk just because you got
Slapped in the face. You're taking
It personal, it's just business and
He's taking it personal.

Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps
His face serious.

MICHAEL
(angrily, but cold)
Sonny, it's all personal, and I
Learned it from him, the old man,
The Godfather. He took my joining
The Marines personal. I take
Sollozzo trying to kill my father
Personal, and you know I'll kill
Them Sonny.

MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.

INT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945)

CLOSE on a revolver.

CLEMENZA (O.S.)
It's as cold as they come,
Impossible to trace.
(he turns it upside down)
Don't worry about prints Mike, I
Put a special tape on the trigger
And butt. Here.
(he hands the gun to
Another pair of hands)
Whatsamatter? Trigger too tight.
(it fires: very LOUD)
I left it noisy, so it'll scare any
Pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander
Away.

MICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.

CLEMENZA
Just let your hand drop to your
Side, and let the gun slip out.
Everybody will still think you got
It. They'll be starin' at your
Face, see? Then walk out of the
Place real fast, but don't run.
Don't look anybody directly in the
Eye, but don't look away from them
Neither. Hey, they'll be scared
Stiff o you, believe me. Nobody's
Gonna bother with you. Don't worry
About nothing; you'd be surprised
How good these things go. O.K.,
Put your hat on, let's see how you
Look. Helps with identification.

They put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.

CLEMENZA
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse
To change their identification when
We make them see the light. Then
You take a long vacation and we
Catch the hell.

MICHAEL
How bad will it be?

CLEMENZA
Probably all the other families
Will line up against us. But, it's
Alright. These things have to
Happen once every ten years or
So...gets rid of the bad blood.
You gotta stop 'em at the beginning.
Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at
Munich, they shoulda never let him
Get away with that, they were just
Asking for big trouble...

INT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house. A card
Table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the
Corleone buttonmen.

He continues into the living room. It's a mess. SONNY
Asleep on the sofa. On the coffee table are the remains of
A take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of
Whisky. The radio is playing.

MICHAEL
Why don't you stop living like a
Bum and get this place cleaned up.

SONNY
What are you, inspecting the
Barracks?
(SONNY sits up with
His head in his hands)
You ready? Did Clemenza tell you
Be sure to drop the gun right away?

MICHAEL
A million times.

SONNY
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to
Pick you up in an hour and a half
On Times Square, under the big
Camels sign.

HAGEN
We don't let Mike go until we have
The hostage, Sonny.

CLEMENZA
It's okay...the hostage is outside
Playing pinochle with three of my
Men.

The phone rings in the DON's office.

SONNY
That could be a Tattaglia informer
With the meeting place.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

HAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS
Move in.

HAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.

SONNY
One of Tattaglia's people?

HAGEN
No. Our informer in McCluskey's
Precinct. Tonight at 8:00 he
Signed out for Louis' Restaurant in
The Bronx. Anyone know it.

TESSIO
Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.
A small family place with big
Booths where people can talk in
Private. Good food. Everybody
Minds their business. Perfect.
(he moves to the desk
And makes a crude drawing)
This is the entrance, Mike. When
You finish just walk out and turn
Left, then turn the corner.
Clemenza, you gotta work fast to
Plant the gun. They got an old-
Fashioned toilet with a space
Between the water container and the
Wall. We can tape the gun behind
There.

CLEMENZA
Mike, they're gonna frisk you in
The car. You'll be clean so they
Won't worry 'bout nothing. In the
Restaurant, wait and talk a while,
And then ask permission to go. See?
Then when you come out, don't waste
Time; don't sit down...you come out
Blasting. And don't take chances.
In the head, two shots apiece. And
Out as fast as your legs can move.

SONNY
I want somebody very good, very
Safe to plant that gun. I don't
Want my brother coming out of that
Toilet with just his dick in his
Hand.

CLEMENZA
The gun will be there.

SONNY
(to MICHAEL, warmly)
You're on, kid...I'll square it
With Mom your not seeing her before
You left. And I'll get a message
To your girl friend when I think
The time is right.

CLEMENZA
We gotta move...

MICHAEL
O.K. How long do you think before
I can come back?

SONNY
Probably a year...

HAGEN
(starting to crack)
Jesus, I don't know...

SONNY
Can you do it Mike?

MICHAEL moves out.

EXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)

The enormous ""CAMELS"" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands
MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat
CLEMENZA had given him. A long black car pulls around the
Corner and slows before him. The DRIVER, leaning over, open
The front door.

DRIVER
Get in, Mike.

He does, the car drives off.

EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

Inside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat
And shakes MIKE's hand.

SOLLOZZO
I'm glad you came, Mike. I hope we
Can straighten everything out. All
This is terrible, it's not the way
I wanted things to happen at all.
It should never have happened.

MICHAEL
I want to settle things tonight. I
Want my father left alone.

SOLLOZZO
He won't be; I swear to you be my
Children he won't be. Just keep an
Open mind when we talk. I hope
You're not a hothead like your
Brother, Sonny. It's impossible to
Talk business with him.

McCLUSKEY grunts.

MCCLUSKEY
He's a good kid. He's all right.
Turn around, up on your knees,
Facing me.

He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.

MCCLUSKEY
I'm sorry about the other night
Mike. I'm getting too old for my
Job, too grouchy. Can't stand the
Aggravation. You know how it is.
He's clean.

EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where
They're heading.

The car takes the George Washington Bridge. MICHAEL is
Concerned.

MICHAEL
We're going to New Jersey?

SOLLOZZO
(sly)
Maybe.

MICHAEL closes his eyes.

EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)

The car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way
To New Jersey. Then suddenly it hits the divider,
Temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the
Lanes going back to New York. It then hits it very fast, on
The way back to the city.

EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

SOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and
Then leans to the DRIVER.

SOLLOZZO
Nice work; I'll remember it.

MICHAEL is relieved.

EXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

The car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in
The Bronx: The ""LUNA AZURA"". There is no one on the street.
MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with
Them. He gets out, and opens the door. SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY
And MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the
Car. They enter the restaurant.

INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

A very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.
SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small
Round table near the center of the room. There are empty
Booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,
And ONE or TWO WAITERS. It is very quiet.

MCCLUSKEY
Is the Italian food good here?

SOLLOZZO
Try the veal; it's the finest in
New York.

The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.
They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three
Glasses. Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:

SOLLOZZO
I am going to talk Italian to Mike.

MCCLUSKEY
Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll
Concentrate on my veal and my
Spaghetti.

SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian. MICHAEL listening
Carefully and nodding every so often. Then MICHAEL answers
In Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on. The WAITER occasionally
Brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.
Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in
Italian, accidentally lapses into English.

MICHAEL
(using English for emphasis)
Most important...I want a sure
Guarantee that no more attempts
Will be made on my father's life.

SOLLOZZO
What guarantees can I give you? I
Am the hunted one. I've missed my
Chance. You think too highly of
Me, my friend...I am not so
Clever...all I want if a truce...

MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling
Holding his open hands up as if to say: ""I have no tricks up
My sleeve"". Then he looks away and makes a distressed look
On his face.

SOLLOZZO
What is it?

MICHAEL
Is it all right if I go to the
Bathroom?

SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious. He studies MICHAEL with
His dark eyes. Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's
Thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.

MCCLUSKEY
I frisked him; I've frisked
Thousands of young punks; he's clean.

He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;
Indicating the bathroom with his eyes. The MAN nods,
Indicating no one is there.

SOLLOZZO
Don't take too long.

MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and
Disappears inside.

INT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very
Hard. He actually uses the urinal. Then he washes his
Hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.
Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.
Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he
Cannot feel the gun. We see behind the tank his hand is
Just a few inches from the gun...he gropes
Searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him. Then he
Breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep
Breath and shoves it under his waistband. For some
Unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately
Washes his hands and dries them. Then he goes out.

INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.
McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal. SOLLOZZO
Turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at
MICHAEL. MICHAEL looks back. Then he smiles and continues
Back to the table. He sits down.

MICHAEL
Now I can talk. I feel much better.

The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now
He too relaxes. SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down
Comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton
His jacket. SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again
But MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear
Him.

The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to
Speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away
From him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts
The gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his
Temple. He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's
Head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the
Entire area.

The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is
Sprayed and stained with blood.

SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he
Seems to hang in space suspended.

MICHAEL pivots, and looks:

There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal
Suspended in air before his gaping mouth.

MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging
Throat. He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound. Then
Coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right
Through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.

The air is filled with pink mist.
MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.
He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.
Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty.
The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an
Expression of horror on his face.
MICHAEL looks at his two victims:
SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by
The table.
McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.
MICHAEL is wildly at a peak. He starts to move out. His
Hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.
He moves, not letting the gun go.

MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.

His hand: still holding the gun.

His face: finally he closes his eyes.

His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.

He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.

He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had
Been recreated in wax.

Then he leaves.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

FADE IN:

INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

A MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old
Upright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.
ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.

A little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,
Quietly eating. They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there
Is an occasional laugh.

ROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered
With a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.

A large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.

The sentimental tune is continued over the following:

INT DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)

A MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie
Still together in a bullet-riddled automobile.

INT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945)

A MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.

INT DAY: MATTRESS

Ten mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty
Living room of an apartment. THREE or FOUR MEN including
CLEMENZA, are taking naps.

An arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.

The MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and
Pouring the wine.

Trash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.

INT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

A MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an
Office building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S.
Truman.

EXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945)

ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning
Three steps of a front stoop.

INT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a
Crossword puzzle.

A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.

Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.
Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.

A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of
Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.

EXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945)

A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet
Alley.

INT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945)

A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in
A pool of blood on the tablecloth.

INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an
Apartment. We catch a glimpse of one headline: ""Five Family
War...""

The table. The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts. ONE
Has fallen asleep on his arms at the table.

SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.

The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse. Picks up
And takes a drag from his cigarette. The OTHER MAN nods
Appreciatively.

MAN
Nice Augie...nice.

EXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46)

Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York
Apartment building. We recognize a couple of SONNY's
Bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards
Against the curb.

Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of
Brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.

Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step,
Smoking a cigarette.

One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch,
Which is attached to a key chain. We HEAR the sound of a
Door opening; they look up.

The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.

SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI
Wrapped around him. She doesn't want to let go of him; she
Draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he
Comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.

He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard
On the first floor, and moves outside toward his car. The
Men quickly take up their positions. As he gets in his car:

DRIVER
Pick up your sister?

SONNY
Yeah.

The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the
Bodyguards in their cars.

INT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)

He knocks on the door. No answer. Then again.

CONNIE'S VOICE
Who is it?

SONNY
It's me, Sonny.

We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open. SONNY
Enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her
Back to him.

SONNY
(tenderly)
Connie, what is it?

He turns her around in his arms.

Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her
Rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.
As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red
With rage. She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing
Him from running out of the apartment.

CONNIE
(desperately)
It was my fault! I started a fight
With him and I tried to hit him so
He hit me. He didn't even try to
Hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.

Sonny listens, and calms himself. He touches her shoulder,
The thin silk robe.

SONNY
I'm goin' to have the doctor come
Over and take a look at you.

He starts to leave.

CONNIE
Oh Sonny, please don't do anything.
Please don't.

He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.

SONNY
Hey. Con. What'm I goin' to do?
Make your kid a orphan before he's
Born.

She laughs with him. He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.

EXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET

CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.
""Book"" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking
Beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the
Corner. The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the
Kids on the street are still playing stickball.

CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street
Suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block
And to a halt in front of the candy store. The tires
Scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a
MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast
The everyone is paralyzed. It is a moment before we
Recognize that it is SONNY.

His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on
The stoop and has CARLO by the throat.

He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down
Into the street. But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,
And hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to
Hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.
His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.

SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.

SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,
In a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing. His
Blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.

The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching
In fascination.

CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.

SONNY beats him mercilessly.

Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become
Spectators.

SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into
CARLO's face and body.

CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does
Nothing, other than hang onto the railing.

SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag
Him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in
The effort. Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;
Even biting them. CARLO screams but he does not let go.

It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will
Not be moved. SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him
More; but he is exhausted. Totally out of breath, he
Stammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.

SONNY
You...bastard...You...hurt my
Sister... again...and I'll
Kill...you.

He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.
And hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,
Leaving even his bodyguards in confusion. We notice ONE MAN
With a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially
Interested.

CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands. He slumps
Onto the stoop.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall. It is a gray, rainy day.
Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of
Various points around the main house and compound. Things
Have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new
And secure gate house has been built. Security measures
That had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made
A permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval
Fortress. We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the
Result of a recent bomb attempt. The house nearest the
Crater is damaged by fire.

A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright
Yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the
Shelter of the gate house.

They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they
Call the main house.

KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still
Runs down onto her face.

She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the
Sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.

TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.

HAGEN
Kay, we weren't expecting you. You
Should call...

KAY
I've tried calling and writing. I
Want to reach Michael.

HAGEN
Nobody knows where he is. We know
He's all right, but that's all.

KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with
Rainwater.

KAY
What was that?

HAGEN
An accident. No one was hurt.

KAY
Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I
Come in to call another one?

TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has
To.

HAGEN
Sure...I'm sorry.

They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.

INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

In the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and
Takes her rainhat off.

KAY
Will you give this to him.

HAGEN
If I accept that letter and you
Told a Court of Law I accepted it,
They would interpret it as my
Having knowledge of his whereabouts.
Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.

We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE
Enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.

MAMA
You're Mikey's little girl.

KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.

MAMA
You eat anything?

KAY shakes her head.

MAMA
(to HAGEN)
Disgrazia, you don't even give the
Poor girl a cup of coffee?

HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves
Toward MAMA, the letter extended.

KAY
Will you give this letter to Michael.

HAGEN
Mama, no.

MAMA
You tell me what to do? Even he
Don't tell me what to do.

She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.

KAY
Why did they blame Michael?

MAMA
You listen to me, you go home to
Your family, and you find a good
Young man and get married. Forget
About Mikey; he's no good for you,
Anymore.

She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what
That means.

EXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)

A hospital in New York City. POLICE and teams of PRIVATE
DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area. An ambulance
With a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the
Hospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL
ASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying
The DON.

TESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing
Up the rear. HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a
Moment they disappear behind the ambulance. Then suddenly,
Siren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung
Cars.

EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

The Corleone Mall.

Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone
Mall. EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE
DETECTIVES.

It all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.
All is silent. The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday
Clothes, wait.

EXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)

One ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway,
Preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a
Team of BUTTON MEN.

Sitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with
A rifle on his lap.

INT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946)

Inside the Main CORLEONE House:

Hospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully
Under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and
Various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.

All the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA,
THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.

INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but
Been converted into a hospital room, with complete and
Extensive equipment. The various CHILDREN get a turn to
Kiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then
SONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO
Should leave.

They do, the door is closed.

INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the
Sunday dinner, and set the table.

CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.

CONNIE
What's the matter, Carlo?

CARLO
Shut up.

INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

All the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with
Grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN. The DON
Does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and
Glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized. HAGEN is
The spokesman for the family.

HAGEN
...since McCluskey's killing, the
Police have cracked down on most of
Our operations...on the other
Families too. There's been a lot
Of bad blood.

The OLD MAN glances at SONNY.

SONNY
Pop, they hit us and we hit them
Back.

HAGEN
We put out a lot of material
Through our contacts in the
Newspapers...about McCluskey's
Being tied up with Sollozzo in the
Drug Rackets...things are starting
To loosen up.

The OLD MAN nods.

SONNY
Freddie's gonna go to Las
Vegas...under the protection of Don
Francesco of L.A. I want him to
Rest...

FREDO
I'm goin' to learn the casino
Business.

The DON nods approvingly. Then he searches around the room
For a face he does not see. HAGEN knows who he's looking for.

HAGEN
Michael...
(he takes a breath)
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and
Rage.

HAGEN
He's safe now...we're already
Working on ways to bring him back.

The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they
Leave him alone.

INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)

HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is
Expansive and optimistic.

SONNY
We'll let the old man take it easy
For a couple of weeks. I want to
Get things going good before he
Gets better. What's the matter
With you?

HAGEN
You start operating, the five
Families will start their raids
Again. We're at a stalemate Sonny,
Your war is costing us a lot of
Money.

SONNY
No more stalemate Tom, we got the
Soldiers, we'll match them gun for
Gun if that's how they want it.
They know me for what I am, Tom--
And they're scared of me.

HAGEN
Yes. That's true, you're getting a
Hell of a reputation.

SONNY
Well it's war! We might not be in
This shape if we had a real war-
Time Consiglere, a Sicilian. Pop
Had Genco, who do I have?
(TOM starts to leave)
Hey Tom, hey...hey. It's Sunday,
We're gonna have dinner. Don't be
Sore.

INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table
Over Sunday dinner. SONNY is at the head of the table.

EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

SOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed
Mall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally
By the gate.

ONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house. A
Young BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.

-----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------

INT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)

CONNIE and CARLO's apartment. She's in a slip, on the phone.
We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.

CONNIE
Who is this?

GIRL (O.S.)
(giggle)
I'm a friend of Carlo's. I just
Wanted to tell him I can't see him
Tonight; I have to go out of town.

CONNIE's face turns red.

CONNIE
You lousy tramp bitch.
(click)

She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the
Bathroom drying his golden body.

CARLO
What was that?

CONNIE
Your girl friend. She says she
Can't make it tonight. You lousy
Bastard you have the nerve to give
Your whores my telephone number.
I'll kill you, you bastard!

She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then
She flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy
Belly heaving under the thin slip.

CARLO
(defending himself)
You're crazy. She was kidding
Around; I don't know, some nut.

He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue
Dressing.

CONNIE
You're staying home. You're not
Going out.

CARLO
OK, OK. You gonna make me something
To eat at least?

That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing
Heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and
Starts her wifely duties.

CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in
The doorway.

CONNIE
The food is on the table.

CARLO
I'm not hungry yet.

CONNIE
Eat it, it's on the table.

CARLO
Ba Fa Goulle.

CONNIE
BA FA GOULE YOU!

She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen. A moment
Later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking. CARLO
Slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically
Smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy
Veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.

CARLO
You filthy guinea spoiled brat.
Clean it up or I'll kick your head
In.

CONNIE
Like hell I will.

She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again. Slowly,
He slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in
His hand.

CARLO
Clean it up!

He swings the belt against her heavy hips. She moves back
Into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it
Ready.

CARLO
Even the female Corleones are
Murderers.

He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her. She
Makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids. He
Pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process. She
Gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table,
Gets her; and starts to slap her in the face.

She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.

CONNIE
The baby! The baby!

INT DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

She runs into the bedroom; he follows. She moves into a
Corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide
Under the bed.

He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.

He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he
Throws her on the bed, contemptuously. He grabs part of her
Thigh, pinching it very hard.

CARLO
You're fat as a pig.

Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving
Her in tears. She is crying; she pulls herself to the
Bedroom phone, and in a whisper:

CONNIE
Mama...mama, it's Connie. Mama, I
Can't talk any louder. No, I don't
Want to talk to Sonny.

We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.

INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)

In the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the
Whispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.

SONNY
Yeah Connie.

CONNIE (O.S.)
Sonny, just send a car to bring me
Home. I'll tell you then, it's
Nothing Sonny, don't you come.
Send TOM, please Sonny, it's
Nothing; I just want to come home.

SONNY's face is turning red.

SONNY
(in a controlled voice)
You wait there. You just wait there.

He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.

SONNY
(quietly)
That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...

HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he
Cannot interfere.

EXT DAY: MALL

SONNY leaves the house. HAGEN moves to the outside mall
Just as SONNY's car is driving off. He moves to a group of
BUTTON MEN.

HAGEN
Go after him.

EXT DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)

SONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.
After a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is
Trailing.

SONNY is driving; he is very angry.

EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

SONNY in his car; driving back. Still breathing hard and
Still furious. Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.
He starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a
Toll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the
COLLECTOR.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

FADE IN:

INT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT

The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.

HAGEN (O.S.)
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Don Corleone, at his request.

BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.
BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.

BONASERA
Yes, I understand. I'm listening.

HAGEN (O.S.)
You owe the Don a service. In one
Hour, not before, perhaps later, he
Will be at your funeral parlor to
Ask for your help. Be there to
Greet him. If you have any
Objections speak now, and I'll
Inform him.

Silence. BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.

BONASERA
Anything...Anything the Godfather
Wishes.

HAGEN (O.S.)
Good. He never doubted you.

BONASERA
The Don himself is coming to me
Tonight?

HAGEN (O.S.)
Yes.
(click)

BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE
Sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.

Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing. His WIFE knows
Something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes
From him. He lights a cigarette.

BONASERA
For the last year, they have been
Killing one another. So now, what?
Your Godfather comes to me...Why?
(whispering, slyly)
They've killed someone so important
That they wish to make his body
Disappear.

MRS. BONASERA
(frightened)
Amerigo!

BONASERA
They could make me an accomplice to
Their murder. They could send me
To jail!

He slips into his trousers. Then he moves to his WIFE to
Tie his tie, as she has done for years.

BONASERA
And if the other families find
Out...they will make me their enemy.
They could come here to our house.
I curse the day I ever went to the
Godfather.

EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.

INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without
Turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room,
Past the tables, and equipment. He operates the chain that
Lifts a large overhead garage type door. And looks out into
The alley.

He sits on a bench, and waits.

EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)

The tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley;
We notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral
Parlor.

CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.
BONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak. He notices TWO
OTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a
CORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet
Protruding.

BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way
The MEN should carry their sinister burden.

INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming
Room.

Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the
Darkness somewhat uncertainly. It is DON CORLEONE.

He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking. His
Cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.
Then, after a long gaze:

DON CORLEONE
Well my friend, are you ready to do
Me this service?

BONASERA nods. The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming
Table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.

BONASERA
What do you wish me to do?

DON CORLEONE
(staring at the table)
I want you to use all your powers,
All your skill, as you love me. I
Do not want his mother to see him
As he is.

He draws down the gray blanket.

BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:

The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.

EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

SONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.

A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the
Booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets
Him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll
Booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the
Car blocking him.

The windows of his car are shot out.

Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car.

His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.

His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it
Continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that
He will survive it.

Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and
Actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER
Fire.

His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.

A FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and
Make off in the distance.

SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they
Are too late.

INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

View on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room. He is silent
A moment, and then:

HAGEN
(quietly)
OK. Go to Clemenza's house and
Tell him to come here right away.
He'll tell you what to do.

The MEN leave him alone. He is quiet, standing in the
Middle of the living room a moment. He looks in the
Direction of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA
Moving around.

INT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)

TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the
DON's room. He opens the DON's door. Looks in.

INT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

The DON in his hospital bed. Asleep under sedation. HAGEN
Hesitates. He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN. He
Closes the door.

INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)

HAGEN alone in the office. He is drinking. He looks up at
The sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving. Then he
Hears footsteps.

The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE
Slowly enters the room. He walks directly to his stuffed
Armchair, sits down. His face is stern, as he looks into
HAGEN's eyes.

DON CORLEONE
Give me a drop of anisette.

HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.

DON CORLEONE
My wife was weeping before she fell
Asleep, outside my window I saw my
Caporegimes to the house, and it is
Midnight. So, Consigliere of mine,
I think you should tell your Don
What everyone knows.

HAGEN
(quietly)
I didn't tell Mama anything. I was
About to come up and wake you and
Tell you. Just now.

DON CORLEONE
But you needed a drink first.

HAGEN
Yes.

DON CORLEONE
Now you've had your drink.

Pause.

HAGEN
They shot Sonny on the Causeway.
(pause)
He's dead.

DON CORLEONE blinks. One feels that just for a second he
Loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of
Him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.

DON CORLEONE
I want no inquiries made. No acts
Of vengeance.
(pause)
Consigliere, arrange a meeting with
The heads of the five
Families...this war stops now.

He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...

DON CORLEONE
Call Bonasera...he will do me a
Service.

And leaves. HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...

HAGEN
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for
Don Corleone, at his request.

BONASERA (O.S.)
Yes, I understand I'm listening.

HAGEN
You owe the Don a service. He has
No doubt that you will repay it.

EXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)

Day in Manhattan. An impressive Bank Building in the
Financial center of New York. Many limousines are parked,
Uniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.

INT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)

The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.

CARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man,
Sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a
MAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and
Settles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man;
As the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:

DON CORLEONE (O.S.)
I want to thank you all for coming.
I consider it a service done to me
Personally and I am in the debt of
Each and every one of you.
Especially those of you who have
Traveled from such distances as
California, St. Louis, Kansas City;
And New Orleans...

The VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both
Younger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA,
Short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the
Table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his
JEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an
Older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO
CUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then
DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair
And a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his
Early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at
CONNIE's Wedding.

DON CORLEONE
Ah well, let's get down to business.
We are all honorable men here, we
Don't have to give assurances as if
We were lawyers.
(he sits, gazes out
At them, and sighs)
How did things ever go so far?
Well, no matter. A lot of
Foolishness has come to pass. It
Was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks. A
Large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times,
And two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during
The day's trading, and projected above.

DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.

DON CORLEONE
Tattaglia has lost a son; I have
Lost a son. We are quits. Let
There be a peace...
(he gestures
Expressively,
Submissively, with
His hands)
That is all I want...

BARZINI
Don Corleone is too modest. He had
The judges and politicians in his
Pocket and he refused to share them.
His refusal is not the act of a
Friend. He takes the bread out of
The mouths of our families. Times
Have changed, it's not like the old
Days where everyone can go his own
Way. If Don Corleone had all the
Judges and politicians in New York,
Then he must share them or let
Others use them. Certainly he can
Present a bill for such services,
We're not Communists, after all.
But he has to let us draw water
From the well. It's that simple.

DON CORLEONE
My friends, I didn't refuse out of
Malice. You all know me. When
Have I ever refused an accommodation?
But why, this time? Because I
Think this drug business will
Destroy us in the years to come.
It's not like whiskey or gambling
Or even women which most people
Want and is forbidden them by the
Pezzonovante of the Church and the
Government. But drugs? No. Even
Policemen, who help us in gambling
And other things would refuse to
Help us in drugs. But...I am
Willing to do whatever all of you
Think is necessary.

DON ZALUCHI
I don't believe in drugs. For
Years I paid my people extra so
They wouldn't do that kind of
Business...$200 a week. But it
Didn't matter. Somebody comes to
Them and says, ""I have powders, if
You put up three, four thousand
Dollar investment, we can make
Fifty thousand distributing."" Who
Can resist such a profit?
There's no way to control it, as a
Business...to keep it respectable.
(rapping the table)
I don't want it near schools! I
Don't want it sold to children.
That is an infamita.
(thinking)
In my city I would try to keep the
Traffic in the dark people, the
Colored. They are the best
Customers, the least troublesome,
And they are animals anyway. They
Have no respect for their wives or
Their families or themselves. Let
Them lose their souls with drugs.
But something has to be done, we
Can't have everybody running around
Doing just what they please, like a
Bunch of anarchists.

BARZINI
Then, are we agreed; the traffic in
Drugs will be permitted, but
Controlled; and Don Corleone agrees
To give it protection in the East.

DON CORLEONE nods.

BARZINI
That's the whole matter then, we
Have the peace, and let me pay my
Respects to Don Corleone, whom we
Have all known over the years as a
Man of his word.
(noticing TATTAGLIA
Is uneasy)
Don Philip?

TATTAGLIA
I agree to everything here, I'm
Willing to forget my own misfortune.
But I must hear strict assurance
From Corleone. When time goes by
And his position becomes stronger,
Will he attempt any individual
Vengeance?

They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that
DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something
Else in mind. Slowly the DON rises.

DON CORLEONE
I forego my vengeance for my dead
Son, for the common good. But I
Have selfish reasons. My youngest
Son had to flee, accused of
Sollozzo's murder, and I must now
Make arrangements so that he can
Come home with safety, cleared of
All those false charges. That is
My affair, and I will make those
Arrangements.
(with strength)
But I am a superstitious man...and
So if some unlucky accident should
Befall my youngest son, if some
Police officer should accidentally
Shoot him, or if he should hang
Himself in his cell, or if my son
Is struck by a bolt of lightning,
Then I will blame some of the
People here. That, I could never
Forgive, but...aside from that, let
Me swear by the souls of my
Grandchildren that I will never be
The one to break the peace we have
Made.

EXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)

The DON's black limousine. He sits quietly in the padded
Rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.

It is night. Lights flash by them every so often.

HAGEN
When I meet with Tattaglia's
People; should I insist that all
His drug middle-men be clean?

DON CORLEONE
Mention it, don't insist. Barzini
Is a man who will know that without
Being told.

HAGEN
You mean Tattaglia.

DON CORLEONE
(shaking his head)
Barzini.

HAGEN
(a revelation)
He was the one behind Sollozzo?

DON CORLEONE
Tattaglia is a pimp. He could
Never have outfought Santino. But
I wasn't sure until this day. No,
It was Barzini all along.

The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.

------------------------------------------FADE OUT------

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT

A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and
Downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left
Grotesque and misshapen.

GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea
Jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.

THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on
Either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his
Shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple
Honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable,
And with a pleasing build. Each of the SHEPHERDS carry
Knapsacks.

The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape,
Overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.

EXT DAY: SICILY ROAD

The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make
Their way to a dusty rural road. We HEAR a rinky horn
Sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.
An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL. The
Car pulls in front of them and stops. MICHAEL nods
Respectfully.

MICHAEL
Don Tommassino.

DON TOMMASSINO
Michael, why must you do this. We
Have been lucky so far, all these
Months you've been here we've kept
Your name a secret. It is from
Love for your father that I've
Asked you never to more than an
Hour from the Villa.

MICHAEL
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me;
Nothing will happen.

DON TOMMASSINO
You must understand that your
Father's enemies have friends in
Palermo.

MICHAEL
I know.

DON TOMMASSINO
Where are you going?

MICHAEL
Corleone.

DON TOMMASSINO
There is nothing there. Not anymore.

MICHAEL
I was told that my Grandfather was
Murdered on its main street; and
His murderers came to kill my
Father there when he was twelve
Years old.

DON TOMMASSINO
Long ago. Now there is nothing:
The men killed each other in family
Vendettas...the others escaped to
America.

MICHAEL
Don Tommassino...I should see this
Place.

DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.

DON TOMMASSINO
That is your birthright...but
Michael, use this car.

MICHAEL
No...I would like to walk to
Corleone.

The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.

DON TOMMASSINO
Be careful Michael, don't let them
Know your name.

The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues
On his journey.

EXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE

The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit
Trees, in bloom and bursting with life.

EXT DAY: VILLAGE

They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the
Post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the
Empty streets. Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only
Gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass. And there
Are many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.

The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main
Road ""VOTA COMMUNISTA"".

EXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD

They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally
A donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.

EXT DAY: FIELD

Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession
Of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong,
Marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men
Carrying billowing red banners.

EXT DAY: GROVE

They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees
Is a deep, tall field of wild flowers.

The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out
Loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.

MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.

FABRIZZIO
You tell us about America.

MICHAEL
How do you know I come from America?

FABRIZZIO
We hear. We were told you were a
Pezzonovanta...big shot.

MICHAEL
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.

FABRIZZIO
Hey America! Is she as rich as
They say?

MICHAEL
Yes.

FABRIZZIO
Take me to America! You need a
Good lupara in America?
(pats his shotgun)
You take me, I'll be the best man
You got. ""Oh say, can you
Seeee...By da star early light...""

MICHAEL laughs.

EXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD

The TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military
Convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of
The U.S. drivers, as they move by.

FABRIZZIO
America.
Hey America!
Take me with you!
Hey, take me to America G.I.!

EXT DAY: CORLEONE HILL

They continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until
They hesitate, and look down.

CALO
Corleone.

They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.

EXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET

MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of
The village. They walk behind him, and spread to either
Side about fifteen feet away from him.

They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.
MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.
They go on.

They move up a very narrow old street. MICHAEL looks at the
Doorways that they pass.

MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.

CALO sees MICHAEL looking.

CALO
The names of the dead.

MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street. He looks.

The street is empty, barren. Occasionally, an old woman
Will pass.

MICHAEL turns his head.

The other side of the street: empty and deathly.

A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old
Street, the shepherds a respectful distance away.

-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

EXT DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE

A green ribboned field of a baronial Estate. Further ahead
Is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been
Discovered in the ruins of Pompeii. There is a group of
Young village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,
Dressed in black. They have been gathering the pink sulla,
Purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon
Blossoms. They are singing, off in the distance as they work.

MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this
Fantasy-like scene.

FABRIZZIO
(calling out to them)
Hey, beautiful girls!

MICHAEL
(sternly)
Shhhhh.

He settles down to watch.

The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that
Cling to their bodies. They are still in their teens, but
Developed and womanly.

They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not
Aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.
Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them
Playfully, in the direction of the grove.

The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her
Left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws
Them back at her pursuers laughing.

They come closer and closer. Just short of the grove, she
Poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the
View of the THREE MEN. She stands there on her toes about
To run.

MICHAEL sees her; now face to face. He looks.

Her face. Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair
And a rich mouth.

FABRIZZIO
(murmuring)
Jesus Christ, take my soul. I'm
Dying.

Quickly, she turns, and runs away.

MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her. We hold
On him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS
Laughing. Then he turns to them.

FABRIZZIO
You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?

CALO pats him on the shoulder.

CALO
Easy man.

MICHAEL
What are you talking about?

FABRIZZIO
You can't hide it when you're hit
By the thunderbolt.

EXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE

The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate,
Is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.

MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central
Square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.

The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man;
He greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at
Their table.

FABRIZZIO
You know all the girls in this
Town, eh? We saw some beauties
Coming down the road. One in
Particular got our friend hit with
The Thunderbolt...
(he indicates MICHAEL)

VITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with
New interest.

VITELLI
You had better bring a few bottles
Home with you, my friend; you'll
Need help sleeping tonight.
(he laughs)

FABRIZZIO
This one could seduce the devil. A
Body! and eyes as big and black as
Olives.

VITELLI
(laughing with
Them...pouring more wine)
I know about what you mean!

FABRIZZIO
This was a beauty. Right, Calo?

VITELLI
(laughing)
Beautiful all over, eh?

FABRIZZIO
And hair. Black and curly, like a
Doll. And such a mouth.

VITELLI does not laugh quite so much.

VITELLI
Yes, we have beautiful girls here...
But virtuous.

VITELLI is no longer drinking with them.

MICHAEL
She wore a red dress, and a red
Ribbon in her hair. She looks more
Greek than Italian. Do you know a
Beauty like that?

As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less,
Until he wears a scowl.

VITELLI
No.

Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.

FABRIZZIO
God in Heaven, I think I
Understand...

He goes into the back room after the innkeeper. Then he
Returns.

FABRIZZIO
Let's get out of here; he's boiling
Up his blood to do us mischief.
It's his daughter.

They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.

CALO
Come quickly.

MICHAEL
Innkeeper. More wine!

FABRIZZIO
(whispered)
The old bastard mentioned two sons
He only has to whistle up.

MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.

MICHAEL
Tell him to come to me.

The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in
A moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI
Between them.

MICHAEL
(quietly)
I understand I've offended you by
Talking about your daughter. I
Offer you my apologies, I'm a
Stranger in this country, I don't
Know the customs very well. Let me
Say this, I meant no disrespect to
You or her...

CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.

VITELLI
(shrugs)
Who are you and what do you want
From my daughter?

MICHAEL
I am an American hiding in Sicily
From the police of my country. My
Name is Michael. You can inform
The police and make your fortune
But then your daughter would lose a
Father rather than gain a husband.
In any case, I want to meet your
Daughter. With your permission and
Under the supervision of your
Family. With all decorum. With
All respect. I am an honorable man.

CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then
Asks:

VITELLI
Are you a friend of the friends?

MICHAEL
When the proper time comes, I'll
Tell you everything that a wife's
Father should know.

FABRIZZIO
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.

VITELLI
(formally)
Come Sunday morning: My name is
Vitelli and my house is up there on
The hill, above the village.

MICHAEL
Your daughter's name?

VITELLI
Appolonia.

-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from
Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an
Alfa Romeo. CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday
Best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their
Luparas on their shoulders.

DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off,
Rocky and bouncing on the dirt road.

The Sunday churchbells ring.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE

MICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by
The yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the
MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.
Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate
Sunday clothing. Now he presents the wrapped gift to
APPOLONIA. She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives
Her permission to open it. She unwraps it. Her eyes light
At the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.

She looks at him.

APPOLONIA
Grazia.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE

Now the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's
Cafe.

MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS,
Though they are all dressed differently.

They go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is
Talking and talking.

MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.
She wears the gold necklace around her neck.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME

MICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path,
Seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.

As the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a
Half dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces
Further behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on
Their shoulders.

Further up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone,
And falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm. She modestly regains
Her balance, and they continue walking.

Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH

Church bells in an ancient belfry ring out. Music, old and
Dissonant, plays.

There is a bridal procession in the street of the village;
The same in feeling and texture as it might have been five
Hundred years ago.

Donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant
Flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white
Confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by
Countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.

We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with
All the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in
Sicily.

APPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome
Despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE

CALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the
Great wedding celebration. It is held in the Village
Square; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the
Tops of buildings, carrying luparas.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

INT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA

MICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight
Fills the room.

He turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA. A
Little frightened; but lovely.

He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her,
Looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.

Slowly and tenderly he kisses her. Her tiny hands come up
To his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.

She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.

--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

INT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA

Morning. MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the
Room.

APPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially
Covered by the bedsheets.

He looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.

EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

HIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA

We HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving
Erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost
Hitting th inner court wall.

APPOLONIA is laughing, driving. MICHAEL pretends to be
Frightened, as he teaches her to drive.

Outside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking
Guard duty.

The car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.

MICHAEL
It's safer to teach you English.

APPOLONIA
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday...See, I learned
It. Now teach me to drive!

DON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard. He seems tired and
Concerned.

MICHAEL
Ciao, Don Tommassino.

APPOLONIA kisses him.

MICHAEL
Things went badly in Palermo?

DON TOMMASSINO
The younger men have no respect.
Things are changing; I don't know
What will happen. Michael, because
Of the wedding, people now know
Your name.

MICHAEL
Is that why there are more men on
The walls?

DON TOMMASSINO
Even so, I don't think it is safe
Here anymore. I've made plans to
Move you to a villa near Siracuse.
You must go right away.

MICHAEL
What is it?

DON TOMMASSINO
Bad news from America. Your
Brother, Santino. He has been
Killed.

For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the
Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.

EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

Morning. MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.

Below, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs,
Combing his thick hair.

MICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.

MICHAEL
Get the car. I'll be leaving in
Ten minutes. Where's Calo?

FABRIZZIO
Calo is having a cup of coffee in
The kitchen. Is your wife coming
With you?

MICHAEL
No, she's going home to her family.
She'll join me in a few weeks...

INT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN

MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the
Kitchen. CALO is just finishing a bite. He rises when he
Sees MICHAEL.

CALO
Should I get your bag?

MICHAEL
No, I'll get it. Where's Appolonia?

CALO
(smiling)
She is sitting in the driver's seat
Of the car, dying to step on the
Gas. She'll be a real American
Woman before she gets to America.

MICHAEL smiles.

MICHAEL
Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in
The car.

He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.

He looks out from the opening in the doorway.

EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's
Seat, playing with the wheel like a child.

CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear
Seat.

Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.

Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO
Disappear through the gate.

MICHAEL
(muttering to himself)
Where the hell is he going?

MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.

MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer
Courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.

APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay
Where he is.

APPOLONIA
(calling out)
I'll drive to you.

He smiles affectionately.

CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling
By his side. There is no sight of FABRIZZIO. Suddenly the
Smile fades from MICHAEL's face. He steps forward and holds
Out his hand.

MICHAEL
No. No!

His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION,
As she switched on the ignition.

Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off;
And there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.

MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.

INT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM

MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room. We hear
Whispering around him, but can't make any of it out. A soft
Cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open. DON
TOMMASSINO is there, close to him. He looks at them and
From their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.

MICHAEL
Fabrizzio. Let your shepherds know
That the one who gives me Fabrizzio
Will own the finest pastures in
Sicily.

--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)

Easter.

A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime. Hordes
Of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children
And Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets,
Searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden
Easter eggs.

The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing
Baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around
His garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.

Suddenly, he stops and looks.

MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.

Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in
MICHAEL's direction.

MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son
And embraces him.

DON CORLEONE
Be my son...

INT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY

DON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the
Building.

DON CORLEONE
This old building has seen its day.
No way to do business...too small,
Too old.

They enter the DON's glass-panelled office.

DON CORLEONE
Have you thought about a wife? A
Family?

MICHAEL
(pained)
No.

DON CORLEONE
I understand, Michael. But you
Must make a family, you know.

MICHAEL
I want children, I want a family.
But I don't know when.

DON CORLEONE
Accept what's happened, Michael.

MICHAEL
I could accept everything that's
Happened; I could accept it, but
That I never had a choice. From
The time I was born, you had laid
This all out for me.

DON CORLEONE
No, I wanted other things for you.

MICHAEL
You wanted me to be your son.

DON CORLEONE
Yes, but sons who would be
Professors, scientists,
Musicians...and grandchildren who
Could be, who knows, a Governor, a
President even, nothing's impossible
Here in America.

MICHAEL
Then why have I become a man like
You?

DON CORLEONE
You are like me, we refuse to be
Fools, to be puppets dancing on a
String pulled by other men. I
Hoped the time for guns and killing
And massacres was over. That was
My misfortune. That was your
Misfortune. I was hunted on the
Streets of Corleone when I was
Twelve years old because of who my
Father was. I had no choice.

MICHAEL
A man has to choose what he will be.
I believe that.

DON CORLEONE
What else do you believe in?

MICHAEL doesn't answer.

DON CORLEONE
Believe in a family. Can you
Believe in your country? Those
Pezzonovante of the State who
Decide what we shall do with our
Lives? Who declare wars they wish
Us to fight in to protect what they
Own. Do you put your fate in the
Hands of men whose only talent is
That they tricked a bloc of people
To vote for them? Michael, in five
Years the Corleone family can be
Completely legitimate. Very
Difficult things have to happen to
Make that possible. I can't do
Them anymore, but you can, if you
Choose to.

MICHAEL listens.

DON CORLEONE
Believe in a family; believe in a
Code of Honor, older and higher,
Believe in Roots that go back
Thousands of years into your Race.
Make a family, Michael, and protect
It. These are our affairs, sono cosa
Nostra, Governments only protect
Men who have their own individual
Power. Be one of those men...you
Have the choice.

--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

EXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS (1955)

A MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.

FREDO (O.S.)
There's a new one. Construction
Going on everywhere.

MORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the
Bill marquees read: ""MARTIN AND LEWIS"", ""PATTI PAGE"", etc.

FREDO (O.S.)
That's one of the family's new ones.
Not bad, eh?

EXT DAY: FLAMINGO (1955)

The car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel.

Inside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man,
NERI, quiet and sinister.

MICHAEL
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the
Airport?

FREDO
He had business at the hotel, but
He'll drop in for dinner.

From the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a
Discourtesy.

INT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955)

A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of
MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI. Great fuss is made. They are
Being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.

FREDO
You look wonderful, kid; really
Wonderful. That doctor did some
Job on your face.

MICHAEL
You look good, too.

They enter the suite.

FREDO
Nice, eh?

FREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the
Bellboys, waiters and maids.

FREDO
(hurrying into the bedroom)
Kid, take a look-see.

MICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom.

There is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform,
Mirrors to each side. FREDO points upward.

A VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.

FREDO
Ever seen anything like that before?

MICHAEL
(dryly)
No.

INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM (1955)

MICHAEL is alone in the bedroom. He is just finishing
Dressing; he puts on his jacket. From the window, with the
Lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night. MICHAEL
Passes into the other room.

He stops, looks. He is disturbed.

INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

A magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite;
A lavish table setting for eight. Standing by the table are
HAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier,
Beautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.
NERI stands quietly by the door.

FREDO
Mike! The party starting!

MICHAEL
Come here a minute, Fredo.

FREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.

MICHAEL
Who are those girls?

FREDO
(jokingly)
That's for you to find out.

MICHAEL
Give them some money and send them
Home.

FREDO
Mike!

MICHAEL
Get rid of them...

INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

They are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite.
MICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY.

MICHAEL
Johnny, the Corleone family is
Thinking of selling out all our
Interests in the Olive Oil business
And settling here. Moe Greene will
Sell us his interest so it can be
Wholly owned by friends of the
Family.

FREDDIE seems anxious.

FREDO
Mike, you sure about Moe selling.
He never mentioned it to me and he
Loves the business.

MICHAEL
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.

MICHAEL
Johnny, the Don wants you to help
Us get started. We figure
Entertainment will be the big
Factor in drawing gamblers. We
Hope you'll sign a contract to
Appear five times a year for maybe
A week long engagement.
We hope your friends in the movies
Will do the same. We count on you
To convince them.

JOHNNY
Sure, I'll do anything for my
Godfather. You know that, Mike.

There is knock on the door. NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL,
Who nods. NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters,
Followed by TWO BODYGUARDS. He is a handsome hood, dressed
In the Hollywood style. His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast
Style.

MOE
Mike, good to see you. Got
Everything you want?

MICHAEL
Thanks.

MOE
The chef cooked for you special;
The dancers will kick your tongue
Out and you credit is good!
(to his BODYGUARDS)
Draw chips for all these people so
They can play on the house.

MICHAEL
Is my credit good enough to buy you
Out?

MOE laughs.

MOE
Buy me out?...

MICHAEL
The hotel, the casino. The Corleone
Family wants to buy you out.

GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense. NERI eyes
The BODYGUARDS.

MOE
(furious)
The Corleone family wants to buy me
Out. I buy you out. You don't buy
Me out.

MICHAEL
Your casino loses money. Maybe we
Can do better.

MOE
You think I scam?

MICHAEL
(the worst insult)
You're unlucky.

MOE
You goddamn dagos. I do you a
Favor and take Freddie in when
You're having a bad time, and then
You try to push me out.

MICHAEL
You took Freddie in because the
Corleone family bankrolled your
Casino. You and the Corleone
Family are evened out. This is for
Business; name your price.

MOE
The Corleone family don't have that
Kind of muscle anymore. The
Godfather is sick. You're getting
Chased out of New York by Barzini
And the other families, and you
Think you can find easier pickings
Here. I've talked to Barzini; I
Can make a deal with him and keep
My hotel!

MICHAEL
(quietly, deadly)
Is that why you thought you could
Slap Freddie around in public?

FREDO
(his face turns red)
Ah Mike, that was nothing. Moe
Didn't mean anything. He flies off
The handle sometimes; but me and
Him are good friends. Right, Moe?

MOE
Yeah sure. Sometimes I gotta kick
Asses to make this place run right.
Freddie and I had a little argument
And I had to straighten him out.

MICHAEL
You straightened my brother out?

MOE
Hell, he was banging cocktail
Waitresses two at a time. Players
Couldn't get a drink.

MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:

MICHAEL
I have to go back to New York
Tomorrow. Think of your price.

MOE
You son of a bitch, you think you
Can brush me off like that? I made
My bones when you were going out
With cheerleaders.

FREDO
(frightened)
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you
Can talk to the Don and advise him.

MICHAEL
The Don has semi-retired. I'm
Running the Family business now.
So anything you have to say, say it
To me.

Nobody answers. MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door.
MOE exits angrily.

MICHAEL
Freddie, you're my older brother.
I love you. But don't ever take
Sides with anybody against the
Family again.

EXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955)

KAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark
AIRPORT. ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.

She has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who
Plays with a cardboard bird on a string.

Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have
Learned to tell are bodyguards.

MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO
PORTERS carrying luggage.

NERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.

MICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.

LAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and
MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son. Automatically,
The luggage is put in. NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver;
And LAMPONE joins the other men. HAGEN gets into one of the
Other cars.

And the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other
Sedans.

INT DAY: LIMO (1955)

The little BOY looks out the window as they drive.

MICHAEL
I have to see my father and his
People when we get back to the Mall.

KAY
Oh Michael.

MICHAEL
We'll go to the show tomorrow
Night--we can change the tickets.

KAY
Don't you want dinner first?

MICHAEL
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.

KAY
Wake me up when you come to bed?

The little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding
Limousine window.

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

The limousine arrives at the Mall. We are inside.

KAY
Your sister wants to ask you
Something.

MICHAEL
Let HER ask.

NERI opens the door. KAY wants to talk just a little more.

KAY
She's afraid to. Michael...

MICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment
Longer.

KAY
Why are you so cold to her and
Carlo? They live with us on the
Mall now, but you never get close
To them.

MICHAEL
I'm busy.

KAY
Connie and Carlo want you to be
Godfather to their little boy.

NERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.

He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.

KAY
Will you?

MICHAEL
Let me think about it, O.K.?

She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY
And the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955)

VIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size. He
Wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt. He sits in a
Chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.

TESSIO (O.S.)
Barzini's people chisel my territory
And we do nothing about it. Pretty
Soon there won't be one place in
Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

MICHAEL (O.S.)
Just be patient.

TESSIO
I'm not asking you for help, Mike.
Just take off the handcuffs.

MICHAEL (O.S.)
Be patient.

CLEMENZA (O.S.)
We gotta fight sometime. Let us at
Least recruit our regimes to full
Strength.

MICHAEL (O.S.)
No, I don't want to give Barzini an
Excuse to start fighting.

TESSIO (O.S.)
Mike, you're wrong.

CLEMENZA (O.S.)
Don Corleone...Don Corleone.

The OLD MAN looks up. CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.
Beside him is an anxious TESSIO. NERI stands by the door;
HAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.

CLEMENZA
You said there would come a day
When Tessio and me could form our
Own Families. Only with your
Benediction, of course. I ask
Permission...

DON CORLEONE
My son is head of the Family now.
If you have his permission, you
Have my good will.

MICHAEL
In six months you can break off
From the Corleone Family and go on
Your own. Carlo, I'm counting on
You to make the move to Nevada;
You'll be my right-hand man out
There. Tom Hagen is no longer the
Consigliere.

Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.
He remains inexpressive.

MICHAEL
He's going to be our lawyer in
Vegas. Nobody goes to him with any
Other business as of now, this
Minute. No reflection on Tom;
That's the way I want it. Besides,
If I ever need any advice, who's a
Better Consigliere than my father.

CLEMENZA
Then in a six month time we're on
Our own; is that it?

MICHAEL
Maybe less...

TESSIO
Let us fill up our Regimes.

MICHAEL
No. I want things very calm for
Another six months.

TESSIO
Forgive me, Godfather, let our
Years of friendship be my excuse.
How can you hope for success there
Without your strength here to back
You up? The two go hand in hand.
And with you gone from here the
Barzini and the Tattaglias will be
Too strong for us.

CLEMENZA
And I don't like Barzini. I say
The Corleone Family has to move
From strength, not weakness. We
Should build our Regimes and take
Back our lost territories in Staten
Island, at least.

DON CORLEONE
Do you have faith in my judgement?

CLEMENZA
Yes, Godfather...

DON CORLEONE
Then do what Michael says...

MICHAEL
All I can say is that things are
Being resolved that are more
Effective than a thousand buttonmen
On the streets. Understood?

There are uneasy looks all around.

CARLO
Understood. I just wish I was
Doing more to help out.

MICHAEL
I'll come to you when I need you.

He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN. They all nod,
Reluctantly.

MICHAEL
All right, then it's resolved.

NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.

CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,
Then CARLO. NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the
Corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.

Then NERI closes the door.

MICHAEL relaxes.

HAGEN
Mike, why are you cutting me out of
The action?

MICHAEL
Tom, we're going to be legitimate
All the way, and you're the legal
Man. What could be more important
Than that.

HAGEN
I'm not talking about that. I'm
Talking about Rocco Lampone building
A secret regime. Why does Neri
Report directly to you, rather than
Through me or a caporegime?

DON CORLEONE
I told you that it wouldn't escape
His eye.

MICHAEL
How did you find out?

HAGEN
Bookkeepers know everything.
Rocco's men are all a little too
Good for the jobs they're supposed
To be doing. They get a little
More money than the job's worth.
(pause)
Lampone's a good man; he's operating
Perfectly.

MICHAEL
Not so perfectly if you noticed.

HAGEN
Mike, why am I out?

MICHAEL
You're not a wartime Consigliere.
Things may get tough with the move
We're trying.

HAGEN
OK, but then I agree with Tessio.
You're going about it all wrong;
You're making the move out of
Weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and
If he tears you apart, the other
Families won't come running to help
The Corleones...

DON CORLEONE
Tom, I never thought you were a bad
Consigliere, I thought Santino a
Bad Don, rest in peace. He had a
Good heart but he wasn't the right
Man to head the family when I had
My misfortune. Michael has all my
Confidence, as you do. For reasons
Which you can't know, you must have
No part in what will happen.

HAGEN
Maybe I can help.

MICHAEL
(coldly)
You're out, Tom.

TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence. TOM
Leaves.

MICHAEL looks at NERI.

MICHAEL
I'm going to talk to my father.

NERI nods, and then leaves. The DON opens the doors,
Breathes in the air, and steps outside.

EXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)

DON CORLEONE
I see you have your Luca Brasi.

MICHAEL
I'll need him.

DON CORLEONE
There are men in this world who
Demand to be killed. They argue in
Gambling games; they jump out of
Their cars in a rage if someone so
Much as scratches their fender.
These people wander through the
Streets calling out ""Kill me, kill
Me."" Luca Brasi was like that.
And since he wasn't scared of
Death, and in fact, looked for
It...I made him my weapon. Because
I was the only person in the world
That he truly hoped would not kill
Him. I think you have done the
Same with this man.

They walk through the DON's vegetable garden. Tomatoes,
Peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.
MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him. Then
Stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.

DON CORLEONE
Barzini will move against you first.

MICHAEL
How?

DON CORLEONE
He will get in touch with you
Through someone you absolutely
Trust. That person will arrange a
Meeting, guarantee your safety...

He rises, and looks at Michael...

DON CORLEONE
...and at that meeting you will be
Assassinated.

The DON walks on further.

DON CORLEONE
Your wife and children...you're
Happy with them?

MICHAEL
Yes.

DON CORLEONE
Good.

MICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:

MICHAEL
I've always respected you...

A long silence. The DON smiles at MICHAEL.

DON CORLEONE
And I...you.

EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

KAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left
Them off.

KAY
How is your husband feeling?

MAMA
He's not the same since they shot
Him. He lets Michael do all the
Work. He just plays the fool with
His garden, his peppers, his
Tomatoes, as if he was some peasant
Still. But men are like that...

She stops toward the Church.

MAMA
You come in, too.

KAY shakes her head.

MAMA
The Priest ain't gonna bite you
Cause you're not Catholic.
(whispered)
He's in the back drinkin' his wine.

KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.
They enter.

INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from
The holy water.

MAMA
You can.

Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and
Blesses herself. Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in
Awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally
The Altar.

MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles. There is a
Large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting
Candles. MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives
Her some.

MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the
Taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great
Dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights
Twenty candles.

She finishes, and bows her head.

EXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME

Very few people in the streets. TOTAL SILENCE. But black
Flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.
An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.
Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King.

Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration. We show
These in detail; and the flowered messages: ""A Benefactor to
Mankind"", ""He Knew and Pitied""...""Our Don Our Leader""...""The
Sacred Heart""...

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

Silence.

The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill
All the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.

Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the
Wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is
Somber and respectful.

MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform
Which holds the ornate coffin. We cannot see the remains of
Don Corleone.

BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved
Family. One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely
With grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.

The VIEW ALTERS,

And we see that the line is endless. JOHNNY FONTANE, tears
Openly falling, takes his turn.

Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last
Look at the great man.

CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE. LAMPONE
Immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York
Families to pay their respects.

First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI. Then PHILIP
TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.

Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.

MICHAEL watches the scene.

BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined
By his men.

As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on
Him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear
From the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that
He is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don
Corleone.

MICHAEL watches silently.

BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes. First
CLEMENZA. Then TESSIO.

CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes. He
Embraces and comforts her.

Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching
All who come close to him.

EXT DAY: MALL (LATER)

Later on the Mall; some people have left, although there are
Still hundreds of mourners.

A young GIRL approaches TESSIO. She's about 18.

GIRL
Do you remember me?

TESSIO
No...

GIRL
We danced together at Connie's
Wedding.

TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown',
And they move though the crowd, looking for Michael. He
Finds him.

TESSIO
Mike, could I have a minute?

MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place. NERI is close
By.

TESSIO
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
Says we can straighten any of our
Problems out.

MICHAEL
He talked to you?

TESSIO
(nods)
I can arrange security.

MICHAEL looks at him.

EXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955)

The Cemetery. Late day.

The hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the
Stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in
Queens Village.

Hundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take
Pictures, etc.

MICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.

MICHAEL
(softly)
Christ, Tom; I needed more time
With him. I really needed him.

HAGEN
Did he give you his politicians?

MICHAEL
Not all...I needed another four
Months and I would have had them
All.
(he looks at TOM)
I guess you've figured it all out?

HAGEN
How will they come at you?

MICHAEL
I know now.
(a passion wells up
Inside of MICHAEL)
I'll make them call me Don.

HAGEN
Have you agreed on a meeting?

MICHAEL
(nods)
A week from tonight. In Brooklyn
On Tessio's ground, where I'll be
Safe.

HAGEN looks at him; understands.

MICHAEL
But after the Baptism. I've
Decided to stand as godfather to
Connie's baby.

They look up.

The coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which
Stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel,
With the bold inscription: CORLEONE.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

FADE IN:

INT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)

ALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he
Pulls a small trunk from under his bed. He opens it, and we
See in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's
Uniform. He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.
Then the badge, and the identification card; with his
Picture on it. Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he
Begins to dress.

INT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)

MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in
Their room. MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is
Beginning to take on a matronly look.

INT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)

In a Long Island motel.

ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it,
Checks it, and puts it back together.

EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)

PETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln. He hesitates,
Takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then
Gets in, drives off.

EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

The Church.

Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the
Church. They laugh and talk. A MONSIGNOR is officiating.
Not all of the participants have arrived yet.

CONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO. She holds the
Infant; showing him off to interested people.

EXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955)

NERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN
Building. He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a
Policeman. He carries a huge flashlight.

EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955)

LAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort
Motel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising
""ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY"".

INT DAY: CHURCH

The Church.

CONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and
MICHAEL stand side by side around the urn.

PRIEST
(to MICHAEL)
Do you pledge to guide and protect
This child if he is left fatherless?
Do you promise to shield him
Against the wickedness of the world?

MICHAEL
Yes, I promise.

EXT DAY: FIFTH AVE.

NERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area. He
Continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center. On
His side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly
Across from the main entrance of the building. Slowly he
Approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his
Nightstick.

The DRIVER looks up in surprise.

NERI points to the ""No Parking"" sign.

The DRIVER turns his head away.

NERI
OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or
You wanna move?

DRIVER
(obviously a hood)
You better check with your precinct.

NERI
Move it!

The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately,
And hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's
Jacket.

NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street. Then
He crooks a finger at the DRIVER.

NERI
Let me see you license and
Registration.

EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY

LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.
It parks. A young, pretty GIRL gets out. Quickly, he
Returns into the room.

INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel. He
Rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.

INT DAY: CHURCH

The Church. Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently
Applies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.

PRIEST
Ephetha...be opened...So you may
Perceive the fragrance of God's
Sweetness.

EXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955)

The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center
Is arguing with NERI.

Now the DRIVER looks up.

WHAT HE SEES:

TWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving
Glass doors.

NERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass
Doors. The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of
BARZINI within them.

INT DAY: CHURCH

In the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL. The PRIEST hands him
The infant.

PRIEST
Do you renounce Satan.

MICHAEL
I do renounce him.

PRIEST
And all his works?

MICHAEL
I do renounce them.

INT DAY: MOTEL MURDER (1955)

LAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down
The iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.
PHILIP TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a
Semi-nude young GIRL leans up.

They are riddled with gunfire.

INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

CLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with
His package.

INT DAY: CHURCH

The PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant
MICHAEL holds.

PRIEST
Do you wish to be baptized?

MICHAEL
I do wish to be baptized.

INT DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)

CLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.

He walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate
Elevator waiting shaft.

The lights indicate the elevator has arrived.

The doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with
The dapper MOE GREENE.

CLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.

The PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.

PRIEST
I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.

Flash bulbs go off. Everyone is smiles, and crowds around
MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO.

--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

The christening party outside the Church.

Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to
Receive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.

Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.

As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up. LAMPONE gets out
And works his way to MICHAEL. He whispers in his ear. This
Is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.

CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.

CONNIE
Kiss your Godfather.

The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an
Excuse to back away.

MICHAEL
Carlo...we've had a change in the
Plans. Mama, Connie, Kay and the
Kids will have to take the trip out
To Vegas without us.

CONNIE
Oh Mike, it's our first vacation
Together.

CARLO
(anxious to please)
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...

MICHAEL
Go back to your house and wait for
Me...

He kisses KAY.

MICHAEL
(to KAY)
I'll just be a couple of days...

People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to
Drive off.

INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN

TESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.

HAGEN enters.

HAGEN
You'd better make your call to
Barzini; Michael's ready.

TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.

TESSIO
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

He hangs up and smiles.

TESSIO
I hope Mike can get us a good deal
Tonight.

HAGEN
(gravely)
I'm sure he will.

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

The TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car. On their
Way they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.

BUTTON MAN
The boss says he'll come in a
Separate car. He says for you two
To go on ahead.

TESSIO
(frowning)
Hell, he can't do that. It screws
Up all my arrangements.

THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.

HAGEN
(gently)
I can't go with you either, Tessio.

He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he
Panics, and then he accepts it.

TESSIO
(after the pause)
Tell Mike it was business...I
Always liked him.

HAGEN
He understands that.

TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.

TESSIO
(softly)
Tom, can you get me off the hook?
For old times' sake?

HAGEN
I can't.

HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group. Then about
Twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.

TESSIO is led into a waiting car.

HAGEN looks away, and walks off.

INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

CARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather
Nervously. He moves to the window and looks out.

WHAT HE SEES:

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

MICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,
LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.

They move toward us.

Excitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.

He wears a broad smile.

CARLO
Godfather!

MICHAEL
You have to answer for Santino.

The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish
Attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and
Backs into the living room.

INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

The door opens, and the grim party enters.

MICHAEL
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini
People. That little farce you
Played out with my sister. Did
Barzini kid you that would fool a
Corleone?

CARLO
(dignity)
I swear I'm innocent. I swear on
The head of my children, I'm
Innocent. Mike, don't do this to
Me, please Mike, don't do this to me!

MICHAEL
(quietly)
Barzini is dead. So is Philip
Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo
And Moe Greene...I want to square
All the family accounts tonight.
So don't tell me you're innocent;
Admit what you did.

CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.

MICHAEL
(almost kindly)
Don't be frightened. Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow? Do you
Think I'd make your children
Fatherless? After all, I'm
Godfather to your son. No, your
Punishment is that you're out of
The family business. I'm putting
You on a plane to Vegas--and I want
You to stay there. I'll send
Connie an allowance, that's all.
But don't keep saying you're
Innocent; it insults my intelligence
And makes me angry. Who approached
You, Tattaglia or Barzini?

CARLO
(sees his way out)
Barzini.

MICHAEL
(softly)
Good, good. Leave now; there's a
Car waiting to take you to the
Airport.

CARLO moves to the door; opens it. There is a car waiting;
With a group of MEN around it.

He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.

MICHAEL
I'll call your wife and tell her
What flight you're on.

EXT DAY: MALL

CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his
Things in the trunk.

ONE opens the front door for him.

SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.

CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back
To see the other man.

It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.

The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA
Suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck. He chokes
And leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.

The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.

His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.

Then the body goes slack.

CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car
Drives off.

EXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955)

MICHAEL and his party. They watch.

Then he turns and walks off, and they follow.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

FADE IN:

INT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955)

MICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving.

They do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights
Flash by.

NERI turns back.

NERI
You know I would never question
Anything you say.

MICHAEL
(smiles)
Speak your mind.

NERI
I'll do this for you; you know I
Should.

MICHAEL
No. This I have to do.

EXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)

MICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an
Italian Pizzeria. NERI opens the door.

MICHAEL
Sit in the car.

INT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)

He walks alone into the restaurant. A MAN is tossing pizza
Dough in the air.

MICHAEL
Where's the boss?

MAN
In the back. Hey Frank, someone
Wants you.

A MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.

MAN
What is it?

He stops, frozen in fear. It is FABRIZZIO.

VIEW ON MICHAEL. Gunfire from under his coat. FABRIZZIO is
Cut down. MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

Several moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that
These are the final days; the families are moving out; signs
Indicating that the property is for sale are evident.

A black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped,
The rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out,
Restrained by MAMA. She manages to break free and runs
Across the Mall into Michael's house.

INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

Inside the Corleone house. Big boxes have been packed;
Furniture prepared for shipping.

CONNIE
Michael!

She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon
MICHAEL and KAY.

KAY
(comforting)
Connie...

But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL. NERI
Is watchful.

CONNIE
You lousy bastard; you killed my
Husband...

KAY
Connie...

CONNIE
You waited until our father died
And nobody could stop you and you
Killed him, you killed him! You
Blamed him about Sonny, you always
Did, everybody did. But you never
Thought about me, never gave a damn
About me.
(crying)
What am I going to do now, what am
I going to do.

TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders
From him. But he stands there, waiting for his sister to
Finish.

KAY
Connie, how could you say such
Things?

CONNIE
Why do you think he kept Carlo on
The Mall? All the time he knew he
Was going to kill my husband. But
He didn't dare while my father was
Alive. And then he stood Godfather
To our child. That coldhearted
Bastard.
(to KAY)
And do you know how many men he had
Killed with Carlo? Just read the
Papers. That's your husband.

She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria
She has no saliva.

MICHAEL
Get her home and get a doctor.

The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her,
Gently but firmly.

KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from
MICHAEL. He feels her look.

MICHAEL
She's hysterical.

But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.

KAY
Michael, it's not true. Please
Tell me.

MICHAEL
Don't ask me.

KAY
Tell me!

MICHAEL
All right, this one time I'll let
You ask about my affairs, one last
Time.

KAY
Is it true?

She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so
Directly that we know he will tell the truth.

MICHAEL
(after a very long pause)
No.

KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs
Him. Then she kisses him.

KAY
(through her tears)
We both need a drink.

INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)

She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the
Drinks. From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the
Drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the
House with their BODYGUARDS.

She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive
Them. He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one
Foot slightly behind the other. One hand on his hip, like a
Roman Emperor. The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.

CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.

CLEMENZA
Don Corleone...

The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her
Husband has become.

INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

KAY wears a shawl over her hand. She drops many coins in
The coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in
A pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles.

Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say?
Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay

And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on anyway, well

A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way

Now who get the party jumpin' like me
Who crunk it like me?
Lotta of guys here, but none is like me
Though some could try to be
With two or three chains up under the white tee
And I got two or three dames that's comin' tonight
See em, done tonight leave
Like one, aight peace
Only Mike puts up numbers like these
And he's no longer playin', but neither am I
So what I'm sayin' is hop in the deuce seater with I
'Cause you know with them boots and that beater you fly
Other dudes act to cheap with the pie
Won't drop a few pennies
Or cop you a guinea
But I'll cop you as many

Get to know each other later
Let's dance for now, c'mon

160,Burn,"[Intro]
Girl, I understand why
See, it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sending pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself calling her your name
Ladies, tell me do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Oh oh oh oh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burning 'til you return (let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (gotta let it burn), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn

[Bridge]
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, oooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on

But still somehow slowly
Goin' numb inside
I don't like who I'm becomin'
I know I've gotta do somethin'
Before my life passes right by
I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a
Beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a
Church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go
Down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be
Alone
Take everything that this
World has to give
I want to live
Sometimes I wonder
Why I work so hard to guard
My heart
Till I hardly feel anything at all
I've spent my whole life building
Up this ivory tower
And now that I'm in it, I keep
Wishin' it would fall
So I could feel the ground
Beneath me
Really taste this air I'm
Breathin'
And know that I'm alive
I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a
Beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a
Church bell ringin'

Down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be
Alone
Take everything that this
World has to give
I want to live
Somethin' deep inside
Keeps sayin'
Life is like a vapor
It's gone in just the
Twinklin' of an eye

Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a

Sing to the Heavens like a
Church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go
Down swingin'

Mile marker 203
The gas gauge leanin' on the edge of E
And I'll be danged if the rain ain't pouring down
There's something smoking underneath the hood
It's a bangin' and a clangin' and it can't be good
And it's another 50 miles to the nearest town
Everything I own's in the back in a Hefty bag
I'm outta cigarettes and I'm down to my last drag

[Chorus]
I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down here

[Verse 2]
Under fifty thousand miles ago
Before the bad blood and busted radio
You said I was all you'd ever need
But love is blind and little did I know
You were just another dead-end road
Paved with pretty lies and broken dreams
Baby, leaving you is easier than being gone
I don't know what I'll do if one more thing goes wrong

[Chorus]
I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down here

Oh, no...

[Chorus]
I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now

164,Somebody,"At a diner down on Broadway they make small talk
When she brings his eggs and fills his coffee cup
He jokes about his love life
And tells her he's about ready to give up
That's when she says, ""I've been there before
But keep on looking because maybe who you're looking for is""

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Across town in a crowded elevator
He can't forget the things that waitress said
He usually reads the paper
But today he reads a strangers face instead
It's that blue-eyed girl from two floors up
Maybe she's the one maybe he could fall in love with

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Now they laugh about the moment that it happened
A moment they'd both missed until that day
When he saw his future in her eyes
Instead of just another friendly face
And he wonders why he searched so long
When she was always there at that diner waiting on

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at

Nah, I ain't putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna
26-inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This heat gon last for the whole summer
Running your bitch faster than the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buying diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinning is your hair
Yeah, I'm riding with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
I'm 80's man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists getting wrong deals
I'm only 21, sitting on mills

(Ugh)
If you know anything about me, then you know I'm a baller
If I don't hit the first night, I ain't gon' call her
I'm trying to play, you trying to have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't putting no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't sparing a quarter
So cut the games ma, let's go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass 'round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when I'm riding through the town
Like 'em small, like 'em tall, like 'em black, like 'em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her

Well, I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
And I buy the bar a double round of  Crown
And everybody's getting down
An' this town ain't never gonna be the same

[Chorus:]
Cause I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy

Well I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and Bling-Blinging
While the girls are drinking
Long necks down!
And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
Or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town

And I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city

[Spoken:]
I'm a thourough-bred
That's what she said
In the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road
We where flying high
Fine as wine, having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go

But her evaluation
Of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation
All night long
So I took her out giggin frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Wilie Nelson song I could think of
And we made love

And I saddled up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy

So I changed, huh? You got a phone
Pick it up, call me

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We were so young so full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succame to yours
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it your cold your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment I can sense it and I don't like it

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more, and you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all, and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more

It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
'Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first
For I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with I woulda hit it and quit
But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her you would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her stumbling half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fucking other niggas musta hurt your pride or something
Cause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your man and lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth
Don't hate the game or the player the one that's changing is you

It gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube

Like my finger get to snapping and poof it just happen

Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
(HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you play, you look away

You're the fire that keeps me warm
How will I get through this storm?
At night, I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through
I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love

Brooklyn's Bad Boy back again
Feet hit the ground running and my back's to the wind
Angels on my shoulders, head in the clouds
No I'm not rapping I'm just thinking out loud
My karma's my armor, my charm and wit
Is like a leather bomber, I'm warm and shit
And I did bad for good but when you're trapped in the hood
You do worse for less, homie earth's a test
Only God can judge me, my heart isn't ugly
But the thoughts that I drop is heavy, try to budge me
Momma loved me, Pop left me
Still the homies call me Lucky Lefty
I'm flashy and deadly, deceptively smart
I make hustling heaven and pimping an art
Long as I know that I'm blessed and I'm loved in depth
I can walk through water and not get wet, I'm that fresh!

See I rep the most high, still I'm the most fly
Win so much, they wanna know who I'm coached by
Everyday approached by chicks when I was on top
Wanna give me sosa, but I'm like don't try
I see the hisses and the disses when I go by
But see the misses on my wristses when I float by
Self control, and I can't tell you no lie
Tryin' to find a soulmate, you end up being so tired
I make my money man without the coca
Livin' the vida without the loca
I'm down south so they show me country love
And I ain't even country thug
The people give me daps and hugs, so it must be love
And I love the country grub
It feel good to hear people singing welcome back
And I ain't even sellin' the track, cause I'm that Harlem cat

[Hook x2]
See the names have all changed since I been around
But the game ain't the same since I left out
Ooh you know we need ya, ooh you know we need ya
Right here's where we need ya, right here's where we need ya

Tell me what I have to do tonight

I'm sorry for the way I lost my head
I don't know why I said the things I said
Let's be us again

Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in

Oh us again

Look at me, I'm way past pride
Isn't there some way that we can try
To be us again
And even if it takes a while
I'll wait right here until I see that smile
That says we're us again

Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range

Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming ""my, my, my, my""
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me I can mold your life

And I love it when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me and have a brother going ""oh-oh""
Girl I love how you roll me right
I can make you a celebrity overnight

Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?

The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight

[Bridge: Twista]
You see, see baby girl
You see how you make a brother break down
I just gotta ask you, what you need
What you need from me, oh you wanna be a star
Are you messing with the right one
I can take you there, I can make sure
You've got all the finest things
Let me be your manager

Come here girl, I could see you bored
Tell you you're the queen that I see you for
Take you shopping on sprees in stores
I'mma get you to the MTV awards
We about to do a show tonight
You looking good girl, show you right
Take you places I know you like
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Come here girl, you could hang if you bored
We could do plenty things plus more

Teen drinking is very bad
Yo, I got a fake ID though
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, two step with me, two step with me

[Verse 1]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two to the one
Homeboy trippin', he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, man, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga, you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hun
While she goin' down, I'm braggin' on what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch, give it back, now you don't get none

[Verse 2]
Two, here comes the three to the four to the five
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass, now I'm lookin' at her thighs
While she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl, you twenty-one? Girl, that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' with them fries
If so, baby, can I get 'em super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three to the two
She started feelin' on my Johnson right out the blue
Girl, you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do

[Verse 3]
Three, here comes the four to the five to the six
Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
Yes, single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me, man, son of a bitch
Brushed it-it off, now I'm back to gettin' lit
With some orange juice, man, this some good ish
Homeboy trippin' 'cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique
Here comes the five to the four to the three
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me

Comes creeping on so haunting every time

The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

'Cause my farm ain't fat
So what's up with that?
I've got friends and family that I respect
When I think I'm too good, they put me in check
So believe when I say I'm no better than you
Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true
Like that, y'all, and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock

[Chorus]
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this muthafucking party out

[Verse 4: Mike D]
I said, ""Doc, what's the condition?
I'm a man that's on a mission""
He said, ""Son, you'd better listen
Stuck in your ass is an electrician""
Like a scientist
Mmm, when I'm applying this
Method of controlling my mind
Like Einstein and the Rapping Duke combined

[Verse 5: Ad Rock]
Now, hey, baby bubba, now what's the deal?
I didn't know you go for that mass appeal
Some call it salugi, some hot potato
I stole your mic, but you won't see it later
'Cause I work magic like a magician
I add up, the mathematician
I'm a bank cashier, engineer
I wear cotton and I don't wear sheer

[Verse 6: MCA]
Shazam and abracadabra
In the whip, I'm gonna cruise past ya
Yo, money, don't chump yourself
Put that shit back on the shelf
Light rays blazing, you're out of phase, and my crew's amazing
We're working on the record, yo, so just stay patient

[Verse 7: Ad Rock]
Now, I go by the name of the King Ad-Rock
I don't wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre
Like Miss Piggy (Who, moi?)
I am the one with the clientele
You say, ""Ad-Rock, you rock so well""
I've got class like pink champale
MCA, grab the mic before the mic goes stale

[Verse 8: MCA]
Don't test me, they can't arrest me
I'll fake right, cross-over and shoot lefty
You look upset, yo, calm down
You look like Cable Guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney
You never been me
You wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip-hop, B

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Get your clothes right out the dryer
Put Armor All up on your tire
Sport that fresssssh attire
Tonight we goin' out, set the town on fire
Set the town ablaze
Gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head and say ""those were the days""

[Verse 1]
It's hard growin' up lookin' at drug dealers wit' all this paper
Wonderin' how I can get me some
My family's strugglin', I'm buggin', sittin' on my porch
So confused, chewin' on some bubblegum
I was always taught to use my manners with the misses
But please, stay away from the hoes and snitches
And I was always reached for the sky, I dont know why
Ima little bitty kid wit' a whole buncha gangsta wishes
When I grow up, you just wait, Ima be so straight
And everything's gonna be so marvelous
No more borrowin' from the neighbors, no more haters
No more blowin' Nintendo cartridges
Ima have it made in the shade, Ima be so paid
And my fam, get 'em off that payin' them bills
Matta fact Im schemin' my way on up out this hood, I'll be good
When I ditch these trainin' wheels

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm sick and tired of ridin' public transportation
Been patient waitin' on my set of wheels
I'm willin' to do what it takes, whatever the stakes
In order to get myself some dollar bills
It's too many holes in my socks, and I'm ready to box
Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes
And I ain't the only one trippin', or makin a fuss
My older cousin need some cheddar too
He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick
It involves that local corner store
I overheard him say he knew who works there
And whatever they do, dont let the owner know
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change
At least for the summer
And if he dont let me borrow nothin, but ask me what I want
Ima tell him I wanna...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Why can't I walk with a limp mama? won't be no drama
For goodness sakes, Im just a kid
Had to get my whoopin' in fo's, I was just a po'
Like there no remorse for what I did
Gotta learn the hard way, when runnin' them streets
How some just creep, really just to eat a meal
""I coulda swore it was mine,"" what I used to tell the po-pos
What I left to rob and steal
Man, I gotta earn for a livin', ain't nobody givin' me nothin'
Find somethin' I love to do
Hmm, what about that pimpin'? It's good tippin'
Tax free, and I know a lot of people that love to screw
Yeah, it's just a way of the world, with boys and girls
I'm adjustin' to my environment
This government cheatin' us, so I'll cheat 'em back
Why can't work feel like retirement?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair.""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this.""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon

Ah shit, y'all done fucked up and let me in this bitch
I'm just your average hood nigga with dreams of gettin' rich
(But you don't hear me)
My crib big like a football field (football field)
You might fuck around and think I signed a football deal
(But you don't hear me)
I take 15 minutes to drop a track (yeah)
I take half a minute to load my gat
(But you don't hear me)
I make 'em bounce all across the globe
I'm a pimp, I got your hoe takin' off her clothes
(But you don't hear me)
A franchise like a Houston Rocket (Houston Rocket)
Every eight months is when I usually drop it
(But you don't hear me)
I got the streets on lock, I like my beats with knock
You know my heat stay cocked, niggaaaaa

Look, I'm a Cristal nigga and you a red-winer
You just an opening act, but I'm the headliner

I'm 'bout to ship 3 mill' off top
You got your deal off your man, I got my deal off props
(But you don't hear me)
I'm connected like Dub and Mack 10 with ice cubes in my watch
And dubs on the black Benz
(But you don't hear me)
I'm getting' paid 'cause I do all the work
It's rainy days if we don't move all our work, we go berserk
(But you don't hear me)
I'm on the block fam, in the cream drop Lam
Most of y'all cats with deals, y'all ain't hot man

I'm 'bout to do it again, you 'bout to lose it again
It's show and tell motherfucker, I'm a prove it again

The game over, 'cause shit about to change over
It's 'bout time 'cause hip-hop need a make over
(But you don't hear me)
If most producers want to charge too much
But around my way that's how you get fucked up
(But you don't hear me)
You might think we all beats and rhymes
But way before this rap shit, nigga, the streets was mine

That get hot shit, that B.I.G. ""Ready to Die"" shit

After the hoping and the praying and the wishing
Girl your right here in my face
I never been the one to bite my tongue, no, no...
I have not one word to say
I'm mesmerized by your sexy eyes and
Your soft and lovely skin
I want this fiasco to end
So baby we can start all over again

(Listen)
(I wanna be able...) I wanna be able to love you, oh I...
(I wanna be able...) And let me be the one to please you, oh I...
As sure as the sun shines all over the earth

See, I'm a man and we make mistakes
But please don't take your love away, oh I...

Baby don't take your love away from me I need you girl (From me, my baby, baby)
Don't take your love away, baby

(Verse II)
Mama said, 'Don't put your hands in the cookie jar.'
She said, 'Son, have control.'
She said everything that's sweet and good for you, NO. (That what she said.)
And everything that glitters ain't gold
And now that your gone, I realized, (Yes, I do.) I've lost my soul. (Preach.)
And I don't want to pass the torch
Baby can you give me one more, one more, chance?

(I wanna be able) Able to do everything I didn't do before for ya, baby
(I wanna be able) Listen. I wanna love ya, over, over and over again
Gotta hold myself together and stay strong
Baby, you been gone too long
See, I'm a man and we make mistakes
So baby, baby, baby, don't take your love away

See, girl I know that I hurt you so, (Girl, I know...)
With all of those girls that were in my world. (In my world.)
Now Stacy and Kim, damn all of them
Girl, I wanna give you everything I can. (Every day, yeah.)
I know your tired of my game, (Of my games...) tired of my lies, (Of my lies...)
Baby, this time I promise it'll be alright
No longer will you be left astray, (No, no, no, no, no.)
Baby, listen to the words I say!

(Chorus)
Don't take your love away (Yeah, yeah!)
Baby, don't take your love away from me, I need you girl. (Yes, Don't take your love, no.)
Don't take your love away, (I've been searching here and there, everywhere,)
Don't take your love away. (And can't find no one like you, girl.)
Don't take your love away, (Don't take your love away.)

[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
""Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.""
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!""
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 2]
Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 3]
Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?

He was sittin' there, his brush in hand
Painting waves as they danced, upon the sand
With every stroke, he brought to life
The deep blue of the ocean, against the mornin' sky
I asked him if he only painted ocean scenes
He said for twenty dollars, I'll paint you anything

[Chorus]
Could you paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she'll be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

[Verse 2]
He looked at me, with knowing eyes
Then took a canvas from a bag there by his side
Picked up a brush, and said to me
Son, just where in this picture would you like to be
I said if there's any way you can
Could you paint me back into her arms again

[Chorus]
Could you paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned

Put her there in the front yard swing

I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
‘Cause I'm like the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because…

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So I get off stage, right, drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
""Sup? Ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
And by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
‘Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude! I just think you're trying to steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
‘Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me, because these…

But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands

Dude!
Give me this mic!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay (& Kon Artis)]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you?
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift (Oh, I thought you were Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with our dressing room?!
‘Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap, it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryin' to get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back

[Verse 3: Kuniva, Kon Artis, & (Eminem)]
Look at Em's little punk ass thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself taking all the flicks
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
(No, I had an interview, not you two)
You gon' be late for soundcheck, man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up and his always sound best!
You know what, man? I'ma say something
Ayo Em! (You got somethin' to say?!) Man, nothin'!
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up!
You ain't even back me up when we supposed to be crew
Man, I was 'bout to talk right after you, I swear
Aww, man, whatever I swear, man!

But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 4: Proof & (Eminem)]
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Ayo, it's…) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey, dude, I love your band!)
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
(Proof, carry my bag!) Bitch, carry your own!
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
God damn it, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artis slipped me some crack
""Lose Yourself"" video – I was in the back
""Superman"" video – I was in the back
For the media I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall! Ask us the questions!
Like ""Who's D12? How we get started?""
(But what about Eminem?) Bitch, are you retarded?!
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12! I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne

Girl, why can't you see you're the only one for me?
And it just tears my ass apart
To know that you don't know my name

But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall!)

Watchin' the clouds roll by
Bye, bye (Bye, bye)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I can hear this old earth shoutin'
Through the trees, as the wind blows
That's when I climb up here on this mountain
To look through God's window
Now I can't fly, but I got two feet
To get me high up here
Above the noise and city streets
My worries disappear

Sometimes I dream I'm drivin' down an old dirt road (Down an old dirt road)

You're the only one who
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams
You're the only one who
Knows exactly what I mean

And I probably forgot to tell you this
Like that time when I forgot to tell you about the scar
Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel?
See you're not what I expected
But you're the only one who knows how to handle me
And you're such a great kisser and I know that you agree

[Chorus]

I hope you can forgive me for that time
When I put my hand between your legs
And said it was small
Cuz its really not at all
I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down
Just to keep you around
Cuz the day that you realize how amazing you are
You're gonna leave me

You're the only one who
Holds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick
You're the only one who
Knows exactly what I mean

I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright
As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

[Chorus]
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

[Verse 2]
I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

[Chorus]
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

[Verse 3]
Someday I'm going to run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm going to be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

[Chorus]
So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Because we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better

Being I can't go to jail cause them years'll cost me

Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
Think how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over Customs
Never underestimate niggas, or over trust them
Uh...yeah them M's is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the Tech will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray

I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't shake the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what

The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, that time is over

Puttin purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwin them nicks

All you shootin is the breeze, a bootleg uzi

Into something else that'll make something melt

Don't make me put your heart in your lap

Hop out lookin crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little acting
Now that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip drip drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks - thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them
Something to remember, yell out
Timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho

Come on lady, dance all around me

Oooh cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, whoo!

But “got it” just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is “Nothing is forever”
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?

Chasing fireflies by the creek
Kissing Gabby Williams' sister
On the porch homecoming week

With rusted cars and weeping willows
Keeping watch out in the yard

Could be anywhere you are

In Carolina or in Georgia
Open arms are waiting for you

Eleven coffees, Ricki Lake on play

Erased your number from my telephone
And if you call me I won't be at home

Oh, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Hope life's been good to you
Since you've been gone
I'm doing fine now — I've finally moved on

I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst, and I feel so alive

Would she like to explore the world of I we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, Mama looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about this girls style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual, walks through the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinking smart
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, crush and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up (brrring)
We could talk, conversate about political subjects, whatever thoughts
So I zoomed off (car noise)

It was her in the shower (what did she say?)
She said I couldn't do without you

I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please
While you're looking up at me
You're like my favourite damn disease

And I love the places that we go
And I love the people that you know
And I love the way you can't say no
Too many long lines in a row
I love the powder on your nose

[Chorus]
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)

[Verse 3]
I like the freckles on your chest
And I like the way you like me best
And I like the way you're not impressed
While you put me to the test
I like the white stains on your dress

[Verse 4]
And I love the way you pass the check
And I love the good times that you wreck
And I love your lack of self-respect
While you're passed out on the deck
I love my hands around your neck

And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm loving how you look in my eyes, swanging them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tattooed on that ass, baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple, but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (what?)
She got me feeling like, maybe she the wrong woman
Think I'ma be chasing a chickenhead, you're on something
Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I'll have you doing what you said that you won't do
Make a decision shorty, good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keeps showing me that thong
Before I head home I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Lately she's been frustrated with the baller, wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her
It gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know that we friends and nutting more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hitting the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm sticking and moving, cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call my by my government name
Her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?
Surrounding me, hounding me, trying to be my ON-LY
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your HO-MIE

[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Yeah..
Don't know what fuck me up more: watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips, man
I sweet talk her if she like
'Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?
Look, I'm legit now, I used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours (wooo!)
Big house, big Benz - girl it's yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't got to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you
'Cause it means somebody's gon' hate you that never saw you
Come here, let me touch on you, I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you, and you can ride on
We can do it all tonight, we can have a ball tonight

259,Last Train Home,"To every broken heart in here
Love was once a part, but now it's disappeared
She told me that it's all part of the choices that you make
Even when you think you're right, you have to give to take

But there's still tomorrow
Forget the sorrow
And I can be on the last train home
Watch it pass the day
As it fades away
No more time to care
No more to time today

But we sing
If we're going nowhere
Yeah we sing
If it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to ever fall in love

I wonder if you're listening
Picking up on the signals
Sent back from within
Sometimes it feels like I don't really know what's going on
Time and time again it seems like everything is wrong in here

But there's still tomorrow
Forget the sorrow
And I can be on the last train home
Watch it pass the day
As it fades away
No more time to care
No more to time today

But we sing
If we're going nowhere
Yeah we sing
If it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to ever fall in love

But we sing if we're going nowhere
Yeah we sing if it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to ever fall in love

But we sing
If we're going no where

Until it died

And solitaire it the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again
And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day
A lonely day
So much to say
That goes unspoken

And through the night
His sleepless nights
His eyes are closed
His heart is broken

And solitaire it the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again
And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope
Goes up in smoke
Just how it goes
Goes without saying

Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
This is such an art, where do I begin-a?
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fire
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin'
To look sexy, but even if she was, so what?
Motherfucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt
But that let's me know that she's a human being
And being human's hard—on the boulevard
Girl, you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm André, Benjamin André to be exact
You'd hope to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that
In fact, Dookie introduced us at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the Southern states, you know, where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes, you're getting booed if your shit do not get down
And yes, you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks

And floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry
And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love
That have to say goodbye

And as I float along this ocean
I can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let me go

And you make everything alright
And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way when you are here

[Verse 2]
And every word I didn't say that caught up in some busy day
And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't have before
And every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all up in a kiss
And pick you up in all of this when I sail away

[Chorus]
While I float along this ocean
I can feel you like a notion that I hope will never leave
Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright
And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way when you are here

[Verse 3]
Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead
Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly
But with you I can spread my wings
To see me over everything that life may send me
When I am hoping it won't pass me by

And when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me
There you are to show me

292,F**k It (I Don't Want You Back),"INTRODUCTION

99 Problems is a song by Jay-Z.[1] It’s a good song. It was a big hit in 2004.[2] I’m writing about it now because it’s time we added it to the canon of criminal procedure pedagogy. In one compact, teachable verse (Verse 2), the song forces us to think about traffic stops, vehicle searches, drug smuggling, probable cause, and racial profiling, and it beautifully tees up my favorite pedagogical heuristic: life lessons for cops and robbers. And as it turns out, I’m not late to the game after all: Jay-Z recently published a well-received volume of criticism and commentary that includes his own marginal notes on Verse 2 of 99 Problems.[3]

When I teach the Fourth Amendment, I ask my students what the doctrines tell us about, on the one hand, how to catch bad guys and not risk suppression, and on the other, how to avoid capture or at least beat the rap if not the ride[4]. I’m always happy to tell my own stories, but the song struck me as the perfect teaching tool. All the students know it, and importantly for pedagogical purposes, it gets some things right—and some things very wrong.

It turns out that, while some other law professors have noticed 99 Problems, no one has yet provided a detailed, accurate analysis of the Fourth Amendment issues Verse 2 raises.[5] In this Essay, I remedy that deficiency in the literature. This is, after all, one of the most popular songs of the last decade[6], and we should seize the opportunity to use it in our teaching. My audience, accordingly, is primarily teachers and students of criminal procedure, but I hope that my comments may be of some interest to cops and perps as well.

II. ANALYSIS
A. Line 1
The year is ‘94, and in my trunk is raw... Jay-Z was transporting drugs in his car, like many of the protagonists who populate the core cases of Fourth Amendment law.[8] Unlike most of them, he gets away with it. Jay-Z says that the story in 99 Problems describes a real incident. In 1994, Jay-Z was dealing crack in New York City and was expanding to other markets.[9] As he puts it, “New York guys had better connects and opened up drug markets down the I-95 corridor.”[10] Drug prices increase with distance from importation zones, and New York was a key transshipment hub, so presumably he was able to offer better product and prices to smaller regional markets.[11]

For several reasons, the transportation of illegal drugs has produced a veritable cornucopia of Fourth Amendment case law.[12] Retail sales are often conducted either inside, or via drop points, making them—if done competently—relatively difficult to police. And even if you do a buy-and-bust with an undercover wearing a wire, retail transactions are still small potatoes. Sentences increase with quantity; retail-sale busts don’t get you promotions and press conferences. Wholesale loads in transit, on the other hand, are pure gold, both for the dealer and for the cops and prosecutors who want to bust him. At one hundred milligrams of cocaine per street dose of crack, a twenty kilo wholesale load of powder cocaine[13] is 200,000 potential street sales of crack.[14] That’ll get you your Lambo, or your press conference, respectively.

Most importantly, it has to be transported, on public roads, in a vehicle. And vehicles, as it happens, present far more opportunities for searching—as a matter of law and practice—than houses or people.[15] So it’s no wonder that the recent history of Fourth Amendment law is so full of cases about stopping cars and searching them for drugs. As the joke goes, “you look for your keys where the light is.”[16] There’s a lot of Fourth Amendment law packed into the simple question: When can you use a traffic stop to search for drugs?

Jay-Z says that, in the actual incident, the drugs were concealed in a hidden compartment built into the sunroof of the car.[17] In the video, the drugs are in three briefcases in the trunk, and the stop occurs on a surface street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, in Brooklyn.[18] As he suggests both in the book and in the song, he was probably targeted by the New Jersey police for fitting a drug courier profile.[19] Law students have to learn the hard lesson that racial profiling does not give rise to a Fourth Amendment suppression claim if there was objective probable cause for the stop.[20] For example, suppose a police department systematically pulled over every black driver who exceeded the speed limit, while letting all the white speeders go. If contraband was legitimately found in a black driver’s car during the stop, he would not have a suppression claim based on the fact that the department systematically targeted black drivers. Those claims do have remedies—Fourteenth Amendment remedies—and most importantly, political remedies. They don’t, however, have Fourth Amendment remedies, which means there won’t be any suppression. The U.S. Supreme Court made this explicit in Whren v. United States back in 1996: if there is objective probable cause for a stop, the courts may not inquire into the officer’s subjective motivation as a basis for a Fourth Amendment suppression claim.[21]

B. Lines 3–4
In my rearview mirror... I got two choices... The calculation Jay-Z has to make is whether, knowing that the car contains concealed contraband, he’s better off trying to flee or hoping that the police won’t find the drugs during the stop. This may be the hardest choice perps face (until they have to decide whether or not to cooperate), but there’s only one answer: you are always better off having drugs found on you in a potentially illegal search than you are fleeing from a potentially illegal search and getting caught. The flight will provide an independent basis for chasing and arresting you, and the inadequacy of the quantum of suspicion supporting the initial attempted seizure will not taint the contraband discovered if there is an intervening flight.[22] Law students: practice explaining the preceding sentence to a layperson. Smugglers, repeat after me: you have to eat the bust, and fight it in court.

C. Line 5
I ain’t trying to see no highway chase with jake... “Jake” is the cops,[23] and Jay-Z’s narrator is making a prudential business decision here. Highspeed chases are almost always bad for the perp. If you’re caught after a highspeed chase, you can be certain that the police will impound the car, run a dog over it, and search it thoroughly. So if you’re going to run, you’d better either get away or ditch your load mid-chase. But the latter is dicey, because your load will likely be found,[24] and you’ll have no suppression remedy because you abandoned it before you were technically seized.[25] And it’s not an option at all if the load is in the trunk or a concealed compartment where you can’t get at it.

You’re also not likely to get away. The Supreme Court recently held that the Fourth Amendment permits the use of deadly force to terminate high-speed chases.[26] In that case, the suspect fled from an ordinary traffic stop, the police chased him, and when he still didn’t stop, the police rammed him from behind at over eighty-five miles an hour, sending his car spinning off the road and into a tree, killing him.[27] The Court watched the dashboard camera video and pronounced the response reasonable.[28]

Here you have to know the local rules, because some jurisdictions have banned high-speed chases as a matter of policy. Washington, D.C., for example, did so after two children were killed by a driver being chased by police.[29] In those jurisdictions, the cops will take your plates and come find you later.[30] They’ll still find you, of course, but you’d probably have time to get the contraband out of the car and hide or discard it. Then you’d avoid the trafficking bust, and you would just have to eat a reckless endangerment charge for the flight itself. And even better for the perp, if the car or the plates are stolen, you might get clean away.

But Jay-Z didn’t have a stolen car or plates (“all my papers legit”), the New Jersey State Police are not a no-chase department, and he was on an interstate.[31] They would have chased him, and even if he had been able to open the sunroof compartment and throw the load out, it would likely have been found. The better business decision was to stay cool.

D. Line 6
I got a few dollars I can fight the case... Staying cool is easier to do, of course, if you have a few dollars to hire a good attorney. If you’re going to get an overworked public defender or a bottom-feeding court lurker who’ll just try to get you to take a quick plea, then bouncing on the double starts to look more attractive, even given the considerations discussed above. Jay-Z had money, he could get a good lawyer, he made the right choice.

Jay-Z is also betting that there’s no dog on scene. He can perhaps see in his rearview mirror that the cruiser behind him is not a canine unit, and he knows that dog units are few and far between in any event. And he knows that, without a dog sniff, there will be no probable cause for a search. To search a vehicle, an officer must have probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband or evidence of a crime.[32] At this point, the only probable cause the officer has is the speeding offense. The compartment is concealed, and there’s nothing in plain view, so no search is going to permissibly occur, unless the officer arrests Jay-Z for the traffic offense and impounds the car.[33] Jay-Z is assuming the officer won’t do that, because it’s a big hassle and an embarrassment if the car turns up clean.[34]

If there’s no dog on scene, the law here is clear: prolongation of the stop to wait for a dog unit to arrive will trigger suppression.[35]

E. Line 7
So I pull over... At this point, Jay-Z has been seized, for purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis, because he has submitted to a show of police authority.[36] He has thus preserved his Fourth Amendment claims. If you are stopped illegally and want to fight it later, you have to submit to the show of authority.[37] In this case, if the police find the contraband, he’ll be able to challenge it in court. Smart decision here by Jay-Z.

F. Line 8
Do you know what I’m stopping you for? This is an important part of any traffic-stop colloquy that should be memorialized by the prudent driver, ideally on a cell phone, unless you are (unluckily) in one of the thirteen states that require two-party consent for audio recording.[38] Neither New York nor New Jersey is on the list, so Jay-Z could record the stop, both the real one and the one in the video. His West Coast rivals are not so lucky, however: California is a two-party consent state.[39] Memorialization of the stated basis for the stop is important because the government must be able to show that the stop was based on probable cause, and you’ll be able to put the cop on the stand. So if you later develop evidence that you were not in fact doing what the officer said you were at the time, the officer will either have to fight the evidence, or else come up with a different basis for the stop, in which case he’ll have to contradict his contemporaneous explanation. This can happen, and judges find it most displeasing.[40]

G. Lines 9–10
Cause I’m young and I’m black and my hat’s real low? At the time the song takes place, the New Jersey State Police had an active “drug courier profiling” program[41] that would absolutely have included the observable facts here: Jay-Z was: (1) young, (2) male, (3) black, (4) wearing attire favored by drug dealers (the hat way down low), (5) driving an expensive car (in the video), (6) traveling on I-95 (the primary route for bringing drugs into and out of the city).[42] Such profiles are of questionable validity as the sole basis for a stop,[43] but there is no constitutional reason why they cannot inform an officer’s subjective determination to stop someone if there is objective probable cause for the stop (for example, speeding). The Supreme Court has answered this question definitively: pretext is not a basis for Fourth Amendment suppression if there is objective probable cause.[44]

I don’t know... Smart response for two reasons. First, it allows you to make a record of the officer’s asserted basis for the stop. Second, it doesn’t admit any misconduct. There’s no need whatsoever to blurt out, “Sorry, officer, I know I was speeding!”

H. Line 11
Am I under arrest...? A great question, and an important one for any future suppression claim. As new lawyers learn (to their dismay), there is no constitutional problem with arresting someone for a traffic violation, no matter how minor.[45] And if you are arrested for a traffic violation, your car can be impounded and then searched to inventory its contents, without a warrant and without any level of suspicion that the car contains contraband.[46] Your person, clothing, and bags can also be searched with no required quantum of suspicion.[47] On the other hand, if you are not under arrest, the police need probable cause to search the car. So if the cop tells you you’re not under arrest, and then proceeds to search the car, you will be able to suppress any contraband if you can show that there was no probable cause for the search. Here again, documentation will be important.[48]

I. Line 12
You was doing fifty-five in a fifty-four... All drivers—not just those smuggling drugs—have reason to complain about what they see as arbitrary speed enforcement. Drive down a highway with a marked limit of sixty-five, and you’ll see that virtually every car is speeding. The cultural norm we learn as drivers is that anything within ten miles per hour of the posted limit is okay.[49] But as a matter of law—which is what matters for the suppression issue—if you’re even one mile per hour over, that’s sufficient to pull you over, write you a ticket, and, if the officer chooses, to arrest you.[50] Neither arbitrariness nor pretextual motive is relevant to the validity of the stop if it is based on probable cause that you were in fact violating the traffic law.[51] Jay-Z explains the line as “another way of saying that we’re being pulled over for no good reason.”[52]As numerous commentators have observed, the number and scope of traffic regulations is so extensive that the police can in practice find a perfectly legitimate traffic-law basis for stopping any car they choose, just by following it for a few blocks.[53]

J. Lines 13–15
Step out of the car... We now turn to the suspect’s interaction with the officer during a traffic stop. In the song, Jay-Z’s protagonist refuses the cop’s order to get out: “I ain’t stepping out of shit . . .” In the video, he remains in the car and the cop backs off. Well, this is a basic question, the sort a criminal lawyer can answer: Does a driver actually have the right to refuse an order to exit the vehicle during an ordinary traffic stop? Unfortunately for drivers, the answer here is an unequivocal “no,” straight from the Supreme Court: “[O]nce a motor vehicle has been lawfully detained for a traffic violation, the police officers may order the driver to get out of the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendment’s proscription of unreasonable searches and seizures.”[54]

So the order to step out of the car is per se lawful; the lack of suspicion of anything beyond the traffic offense is irrelevant. Indeed, in Mimms, the case just quoted, the government conceded that there was no suspicion of any kind other than the traffic violation, and that it was simply the officer’s “practice” to order the driver out of the car whenever he made a traffic stop.[55]

Are you carrying a weapon...? Here, things get even worse for the drug smuggler. Terry v. Ohio [56] allows for a weapons patdown any time legitimate police activity puts an officer in close proximity to someone, if the officer has “reasonable suspicion” that the person may be armed and dangerous.[57] Reasonable suspicion is less than probable cause, and courts tend to allow the usual “training and experience” boilerplate, so long as there are specific, articulable facts that give rise to the suspicion.[58] A later case, Michigan v. Long, [59] extended the Terry rationale to vehicle stops, allowing for a “frisk” of the car itself—that is, a search of the car for readily available weapons. The rationale there is that if the person is a criminal, he might well grab a gun and shoot you when you let him back into his vehicle after patting him down.[60]

I know a lot of you are... Jay-Z comments that this “is another statement with racial overtones that he [the cop] and I are both aware of.”[61] Yes, indeed: race is always lurking in the background of the reasonable suspicion determination. You’re not going to put it right in your report, but it’s always there. On the facts of this song, I would say that most courts would find reasonable suspicion, primarily based on the suspect’s age, his gender, his attire, his vehicle, and the location: all the officer would have to say is: “I had reasonable suspicion that the suspect could be involved in drug trafficking, and based on my training and experience, I know that drug traffickers habitually carry weapons.”[62] Here’s an illustration I show my students, from a law enforcement message board. It’s one cop’s analysis of a situation very much like the one shown in the video.
When you want to get into a car, how often do you use “Terry” as justification for a search of “weapons”? I was on a stop not too long ago, that went something like this. . . Me and my partner are situated in a high crime/drug area when we see a white male, who fits the profile of a tweaker, and two black males sitting in a car (that fits the profile of a tweaker car) at a gas station known for drug activity. We just sit there and think, tweaker. They pull off towards a street that’s known for selling tweak and we follow. They suddenly make a U-turn when they spot us and then run a red light, which we then pull them over. Driver is nervous and he doesn’t really know his passengers, conflicting statements abound, pull them out of the car and then I ask the driver, “Is it ok to check the vehicle.” He says no, you can’t search my vehicle. I say ok, and tell my partner to start checking the vehicle for “weapons.” [63]
Does this narrative describe sufficient reasonable suspicion to justify a Terry stop? As you can see, a lot of work is being done by the hearsay assertions: “high crime/drug area,” “profile of a tweaker,” “profile of a tweaker car,” “gas station known for drug activity,” and “street known for selling tweak.” This sort of “training and experience” boilerplate is notoriously hard to refute, and its acceptance by the courts serves as an almost-per se invitation to search people who live in actual high-crime neighborhoods.[64] So, in the video—which is set in Bed-Stuy—the officer could, per Mimms, definitely order Jay-Z (and Rick Rubin, the passenger) out of the car, and thus arrest him if he fails to comply. He could likely then legitimately pat Jay-Z (and Rubin) down for weapons, per Terry, and search the inside of the car for weapons, per Long. That “likely” depends on whether he can make specific, articulable observations about their demeanor, appearance, and behavior.

Two caveats tip the scales a little bit back toward Jay-Z, however: First, the “car frisk” would not include the trunk, nor would it include drilling into the ceiling in search of a concealed compartment: it’s a search for readily available weapons—not a search for contraband. Second, it will not be as easy to justify the Terry or Long frisks out on the shoulder of the New Jersey Turnpike, because the “high-crime neighborhood” boilerplate won’t be available.[65]

K. Line 16
Do you mind if I look around...? Cops are trained to ask for consent, and almost everyone gives it. [66] Consent is useful for them because voluntary consent renders moot any other problems that might arise with the search (for example, a later determination that the officer lacked probable cause).[67] Furthermore, awareness of the right to refuse is not a prerequisite to a
voluntary consent to search.[68] A suspect who thinks he has no choice can nonetheless give voluntary consent as a matter of law.[69]

Searches, in this respect, are unlike statements. Under Miranda, a statement made during custodial interrogation will be presumed involuntary (and thus suppressed) [70] if not preceded by the required warning, which includes telling the suspect that he has the right to remain silent.[71] But seven years after Miranda, the Court considered adopting such a warning regime for consent searches and declined to do so.[72] The Court said that street encounters with the police are inherently less coercive than jailhouse interrogation.[73] I find the Court’s reasoning unpersuasive: for a lot of people, street encounters and traffic stops are still pretty coercive. But who cares what I think: that’s the law. The burden is on the public to be aware of its rights—in this case, the right to decline consent. As a rule of thumb, think of it this way: if the police have the authority to search, they’ll just search. If they have to get your consent, it’s because they don’t have the authority to search unless you consent.[74] So a good response to memorize is: “I do not consent.” If the cop asks to search without threatening you, and you give consent, you are flat out of luck even if you had no idea that you had the right to refuse.

L. Lines 17–22
And I know my rights, so you go’n need a warrant for that... If this Essay serves no other purpose, I hope it serves to debunk, for any readers who persist in believing it, the myth that locking your trunk will keep the cops from searching it. Based on the number of my students who arrived at law school believing that if you lock your trunk and glove compartment, the police will need a warrant to search them, I surmise that it’s even more widespread among the lay public. But it’s completely, 100% wrong.

There is no warrant requirement for car searches. The Supreme Court has declared unequivocally that because cars are inherently mobile (and are pervasively regulated, and operated in public spaces), it is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment for the police to search the car—the whole car, and everything in the car, including containers—whenever they have probable cause to believe that the car contains evidence of crime.[75] You don’t have to arrest the person, or impound the vehicle. You just need probable cause to believe that the car contains evidence of crime. So, in any vehicle stop, the officers may search the entire car, without consent, if they develop probable cause to believe that car contains, say, drugs.

All the action, in short, is about probable cause. Warrants never come into the picture. The fact that the trunk and glove compartments are locked is completely irrelevant. Now, Jay-Z may have just altered the lyrics for dramatic effect, but that would be unfortunate insofar as the song is going to reach many more people than any criminal procedure lecture, and everyone should really know the outline of the law in this area.[76] What the line should say is: “You’ll need some p.c. for that.” Given that we’ve established (it appears) that Jay-Z is not under arrest, and given that the Terry frisk of the car is limited to accessible places a weapon could be hidden, the trunk is definitely off limits at this point. What that means is that if the officer opened the trunk by force, without developing articulable probable cause, the contraband found inside would be suppressed. That is the point of the next line.

M. Line 23
We’ll see how smart you are when the K-9s come... A sniff by a drugsniffing dog is not a “search,” for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.[77] Dog sniffs are “sui generis,” the Court has held—they’re unique in that they don’t reveal any information about the contents of the object sniffed except the presence of contraband, as to which you have no privacy right.[78] Thus, if the police have a dog ready to sniff your car when they pull you over for a traffic violation, you have no basis for objecting to the sniff. And, of course, if the dog does alert to the car, that is probable cause, so the police can then search the whole car.[79] That’s what the officer wanted to do with Jay-Z, but the K-9 unit wasn’t there when he was pulled over, and was late arriving. And this brings us to the final legal issue implicated by the song: excessive prolongation of a traffic stop.

A traffic stop is a legitimate seizure of the person, for purposes of investigating the violation of the traffic law and writing up the citation.[80] But it cannot be prolonged for longer than reasonably necessary to complete that legitimate activity.[81] If in fact the patrol car’s computer is slow, so you have to sit there for ten minutes while the cop runs your license, that’s one thing. But increasingly, given dashboard cameras and records of department computer activity, that sort of “delay” is getting harder to fudge.[82] And the Fourth Amendment rule is very clear: if the police detain you after they’ve finished processing the ticket—or if they simply dawdle over the ticket processing for an unreasonable length of time—in order to get a K-9 team there, then the eventual dog sniff will be the fruit of an illegal detention, and any evidence found will be suppressed.[83] The officer in Jay-Z’s case apparently knew this, and so released Jay-Z after the stop when the K-9 unit he’d called was late in arriving.[84]

Of course, if, during the traffic stop, you provide the officer with reasonable suspicion that you’re smuggling, then the traffic stop becomes a Terry stop for the purpose of investigating the suspected smuggling.[85] And then it can be extended—not indefinitely, but for a few minutes, anyway, depending on the circuit.[86] Courts will uphold reasonable suspicion for all the usual reasons—but there still has to be something beyond the traffic stop itself. This is a crucial distinction that all cops and perps need to be aware of, and be prepared to litigate.[87]

The best practice for law enforcement, if you’re planning to use traffic stops to make drug busts, is to have the dog unit there when you make the initial stop. But drug dogs and their handlers are valuable commodities—the dogs take a long time to train, are expensive to house, and typically work only with a designated officer.[88] So there aren’t as many K-9 units available as there are potential pretext traffic busts to make in a given night. The cops in Jay-Z’s case could have rolled the dice on holding him there until the unit arrived. But this is always a cost-benefit game: what are the chances that I’ll actually find something, and what are the chances it’ll be suppressed if I do find it?

And also: what are the chances that if I intentionally violate someone’s rights, I’ll get in trouble? On the last question, the prevalence of cell-phone cameras, video-sharing sites, and departmental policies on dashboard cameras and body recorders for officers have worked a huge cultural shift in most departments.[89] And you’re not going to have qualified immunity for intentionally prolonging a traffic stop to allow the dog to arrive. The law’s much too clear for that.[90]

N. Line 24
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain’t one... Jay-Z says that the “bitch” in this line, which recurs in the chorus, refers to the late-arriving drug dog, not to a woman.[91]

III. CONCLUDING ADVICE
The lesson for cops is that if you want to use traffic laws as a pretext for catching drug smugglers, you can. Absolutely, no problem. But you have to do it right, and doing it right can be labor-intensive. If you’re out to get some smuggling busts, have the dog unit ready. If you don’t have a dog on scene, and the suspect doesn’t give you consent (which if they’re any good, they won’t), then make as specific a record as you can of anything suspicious. If you don’t have anything (which again, if they’re any good, you won’t), it’s still not game over: just arrest for the traffic violation and impound the vehicle, and run a dog on it in the lot.[92] This means time off the street, paperwork, and potentially getting chewed out by your boss if you don’t turn up contraband — but it also means your bust will stick if the car was loaded. This is almost always good advice; I’ve heard it from my bosses, and I’ve given it myself: when in doubt, arrest, call it in, and let the lawyers deal with it.

The lesson for perps is threefold: (1) don’t consent, (2) know the reasonable suspicion boilerplate and don’t provide it, and (3) make a record of the encounter any way you can, including your behavior, appearance, and demeanor before and during the stop, the officer’s stated motive for the stop, all of your responses to questioning, whether or not you were placed under arrest, and the exact amount of time you were held on the side of the road.

And finally, most importantly, for both sides—when in doubt, talk to a lawyer. My door’s always open to players on both sides of this game. Call me.[93]

DRUG ISSUES 593, 599 (1998) (describing spatial variation in drug prices correlating with distance from points of import). Because the market is illegal, ordinary commercial transportation networks are not available to smooth regional price differences. In 1994, powder cocaine was primarily imported from Colombia through Miami and then to large eastern seaboard cities, starting with New York. The once-dominant Caribbean/Miami corridor for cocaine has since been eclipsed by the eastern and western Mexican corridors. See OFFICE OF NAT’L DRUG CONTROL POLICY, COCAINE SMUGGLING IN 2007 (2008). But those drugs still get to the Northeast from the South, so there is still plenty of drug traffic up I-95.

13. Cooking it into crack is the last stage before retail distribution. At the wholesale level, it’s always powder. Twenty kilos is about right for three briefcases, such as depicted in the video. It’s a little much for a sunroof compartment in a Maxima, but you never know—there are a lot of ingenious and well-built compartments out there (I’ve prosecuted a lot of smugglers). Jay-Z says that in the actual incident, he had crack, not powder, in the sunroof compartment. So he probably only had a couple of kilos and was en route either to conduct retail sales or to turn over the product to retail-level dealers. See JAY-Z, supra note 3, at 61.

14. At 100 milligrams a dose, that’s ten doses per gram, 10,000 doses per kilo, and 200,000 doses out of twenty kilos. See Jonathan P. Caulkins, Is Crack Cheaper Than (Powder) Cocaine?, 92 ADDICTION 1437, 1441 (1997) (noting that crack is often sold in fifty to 100 milligram doses). Street crack is usually highly adulterated, with pure coke percentages as low as five percent. See Hill v. State, No. 03-00-00777-CR, 2001 WL 1627598, at *2–3 (Tex. App. Dec. 20, 2001) (relating expert testimony from undercover officer about crack production and dosage). Crack rocks vary somewhat in weight, but a tenth of a gram is a good rule of thumb. And the rocks are not pure cocaine: you add an adulterant like baking soda when cooking the powder cocaine, so you should get substantially more (on the order of two to one) total weight of crack than you started with of powder. Of course, the process is less than perfectly efficient, so there’s some loss. But without a doubt, a suitcase full of reasonably pure raw powder will get you thousands of street sales. And according to government estimates, around 800 metric tons of pure cocaine are produced each year in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru. NAT’L DRUG INTELLIGENCE CTR., U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, NATIONAL DRUG THREAT ASSESSMENT 2009, at 3 tbl.1 (2009). Of that, perhaps 350 metric tons makes it into the United States. See David Bjerk & Caleb Mason, The Market for Mules: Risk and Compensation of Cross-Border Drug Couriers 15–16 (July 7, 2011) (unpublished manuscript), available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id= 1881212.

Mosley, 454 F.3d 249, 259–60 (3d Cir. 2006) (noting that “the Fourth Amendment has been repeatedly characterized by the Supreme Court as affording enhanced protection to the home, and diminished protection to vehicles,” and collecting cases).

Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 121–22 (2000), in which the Court upheld a Terry stop where the only articulated facts were that the suspect was in a “high- crime” area, was carrying a bag, and ran away when police cars drove past the building where he was standing. The lesson Jay-Z accurately imparts in the song is: a young black man driving an expensive car in Bed-Stuy is, as far as the law is concerned, per se an object of reasonable suspicion. The courts have consistently declined to impose much supervision on stop-and-frisk policies under Terry. Columbia Law School Professor Jeffrey Fagan recently completed a comprehensive survey of NYPD stop-and-frisk reports for the Center for Constitutional Rights and found that of 2.8 million reports, nearly 700,000 did not include specific observations to support the stop.

Conn. 2005) (“Viewed with a modicum of common sense and through the lens of a trained police officer, the facts presented justified the Officers’ concern that Mr. Thomas might be armed and dangerous . . . .”).

65. Query whether a court would buy “known drug transportation corridor” as applied to the whole Turnpike.

66. See, e.g., Eamon Kelly, Race, Cars and Consent: Reevaluating No-Suspicion Consent Searches, 2 DEPAUL J. SOC. JUST. 253, 269 (2009) (reporting studies showing that ninety percent of drivers consented to searches when requested).

67. Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 219 (1973).

68. Id. at 231.

69. Id. at 224.

70. But just the statements, and just for the case-in-chief. See, e.g., United States v. Patane, 542 U.S. 630, 640 (2004) (holding that “nontestimonial fruit of a voluntary statement” taken in violation of Miranda is inadmissible); Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 226 (1971) (holding that statements that would be excluded from the case in chief due to Miranda violation may be used for impeachment purposes).

71. See Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 307 (1985).

72. Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 231 (“One alternative that would go far toward proving that the subject of a search did know he had a right to refuse consent would be to advise him of that right before eliciting his consent. That, however, is a suggestion that has been almost universally repudiated by both federal and state courts, and, we think, rightly so.” (footnotes omitted)).

73. Id. at 247 (“In Miranda the Court found that the techniques of police questioning and the nature of custodial surroundings produce an inherently coercive situation. . . . In this case, there is no evidence of any inherently coercive tactics—either from the nature of the police questioning or the environment in which it took place. Indeed, since consent searches will normally occur on a person’s own familiar territory, the specter of incommunicado police interrogation in some remote station house is simply inapposite.”).

74. Id. at 219. To be sure, many officers use a belt-and-suspenders approach, requesting consent even where they have probable cause. This is efficient, because it saves the government the burden of litigating probable cause. See, e.g., United States v. Alexander, 573 F.3d 465, 477 (7th Cir. 2009).

75. California v. Acevedo, 500 U.S. 565, 580 (1991) (“The police may search an automobile and the containers within it where they have probable cause to believe contraband or evidence is contained.”).

76. It works just as well rhythmically, and has the added salutary benefits that (a) it might prompt confused listeners to Google “p.c.” and learn about the concept of probable cause, and (b) if you quoted it at a traffic stop, you’d be correct.

77. Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 408–09 (2005).

78. Caballes, 543 U.S. at 408 (explaining that dog sniffs are not searches because the “interest in possessing contraband cannot be deemed ‘legitimate,’ and thus, governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband compromises no legitimate privacy interest” (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 707 (1983) (discussing the sui generis nature of dog sniffs). Dog sniffs are thus unlike, say, thermal imaging scanners, which can detect grow lights, but might also reveal “at what hour each night the lady of the house takes her daily sauna.” Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 38 (2001). But see Jardines v. State, 73 So. 3d 34, 49 (Fla. 2011) (holding that a dog sniff is a search when conducted at the front door of a residence, as opposed to a car).

79. See Caballes, 543 U.S. at 409.

80. Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 809–10 (1996).

81. Caballes, 543 U.S. at 407.

82. See, e.g., David A. Harris, Picture This: Body-Worn Video Devices (Head Cams) as Tools for Ensuring Fourth Amendment Compliance By Police, 43 TEX. TECH L. REV. 357, 360 (2010) (discussing the increase in the number of camera systems installed in police cruisers).

83. Of course, as always, you’d better clearly assert your rights and document that your continued detention is non-consensual—and it helps not to be in the Fourth Circuit. See United States v. Lattimore, 87 F.3d 647, 649, 652 (4th Cir. 1996) (en banc) (upholding search as consensual despite the following pre-consent exchange: “Lattimore: Yeah, and I seen where [sic] they pulled a guy over, and they, you know, asked him the same thing you’re asking me— whether they could search his car or not. And, um, what’s the difference? If you do or you don’t, it’s gonna happen anyway, right? Trooper: Not really. If you don’t, I feel you’re hiding something. Therefore, I’ll call a drug dog right up the road to come down here and let him search your car. Lattimore: That’s what I’m saying. It don’t really make no difference.”).

84. See JAY-Z, supra note 3, at 61. Jay-Z says he actually saw the K-9 unit racing down the highway in the other direction as he pulled away. Id.

85. United States v. Flores, 359 F. Supp. 2d 871, 875 (D. Ariz. 2005).

86. See, e.g., United States v. Hardy, 855 F.2d 753, 761 (11th Cir. 1988) (upholding Terry detention to await drug dog for fifty minutes when officer developed reasonable suspicion during stop based on passengers’ responses to questions about their identity and destination).

87. See, e.g., Kelly, supra note 66, at 269 (noting that “[m]any reported cases reveal an admitted police practice of extending stops involuntarily after a refusal” and citing examples).

88. My ballpark, for what it’s worth, is: up to ten grand to buy the dog, which will have a working life of probably five years, ten at the outside, but limited hours (half a shift), plus training for the handler, and taking the handler off regular duty and/or hiring a replacement. For a similar estimate, see Mark Weintraub, A Pack of Wild Dogs? Chew v. Gates and Police Canine Excessive Force, 34 LOY. L.A. L. REV. 937, 969 n.195 (2001).

89. See Harris, supra note 82, at 360 (noting that video cameras in police cruisers tend to increase officer compliance with department policies).

90. Officers have qualified immunity from damages suits if they violate a person’s rights, so long as they did not violate “clearly established” law. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). Prolongation is a no-brainer as to the law, so the dispute will be factual, and you’ll at least get your jury trial. As one recent case put it, in denying the officer’s motion for summary judgment in a prolongation case:
Here, the Court finds that it was clearly established that reasonable suspicion must exist in order for an officer to prolong a traffic stop to conduct a field sobriety test. Here, there is a question of fact as to what Breshears knew and how he chose to justify his decision to detain Plaintiff.Thompsen v. Breshears, No. CV-08-230-RHW, 2009 WL 2581556, at *11 (E.D. Wash. Aug. 14, 2009).

91. JAY-Z, supra note 3, at 61 (“In this verse, the bitch is a female dog, the K-9 cop coming to sniff the ride.”); Id. at 56 (“At no point in the song am I talking about a girl.”).

92. See, e.g., South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U.S. 364, 368–69 (1976). But remember: If the dog alerts but you didn’t see anything when you inventoried the car, get a warrant: the inventory search rule does not cover dismantling the car in search of a concealed compartment. See, e.g., United States v. Bowhay, 992 F.2d 229, 230 (9th Cir. 1993) (“To be valid, an inventory search must conform to a standardized and established local procedure, and must be motivated by a concern to inventory [the items] rather than to search for other incriminating evidence.” (internal quotation makes omitted)).

You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried

Remember when we vowed the vows
And walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt

And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts

Was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up

Now lookn' back it's just a steppin' stone

Where we've been
Said we'd do it all again

Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Outro Over Chorus]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?

That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said

Just like I said, get the fuck back
Get up on my level jack
Bread and chips is all I stack
Roll a seven, bring it back
Never crapped out
'Cause my pimpin' is too slick for that
But if you think I'm jokin' then I guess
That's yo ass jacked
Beat 'em down, stomp 'em out
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Dirty Mouth off in this bitch

Any city, any hood
Any state, it's all good
Wish you lames can get up on my level
But you never could
In the club, throwin' bows

Mean muggin' hard, 'cause they crunk out the rainbow

Get up on my level cause my clique is the fuckin' best

Nigga I got too many stars, too many stripes
Too many thumpers, and too many pipes

Fuck yo boys, fuck yo laws
Keep lookin' at me I'm a hit 'em in the jaw
Mac-11, 30 calibers, and SK's
In the trunk for the haters if you really wanna draw
See a bitch, smack a bitch
Up that thing, then my gat to click
Bust yo dome in the back of it
Then I ride to the black Cadillac and split
If you do really wanna get the picture then I gotta hit you with real steel
Let it ride then I scream ""You can't fuck with Twista and Trillville!""
Cause we got them thangs, got that dust
When I'm in the club, gurls twerk that butt
Make them shawties wanna cut
With the spinners on the Benz, 24's on the truck
Wood and leather
You really wanna get ahead of motherfuckers like me
But I'm bringin' better cheddar

I'm gone bust up in the club with no guest list
The other artists I'll keep em' all restless

Kiss kiss and still you gets nowhere
Just two blue balls down in your underwear, I play unfair

Look, let me move to the left

Jiggle, Jiggle, Jangle
Watch how my glu-te-us dangle
I do a one-two step STOP!
No I ain't done yet
Everybody in the club go to work
Tight jeans, crop shirts, short skirts
I'm gone rock to the beat till it hurt
I'm gone drop it on the street yeah you heard
Haters I flip the bird, Got guns so what I ain't scurred

304,Long Black Train,"[Verse 1]
There's a long black train coming down the line
Feeding off the souls that are lost and crying
Rails of sin, only evil remains
Watch out, brother, for that long black train
Look to the heaven's, you can look to the sky
You can find redemption staring back into your eyes
There is protection and there's peace the same:
Burning your ticket for that long black train

Because there's victory in the Lord, I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train

Making you wonder if the ride is worth the pain
He's just a-waiting on your heart to say:
""Let me ride on that long black train.""

But you know there's victory in the Lord, I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train

Well, I can hear the whistle from a mile away
It sounds so good but I must stay away
That train is a beauty making everybody stare
But its only destination is the middle of nowhere

Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train

Got my whole life ahead

He's got a redneck side when you get him agitated
He got the gold toothed look from a stiff right hook
He's proud he took for his right wing stand on Vietnam
Says he lost his brother there

He yells out Johnny Cash

A ring of fire as he walks up
And stands there by the stage

She's got a rock and roll side when you get her agitated
She got the tattoo there on her derriere from a spring break dare

Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance

But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in

But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest

Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life

Heaven bend to take my hand
And lead me through the fire
Be the long awaited answer
To a long and painful fight
Truth be told, I've tried my best
But somewhere 'long the way
I got caught up in all there was to offer
And the cost was so much more than I could bear

[Chorus]
Though I've tried
I've fallen, I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better, I should know
So don't come 'round here
And tell me ""I told you so""

[Verse 2]
We all begin with good intent
When love was raw and young
We believe that we can change ourselves
The past can be undone
But we carry on our back the burden time always reveals
In the lonely light of morning
In the wound that would not heal
It's the bitter taste of losing everything
That I've held so dear

[Chorus]
I've fallen, I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better, I should know
So don't come 'round here
And tell me ""I told you so""
Oh

Heaven bend to take my hand
I've nowhere left to turn
I'm lost to those I thought were friends
To everyone I know
Oh they turn their heads embarrassed
Pretend that they don't see
That it's one missed step one slip before you know it
And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed

[Chorus]
Though I've tried
I've fallen, I have sunk so low
I messed up

Well they all wonder why I've changed
How many times must I explain
It's basic honky-tonk anatomy

I'm rolling down a lonely highway
Asking God to please forgive me
For messing up the blessing he gave to me, I see, everything clearer now
The nights is black as, black as its ever been
Without my girl, I'm gonna lose it
I pray that he would just shed his grace on me
I need just to be back with my baby

See my mama told me that's if its meant to be
She'll come back and she'll forgive me
And the best thing I can do it to just let her, let her go

But if I continue to push she'll just pull away
And I know that in my heart its a reality
I didn't treat her like she wanted to be treated
And I hope that shes not gone for good no no

Between you and Biggie it was like, who's going to rule the
Nigga kingdom and shit, basically, know what I'm saying?
I was like, this is like a fucking election
It is that
You know what I am saying
Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like…

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't faze me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?

Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
(It's on me)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?

Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But when he, when he died, I was just like, ""whoa"", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Seven series BM, six series Benz
Twenty-four inches, Giovanni rims
R1 one wheel when I'm on one of them
Ma, that boy out there acting a fool that's him
They say I've changed man, I'm getting paper, I'm flashy
They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy
My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace
Stunt so hard, everybody got to watch me
And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold
As long as the VS bling, look at that light show
In the hood they say 50 man your sneaker look right yo
Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho
Banks is a sure thing, y'all niggas might blow
I'm fin to drop that, so I suggest you lay low
Buck, he from Cashville, Ten-a-key nigga
We getting them ten a ki', save ten for me nigga

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'll teach you how to stunt
My wrists stay rocked up
My TV's pop up in a Maybach Benz
I'll teach you how to stunt
Nigga you can't see me
My Bentley GT got smoke-gray tints
I'll teach you how to stunt
My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man
I'll teach you how to stunt
I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya man
I'll teach you how to stunt

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I'm sensing a lot of tension now that I'm rapping
But the kids used to look up to you, what happened?
Me on the contrary, hand covered with platinum
Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one
On point, cause you get R.I.P.'s when slacking
So the stash box big enough to squeeze the MAC in
Yeah, I'm fairly new but I demand some respect
Cause I already wear your advance on my neck
I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches
Blue Yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers
I already figured out what to do with all my features
Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers
When it comes to stunting there's nothing you can teach us
We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us
Naww, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt
Come with me out front, I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO STUNT

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'll teach you how to stunt
My wrists stay rocked up
My TV's pop up in a Maybach Benz
I'll teach you how to stunt
Nigga you can't see me

I'll teach you how to stunt
My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man
I'll teach you how to stunt
I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya man
I'll teach you how to stunt

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Chain so icy, you don't have to like me
In a throwback jersey, with the throwback Nikes
I know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the days
The only thing changed is the numbers on the Range
I bought me an old school and blew out the brains
The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain
My Sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing
And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game
Come on now, we all know gold is getting old
The ice in my teeth keep the Cristal cold
G-Unit homie, acting like y'all don't know
Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more
I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes
They never seen doors lift up on a car before
Don't be mad at me dog, that's all I know
That's how to show these fugazies how it's supposed to go, yeah

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'll teach you how to stunt

Let's pretend for one night, I'm the man in your life
And we do the things that lovers do
All the loving you like, I give it to you just right
There's nothing less than special when it comes to you

See what we have is understanding
That works so well for how we are
Cause neither of us has the heart
To fall in love all over again

So that I can hold you until the morning comes
Then we can go back to how things was before

Hahaha, yo, yo, yo, yo
You never met a nigga like me
Yo yo, have you ever seen a little dude
Who be doing what I do?
Uh huh, yo whoo!
Let's get at it dog, whoo!

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
Now what goes up, must come down (shiiett)
But we ain't coming down, it be them same ol' clowns
Aiming your pound, pretending they proud
But when you leave town they go around they running they mouth (maaann)
They something like a hater, man
Talking bad about a playa as if I'm not gon' see ya later, man
You constantly frontin' until you confronted on
If you don't like whats going on goin' to another song
'Cause I keep a hater guilty
My cars and my money all alike man, both them filthy (get it?)
From skimpy and empty to fuel on full
See I be high when my 'Ca-go Bulls
Obey no rules to school you fools
Schoolboy's err'y where, we're Young Dude news (maann)
St. Louis like Blues, D. Miles and Larry Hughes
And the Young Dude done paid young dudes' dues dude

[Hook] 2x
[JD:] But yo, what da hook gon' be? (Uh oh!)
[ML:] See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'mma rip

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
The sun'll come out... tomorrow
And I will never have to borrow
Got my first car when I turned sixteen
Only drove it home outta town limousines
Plus we was broke wit a deal but nobody could tell
So we did what we had to do for ""Country Grammar"" to sell
Haha, I stay on my own melodies
Plus I like my booties and my boobs like a capital letter 'B'
That's how it is, how it better be
I preferably rather have two or three girls in the bed wit' me
Close your ears, ma, you ain't heard nothing (what?)
I always pay ma, let a brother hold something
I'm basically coming from nothing to something
When I say nothing meaning pocket full of lint and buttons
(We all we got!) Used to be creative on Halloween (how you gon?)
Stop a hotter teen went from nada to a lot of things

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
People always saying man it must be nice
No hi, no nothing, not a simple ""how's life?""
Understand the money's good but I'm still from the hood
So don't be asking for no ""inch"" and be expecting the ""foot""
Unless you want a foot (whoo!)
I know a few crooks that can place you where you need to be put
And it might not cost me playa
Got a Benz pepper interior, paint salty playa
And we all push it, but me I push it real good
Brains blown out, chromed out, wheel real wood
Catch me on your local derrty
Or in the studio doing vocals derrty
I'm the same dude that came through wit my crew
Let the girls do me while you do you
And um, all I need is JD beat to be banging
And I'll come up wit these verses that I'm usually slanging
I be ripping man

Once upon a time in this place called hood
Where the gangsta girls shake it and they all smell good
Lived this legendary pimp (pimp) by the name of Fresh
Fix hair, fix nails, fix toes, fix breast
But one chick super sick, make every nigga grab his dick
Heart pound up and down, when she goin round and round

Now we leavin from the club, and she let me cop a rub
Can't believe she choose me, +Feelin On Her Booty+
I'm about to cut like knives, strokin mami with some ice
Takin me to paradise, I nut once, she nut twice
Sex in cities, rubbin titties, that's how I get it

It was the summer 2001
All before the drama begun
When we first met
I seen you sitting out on your steps
You was broke down crying a mess
So I interferred
I asked what's the reason for tears
I was wishing you could tell me your fears
But I'll start with ya name
You told me how ya man playin games
So I said that it was time for a change
And you just laughed
But it looked like you ain't laughed in while
I was glad that I could give you a smile
Then we both blushed
But really girl it ain't no rush
I was thinking girl that we can discuss
A future for us
Cause homeboy just got you crushed
You need to leave that clown in the dust
Trust, I just wanna talk
I'm thinking I can give you a call
And we can pick it up
Where we left off
I'll holla tomorrow

Girl I understand you loyal to ya man
And that's alright aww baby
But that don't change the fact
That you fine and you stay crying every night nah baby

Nah baby
Can't see
Together you and me could be so special ah baby

[Verse 2]
Our feelings get greater
A million days later
Talking all night we stay up but
Here comes ya ex
Returned with that drama and stress
All the nonsense that you just left but yet
You except and go back to try it again
Then return with a broken heart
That I gotta mend
That's unfair
I've only been your lover and friend
And homey there he just front and pretend
But you don't care the life he leads is unsafe
I would never place my hands to your face
But still I chase
Cat and mouse
First you kick him out
Then you at his house
What is that about
I can't figure you out
Even your friend said I was better
But you listen to him
Never like uh-uh whatever
So the next time hurt you again
You already knew where you should've been
And that's with me

[Verse 3]
All the times
You 2way telling me
That you miss me
Wanting me to come over and keep you busy
Remember that
Now that you gone
It's been kinda hard
Can't think, can't sleep
Can't do nothing at all
Just tell me why you had to go back
See you ain't have to go through that
My baby
You could've been here right by my side
Me and you at the park taking walks outside
But instead, I keep on having these dreams
Waiting for my phone to ring

352,Not Today,"Why won't you grow up and be a man someday
I can't believe that you're still playing silly games
Now why do I put up with all this childish play
Now if your word is all you have, then you ain't worth a damn thing

You told me everyday (that you made)
You never ever came (not for me)
I really want to believe (but not today)
Not today, not today, not today

You're the worst, I can't even depend on you
You say a lot of good things, but somethin' else you always do
Be a man of your word, try to love something or love in you
But now you can be on your way, because I don't want you today

Bought a house, bought the kids
Lifestyles we would live
Who the fuck you really is
In my face all the time
Spittin' line afta line
Broke down my wall and you got in my mind
You's a fake, shoulda known
All the times I was shown
Believe what I saw and your cover was blown
Break up leave, make up please
You's a magician, all the tricks up your sleeve
Have me for a minute an' I was in it
You played good but I'ma bet you gotta get it
So I make moves and I'ma leave you where you at dog, chill
Go back to square one, wait for somethin' real
Selfish nigga, coulda helped you nigga
Usually know betta but I felt you nigga
I guess gettin' in my head was part of the plan
Cause in reality, the only thing you givin' me is

You told me everyday (that you made)
You never ever came (not for me)
I really want to believe (but not today)
Not today, not today, not today

You told me everyday (that you made)
You never ever came (not for me)
I really want to believe (but not today)
Not today, not today, not today

Don't let him waste your time girl (don't let him waste your time girl)
He's only tellin' lies girl (he's only tellin' some lies to you)
Then he apologizes (and he will, he will)
Don't believe all that mess cause he will do it again

You told me everyday (that you made)
You never ever came (not for me)
I really want to believe (but not today)

Peeps call me up [phone ring] said it's a ho-tel party
Just bring the liquor, there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way, let me stop by the store
Get a 12-pack of Coronas - plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Rd
I'm already blowed, hit third I'mma be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet looking like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
It's three girls on the elevator like: ""wassup?""
I told em: ""follow me"". they knew I had it cracking B
One said ""ain't you that boy that be on BET?""
""Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped with much ding-a-ling""
Knock on the door, I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face
Fuck it then, feel like my head is toxic waste
It's some pretty girls in hurr, I heard em whispering
Talking bout ""that's that dude that sing ""Right Thurr"" - he glistening""
I ain't come to talk, I ain't come to sit
What I came for was to find out who I'm gonna hit, aww shit

Man know what, get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, acting silly
The girl said ""can I be in yo video"" I'm like ""yeah!"", ""oh really?""
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage as I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wilding
Sharing the next room with some girls looking like they from an island

Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little ""D"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not Wiffle
Hit 'em in triples, with no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, with a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again

He said: ""Just think it over, and write me a list

Dividing an' deciding his and hers

An' one by one, she wrote down what she wanted most from him

She reached across the table an' placed it in his hand
An' said: ""You know this isn't easy for me.""
As he thought about the new car, the house an' the land
An' wondered what that bottom line would be
An' a thousand other things that she'd want him to leave behind
But he never dreamed he'd open up that napkin and find:

Well, he fought back the tears, as he looked in her eyes

Bust nuts up in that ass, yeah, lots of abortions
You, took it out of proportion
Made the bitch wifey, when you should be plottin divorcin
I put her through the ring, had her wildin' out horse, when
You, bought rings, had her hiding out in Nordstrom (whoo!)
I coach her, help her play her part{whistle}
Catch these bars, you know I play her like a sport (hah!)

Or payin' the cost for another man to floss (nah!)
I'd rather have my hands on the grands of course
So the plan is creepin' up on your man, pushing The Porsche (what!)

With Manolo's and a pair of handcuffs on her hip (ey yo)
She love coke, doin' lines off my CD (sniff sniff)
She in the bottles like ""I Dream Of Genie""
She got a G.E.D. from nightschool
That stands for ""Gettin' Errbody Dolla"", greeeedy!
I first met her at Magic City, she was gettin' lapdances, and grabbin' titties
When the stripper ain't lookin', she grabbed a $50
Ride out the bitch thong, when the song is on
I'm like: that bitch ain't shit!
She'll put the gun to your balls while swallowing your ""kids""
Before you know it, you got robbed
By four fat chicks that kicked in your door while you was tied
That's the game that bitches play
Watch your back while they walkin' your way
You know her, long hair brown skin
Pussy be whippin' niggas like Lady Heroine
You try to get her drunk, she slipped you a Mickey
Now you the next date-rape victim on ""Ricky""
Bitch fuck with D, I have her legs ""hangin' out the trunk"" like the
""Marshall Mathers LP"" (yup!)

Pussy the first day (yeah)
Hey, slow down boo, cause' at a G-Unit party
My niggas pattin' the hoes down too (yeah)

Thinkin' I'm off point cause I blew about a grand on a chocolate
And even if I'm loose off the liquor (liquor)

If he don't die, I bet he be leakin' (D-Block!)
And I'm in the zone right now, I think I'm 'bout to finish up my album
By the rest of the weekend (let's go)

You wanna deck him, and deck her
Should have only used her from the neck up (whoo)
Instead of taking her to shop
Take her scandalous ass to ""The Doc"", make her get a check up
Now for nothing, you should just stand down

Oh fuck

You can't imagine so many monkeys in the daily mail
And all of them coming anonymously, so they leave no trail
Never thought I'd have an admirer from overseas
But somebody's sending me stationary filled with chimpanzees

Some chimps in swimsuits
Some chimps are swinging from a vine
Some chimps in jackboots
Some chimps that wish they could be mine
Starsky and Hutch chimps
A chimp who's sitting on the can
A pair of Dutch chimps
Who send their love from Amsterdam

Another postcard with chimpanzees

If I had to guess, I'd say the monkey-sender thinks its great
He's sending me, maybe she's sending me, just to see me get irate
I'm losing sleep and it's gonna be keeping me up all night
I thought it was funny but now I got money on a monkey-fight

Some chimps in hard-hats
Chimps a-working on a chain gang
Some chimps who love cats
Burning rubber in a Mustang
A birthday wishing chimp
A chimp in black, like a goth
A going fishing chimp
A British chimp in the bath

Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me

Somebody followed me even though I packed and moved my home
No matter what they come and they come, they won't leave me alone
Another monkey in the mail could make me lose my mind
But look at me shuffling through the stack until I finally find
Some chimps in swimsuits
Some chimps in jackboots
Some chimps in hard-hats
Some chimps who love cats
I got some shaved chimps
Thats chimps devoid of any hair
I got depraved chimps

How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
""There's no way we're gonna give up""
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

You'll understand what I mean when I say

Down on Union Avenue

And watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
There's a pretty little thing
Waitin' on ""The King""

Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said
""Tell me are you a Christian""
And I said ""Ma'am I am tonight""

[Chorus]
Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for
Cause I'm bigger than my body now

[Bridge]
Maybe I'll tangle in the power lines
And it might be over in a second's time
But I'll gladly go down in a flame
If a flame's what it takes to remember my name
To remember my name

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry
For my fuse to dry
Wait for my fuse to dry

[Chorus]
Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body now",John Mayer,John Mayer,2004,"[96, 94]",2
374,I Melt,"[Verse 1]
When you light those candles
Up there on that mantle, setting the mood
Well, I just lie there staring
Silently preparing to love on you
Well, I can feel the heat
From across the room
Ain't it wild what a little flame can make you wanna do?

[Chorus]
I melt, every time you look at me that way
It never fails
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

[Verse 2]
Don't know how you do it
I love the way I lose it, every time
What's even better is knowing that forever you're all mine
The closer you get, the more my body aches
One little stare from you is all it takes

[Chorus]
I melt, every time you look at me that way
It never fails
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I melt (I melt), every time you look at me that way
It never fails (Fails)
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt (I melt)

[Outro]
Every time you look at me that way (I just melt)
I melt (I just melt)
I melt",Rascal Flatts,Rascal Flatts,2004,[81],1
375,Tough Little Boys,"I never once, backed down from a punch
I'd take it square on the chin
Well I found out fast a bullys just that and you got to stand up to him
So I didn't cry when I got a black eye as bad as it hurt I just grinned
But when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again
Scared me to death when took your first steps
Well I'd fall everytime you fell down
Your first day of school
I cried like a fool, I followed your school bus to town
Well I didn't cry when ol Yeller died
At least not in front of my friends
But when tough little boys grow up to be
Dads they turn into big babies again
Well I'm a grown man and as strong as I am
Well sometimes it's hard to believe
One little girl with little blonde curls can totally terrify me
If you were to ask my wife would just laugh
She'd say I know all about men
How tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again
Well I know one day I'll give you away
And I'm goin to stand there and smile
When I get home and I'm all alone
I'll sit in your room for awhile
Cause when tough little boys grow up to be
Dads they turn into big babies again",Gary Allan,Gary Allan,2004,[88],1
376,One More Chance,"[Verse 1]
Uh huh, alright...
This time going to do my best to make it right
Can't go on without you by my side, hold on
Shelter come and rescue me out of this storm
And out of this cold I need someone
Oh why oh why why why...

Searching for that one who is going to make me whole
Help me make these mysteries unfold, hold on

Hurt so bad sometimes it is hard to breathe

And I do not care what it takes no, why
I would sail the seven seas to be near her
And if you happen to see her
See, tell her this from me
