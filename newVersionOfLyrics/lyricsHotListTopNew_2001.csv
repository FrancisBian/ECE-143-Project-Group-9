0,How You Remind Me,"[Verse 1]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream ""Are we having fun yet?""

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no

[Verse 2]
It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause living with me must have damn near killed you

[Pre-Chorus]
And this is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream ""Are we having fun yet?""

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no

[Bridge]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream ""Are we having fun yet?""

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, are we having fun yet?
Yeah, yeah, are we having fun yet?
Yeah, yeah, are we having fun yet?

1,U Got It Bad,"[Intro]
Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ouh

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

[Verse 2]
When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: ""I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world""
Ladies say: ""I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

[Electric Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track

6,Always On Time,"Hi, I’m the Rap Critic. Let’s talk about Ja Rule. Yeah… remember him?

Well, if you do, you, you’ll remember that he was one of the more successful 2Pac Knock-offs that tried to capatilize off of his likeness in the aftermath of his death, as made obvious by the bald head, red bandana, and perpetual shirtlessness, but whereas 2Pac’s musical material, no matter how controversial or disagreeable, at least came across as genuine, intricate, insights of a man trying to sort out his world, Ja Rule’s music came across as very… watered down, to say the least

First of all, he sang WAY too much for a hardcore thug, as he kept claiming to be. Secondly, he sang WAY too much for someone who CAN’T SING. *montage of Ja Rule singing* And Third, he had all of the mannerisms of 2Pac with absolutely none of the substance. And fourth, we already had a late 90’s, eastcoast version of 2Pac. His name was DMX!

And this is a comparison that must be noted, because not only did DMX arrive on the scene about a year before Ja Rule, but he also had an energy, griminess, and passion in his rhymes that made Ja Rule look like a corny knock off. X had diversity in his topics, ranging from hardcore anthems to tracks about multiple personalities to songs detailing his life like “Slippin’”. His material was not only more clever and diverse, but also grittier, making you believe every word he viciously growled. That, coupled with the fact that, in 1998, both his first and second albums went number one in the same year, and you can bet your ass people were trying to imitate the formula. Not by trying to achieve the same intensity or ability as DMX, but by taking his exact aesthetic, and watering it down to hell

Now, Ja and DMX were actually cool with each other at first, that is until right around the release of his second album, Rule 3:36, which is about the time Ja started going from run-of-the-mill gangsta rapper to employing one of the worst trends in HipHop: the “thugs need love too” songs. These were Ja Rule’s Bread and FREAKING butter: songs with females on the chorus singing soulfully about how much they need Ja Rule and declaring their loving loyalty to him while he, in return, spits rhymes about hardcore sex and how much of a gangsta and playa he still is, despite his relationship with her. By the end of 2002, there was a never-ending torrent of “I wanna be gangsta for the fellas and lovey-dovey for the ladies” songs that dominated the airwaves for a while, the biggest single of which was “Always On Time”, which is pretty much the first and last song from him that you really needed to hear when it comes to this topic. Everything that’s done right and wrong is on this song, and mostly, it’s done wrong, so let’s check it out

""Always there when you call (Buckshots, hah), always on time""

RIGHT THERE! That’s exactly what I’m talking about. Smooth, R and B singer crooning about love for the girls, but we’ve still gotta be hardcore, so I gotta talk about shooting guns!... Despite the fact that that has nothing to do with the mood she’s trying to set. Like, in reality, this wouldn’t work

*singing* Yeah, boy, You know I love you! Tell me what you say to that! *pause* *guns go off* Holy shit! What the fuck!

“Gave you my.... baby be mine”
What… what did you give him?
“And I gave you my all, now baby be mine”

Oh… why was that edited out the first time? Did the first take have a… different word there?

“Gave you my....” *...you know… “baby be mine”

Although, the word she actually says here is “I gave you my all”, but then she says, “Now baby, be mine”. And, seeing that the context is, “Yeah, I don’t always answer my phone, but when you need me, I’m there, giving you my “ALL” and since, after giving him her “all”, she still doesn’t know whether or not he wants to be with her, I’m going to forgo any thought that she’s talking about spending quality time together as a loving couple and just assuming she’s talking about her… you know…

BUT, it’s just innocuously worded enough that someone could interpret it in a more innocent context, and that’s a great way that R and B writing works: you can easily deduce a sexual or emotional context from what they’re saying. However, when the verses are coming from a rapper who’s still trying to be hardcore…

“C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other”

Goodbye, subtlety…

""I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain""

Yeah, I know I’ve done very disrespectful things to you in the past, but, hey, you know who I am! I’m a rich rapper! And besides, love is SUPPOSED to be about being hurt. That’s why I’m doing things that hurt you! I’m ONLY trying to verify the enduring power of our love!

""So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints""

Yeah, so just sign these papers that will nullify your restraining order and… WHHA?!

""Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids""

I’m sorry, did you mention something about a restraining order a little while ago?

""Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile""

I guess not! She had a freaking restraining order on you! Look, I understand that people get into relationship problems, but if it’s come to the point of trying to legally restrict a person from being near you, we’ve tread into some dangerous territory

""While I'm smackin you fast and hittin you all wild""

That line about restraining orders is really ruining the rest of this song

""[With Ashanti] But we share somethin so rare,""

Yes, most couples DON’T have what we have between us, namely a document stating that we can’t be within 100 feet of each other

""But who cares?""

The court that drafted it?

“Baby, I’m not always there when you call, but I’m always on time”

Are you still singing this chorus? Why do you like this guy? He’s obviously not worth your time!

“Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together”

See, even Ja Rule wants you to get over him! He’s done nothing to illustrate why he’s not a good person! Like he said, get a grip!

It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather”

Oh wait, was he saying “pull it together” and “get a grip” because he wants her to overlook his shortcomings, because they’ve “been through worse”, as he says? My bad, I guess. I thought he was having a moment of clarity, realizing he was a horrible person and telling her to move on from him. But what a foolish presumption, because most of these songs are about how “girl, you know that I’m a bad boy, and you like the fact that I’m a bad boy, and we’re terrible for each other, but we just can’t stay away from each other, because we love the fact that we’re not supposed to be together *points finger in mouth* and blegh! You know, where Wale handled this topic with nuance and gave the proper weight to the subject, Ja Rule’s songs exploit that angle, and that’s what annoys me. The way this chorus is sung, it treats the topic with no gravity whatsoever, and tries to make the whole thing cute while Ja’s lyrics in the verses outline just how stupid it really is

""Like the stormy nights you wrote a ""Dear Ja"" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather""

Okay, here’s an instance where she did something pretty crappy to him, but I’m fairly sure that she did this in response to something HE did

""Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches""

You know, like casually referring to her as a bitch, or living by the phrase “M.O.B.”, which means that he values money and material items over bitches, a derogatory term that he just called her, as in “Why did you cut up my car? Don’t you remember? I value material items more than I value you! See, this is why things aren’t working out! You don’t understand me!""

“I got two or three hoes for every V”

Or, you could look at the fact that he sees no shame in telling you that he has other girls

“And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy”

And he keeps them high off of drugs to incapacitate them… like a pimp or… wait, is this song about a pimp and his relationship with a prostitute? Yeah, dude, I think it is! I mean, listen to that chorus again!

“I’m not always there when you call, but I’m always on time”

That’s something a prostitute would say to her pimp, “yeah daddy, I may not always answer my phone, but I’m always on time with my money!” Dear God, why didn’t I see it before!

""Believe me, this pimp game is very religious""

Seriously, why didn’t I notice this? This is basically a song about how a pimp makes a girl feel special so that she’ll sell her body for him, and Ashanti is the chick who’s going for it! I mean, if that ISN’T what this song is about, and Ja Rule writing a love song can be this easily misconstrued as a pimp-ho relationship, well, I guess that just shows how terrible he is at it

""I play hard, there's so many women I fathered""

Wait, “fathering” someone means that you’ve been a father to a person. So, you’re bragging about the fact that you have a lot of daughters? I mean, contextually, this should be another line about how many women you’ve had sex with, but if you’re saying you “fathered” them, that verb specifically means to be a father to someone, so… unless raising multiple daughters was a thing that rappers bragged about in the early 2000’s, this line is very wrongly worded

“Oh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life
Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes”

Hold on, so now, Ja Rule is the one concerned about her faithfulness? You just told us that you have two hoes for every car you own. As far as we know, you’re the only one who’s had sex with anyone else, so excuse me if I don’t show sympathy to your speculations that probably arise from the fact that you’re afraid your girlfriend might have the exact same morality code as you!

And you could say that this is a lust song, that’s it’s not meant to be taken as a song about intimate relationships as much as sexual attraction, but then what’s the excuse for cutesy lines like this:

""But we share something so rare
But who cares, you care""

Dude, I know what this really is. This isn’t a morally elusive song for the purpose of telling us a real story about two people struggling between lust and genuine attraction, this is a morally elusive song for the purpose of fooling girls into thinking he has a softer side to make them believe he’ll treat them special, all the while flagging the “but I’m a complicated thug” card that’s supposed to make it okay for him to have sex with other women because he “just doesn’t want to be committed yet”!

It’s obvious, it’s manipulative, and it’s a perfect example of why I don’t like these songs when they’re done this way. And that’s not to say that I don’t like Rap love songs in general, or that hardcore rappers shouldn’t make love songs. It can be done right. Look at the quintessential “thugs need love too” song, “All I Need” by Method Man

“Back when I was nothing You made a brother feel like he was somethin
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray You would rub me on my back and say ""Baby it'll be okay""”

This is a great example of a rap love song that doesn’t come across as either corny or pandering

""I'm realizing that you didn't have to fuck wit me
But you did, now I'm going all out kid And I got mad love to give,""

Sure, to some people, this may not sound super romantic and sweet, but this brand of HipHop isn’t about that: it’s raw, it’s reality, and it sounds authentic, and it doesn’t need to be sugar-coated, which is what they did for “Always On Time”, to cover up the fact that it’s not about love, it’s about manipulating women into thinking that Ja Rule gives a crap about you, and it barely bothers to hide it. Sorry, but I just hate the mood of this song. Ashanti here is desperately trying to get her to love him, begging him to be hers, and the only thing he does is talk about how awesome he is. It’s annoyingly lop-sided in regards to who’s giving them self to the other. I’d give this song a 1 out of 5, because, you know, Ashanti was an okay singer

He has his wrists bling-blinging
And his long legs was bow

I felt fingertips on the small of my back

I met so many men and it's like they're all the same
My appetite for loving is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feeling sexy, who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is their insecurity

[Pre-Chorus: Ja Rule, Jennifer Lopez, Together]
Tired of being alone, yeah, yeah
Sick of arguing on the phone, yeah, yeah
Are you telling all your friends, yeah, yeah
That your nigga don't understand my love?

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 2: Ja Rule with Jennifer Lopez]
Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout this relationship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets?
'Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they been lookin' at me, smilin' at me
Laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin' that we're growin' and we gettin' married
Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this shit for nothing
I'm here to get it poppin', hop in', let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But you still don't fuck with your baby

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Now people lovin' me and hating me, treating me ungratefully
But not knowing that they ain't making or breaking me
My life I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again
Now people screaming what the deal with you and so and so
I tell them niggas mind their biz, but they don't hear me though
'Cause I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I could breathe again, baby, now I could breathe again

Hard work pays off the way it should
Yeah, I've seen enough to know that we've got it good
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

There's a lady that stands in a harbor for what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes the price that it cost to be free

I pledge allegiance to this flag
And if that bothers you, well, that's too bad
But if you got pride and you're proud you do
Hey, we could use some more like me and you
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

Yes, there's a lady that stands in a harbor for what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes the price that it cost to be free

No, it ain't the only place on earth

Uh-huh, come on
You can say I'm plain Jane but it's not the same
I ain't into big names but I like nice things
I watch boxin' matches and the football games
I wouldn't mind being an actress but I love to sing
I like goin' out, takin' walks and stuff
I don't run with many girls 'cause they talk too much
I enjoy quiet nights at home and curl up next to ya
Though I'm ain't a virgin that don't mean I'm havin' sex with ya

Not too many bitches like her, one of a kind
I mean even the bitches like her, she just a dime
Not impressed by your Cris' poppin' 'cause if you would
I might end, of the night we gone be lip locking

It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all

Pushed as far as I can go

For all this
There's only one thing you should know

With the tank tops and the flirty words (hey baby)

Ha ha, hoo hoo, thought you'd get the money too
Greedy motherfuckers try to have your cake and eat it too

[Verse 1: Janet]
Sharp shooter into breaking hearts
A baby gigolo, a sex pistol
Hollering at everything that walks
No substance just small talk
Know why you feeling on that girl's behind
You gotta sleazy one track mind
Working your work until you think you find
Who's going home with you tonight

[Missy]
I changed all the credit cards
And switched the lock to all my doors
You thought my heart would be destroyed
Look around cause I'm chillling boy
Whatcha go and get your lawyers for
I, makes my dough in just one show, you know
Your lawyer shoulda let you know, you know
When you sue me, you gonna be broke you know
Ain't know you way you could bring me down
Any chick that you stick is real sleazy
Before I need you, I betcha gon' need me
You ain't want me anyway way, you wanted to be me
What made you think I'd keep you around
While I, work my ass off and you just lounge
You slump, bump, son of a gun
And a, how much your worth
I think negative Don

[Hook]
Oh who you give it to
Who you gonna steal it from
Who's your next victim
Oh who you gonna lie to
Who you gonna cheat on
Who you gonna leave alone
Oh what you gonna tell her
After she discovers you don't really love her
Oh gonna be a showdown, knock down drag out
Gunslinger shoot 'em up

You musta thought you had game like nigga what
Walk around like you down, you don't give a fuck
Cause you don't really want beef until you hit the streets
See I ma lover, not a fighter but I'll crack your teeth
Boy plea plea nah don't bother me
Cause when you had me, you ain't know how to chill with me
But now you up on dem knees, still jocking me
But I ma say it real real, keep it real

Cause I'm the deal, still here with appeal and it's real

29,Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning),"[Verse 1]
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

[Chorus]
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

[Verse 2]
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?
Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

[Chorus]
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man

And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile since I first saw you
And it's been awhile since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile since I could call you

[Chorus]
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that are rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

[Verse 2]

It's been awhile since I could say I love myself as well and
It's been awhile since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do
And it's been awhile, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

And everything I can't remember

I've gone and fucked things up again, again

Mine was wonderful with you by my side
And when I opened my eyes and see your sweet face

Well since you came along
I can face the dawn

41,Drops Of Jupiter (Tell Me),"[Verse 1]
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey

[Chorus 1]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mmm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Chorus 2]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?

I was just out of the service thumbing through the classifieds
When an ad that said, ""old Chevy"" somehow caught my eye
The lady didn't know the year or even if it ran
But I had that thousand dollars in my hand

[Verse 2]
It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn
With thirty years of dust and dirt on that green Army tarp
And when I pulled the cover off, it took away my breath
What she called a Chevy was a sixty-six Corvette

[Verse 3]
I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills
What a thrill I got when I sat behind the wheel
I opened up the glove box and that's when I found the note
The date was nineteen sixty-six and this is what he wrote

[Chorus]
He said, ""My name is Private Andrew Malone
And if you're reading this, then I didn't make it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of mine, now it belongs to you
And though you may take her and make her your own
You'll always be riding with Private Malone""

[Verse 4]
Well, it didn't take me long at all, I had her running good
I loved to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood
I had her shining like a diamond and I'd put the ragtop down
All the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her through town

[Verse 5]
The buttons on the radio didn't seem to work quite right
But it picked up that oldie show, especially late at night
I'd get the feeling sometimes, if I turned real quick I'd see
A soldier ridin' shotgun in the seat right next to me

[Chorus]
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
He told me to take her and make her my own
And I was proud to be riding with Private Malone

[Bridge]
Well, one night it was raining hard, I took the curve too fast
I still don't remember much about that fiery crash
Someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out
They didn't get his name, but I know without a doubt

[Chorus]
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
And I know I wouldn't be here if he hadn't tagged along
Yeah, that night, I was riding with Private Malone
Oh, thank God, I was riding with Private Malone

That don't make you the one
We ain't even in love
You know that you play

[Chorus] (P. Diddy)
Play with my emotions, you gets no devotion
You gets no love, gets no love
You can't get no love from me
You can't even be my friend (yeah)
And you gets no love again (come on)
Said you gets no love, gets no love
(Ayo, Faith, let me talk to 'em one time, check this out)
You gets no love from me

[P. Diddy]
Yo, how the situation get so raw
To the point we don't kiss no more
Things I miss, you don't miss no more
That night I met you on the disco floor
Every night since missed you more
Making hits on tour
Now when I knock, you don't answer the door
The phone ring, you don't answer no more
'Cause you ain't tryna chance it no more
Got to find me a new diva
Something pretty for P. Diddy and his two-seater

[Loon]
Now you could never have a piece of my love
So when you see me don't reach for no hug
And don't speak in the club
Don't tell me how you deeply in love
Other day you tried to greet me with thugs
That wanted to heat me with slugs
See the message on my beeper was bugged
Try to chill, lay deep in the cut
But you keeping it up
Even my girl think of beating you up
The way you keeping in touch
She don't know if niggas cheating or what

[Bridge]
Boy, we had a cool relationship
But you couldn't handle it

Play with my emotions, you gets no devotion
Whatever you do it will come back to you
You can't even be my friend
And you gets no love again
Said you gets no love, gets no love, gets no love from me

Play with my emotions, you gets no devotions
Whatever you do it will come back to you
You can't even be my friend
And you gets no love again

My niggas that was there from the beginning
Been wit me even 'fore they knew what bein' with me was
Y'all niggas just glanced at it, now I got y'all staring at it

Who wanted to come and ask something stupid

Putting it down for my niggas in the south side
North Carolina, South Carolina
And all my little bitty overlooked hick towns
We gonna hit y'all asses, ain't nothing but a T. T. blast
What we got coming at you?
(Beats?) slamming, (verses?) classic
(Gold for this) What's after platinum?
(Baby you don't want the bomb)
And I don't meant to scare ya
But I'm about to bring it home
Blow these valleys, these hills, these streams
And N. C. outta the water

Take a little trip, hater, pack up your mind
Look forward, not behind, then you'll see what you find

Now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-
-ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See ain't nothing changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin' at the airport who got laid off
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise

Player, I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat running like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stones, gather no moss
Mommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah, then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music, we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing, God-willing, all things that are doable

She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist

Asked her what tribe she with: red dot or feather

And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough""

Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick that plays her part
And if it goes down, y'all, that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the NARCs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma she's always on the scene
God damn she's fine but she parties all the time!
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
That means I'm new-school, pop pills and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first class seat

Free from all the game (free from all the pain)
Free from all the stress (free from all the stress)

Whether we win or loose
And I choose to win

And for that reason I gotta say goodbye

A situation where the best thing you could do
Was the hardest thing you've ever done
But you try to do what's right

That I really wanna be there by your side
But I can't stand to see you cry

Do you think that cuz I packed your stuff
That inside I'm really really crackin' up
Cuz you're wrong, I just hide it good

You gotta learn to love somebody else

Sometimes I ask my heart did we really, give our love a chance (Just one more chance)
But I know without a doubt, we turned it inside out
And if we walked away would it make more sense
But it tears me up inside, just to think we could still try

How long must we keep runnin' on a carousel
Goin' 'round and 'round and never gettin' anywhere, on a wing and prayer

67,Wish You Were Here,"[Verse 1]
I dig my toes into the sand
The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket
I lean against the wind, pretend that I am weightless
And in this moment I am happy–happy

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Verse 2]
I lay my head onto the sand
The sky resembles a back-lit canopy with holes punched in it
I'm counting UFOs, I signal them with my lighter
And in this moment I am happy–happy

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Verse 3]
The world's a roller coaster
And I am not strapped in
Maybe I should hold with care
But my hands are busy in the air saying

I wish you were here
I wish you were...

Yeah

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Welcome to Atlanta, home of them dirty birds
Anybody hatin' get kicked to the curb
Any other team is absurd
Wearing black, white, silver, red is for the Blood
No one scared of getting dirty 'cause we came from the mud
And we hungrier than ever, he rise, she rise
We rise together, birds of a flock
More like birds of a feather
No one here to party until we get the Lombardi
When we giving up? Never
Scratch it off your wishlist, mark it on your calendar
A-town players never play wit' no amateurs
Eighty thou' strong and the fans all screaming
We get knocked down and we coming up swinging
And we putting in work, all done in brotherhood
Yeah, we like family and ATL's motherhood
Brand new home, let the games begin
This season, we back at it again

Now the party don't start 'til I walk in
And all I'm thinking 'bout is the Superbowl again
But in the meantime, in between time
It's been heavy on my mind since '99
See, I've been putting it down here since '83
Since William Andrews and Bartkowski
When Fulton County stadium was the place to be
If you rep the A-town, then you feel just like me
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballin-ist Player
Make my own rules and call me the mayor
Tail-gating in the parking lot, it's like the club
The energy, the brotherhood, everybody rise up
Together, we rise on the rest
And the rest of these guys
The badge of our pride
Around the city, all sides
Brand new home, let the games begin
'Cause this season, we gon' do it again, holla

Sometimes I feel like I'm on top of the heap

Sometimes I feel like just a bump on the street

Some days it's touch and go
But baby, this I know

And it feels right as rain
All my worries wash away
When you're with me

You are a lazy summer day on a porch swing
You are a night running wild on the town
My red Ferrari racing me down a back street

73,From Her Mama (Mama Got A**),"[Verse 1: Alex Oliver]
'Member growing up, as a buck blowing up
Even then taking drugs, get in trouble and disrupt
Adults would erupt, consult my mom and such
They would try to tell stories, stop me from acting up
Teacher tell a tale of a woman that would tail
If you told a tall story it gets gory in detail
Oh well, I guess they failed I was strongly against it
I should mention...tale got my attention
Beautiful woman, stalks juvenile students
In dead of night, in ya’ sights stops where ya' heading
You're full fright, it’s alright, just asks a question
Makes you feel, there's no need to be threatened
Flowing black hair, glowing beauty that's rare
Cover her face they'd swear, and she makes you wanna stare
She speaks her words, your death's ensured
And if you run away, your fate's still secured
Once upon a time, a woman was so fine
Men thought she was divine, and deserved her own shine
Her jealous husband with overzealous children
And he felt threatened she got men's attention
He's overbearing, when they’re all staring
He’s glaring at her and snapping at her
Then they're feeling distant, when it gets consistent
She starts to wary, their marriage hairy
Sh-sh-she meets a jerry that treats her fairly
Its getting scary wants to remarry
He thinks she’s sexy, she thinks he's sexy
What happens next B, you should guess see
Husband finds out, in a rage all about
Takes a knife to her mouth, stretch the whole thing out
No one will think that you're pretty again
Blood on the floor, screams hear all of them
She dies of suicide right in front of the man
But the tale says that she will rise again
With vengeance in hand, take revenge on all man
She'll take a knife and stab you til’ you die, take ya' skin
Why is this fiction stuck in my dome?
Why I'm thinking about story when I'm on my own?
I'm remembering this story when I'm walking home
Strange feeling, but I guess I'm not alone

[Chorus: Alex Oliver]
Ma said beware of the slit mouth woman
Ma said beware of the slit mouth woman
Ma said beware of the slit mouth woman
Of the slit mouth woman
Of the slit mouth woman
You encounter her, then it must be fate
Can't get away, something you can't shake
No right answer everything's a mistake
Suffer same fate if you see her face

[Verse 2: Alex Oliver]
In the park for this story, so I move a lil' quickly
Remark softly ""I'm sickly"" and I feel a bit chilly
Yea it's dark and stormy and I feel a bit silly
But this arc ain't really 'bout the tale of two cities
Walking home, see an attractive Asian
I'm contemplating attempts at persuasion
Mouth's half covered, I'm ignoring information
Approaches me, for conversation
She asks “am I pretty?” and I couldn't say no
Hand reaches for her mask, takes it off so slow
Scar from her mouth to each ear lobe
She asks ""am I pretty now?"" and I'm just froze
Withdraws large, blood smeared sheers
Paralyzed right here
See her insides from her mouth, ear to ear
Turn around, try to run, in hopes to get clear
But her footsteps are near, I always hear
Still try to book it even if though I know
She's in the corner of my eye no matter where I go
Get back to my apartment, close all compartments
Feel my heart my stop, then proceed to vomit
Can't go to sleep, can't even eat
Peep every few hours, trying to fight the sleep
Doze off for second I reckon, but then
There's a blade in the air followed by a door slam

Ma said beware of the slit mouth woman

I could let some of this anger fade

Is the bed that I have made

When all this I was going through

You're with me
Til the bitter end
What we have transcends
This experience
Too painful to
Talk about
So I'll hold it in
Til my heart can mend
And be brave enough to love again

A place in time
Still belongs to us
Stays preserved in my mind
In the memories there is solace

Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
Always remember

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

[Chorus 2]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

[Bridge]
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong

Well I was rolling wheels and shifting gears
Around that Jersey Turnpike
Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
Said sir you broke the limit in that rusty old truck
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from

[Chorus]
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

[Verse 2]
Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
The sign said finger-licking
Well I paid the tab and the lady asked me
How'd I like my biscuit

It ain't like mama fixed it

I was chasing sun on 101
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
Said no thanks ma'am, back home
We like the girls that sing soprano

Well I was headed home on 65
Somewhere around Kentucky

That's rolling on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
No, but you might have seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa

My dash is 180, my weed half a pound
When the smoke in the air my nose like basset hounds
I don't stash the 'dro, nigga, divide
I'm that nigga that ride with trigger to give a supply
High is how I stay all the time

Yo, bitches, shut all your blinds!
If I'm hard to find, take two puffs and pass
I stay back, but my Benz moved up a class

And I'm not old, but I am getting a whole lot older every day
It's too late to keep from going crazy, I've got to get away

Shit I ain't choose to rhyme; rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin' - like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now, but it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer? That sucks for you
'Cause this is Bubba's moment - I put my mother on it
I said my momma; it seems as if I love her don't it?
So buckle up, cause it's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's, and my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk - gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth; but ain't no joke inside
This is complicated - at least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million, then I'll call it quits
But until that day, y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw you crank it cause I just leap through you
What you need to do, is just admit you love me

Though I am country, don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger, with every song I hear
'Cause y'all been bullshittin', spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days and came with somethin' that truly matters
On goes the saga - of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrow, if I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now; I hate it came to this
How else can I say it I don't speak no other languages
I'm fairly ripped now, so this the jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha? That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem' bows - fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just forget what we discussin'
This that new South - take a picture of me
'Cause I'm a fuckin' legend, and this is gettin' ugly

Now this thang is jumpin' - ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special, this whole moment came from nothin'
Now you see it triples; I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets hatin' broads clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin' to live, you with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin', then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law - they can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions; I wanna see you wylin'
And if Bubba dies tonight - know he was smilin'

Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream
'Tis the star-spangled banner! O long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more
Their blood has wiped out their foul footstep's pollution
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation
Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation
Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust""
And the star-spangled banner forever shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave",Whitney Houston,Whitney Houston,2001,"[89, 82, 90, 85, 85, 80, 59, 38, 18, 6, 13, 72, 97, 50]",14

Effervescent.. time time's of the essence
Make 'em undress in less than three seconds
So whores keep steppin whores keep slobbin
Sex as a weapon, clothes that I slept in
Streets keep mobbin, thieves keep robbin
Get two in yoor butt, three to your noggin
Creepin and crawlin, I'm incogneg'

Woke up this mornin' (yeah)
You got yourself a gun (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got yourself a gun

Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 1]
My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames a huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, ‘cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody!

[Chorus]
I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a, barber's preciseness
Bravehearted for life, it's
The return of the Golden Child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never! 'Member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me ""God's Son"" with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 3]
It's, the, return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist' – I floss
Stick-shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (uhh)

But I must have had my momma's will
And God's amazing grace

Even if this love's to die for
Because your bags are packed and I ain't crying
You're walking out and I'm not trying to change your mind
Because I was born to be

[Chorus]
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

[Verse 2]
I don't believe in self-pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
Though my life is changing fast
Who I am is who I want to be

The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed

Who loves her kids and never stops

I ran into a friend of yours the other day
And I asked her how you've been
She said 'My girl is fine, just bought a house, got a job, real good man'
I told her I was glad for you, that's wonderful
But does she ever ask 'bout me?
'She says she's happy with her life right now, let her go, let her be.'

And I told myself I would but something in my heart just would not let you go
I just wanna know...

What if we were wrong about each other?
What if you were really made for me?
What if we were supposed to be together?
Would that not mean anything?
What if that was supposed to be my house that you go home to every day?
How can you be sure that things are better
If you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me?
Still wanting me

[Verse 2]
Your friend asked me if there was someone special in my life that I was seeing
I told her there was no one in particular
There's just I, myself, and me
I told her that I dream of you quite often
She just cut her eyes at me
She said you got a home, you're very happy
So just stop your meddling

[Pre-Chorus]
I told her that I won't
I said things are cool, but I guess I was wrong
I still can't move on

What if we were wrong about each other?
What if you were really made for me?
What if we were supposed to be together?
Would that not mean anything?

If you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me?

Now that could be my car
That could be my house
That could be my baby boy that you're nursing
That could be the trash which I always take out
That could be the chair that I love to chill in
That could be my food on the table at the end of the day
Hugs and the kisses, all the love we make
What the hell do you expect me to say?
What if it's really supposed to be this way?
What if you're really supposed to be with me?
Oh...

What if we were wrong about each other?
What if you were really made for me?

And I see it in your face right now you wish I shut up

I was gutter when ya met me, gutter when ya left me
Gutter when ya came back face it nothin' can change that
Not romance nor romance counselin'
You drop the ball now i'm bouncin'
Find me a room burn up an ounce and
Waitin' for my baby to call foregive it all
On some break up to makeup shit givin' me draws
I dore mi amor, but everytime she choose to go to war
I'm lookin' at the front door

To-day I made up my mind - to get away
Every-day, I sit and pray, everyday, every-day

I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door

Consider your bags outside the door

96,God Bless America,"""God Bless America""
By Irving Berlin

While the storm clouds gather far across the sea
Let us swear allegiance to a land that's free
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair, as we
Raise our voices in a solemn prayer

God Bless America, land that I love
Stand beside her and guide her
Through the night with a light from above
From the mountains, to the prairies
To the oceans white with foam
God Bless America, my home sweet home
God Bless America, my home sweet home

This goes out to my nigga Q - rest in peace baby (I miss you dog)

The city, the farmer, the babies, the mama (what?!)
The projects, the drugs (uhh!), the children, the thugs
(uhh!) The tears, the hugs, the love, the slugs (c'mon!)
The funerals, the wakes, the churches, the coffins (uhh!)
The heartbroken mothers, it happens, too often (why?!)

Yonkers, the Bronx (uhh!), Brooklyn, Harlem (c'mon!)
The hurt, the pain, the dirt, the rain (uhh!)
The jerk, the fame, the work, the game (uhh!)
The friends, the foes, the Benz, the hoes (what?!)

The release, the warning, ""Try not, to get in trouble"" (damn!)
The snitches, the odds (uhh), probation, parole (what?!)
The new charge, the bail, the warrant, the hole (damn!)
The cell, the bus, the ride, up North (uh-huh)
The greens, the boots, the yard, these hearts (uhh!)
The fightin', the stabbin', the pullin', the grabbin' (what?!)
The riot squad with the captain, nobody knows what happened
(what?!) The two years in a box, revenge, the plots (uhh!)
The twenty-three hours that's locked, the one hour that's not
(uhh!) The silence, the dark, the mind, so fragile (aight!)
The wish, that the streets, would have took you, when they had you
(damn) The days, the months, the years, despair
One night on my knees, here it comes, the prayer

(uh-huh) My ups, and downs (uhh), my slips, my falls (uhh)
My trials and tribulations (uhh), my heart, my balls (uhh)
My mother, my father, I love 'em, I hate 'em (uhh!)
Wish God, I didn't have 'em, but I'm glad that he made 'em
(uhh!) The roaches, the rats, the strays, the cats (what, what?!)
The guns, knives and bats, everytime we scrap
The hustlin', the dealin', the robbin', the stealin' (uhh!)
The shit, hit the ceiling', little boy, with no feelings
(damn) The frustration, rage, trapped inside a cage
Got beatin's 'til the age, I carried a twelve gauge
(aight!) Somebody stop me (please!), somebody come and get me
(what?!) Little did I know, that the Lord was ridin' with me
The dark, the light (uhh), my heart (uhh), the fight (uhh)
The wrong (uhh!), the right (uhh!), it's gone (uhh!), aight?

98,Hit 'Em Up Style (Oops!),"[Verse 1]
While he was scheming
I was beamin' in the Beamer just steamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman Marcus on a shopping spree-ah
And on my way I grabbed Sole and Mia
And as the cashbox rang, I thought everything away

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oops) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops) There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
(Oops) There goes the house we've made a home
(Oops) There goes ""You'll never leave me alone""
(Oops) For all the lies you told
This is what you're owed

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

[Verse 2]
While he was braggin'
I was coming down the hill just draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
And I paid, all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just faded away, away

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oops) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops) There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
(Oops) There goes the house we've made a home
(Oops) There goes ""you'll never leave me alone""
(Oops) For all the lies you told
This is what you owe

[Chorus]
Hey ladies (Hey ladies), when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh (Oh), when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
Hey ladies (Ladies), when ya man wanna get buck wild (Oh)
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If you mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

[Bridge]
All of the dreams you sold
Left me out in the cold
What happened to the days when we used to trust each other?
And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old
To get 'em back without me
'Cause revenge is just better than money, you'll see

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style (Hit 'em up style)
Get your hands on his cash and (Oh yeah)
Oh, when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
Hey ladies (Hey ladies, hey ladies, hey ladies, yeah)
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

99,Crawling,"[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

This is my right
A right given by God
To live a free life
To live in freedom

Talking about freedom
I'm talking about freedom

Anyone tries to take it away

101,Every Other Time,"Come on
Every other, every other time

I said let's talk about it
As she walked out on me and slammed the door
But I just laugh about it
'Cause she's always playin' those games, come on

Deep down I know she loves me
But she's got a funny way of showin' me how she cares
Last night she did a doughnut on my lawn
And drove out with one finger in the air, oh yeah

Sometimes it's black, sometimes it's white
Sometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she'll just change her mind

Sometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when I think about it, I'm so in love with her every other time
Yeah, every other time

Sometimes we sit around
Just the two of us, on the park bench
Sometimes we swim around
Like the dolphins in the ocean of our hearts

But then I think about the time
When we broke up before the prom
And you told everyone that I was gay
Okay

Sometimes I walk around the town
For hours just to settle down
But I take you back and you kick me down
'Cause that's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it

Sometimes it's black, sometimes it's white
Sometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she'll just change her mind

Sometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when I think about it, I'm so in love with her every other time
Yeah, every other time

Keep it up home girl, don't you quit
You know the way you scream is the ultimate
And when I walk away, just watch the clock
I bet I don't even get around the block

I said let's talk about it
As she walked out on me and slammed the door
One day we'll laugh about it
'Cause we're always playin' those games, every other time

Sometimes it's black, sometimes it's white
Sometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she'll just change her mind

Sometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when I think about it, I'm so in love with her every other time
Yeah, every other time

Keep it up homegirl, don't you quit

102,Fat Lip,"[Verse 1]
Storming through the party like my name was El Niño
When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino
As a kid
I was a skid
And no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party
'Cause nobody came

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never going, never showing up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearing ""act your age""

[Hook]
I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down

[Verse 2]
Be...cause...you...don't...
Know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause we like having fun at other peoples expense and
Cutting people down is just a minor offense then
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn

[Hook]
I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down

[Bridge]
Don't count on me, to let you know when
Don't count on me, I'll do it again
Don't count on me, it's the point you're missing
Don't count on me, 'cause I'm not listening

[Verse 3]
Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat (Back-packed!)
And I don't give a shit about nothing
You be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing
Then if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringing off the hook
You're on the hit list, (wanted!) in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom should have had an abortion

[Hook]
I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity

All with lutterd legges,   lokkerd unfair,           With legs all bowed, covered with ugly hair
Filtered unfreely,   with fomand lippes -            That was churlishly matted, with foaming lips
The foulest of figure   that formed was ever!
He baltered, he blered,   he braundished thereafter;           danced about; grimaced
To batail he bounes him   with bustous clawes;           prepares himself; wild
He romed, he rored,   that rogged all the erthe,           bellowed; roared; rocked
So rudely he rapped at   to riot himselven!           So violently he stamped on (the earth) to enjoy himself

Then the dragon on dregh   dressed him againes           finally came against him
And with his duttes him drove   on dregh by the welken;           blows; afar; sky
He fares as a faucon,   frekly he strikes;           falcon; boldly
Both with feet and with fire   he fightes at ones.
The bere in the batail   the bigger him seemed,           bear
And bites him boldly   with baleful tuskes;
Such buffetes he him reches   with his brode klokes,           gives; claws
His breste and his brayell   was bloody all over.           breast; waist
He ramped so rudely   that all the erthe rives,           He reared up on his hind legs so rudely that all the earth was shaken
Runnand on red blood   as rain of the heven!           Running
He had weried the worm   by wightness of strenghe           wearied; serpent; stoutness
Ne were it not for the wild fire   that he him with defendes.           himself

Then wanders the worm   away to his heightes,           serpent
Comes glidand fro the cloudes   and coupes full even,           strikes directly
Touches him with his talones   and teres his rigge,           tears; back
Betwix the taile and the top   ten foot large!           long
Thus he brittened the bere   and brought him o live,           Thus he beat down the bear and killed him
Let him fall in the flood,   fleet where him likes.           float
So they thring the bold king   binne the ship-borde,           These dreams so oppress the king aboard the ship
That ner he bristes for bale   on bed where he ligges.           That he nearly bursts for pain on the bed where he lies

Then waknes the wise king,   wery fortravailed,           wakens; wearily exhausted
Takes him two philosophers   that followed him ever,
In the seven science   the sutelest founden,           most subtle
The cunningest of clergy   under Crist knowen;           most learned of scholars
He told them of his torment   that time that he sleeped:
""Dreched with a dragon   and such a derf beste,           Harassed; dire beast
Has made me full wery,   as wisse me Our Lord;           guide
Ere I mon swelt as swithe,   ye tell me my swefen!""           Before I must die quickly, interpret my dream for me

""Sir,"" said they soon then,   these sage philosophers,           immediately; wise
""The dragon that thou dremed of,   so dredful to shew,           dreamed; behold
That come drivand over the deep   to drenchen thy pople,           driving; drown
Soothly and certain   thyselven it is,
That thus sailes over the se   with thy seker knightes.           trusty
The coloures that were casten   upon his clere winges           shining
May be thy kingrikes all,   that thou has right wonnen,           kingdoms
And the tattered tail,   with tonges so huge,           tongues
Betokens this fair folk   that in thy fleet wendes.           Signifies
The bere that brittened was   aboven in the cloudes           beaten down
Betokenes the tyrauntes   that tormentes thy pople
Or elles with some giaunt   some journee shall happen,           else; day's fight
In singular batail   by yourselve one;           battle; alone
And thou shall have the victory,   through help of Our Lord,
As thou in thy vision   was openly shewed.
Of this dredful dreme   ne drede thee no more,           dream
Ne care not, sir conquerour,   but comfort thyselven
And these that sailes over the se   with thy seker knightes.""

With trumpes then tristly   they trussen up their sailes           trumpet calls; boldly
And rowes over the rich se,   this rout all at ones;           company
The comly coste of Normandy   they catchen full even           coast; reach
And blithely at Barflete   these bold are arrived,           Barfleur
And findes a fleet there   of frendes ynow,
The flowr and the fair folk   of fifteen rewmes,           kingdoms
For kinges and capitaines   keeped him fair,           awaited
As he at Carlisle commaunded   at Cristenmass himselven.

By they had taken the land   and tentes up rered,           By the time; reared
Comes a Templar tite   and touched to the king;           quickly; told
""Here is a tyraunt beside   that tormentes thy pople,

After even-song   Sir Arthur himselven
Went to his wardrope   and warp off his weedes           wardrobe; threw; clothes
Armed him in a aketoun   with orfrayes full rich;           padded jacket; gold trim
Aboven, on that, a jerin   of Acres out over;           Upon that, a leather jacket

With graines and gobelets,   glorious of hew.           seed pearls; jewels
He braces a brode sheld   and his brand askes,           He puts on the arm straps (braces) of a broad shield and asks for his sword
Bouned him a brown steed   and on the bente hoves;           Went to; ground waits
He stert til his stirrup   and strides on loft,           leapt; aloft
Straines him stoutly   and stirres him fair,
Broches the bay steed   and to the busk rides,           Spurs; bush
And there his knightes him keeped   full clenlich arrayed.           waited

Then they rode by that river   that runned so swithe,           swiftly
There the rindes over-reches   with real boughes;           trees reach over; stately
The roe and the reindeer   reckless there runnen,           roe deer
In ranes and in rosers   to riot themselven;           bushes; rosebushes; amuse

With faucons and fesauntes   of ferlich hewes;           falcons; pheasants; wondrous

It might salve him of sore   that sound was never!

Then ferkes this folk   and on foot lightes,           goes
Fastenes their fair steedes   o ferrom between;           They tie their horses with a good distance between them
And then the king keenly   commaunded his knightes
For to bide with their blonkes   and boun no further;           horses; go
""For I will seek this saint   by myselve one
And mele with this master man   that this mount yemes,           speak; possesses
And senn shall ye offer,   either after other           And afterwards you shall make your offerings, each after the other

The king covers the crag   with cloughes full high,           gets to; ravines
To the crest of the cliff   he climbes on loft,
Cast up his umbrere   and keenly he lookes,           visor
Caught of the cold wind   to comfort himselven.
Two fires he findes   flamand full high;
The fourtedele a furlong   between them he walkes;           quarter to

Then this woful wife   unwinly him greetes,           woman unhappily

For, and thou see him with sight,   thee serves no herte           For, if you see him with your eyes, you will not have the heart

104,Be Like That,"[Verse 1]
He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen
Then he lies awake and he wonders
""Why can’t that be me?""
'Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
He’s left a lot of things he’d rather not mention right now
But just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

[Chorus]
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?

Now and dreams we run

[Verse 2]
She spends her days up in the north park
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream
Is that too much to ask?
With a safe home, and a warm bed
On a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold onto
That’s all she needs
Yeah

[Chorus]
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?

I’m falling into the same dreams
We run away

If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I could be like that

Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?

If I could be like that

108,Fill Me In,"[Intro]
I got something to say, something to say
Alright (Can you feel me?)
Come on
Can you fill me in?
What you want? What you want me to do, baby?
Can you fill me in?
Let's talk about it

[Verse 1]
I was checking this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned said, ""Hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, ""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?""
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (It's another one, it's another one)

[Verse 2]
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""Hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, ""Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
Out went the girls, but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in?
Wearing a jacket, who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (Can you tell me?)
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)""

[Bridge]
All they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby
Watchin' our every move
Think some day they might approve, baby

[Chorus]
""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?

[Intro]
""Ladies and gentlemen
Let's put our hands together for this dynasty!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
To the 8th wonder of the world!
The flow of the century, always timeless: HOV!
Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me, I appreciate that, ah""

[Verse 1]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't-born-hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof! —Vamoose, son of a bitch!

[Chorus]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let them know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show them how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk mo' bucks

[Chorus]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 3]
Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' their mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail: the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game: the two things that's great
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets bu-sy

[Chorus]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A

Now my momma told me in this dog-eat-dog world
You gotta work harder than a man
She'd say, yeah that's just what you need

Night falls, I slow down
I start dreamin' of you comin' around

It's just what I need on a night like this
A long walk in the dark, someone I can't resist

When I look at you I think that's just what I need

MR. STEINBRENNER: All the way to the floor! What are you crazy! You'd suffocate in there. Your lucky you have any doors at all. You know when I was in the army...... Hey Costanza. What's that your eating over there? It looks pretty tasty.

GEORGE: It's a calzone, sir.

ELAINE: That's what I said.

JERRY: So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Huh.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: No. nothing.

Kramer walks in

JERRY: What's with you?

KRAMER: Feel this.

JERRY: Wow.That's hot.

GEORGE AND MR. STEINBRENNER AT YANKEE STADIUM

MR. STEINBRENNER: I am loving this calzone. The pita pocket prevents it from dripping. The pita pocket. (phone rings)What is it Watson? A lost and found. No. I don't think we need that. If people keel over because they lost something that's there tough luck. You got a drip on your mouth by the way.

GEORGE: You know a lost and found could be a good idea.

MR. STEINBRENNER: Hold on Watson. You like lost and found George?

GEORGE: Definitely.

MR. STEINBRENNER: All right lost and found. But these got to be a time limit. We're not running a pawn shop here.

JERRY: With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.

GEORGE: So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.

JERRY: So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.

GEORGE: Not bills.

JERRY: So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.

GEORGE: Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.

JERRY: You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....

ELAINE: Oh is that so.

JERRY: Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.

ELAINE: What are you talking about?

JERRY: Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner

ELAINE: If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.

JERRY: Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.

MR. STEINBRENNER: Corn beef. I don't think so. It is a little fatty.

GEORGE: How about Chinese?

MR. STEINBRENNER: Uhhhhh. No. Too many containers. Big mess, big mess. Too sloppy.I want to stick with the calzones from Pisano's. That's the ticket.

GEORGE: I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.

MR. STEINBRENNER: No, no, no. George let me tell you something. When I find something I like I stick with it. From 1973 to 1982 I ate the exact same lunch everyday. Turkey chili in a bowl made out of bread. Bread bowl George. First you eat the chili then you eat the bowl. There's nothing more satisfying than looking down after lunch and seeing nothing but a table.

TODD WALKING ELAINE TO HER APARTMENT

ELAINE: Thanks for the dinner.

TODD: Well I had to give these cigars and we were both hungry.

ELAINE: Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?

TODD: Elaine that was a legitimate bet and I lost so I bought you dinner.

ELAINE: Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight.

Kramer leaves

GEORGE: Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.

JERRY: so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?

GEORGE: What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.

JERRY: Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?

GEORGE: Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.

JERRY: No. I never had a job.

GEORGE: Are you going to help me or not?

NEWMAN: All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.

GEORGE: What?

NEWMAN: Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....

GEORGE: All right.

NEWMAN: And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.

GEORGE: That's a little steep don't you think?

NEWMAN: You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.

GEORGE: All right, all right.

NEWMAN: Do we have a deal?

GEORGE: But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.

NEWMAN: I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[Verse 1]
She caught me by surprise, I must say
'Cause I never have seen a pretty face
With such a warm and beautiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style

I was fascinated surely
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say...

[Chorus]
Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?

[Verse 2]
Don't care if I get rejected

'Cause I watched them fall away

Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication

The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication

I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from the squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance

There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication

Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
(Girl you taste so good to me)
Know what I mean, peaches and cream

[Verse 2 - Q]
I never thought that I would be
So addicted to you
On top, underneath, on the side of you
Better yet baby right next to you
Love the way you're just flowin down
And I can feel it all around
In the front, in the back of you
Ooh I love the smell of you
Girl you know what I'm talking about

[Hook - 112 (Q)
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend (ooh)
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine (ooohhh)
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream

[Rap breakdown - Mike (112)]
Won't stop girl you know I can't get enough
Wanna taste it in the morning when I'm waking up
Like peach cobbler in my stomach when I eat it up
Got your arms around my neck and I can't get up
See the boys 112 we from the A'
(A' - shorty we don't play)
And when it comes to eating peaches, shorty we don't play
So all the ladies in the house if your peach the shit
Put your hands in the air represent your clique

[Hook - 112 (Slim)]
Peaches and cream (Oooh)
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend (That's right)
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine  (Girl you are tasty)
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream

Oh girl I need it
I gotta have it
It's always on my mind
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I like it in my car
Or even in my bed
Or baby on the stairs
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream

Oh girl I need it
I gotta have it
It's always on my mind
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I like it in my car
Or even in my bed
Or baby on the stairs
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream

I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream

136,Where The Blacktop Ends,"[Chorus]
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends

[Verse 1]
I'm looking' down the barrel of Friday night
Riding' on a river of freeway lights
Goodbye city I'm country bound
Till Monday rolls around

[Chorus]
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends

[Verse 2]
Working in the grind is an uphill road
Punching that clock and carrying that load
I bust it all week and then I'm free
The weekend belongs to me

[Chorus]
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends

[Bridge]
Give me some fresh air give me that farm
Give me some time with you in my arms
Far away from the hustle and the pressure and the noise

[Chorus]
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends

137,The Space Between,"[Verse 1]
You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you, for me
No corner you could squeeze me?
But I got all the time for you, love

[Hook]
The space between
The tears we cry
Is the laughter - keeps us coming back for more
The space between
The wicked lies we tell
In hope to keep safe from the pain

[Verse 2]
But will I hold you again?
These fickle, fuddled words confuse me
Like 'Will it rain today?'
Waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

[Hook 2]
We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild-eyed beast you be
The space between
The wicked lies we tell
In hope to keep safe from the pain

[Breakdown]
Will I hold you again?
Will I hold...
Look at us spinning out in
The madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like
A devil in a church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do, my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

[Hook 3]
The space between
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go
The space between
The bullets in our firefight
Is where I'll be hiding, waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room
The space between
Our wicked lies
Is where we hope to keep safe from pain
Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Oh, right out of here
Is all we need dear
The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding, waiting for you
The space between
Your heart and mind
Is a space we'll fill with time
The space between
The tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
The space between
Our wicked lies where we hope to keep safe from pain
The space between
The space between",Dave Matthews Band,Dave Matthews Band,2001,"[47, 50, 36, 28, 25, 24, 22, 22, 22, 25, 28, 31, 35, 39, 39, 39, 48, 61, 72, 79, 79, 79, 79]",23
138,All Or Nothing,"[Verse 1]
I know when he's been on your mind
That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realize
It's over, over
It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's got to give
As sharing this relationship
Gets older, older

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there?
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair

[Chorus]
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's no where left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

[Verse 2]
There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you in memories
I feel it in my heart, but I don't show it, show it
And then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
There's times I don't believe it's right
I know it, know it

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me promises
Baby, you never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
It's time to show and tell

[Chorus]
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing

[Bridge]
'Cause you and I
Could lose it all if you've got no more room
Nowhere, inside, for me in your life
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
It's now or never

[Chorus]
Is it all or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all
Or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?

And if you want to leave, I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

[Verse 2]
I'm not worried 'bout the ring you wear
'Cause as long as no one knows, then nobody can care
You're feelin' guilty and I'm well aware
But you don't look ashamed, and baby I'm not scared

I'm not the reason that you go astray and
We'll be alright if you don't ask me to stay

Why does the color of my coffee match your eyes?
Why do I see you when a stranger passes by?
I swear I hear you in the whisper of the wind
I feel you when the sun is dancin' on my skin
And when it's raining
You won't find me complaining 'cause

When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

[Verse 2:]
The taste of sugar sure reminds me of your kiss
I like the way that they both linger on my lips
Kisses remind me of a field of butterflies
It must be the way my heart is fluttering inside
Beautiful distraction
You make every thought a chain reaction

[Chorus:]
When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

Anywhere I go, anything I do
Everything around me, baby
Makes me think of you

When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune

145,What I Really Meant To Say,"(Cyndi Thomson/Chris Waters/Tommy Lee James)

It took me by surprise
When I saw you standin' there
Close enough to touch
Breathin' the same air
You asked me how I'd been
I guess that's when I smiled and said just fine
Oh, but baby I was lyin'

What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
(And, that's what I really meant to say)

And as you walked away
The echo of my words
Cut just like a knife
Cut so deep it hurt
I held back the tears
Held on to my pride and watched you go
I wonder if you'll ever know

What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
(And, that's what I really meant to say)

What I really meant to say
Is I'm really not that strong
No matter how I try
I'm still holdin' on
And here's the honest truth
I'm still in love with you
And, that's what I really meant to say

That's what I really meant to say
That's what I really meant to say",Cyndi Thomson,Cyndi Thomson,2001,"[41, 33, 32, 26, 31, 36, 38, 39, 38, 47, 54, 54, 58, 64, 74, 74, 89, 94, 96, 98]",20

Just like music..

To relax my mind, so I can be free
And ab-sorb sound that keep me 'round
Doin my thang, constantly with no worries
Peace to Keith Murray.. (""just like music"")
To keep me flowin and keep me goin
And keep me growin, and keep me the E from knowin
What happens out there, is not my concern
You wanna die it's not my turn (""just like music"")
To do somethin to me like jump in the Mercedes
On the highway, doin over eighty
Without music baby.. (""Oww! I'll go crazy.. just like music"")
Make me call my homey on the phone
Like there's somethin new out, that got me in the zone
Just that feelin, got me
I wish music can adopt me (""just like music"")

(Chorus: Marvin Gaye)
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music - just like music

Put me in the mood with my woman
Got me in the ear, sayin sweet nothings
Make love come out the mouth, no frontin
Like all of a sudden, (""just like music"")
Takin away your worries and cares
Any problems, music'll be right there
Together match yo, we a perfect pair
Is that true Marvin? (""Yeahhhhh! Music"")
Yo, to get you to bang this
Body soul-snatcher, universal language
It be the light, so open up
This is it, what the fuck? (""just like music"")
One fly tune
That have black and white vibe in one room
No confrontation, parlay all night
It's just the sensation (""just like music"")

(Chorus)
(Marvin Gaye)
Music is the soul of the man
Music makes a, happy day
Music makes a, cloud flow by baby
Your music is my tears in-side my eyes (just like music)
Your music makes me want to sing
Girl music, is a joy to bring (just like music)
Music is my heart and soul, more precious than gold
(Turn on some music, I got my music)
Happiness for days, justice all the way
(Turn on some music, I got my music)
I love your music baby (I got my music)
(Turn on some music, I got my music - just like music)

Sing to me babe I'll be your dashboard drummer and
Let's turn the radio up as loud it can go
Got the ultra-ray wraparound sunglass vision
Got the sails up iced down a cool ambition
Just to relax and let the six-pack summer roll

We've got the sun block, a blanket and the best of Jimmy Buffet
T-bones for the grill, hey ain't it great to rough it
The party's on from dawn to dawn
24-7 'til they pull the plug
No more waitin' come on and kiss me baby

Uh, oh another six-pack summer comin'
Sing to me babe I'll be your dashboard drummer and

149,Girl Next Door,"[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

[Verse 1: Musiq Soulchild]
Girl I'm so surprised to see
The young, fine woman that you grew up to be
Your body's banging like a 400-SE
Even your attitude flows pleasantly
I remember when you was just Tonya Hall
A girl that likes to play basketball
As far as I was concerned, you were one of my boys
I never cared about my sex or yours, but...

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

[Verse 2: Musiq Soulchild]
I'm happy to see that you're home from school
And I wanna let you know that I'm proud of you
Even when we was younger, I admired you
That's why I used to always pick fights with you
I remember when we used to call each other names
Mimic old tv shows and play those childish games
Like I was your Tarzan and you were my Jane
Can we do that nowadays?

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

[Hook: Ayana]
If I would've knew the boy next door would've been you
I would've been nice to you
Spent a little time with you
I would've dressed cuter too
If I would've knew the boy next door
Would've been you
I would've been on your team
When we played hide and seek
Instead of you chasing me

[Bridge: Ayana (& Musiq Soulchild)]
You're so fly now
(Girl stop playing)
I didn't know you were that guy now

She left without leaving a number
Said, she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Verse 2]
The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

[Chorus]
If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Bridge]
Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

If you're calling 'bout my heart, it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more

Hop hills, hills I hop
Hop two hills, on stilts I walk
{Snort two lines} that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and {killed} the Hulk
I wanna {roll} away like a rollerblade
Until my {eyes roll} back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray, yo, I'ma go for broke?
No? Okey-doke, {I'm packin' my nose} with soap
(*Coughing*) Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ah, poor baby, born by a {whore} lady
Now I'm payin' child support? (It's your baby!)

[Verse 4: Swift, Bizarre (& Eminem)]
I take {four shots} at one time
And I don't need to chase when I'm swallowin' mine (Hey, you got any room?)
In Bizarre's hatch back
We can't go far, 'cause the car has flats
Why the hell you people think I rap?
Because my mother taught me how to breach contracts
And if you got cash, then hide it so (Swift, chill!)
I'm just tryna get by like you
And I don't give a damn if you find me rude (Huh-uh)
Mean, crude, to hell with you too (Huh-uh)
I only need three {blunts} and I'm cool
I just got some and I'm goin' back soon

[Chorus: Eminem]
I've been to many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
I'm at a rave, lookin' at a babe
Like she want it
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smell like vomit
Looney, crazy, jumpy, sexy
Dopey-headed guy
Whipped cream, dirty mattresses
Wanna try? (Go on)
{Blue hills, golden seals}
Got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill — {Yeah, right!}
Chick, I'm for real!
Shut yo' mouth, you dirty girl
You know you want me in your world
Ladies, please don't fight
Bizarre's here all night!

Spendin money by the piles throwin dubs

Wit diamonds and furs, he's and her's
Shoppin sprees with ease to fill up a 2000 Suburb, ha
Dawg my projects got taste
Although the rent ain't nuthin but two-fifty
We sportin five thousand dollar drapes
Makin it happen, wit snappin to avoid that - anchor
Hook me up with plenty tracks to keep a playa rappin
So put my city on the map
Hook me up wit million dollar vocal cords
I can afford a million on a track

'Cause just like your love, this is only a phase

Some might think I've gotten caught up in heartache's aftermath
But your memory's taken second to a good book and nice long bath

And when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It's delirium time

He's all mine
And his lovin' makes me high

When his candy kisses sweetly
Caress my whole body
All I need is him to be

From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background

A little voice came on the phone
Said ""Daddy when you coming home""
He said the first thing that came to his mind

I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

[Chorus 2]
I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end

[Carl Thomas]
I always dreamed that everything would be okay
With me and you, but I was wrong
When I looked into your eyes, I didn't see all the things
I used to see, what's going on?

[Faith Evans]
You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby, baby pleases, no more, no more
(Never imagined...)

[Chorus: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (so emotional)

[Verse 2: Faith Evans]
I can't forget that night I saw you in the corner
Wrapped up tight, you were warm
Slow dancing on the floor while I was watching
From the door so hurt, there you were
You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby, baby pleases no more, no more

Never imagined you would be
A faded picture

[Bridge: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
You had your chance (had your chance)
But you threw it all away (yes, you did)
Thought you had my love always
Oh baby, I don't understand
How you think that we could stay
In total unhappiness (unhappiness)

And I died inside the night you left me
But I lived
Oh, how I lived
While you loved me

I'd start with chapter one
Love innocent and young
As a morning sun, on a new day
Even though I know the end
Well, I'd do it all again
'Cause I got a lifetime in

I feel stupid
But I know it won't last for long
And I've been guessing
And I could have been guessing wrong
You don't know me now
I kinda thought that you should some how
Does that whole mad season got you down?

[Verse 2]
Well I feel stupid
But it's something that comes and goes
And I've been changing
I think it's funny how no one knows
We don't talk about
The little things that we do without
When that whole mad season comes around

[Pre-Chorus]
So, why ya gotta stand there looking like the answer now?
It seems to me you'll come around

[Chorus]
I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, that I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken
I come undone, in this mad season

[Verse 3]
I feel stupid
But I think I've been catching on
I feel ugly
But I know I still turn you on
You've grown colder now
Torn apart, angry, turned around
What that whole mad season knock you down?

[Pre-Chorus]
So are you gonna stand there, are you gonna help me out?
We need to be together now

[Chorus]
I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, that I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken
I come undone, in this mad season

[Bridge]
And now I'm crying, isn't that what you want?
And I'm trying to live my life on my own, but I won't, no
At times I do believe I am strong
So someone tell me why, why, why
Do I, I, I
Feel stupid
And I come undone
Well I come undone

[Chorus]
I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, that I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken

[Chorus]
Well I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, I'm a child and I'm hopeless

Sexy and real slow, hey

Runnin' credit checks with no shame now

Uh, like when Janet was Justice, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
A shorty that can tell you when the J's come out
Get creative with they haircuts like T-boz
Fav'rite rappers is Bow Wow, Snoop, JD, & Nas
Always up in they somebody's face tryin' to fuss
And to get where she goin', she can take the bus
Like when Jada was Peaches in the movie Shame
Or the type you can find sitting at a Ruckers game
Only like dealing with cats that love to floss
Only like rocking the stuff that really costs
Lip gloss shinnis' tattoos on her back
Attitude like Mary J., mixed with Brat
You can find a man at a beauty shop, mall, or church
Name brand head to toe with the matching purse
So all that siddity stuff, y'all can keep
'Cause only girls that keep it ghetto get to ride with me (fo' sho)

[Chorus]
Ghetto girls that like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball with the best of them
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixing up the bomb Kool-Aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang than I do
Ghetto girls that's all I like, so tell me, baby, is that you?

[Verse 2]
When they ride with they man like you won't believe
Switch the color on there hair like Eve
When they talk like I talk but walk like a lady
Snap like I snap and get a little crazy
I love that especially when they bout the cheese
Type that won't front for some Mickey D's
Bandanas to barrets daisy dukes to spandex all thats good with me
I like em' G-H-E-T-T-O, now believe me she gots to go
At the corner store buying up all the sweets
From Choo Choo's to Rice Krispy Treats on my street
That's all I see like everyday
And they do what they do in a crazy way
Hang with the ballers so they never pay
And they usually got a name that's hard to say (ya heard)

Ghetto girls that like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball with the best of them
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixing up the bomb Kool-Aid

And talk more slang than I do

Sick and tired of doing the same stuff every day
What’s the deal with school life and will it fade away?
The thing that we now realize is that this was all a trick
We get to do what we want and no this ain’t getting thick

[Pre-Chorus]
(Doesn’t matter)
What we drive or what is on our heads
(Never mattered)
The girls we crushed on or the parties about this spread
(Don’t ever matter)
About our fashion sense, where we go and what
(All that matters)
Is that the countdown’s on and it kicks us through this cut (C’mon)

[Chorus]
Have you ever noticed lately?
This school drives you crazy
Although it makes you frisky
Have it when you
Feel the urge to leave
Your schoolwork starts to weave
We mentally concede
This must be
School life
I know we had our
School life

[Verse 2]
(Message to the teachers)
Hey, what’s with the homework?
That won’t make us twerk
And stopping us from what we wanna do
We have the fundamentals of all free time
In this party of more than two
Doing this the past three years was just being classy
Now we’re on top of the class been doing this heavy Chemistry

About the relationships and the drama we had
(Still won’t matter)
About the tests we failed prior to being the grads
(Above all matters)

Always hit them weak motherfuckers right in they mouth
You better stay out the way and act like you ain't havin' shit
Cause niggas will run up in yo ass like you a nasty bitch
You little bitch, that's what the callin' you
You'd be a damn fool to act like you ballin' dude

We'd talked about forever
I was certain
It was heaven we had found

Walking in the clouds
Sooner or later
You have to come down

It's like a knife

It's a hole
It's a cave
It's kind of like a grave

183,She Couldn't Change Me,"Sometime I think what turned her on
Was my old broke down boots
She wanted her a real cowboy
It was a phase she was goin' through

But not one week after she moved in
I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue
She brought home a bottle of pink Chablis
And poured out my best brew

I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
While she packed her things to leave
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

She changed direction headed out west
Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess
Her dark brown hair went blonde
And her pretty blue eyes went green
She changed everything when she couldn't change me

She was sittin' beside the ocean
Looking out at the waves
Watching how they keep on rollin'
But always seem the same

She called and said she'd been thinkin' about
All those quiet country nights
And whatever she thought was so wrong with me
Suddenly seemed all right

I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
When her truck pulled into view
She said I changed my mind when I couldn't change you

She changed direction headed back home
She changed her tune it's all Haggard and Jones
She had her dark brown hair pulled back
And blue eyes like you've never seen
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

185,Two People Fell In Love,"[Verse 1]
A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon
Before you know it he's off to school and then he graduates in May
Goes out and gets a Ph.D. and then cures all sorts of things
Wins a Nobel Prize and saves a million different lives
The world's a better place for all he's done
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
It's all because two people fell in love

Right now at a picnic shelter down by Caney Creek
You'll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans
The whole Wilson family's lined up filling their paper plates
They've driven or flown in here from fifteen different states
Well Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
That Miss Emma Tucker was the one
Now five generations get together every June
All because two people fell in love

[Chorus]
There is nothing not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
Every single choice we make
Every breath we get to take
Is all because two people fell in love

[Verse 2]
Well, I recall a young man who was drifting aimlessly
And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
But in a little cafe right off of fourteenth avenue
With a whole lot to help from up above
We met and things sure turned around for me and you
And all because two people fell in love

[Chorus]

Lately I've been on the road more than I've been home
All this leaving her alone is killing me
And holding her right now has got me thinkin' more and more
This is right where I need to be

Where when I hear her I can see her
I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her
Anytime that I want to
Yeah that's right where I need to be
Yeah that's right where I need to be

[Verse 2]
There's a plane flying out of here tonight
With an empty first class seat
Because I've finally got all my priorities in line
And I'm right where I need to be

By yourself, nowhere to go

And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good

Where you from anyway?""

Singing:
She's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A
House down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay
Drives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene
Loves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name

She's a rich girl, from the top of the food chain
Love and material things, kinda lonely
'Til I met her at the Grammys, 10mil on a diamond ring
She invites me to spend a day on the jet skis
At first it didn't mean a thing
Then she told me I'm the one that she's searched for
It was hard to believe

She's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A
House down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay
Drives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene
Loves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name

In a couple a days she had me a bracelet made
From Harry Winston's place
Went horseback up to the mountaintop
Showing me the land she's got
Well it's all right, but something else is on your mind
Looking past all that shines, now the tears are running through
All those things are nice, but it's not why I'm here
I will wipe away your tears simply by just loving you

She's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A
House down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay

I pulled into the shopping centre
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions running down her face

And they wore everything they own, living in a car
I wanted to tell him it would be ok
But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away

But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

[Verse 2]
Keep having this dream about my old man
I am 10 years old, and he is holding my hand
We are talking on the front porch watching the sun go down
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he could not be around
So many things I want to say to him
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind

[Chorus]
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry

[Verse 3]
I am sitting here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life
We say grace and thank the Lord
Got so much to be thankful for
Then it is up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says
""I haven't had my story yet""

And everything weighing on my mind disappears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says
""I love you dad""

198,If You Can Do Anything Else,"[Verse 1]
Would you like to live in Houston, where the cowboys come to town
Or maybe Pensacola, where the sun shines all year 'round
Or even New York City, where the city never sleeps
I'm offering you the option before you get in too deep

[Chorus]
If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here

[Verse 2]
There's work up in Seattle, if you don't mind the rain
San Diego to Savannah, they'd all be glad you came
But life with me would always be a roller coaster ride
You won't hurt my feelings, whatever you decide

[Chorus]
If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life

If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here

This place might look real good right now, but looking good don't last
But if you choose it, anyhow, I'll give you all I have

200,I Hope You Dance,"[Verse 1:]
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat
But always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed

I hope you still feel small
When you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes
I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

[Chorus:]
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

[Verse 2:]
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances
But they're worth taking
Loving might be a mistake
But it's worth making

Don't let some Hell-bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out
Reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

[Chorus:]
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

(Time is a wheel in constant motion
Always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone)

I love my life, I love my wife
A bad time to prevail, it overwhelmed me
I'm livin' in hell but livin' wealthy
And know these hoes love me
Because I'm a star
I can't even cop a drink at the bar
Get me some bottles of that Remi Mar-tin
Let's get the party
Cracking right here fuck V.I.P
Knowing my baby loves me
Home with tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin' her lies
She ain't surprised at me
She just surprised that we
Been together for this long
And I can be
The one to mistreat her
Thought it last forever
'Cause if I cry, you cry

From, what I recall we was little niggas
Cuttin' school gettin high wit da hottest bitches
Livin, life so free, that we ain't fearin
The, ills of the world, in heat of drug dealin
You and I then made a killin, and stuck together
In this land of forbidden treasure
Love is the only evil seed that could sever
A tie this close
Not the love between us but your love for the dough
You went O.T. started makin M-O-N-E-Why
All my good niggas gotta die
But shit could last forever, I wish death was pleasure
Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together

Wash away your tears (my love)
You ain't gotta cry no more (my love)
I put it on everything that I love
And my pain it's my love
And I want, this world to smile for me
Don't shed a tear cause the nigga died happily
My momma warned me life was a motherfucker
But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin'
And every night she just looked at me
Tears in her eyes and they be saying shit like
""I don't want me baby to die""
Brought so much pain to her life
Gotta make it better

Maybe I deserve..
For you to put on a sexy dress
For me to ask you ""who the hell you tryna impress?""

For you to laugh it off like it ain't nothin'
I know its somethin'

Maybe I deserve..

Is he kissin' you, touchin' you, holdin' you, what?
To take a drink to help ease my mind
I wanna be mad (wanna be)

Maybe I deserve..
For me to ask you ""where you've been?""

For you to say ""I better stop trippin'""
Maybe I deserve..
To grab your neck until you let me know
Maybe I deserve..
For you to run cryin', cryin' out the door
Maybe I deserve..
To grab my coat, and chase you down the street
Maybe I deserve..
To say its not you, it's my own insecurities
Maybe I deserve..
For you to say ""yes I cheated on you""

208,Ain't Nothing 'Bout You,"Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have

How could I forget

Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life

To this day I still taste that first kiss
How I prayed it wouldn't end
In a way, seeing you like this
I guess it never really did

[Verse 1]
Come home late it seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gonna get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
So If you want some loving I suggest you go back there
Where you came from

Day to day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve God knows that I don't deserve
What you put me through cause I been so true to you
For you to come at me with another lame excuse

[Chorus]
See I
Heard it all before
(Heard it all before)
All of ya lies, all of ya sweet talk
Baby this, baby that
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down

Played the fool before
(Played the fool before)
I was your fool I believed in you
Yes I did, yes I did
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down
(I had to shut you down)

[Verse 2]
What were you thinking bringing her into our home
In our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head
Messing up my sheets and violating me
Have me 'bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets

Nothing you can do and there's nothing you can say
That could persuade me to stay with you another day
You have crossed the line to the point of no return
What you do from here on out, I am no longer concerned

See I
Heard it all before

""Let me explain, baby, it's not what you think""
That's what you said to me
But your lies ain't working now

You had a good game, I must admit
I was it (I was it), but now it's over
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now

I used to hang on to your every word
But the more you lie to me the more I hurt
The things you use to say would sound so sweet

Baby, I swear it wasn't me!""
But your lies ain't working now

You got to know you messed up
You got to go now
Say what you want
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now

214,Let's Get It,"[Round 1: Charlie Clips]
How the fuck is my swag off, fag sauce?
When you called Rich Dolarz handsome twice?
And was the only one who knew he played football his the pads off
That means you'll go to a Lions game in a Viking helmet
Wearing Jacksonville Jag draws and buy Old Navy shirts
And call Calicoe over like, ""Rip the tags off.""
You the 4th dirtiest nigga in battling, {points to Calicoe}
You 3rd
But got the nerve to tell niggas they swag off
And it's been 5 battles straight and you have yet to take that hat off
Now either Blind Fury is your barber, he zipped you and took the back off
Or you have a hairline that'll make Lebron happy but piss Smack off
You know what, fuck the jokes, I ain't got time for all the extra kidding
So I don't wanna hear how you been hard
Which one of y'all niggas got his SIM card?
Cause his texts/Tec's is missing, not mine
I got Mobs, throw that extra clip in
You'll get Roc'd cause I let my K-Shine without Rex permission
Aye Mook! He wanna be a Ruff Ryder
Y'all should let this bitch take Eve's spot
Knock his wig off, he'll get the same scalp Jada' and Styles P got
I show up in Detroit with a gun that's big enough to take Sheek's spot
So when it's shooting you better tell everybody in the D-Block
Before I kill you with more lines like that, it's some real shit I gotta address
X-Factor, the new old nigga, I'm sorry y'all but I'm not all that impressed
Cause in order to be a champion you gotta defeat a champion
Be ready to give and take a beat down
And under no circumstance do you get scared
And demand to go under three rounds
Smack and Beasley called your phone, am I lying?
And you was like, ""I mean, I mean, I mean
I'm not fearing shit, a fat bitch bungee cord snapped on Richie
So I'm not scared and shit
But it's just, it's Charlie Clips we're talking about
And I need a whole lot of time to prepare and shit.""
You bitch ass nigga, you gotta be ready to give and take that contact
Smack and Beasley should have a meeting and then jump you
Cause going 3 rounds was in our contract
But you begged to go one
And then you asked if I can only rap for five minutes
My reply, ""Five minutes? Suck my dick! I rap until I'm finished!""
They paid $100 per ticket, plus tax, everybody in here gotta be hating you
But this ain't the first time you did some sucka shit X
I been seen the fake in you
DNA said let's battle, you said ""no""
Then when 2 weeks left you said, ""I'm taking you.""
You made your 3 rounds, yeah, and you accepted the challenge
I see the snake in you
DNA only had two weeks to prepare
You had a whole month, he was flaming you
Cause you had to get the priorities theme
From Quest McCody to even make it debatable
You know how many niggas wanna battle me?
How many niggas dream of killing Clips?
I give you the fucking opportunity
And you ask for one round, you fucking idiot!
So for the fans that wanted you to kill me in three
And was hoping to see your stock rise
You subconsciously stabbed them in the back
And for that, you will never be top five
Now back to these bars...ain't you a reverend or some shit?
So what you know about throwing that chrome on styling?
Or your moms buying Idaho potatoes
But you using them to put your chrome on silent
No sound it's just...I let that chrome off smiling
Cause when it ring he'll get the Tec's/text but never know it, like his phone on silent
This is what you wanted nigga? You wanted me to be disrespectful
Put my dick in your niece fish tank, dump the water on your nephew
I Tsu Surf lock pick the door, like ""errrr"" show your family what that Tec do
Send 'em all in the sky for cheap, my hammer Jet Blue
Little message for you Detroit niggas that wanna get Clips
Scope on, one eye open, but it ain't Slick Rick
I don't wanna hear how y'all go in y'all Arsonal
To grab Shotgun's until they click click
Cause the only nigga that went to Arsonal for that Shotgun was Trick Trick
Arsonal and Shotgun would probably knock you the fuck out
So I don't wanna hear how you grip the Glock
You bird ass nigga
Since you a chicken I'd rather kill you using a chicken's pot
Like you better roll if you don't pay me, I throw that Idaho on that .380
Them shots steam, send you to Heaven with hot wings
Cause I mash potatoes for the gravy
We feeling on your chicken's breasts but you in love with that old whore
And you be snacking on her box but you don't know she a cold slaw
You ain't nothing but an old chicken that Smack threw in some new grease
Against a new beast that come with that biscuit, I'm like a two piece
If I catch you in that drop, I throw that biscuit to your top
You get your memory five
Since you riding like John F, it's only right I get Kennedy fried
You mentioning me in your blogs and your battles
It's like you can't go a day without me
So I called Ms. Cleo and she told me
""Every ting you plan to say about me.""
He gon' be like, ""I blame bloah again and soak him up like Shamwow again
And make him suffer, how you plan to get a deal? You fat motherfucker
You wore salmon pink against Ave Verb?"" but I'm still good in the gutter
See I'm a hustler
So I wore salmon to let you know I was good with the butter
He gon' be like, ""You ain't got no haircut in your blogs
How you expect to get your chicks wet?
We always see you in Harlem, but never see you with the Dipset
You got the image of a plumber
That's the only way you giving bitches pipe
And in ya battle with Verb you got more dislikes than likes.""
Now that's true, I do got more dislikes than likes, but that ain't shit to me
My 2nd battle, got paid more than you and 10 other niggas that night, I made history
You know how I'm that nigga?
Cause in your last two battles you had to mention me
You almost lost to Surf convincingly
So I made you battle DNA and Rich Dolarz just to get to me
Little nigga, how you expect to hold it down when you gon' correct me
And tell me how Street Fighter 1 ain't never had a bonus round?
It don't have a bonus round, see I be saucy when I say things
So if I fuck up a Street Fighter line
It must make you think that I play games
But if you do wanna play games, let's just make sure it's all action
A UFC type of game where it's kicking or all capping
We can throw the gloves on, play Fight Night with all jabbing
Cause if I throw a bullet you'll need a Raven's defense on All Madden
You might wanna hit Clips cause these offense lines get you mad as hell
But if I grip that hit stick, your helmet fly, you get a shit bag as well
If I bare/bear arms, you better turn Devon Hester running fast as hell
Or get this red circle in your head like Hines Ward in Madden 12
I am not a Game Boy
And you blacker than a PSP, you never seen cash
Your flow 16 bit, mine 32 that's why it seem fast
Catch 'em while he sleep, PlayStation 3 on the way that beam flash
Head shot, let his brains rest in his pillow, now that's a Dreamcast
I'm the controller, I leave squares like you so dead
So if X plan to try angles/triangles like Verb
He'll get an L 2/too and have to battle O-Red
Say it again? I said...
I'm the controller, I leave squares like you so dead
So if X plan to try angles/triangles like Verb
He'll get an L 2/too and have to battle O-Red
Speaking of my nigga O-Red, ""manama, malala, manamama
Mala malama, manamma, manama, malama, manamma
Mama, manamama!""
Now my niggas behind me is like ""What the fuck was my man saying?""
My bad it's only two niggas that can speak this language
I'ma hit y'all with my translation...I said
Lil' nigga you better get low as possible before I let that mag hit you
ICU, your monitor on but your shit showing mad scribble
Your soul leaving your body, cause that's what happens when a mag hit you
So you brain dead, don't even know you travelling
You Lebron when he crab dribble
Now I done murdered you bar for bar and exposed you
The crowd was applauding me nigga, but it's something I forgot to do
Not the translation, I did the Lebron shit, now I remember
I gotta address your priorities, nigga
Two weeks ago I put you in my top 5 and like that I was in disbelief
And had to take you right out of my top five
Cause I found out that he a fucking thief
Remember when he told DNA ""You basic
Get a face lift when that 8 spit
Cause it'll blast and put DNA in a bag like a rape kid""
Now at that time I was like ""Woooo!"" cause that line was certainly fresh
But I realized you stole that from Dizaster
Cause he said he told Swave Sevah
""I'll put DNA in a box like a paternity test""
DNA, paternity test, rape kid, we all watch Law & Order SVU
That shit is the same my nigga
So for you being black stealing punchlines from an Arab
That makes you a lame my nigga
Next time you wanna steal bars get some authority nigga
I'm not trying to be funny
I'm trying to help you with your...priorities, nigga!
Or how 'bout when he told Rich Dolarz, ""I run up in ya state property
Properly, you ain't hot as me cause when it flash
It'll put Rich Dolarz in a bag like a bank robbery,"" right?
Now when I heard that I was like, ""woooh!"" cause that line was crazy then
I realized you stole that from DNA cause he battled Rich and said
""My shotgun will take Dolarz out like an ATM""
Dolarz, ATM, bank robbery, we all seen Set It Off
That shit is the same my nigga
So for you being 40, stealing lines from a 20 year old
That just makes you a lame my nigga
The next time you wanna steal bars, just get some authority nigga
I'm not trying to be funny, I'm trying to help you with your priorities nigga
You fucking thief, you should end up dead in an alley like Raheem
Since you don't know how to keep it real
How do you ever expect to be Bishop if all you know a steal
Just cause a nigga bar cold don't mean you should go rap it
Just cause a nigga bar cold don't mean you should go and jack it/jacket
So the next time you wanna steal bars, just get some authority nigga
And I really freestyled those last 4 lines but I hoped they helped you with your priorities nigga
Now this priority right here is some real shit that I gotta address
I thought you was a great father, but the way you treat your son is a mess
Remember when you wrote on Twitter how you be getting drunk
And be getting saucy off the dark
And you got so drunk that you lost your little son in the park?
Or what about when you battled Amzilla
And you said how you crazy and something wrong
And how you'll punch your son in the face if he stare at you for too long
You look like you get drunk
Beat you son and then leave him with the neighbors
Since you whipping your son ass, I""m whipping my son ass
But doing your son ass a favor
So the next time I hear you fucking with him
Or you raise your hand to fucking hit him
I'ma take a flight to Detroit
Pistol whip you and have ACS come and get him
So the next time you wanna beat him
You call me to get the authority nigga
Cause he's not yours no more, now he's my priority nigga
I hope you got a whole new scheme when you go to battle me nigga
Cause the priority shit is worn out now, it's time for reality nigga
If you battled Nemesis when DNA had a tooth
Then that means that was awhile ago
You been under Miles and Marv Won for years
And out of nowhere came Calicoe, you trying to be top 5 in battling
You not even top three in your own city
If they redid Bad Boy in Detroit, he'll be Biggie you'll be an old Diddy
You had your chance to be Biggie, then Miles took on T-Rex
You lost to Nemesis then got demoted to G-Dep
That nigga Miles got destroyed by Loaded Lux
We all seen the expression on you and your boss face
So you did have your chance to be Biggie cause that night you lost Faith
So I hope you go to do you thing when you go battle me nigga
Cause if you lose tonight, JC will be over you by tomorrow
And that's reality nigga
You said Rich Dolarz got on a stanky Yankee
I can't believe this is the same cat
In two blogs and three battles I caught you wearing the same hat
Type in QP versus B Magic he got on a black and purple Coogi sweater
Looking aight, so I was like, ""Yo my nigga getting his change better.""
Then I typed in ""X-Factor Summer Madness recap""
And the dirty nigga had on the same sweater
Now for all my hustlers in the trap
Y'all know wearing the same clothes twice ain't no thing
But they zoomed in on his sneakers and his Air Max had no strings
You wore the same sneakers, the same hat and the same stanky Coogi
But I know you don't know no better
Smack, lend him $250, buy a metro card, go to 14th and Main
Tell 'em I sent you and put you in a Polo sweater
Go burn that fucking Coogi the next time you come and battle me nigga
Cause now they all know you dirty and that's reality nigga
I'm glad you talking to me while I'm rapping
So now I go this lil' tune that I'm hearing the same
About how you ate Shooney the Rapper's ass
From out of Queen Of The Ring
You know what's funny? That's not even a joke, that shit is real fact
You ate a bitch that got more bars than you, that shit is real wack
I'm a freak myself, but under no circumstance do I feel that
A man's tongue should hang in the same hood that [?] and Scott chill at
So I know you gon' click and spray
You probably got a rhyme for every different day
I mean you eat ass, I'm pretty sure you got some shit to say
I thought this nigga here
You know what I fucked up, I forgot my damn line
Sike! You must be out your damn mind!
What do I look like choking?
Tell this nigga that's not cool
Get in a battle and go, ""I fuck with the boy Surf"" nigga I am not you
So the next time you go choke when you battle me nigga
Bizarre will never co-sign you again and that's reality nigga
Now I want you to get on Twitter right, tell 'em how you killed me
Tell a lie to those folks
But you know what's gon' hurt you?
When they watch this whole battle
And realize I ain't ever crack a nose joke
Time, nigga! Sike! I lied nigga!
Listen', don't worry 'bout why I ain't do three
Why you keep talking while I'm rapping?
They wouldn't call you if they wanted to see they father rap
My bars is crazy I make Detroit niggas have heart attacks
Now I said sike, I lied nigga, your nose look like a field goal's good
That shit is ""this"" wide nigga
It look like you could take a deep breath and smell what's outside nigga
If ya nose is that big, how could you tell your niggas, ""Good looking?""
Hold on see y'all niggas keep talking while I'm rapping
In the hood I learned to slaughter this work
He the first nigga that go on Phat Farm Nautica shirt
Get Calicoe? I mean y'all told me that awhile ago
Math said you ate Ms. Hustle pussy on her period
Nah, I'm just joke, I'm just joking...I mean serious
Now I'm to the hood where my troops control the block
Cause I just fat bitch bungee cord
Cut that shit short I got a Superbowl to watch

[Round 1: X-Factor]
I swear I'ma put an end to this bitch
And he lied on 90% of that shit, and you know that right
Ya fags off swag sauce
You got a fat back, skinny legs with man breast that sag off
With no bitch so Charlie Clips gotta rub a stick to blast off
X-Factor versus DNA, shit, my bad, I mean Charlie Clips
But I already off DNA using Charlie clip
Since we all know DNA be on Charlie clip
I give you a different way of looking at it
See I run up on Charlie like, ""What's popping?"" Charlie Clip
Up that 4-5th and snatch that ratchet off of Charlie hip
Smack the shit out Charlie's lip, probably knock the tooth out him
He spit it out, now we see DNA in Charlie Clips
But that's only the half of it, now it's blood all over that ratchet
So again, you'll see DNA on Charlie Clip
I'm a motherfucking veteran, varsity, Letterman
He all talk, Letterman, Verb, who let him in?
I'm on every fucking top 5 list to every men
On a list with the veterans, all niggas you're not better than
Mook, Rex, Lux, Miles, Math, Solomon, all niggas that's ahead of him
Fat gut chump, I give a fuck cause NY rank him like he so live
You got 2 battles on camera, I had that in '05
Now add that there, imaginary deal with Cam'
Fam' what? Chuck Philly so major?
But you know me, fuck is you? I'm doing the favor
NYC all I ask is y'all give a nigga props
And if he say some shit that's hot and it's hot, then let it rock
But if he say some shit that's not hot and y'all gas it and give it props
The cameras never lie, so the fans gon' see it's not
Now I""m not battling Charlie Clips because I think this nigga nice
It's cause the fans got him hype and to me you just aight
But I had a talk with my conscience in public, fuck it
We was deep in, I'm reasoning with these mahfuckas
Cars riding by, beeping, but see the talk I had with my conscience
My conscience spoke a lil' knowledge
That reasonable me said he was nice
But the arrogant side said he was garbage
Reasonable me: ""X I ain't gon' lie, that boy Charlie Clips is nice
And if you take that nigga light, he'll probably put an end to your night
And you done came too far to be on top of this battle shit
To battle Clips and not let that whole 'matic clip spit at average Clips
I said, ""You right"" but before I could get a word out
The asshole tapped me and said, ""X can I please have my words now?""
He said, ""Man that nigga trash, that nigga butt, that nigga ass
He couldn't see you if you lived in a crib in Time Square and it was glass
You did legendary shit, killed DNA and bodied Rich
Priorities nigga, that's a hit, how many round he had? Six
And see three of which he battled a nigga that was sick
But Tay took a two year break so he swung back and he didn't hit
The other three in which he battled a nigga that had some shit
But Verb didn't just battle Clips
But like 3,000 fans that was riding this nigga's dick
I said, ""Shit, y'all both right, and take sides is kind of hard to
So I'll take advice from both and show niggas I'm impartial
I""ll give 'em bars like I'm 'bout to go 30 rounds with Marshall
But still feel you don't deserve these small bars that I've [?] you
Now bars I got 'em often, he been doing a lot of barking
He must be high so it's only right he's taking an L for talking
Jump in that 40 it's hearse day
Your trunk that's where your skirt and your purse stay
That .38 Special, a retard two years before his 40th birthday
Clips is on that walk of fame, putting in a lot of hard work
But be careful what you say out your mouth spitting them bars jerk
Cause if it's beef and my niggas peep you in that car first
They Dial us (Dallas) we come with them cal' boy (Cowboys)
For thinking we candy I'll leave that Star burst
I bet you 10 times outta 10 under your left titty stink
And since you've waken, you've eaten 5 guys about 5 times
Wendy's fries and a Big Mac
I'm off the hip, two cans when I blow
So if that's first one miss you
Your kids will die from the cig' off the 2nd hand smoke
Uh oh, I'm back on my shit again
Clips done took that bait like a fisherman
Reel 'em in, what's on my waist mean black can sing, Aunt Vivian
You see Uncle Phil, I'm Fresh and the Prince of Michigan
I told my killer Jeffrey I'll give you/U K's, now send him 10
Hit him from this waist to his neck
You button then I'll bend ya men (Benjamin)
You're not a man in my eyes, your vagina trying to play hard
When that 4 on me, no sorority but I'll cap a/Kappa
I'll ride through Harlem comfortable with them guys with me
Charlie's nowhere in sight unless the bakery's giving pies for free
But if you do see me, be easy giving that eye to me
Because 16 from that Charger will bust, no Ryan Leaf
I take the pound, run up on him, lay him down, face the ground
I figure he ain't built so why would I waste a round?
I say Conceited slow that down
I take the pound, run up on him, lay him down, face the ground
I figure he ain't built (belt) so why would I waste/waist a round/around
You a fat nigga bugging, who ain't seen below his waist since a kid
The first time he saw his toes he thought they was chicken nuggets
Fat nigga start spazzing, damn near had a heart attack
Cause he couldn't grab 'em
I got bars, I got jokes, my stage presence is a gift
I control that crowd beautifully
I planned your eulogy for the fifth
He tried to run and was open so I blew one through his shit
And told the judge, ""You aren't supposed to put bullets into clips""
Start a show and I'll get to clapping
Tonight it all ends, I'm 'bout to silence this nigga, Charlie Chaplin
Leave that whip smoking til it's rolling, it'll look like the Marley's passing
Run up on it, break the glass, clap half his back in
Til his lap catches his abdomen and that whip slip and hit, crash and bend
You the type to get mangled with them bars
Fuck around and wanna tangle (tango)
Well I'll send you Dancing With The Stars
In that court singing, get carried/Carey'd when that Cannon go off
Then I squirt until it earth, my seed planted in her jaws
I be going HAM, up dumping, squeezing that pump
Clips be going HAM, add bacon, cheese...
No remorse I'll even slump his lil' cunt
Let that fif' swisher, sheesh I had to be blunt
From what I heard you be begging bitches to get off in they vagina
But I also heard bitches is never on your tip cause it's tiny
Just ask your whore, she love when slam her raw
She told me when my Thing get rocked it's what I'm Fantastic 4/for
Fuck this battling shit, you'll think that chrome was his clone
The way I'll have Charlie battling Clips
I'm usually mild mannered but act in this damn place
I'll slap this man face til his jaw snap like blacks after a handshake
I won't even put the heater to him
Niggas start yapping to the coppers cause they'll be locked up
Before the choppers get to squeezing through him
Now I gotta skip town, a couple pounds I bet C'll do him
Cause soon as I touchdown TD, Jakes, he'll be preaching to 'em
I tried to listen to his album, Calicoe was like, ""Why fam'?""
I'ma keep it a buck and a half, it's trash, I ain't gon' lie fam'
I said, ""Fuck it"" I even tried to listen to it fried then
I played 2 and 5, damn near committed suicide
I couldn't feel/fill this high
I got that Shotty in, I'll let that Shotty spin
And let his wig hold the whole clip like a Bobby pen
My bottom bitch thick as a steak, boy stop that
You saucy cause your A1 bitch couldn't top that
I'm at my girls house watching battles
I said, ""Come here baby, this 'bout to be some shit.""
She said, ""Ohh, Fatman Scoop?!""
I said, ""No, that's Charlie Clips""
But anyway, that nigga there can spit
Halfway in his third against Aye Verb
That's when I witnessed some shit
Now it was on some gay shit but he said Verb be on some gay shit
And right after Verb say some gay shit, he licks his lips
Now that's when I seen some gay shit
But you said Verb lick his lips every time he say some gay shit
And right in the middle of you talking 'bout all that gayness
Charlie Clips turned around and licked his lips
As y'all see I'm getting bored with this nigga
But y'all know I wasn't gonna end it without addressing at least one of your priorities nigga
Against Tay Roc - 200, against Verb - about 305
Nigga, that's growth at a rapid rate
Easy on the cheeseburgers and chili cheese steaks
These your niggas right?
Y'all down to ride? Righter there letting that .380 fly
Who gon' be down to right with helping this mahfucka stay alive?
No that's real shit, I'm being honest, that' my word A
You got no kids, you're not married, I know you want that in your old age
But at the rate that you're going you'll probably die in your sleep by 38
High blood pressure by 31, diabetes by 33, congestive heart failure by 36
I'm saying you my mans and I'm just worried Clips
But you been in the gym, I can tell you trying to get back
Pull ups for your delts, couple dips for your las
I'm backing you 100%, that's all I gotta say scrap
But just remember just because you're ate fat you don't have to stay that
Now soon you gon' walk in that spot and see cones with the ice cream
Freshly baked German chocolate cake topped with the icing
Now for you that's probably high torture my nigga
But before you go make a slice and take a bite
Think life and how got to live a lot more of it my nigga
Now I'm not saying this to be funny
Or try to wipe the floor with this nigga
But I feel like this is real life and Clips it's priorities nigga
When that mac buck duck you lil' fat gut fuck
As y'all see I just spazzed on this nigga and y'all niggas know
I just fat bitch bungee cord snapped on this nigga",URLtv,"Three The... G. Dep, P. Diddy & Black Rob",2001,"[97, 88, 88, 80, 80, 84, 80, 80, 80]",9
215,Until The End Of Time,"[Produced By: Johnny J & Trackmasters]

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings

216,It's A Great Day To Be Alive,"[Verse 1]
I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

[Verse 2]
Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Verse 3]
It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

[Verse 4]
Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doing alright

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Bridge]
Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm falling, desperately calling
Howlin' at the moon ah-ooh

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a fu man chu

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

Everybody's got something
They had to leave behind
One regret from yesterday
That just seems to grow with time

There's no use looking back or wondering (Or wondering)
How it should be now or might have been (Or might have been)
All this I know, but still, I can't find ways to let you go

[Chorus: Jo & All]
I never had a dream come true
'Til the day that I found you
Even though, I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say (Never found the words to say)
You're the one I think about each day (The one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you, yeah

[Verse 2: Jo]
Somewhere in my memory
I've lost all sense of time
And tomorrow can never be
'Cause yesterday is all that fills my mind

There's no use looking back or wondering (Or wondering)

You'll always be the dream that fills my head
Yes you will, say you will, you know you will, oh baby
You'll always be the one I know I'll never forget

There's no use looking back or wondering (Or wondering)
Because love is a strange and funny thing (And funny thing)
No matter how I try and try, I just can't say good-bye
No, no, no, no

Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson

Hey, you pale and sickly child
You're death and living reconciled

You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're given, mmh

Pain is ready, pain is waiting
Primed to do it's educating
Unwanted, uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without, it lives within you

You're shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over

225,What It Feels Like For A Girl,"[Spoken Sample: Charlotte Gainsbourg]
Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's OK to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

Strong inside, but you don't know it

What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor

While i'm sitting waiting for the huh huh
Fired up that smoke screen

I can feel, too much is never enough

But to tell truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Verse 3]
Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, me and you's like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

I don't understand
You look just like the man
In the picture by our bed
The suspence is pounding and clouding up my head
I'm checkin' your clothes
And you wear the same size shoes
You sleep in his spot
And you're driving his car
But I don't know just who you are

There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
Cuz he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house

[Verse 2]
I'm not sure who you are
Don't see your shadow around when you walk
You leave with no kisses
Goodbye with no words
If these walls could talk
They would have nothing to tell

So what could it be?
Is there someone immitating me?
Could she be taking my place?
Look me in the face
And tell me that I'm wrong
When I say

comes back after a long hiatus everyone collectively loses it but when said bad who was a part of the rock scene completely leaves it and tells people they're still doing rock and we just accept what they say that's when we
should be regretting the past thanks to Michael a patron who donated to my patreon page he is asked that I take a look at a band that he hates and has been hoping someone would rip apart fora long time every evil girl's Dreamboats
Fall Out Boy well I named the Triforce of sake too last year with Creed Nickelback and limp Biskit michael has a similar idea for the Triforce of whining which includes simple plan good Charlotte and Fall Out
Boy yeah Fall Out Boy however is a little bit different than the other two is that band has a very split public opinion about them so much so in fact that a little over a month ago I had a quick
unadvertised poll on Twitter for 24 hours asking if Fall Out Boy was good or not the final results was pretty close on both sides as for me I really don't think Fall Out Boy's bad however I do think they are one of the most overrated
bands easily in the past 10 years I understand people like the ban and they are definitely a big deal back in the mid-2000s with their pop rock hits on the radio and concert selling out everywhere but wow is there a following
for these guys that makes fans of 30-years shake their head in jealousy I don't get it their music isn't bad but it's not great I don't get the obsession outside of teenage girls who love these guys back
then who then grew up to be women who love these guys after they returned and it's after that hiatus we are going to talk about when Fall Out Boy announced their return in 2011 social media collectively dropped their panties and
we're ready for a Fall Out Boy love fest and along with our touring came to return album save rockin whoo it's hard to say the title of this album when you know what's involved Fall Out Boy's save rock and roll I really think Fall Out
Boy belongs in a rock conversation when talking about their previous albums like their most well known Under the Cork Tree whether people like that up not you can at least understand how they are included in the overall genre then comes
an album like save rock and roll if I save you mean totally separate yourself from it then yeah you totally saved it this album was the turning point for Fall Out Boy in the sense that they left Rock completely and jumps straight into
pop that's fine if that's what they wanted to do but when you title your album save rock and roll and then jump into another style then you really aren't saving anything you're just pulling a bait and switch on your fans
unless the joke is that they saved rock and roll by removing themselves from rock wow I'm surprised that was come to that logical conclusion yet I feel Fall Out Boy are fine for what they are I don't hate them but I truly think they
are not the Beatles although apparently they are some superfans who think the Beatles can't hack it under the court tree along with Fall Out Boy but after said hiatus in return this was the album Fall
Out Boy came roaring back with a platinum selling album multi-platinum selling singles and plenty of charting positions and with all that it ends up being the least talked about album from the band and that album that shall not
be named amongst Fall Out Boy fans so why is it so passed over they even made a full video series for a music video for every song on this album called the Youngblood chronicles but even with all that effort this is still talked about
as the wars Fall Out Boy album why well thanks to a patrons donation let's see why Fall Out Boy belong in the Triforce of whining and see why we should regret this platinum selling album save rock n roll
okay this doesn't sound too bad so far down to metal okay the build up actually sounds nice what was I worried about oh I thought I would be hearing a band and not a bunch of studio engineers
running music through production software and mixers and filters I get the problem now I'm not by any means saying the song is awful because it's really not it has a great build-up and the vocals sound fine my problem with
the opening track of save rock and roll is that it's filled with overly produced digitally modified instruments that sound like they were played through the guitar and bass sound effect on a Casio keyboard that's not rock and roll
chiptunes players can do that as the song goes on it becomes more clear just how produced and modify this music is the good drumbeat eventually sounds like it's from an electronic drum machine the melody is coming almost completely from
Patrick stumps vocals if the guitar bass was never strummed once in this song I wouldn't be surprised at all I love Ted you have to have guitar in your band to be a part of rock you don't but you definitely need more than a
vocal melody and what sounds like 10 studio engineers making your rock song get used to these finger quotes by the way because every time I say rock it might be in sarcasm like that but this is as good of a spot as any to really
address my issue with Fall Out Boy the lyrics this is why so many people are split on the band are the lyrics deep witty and well delivered or are they whiny cliche and melodramatic all of the above you cannot deny that something
company are putting in effort in writing lines and trying to do something more than just sing generic sentences the problem is how much of a mess it comes out in the end when you really piece it all together look at the first verse in
the first song on this album audibly it flows but it makes zero sense metaphorically and it keeps changing themeaning it's trying to get across we're in a bad spot we have to work together to move forward that's a good message in
a song the lines make no sense at all in describing this situation constantly though you are a brick dragging me down you're a jack-o-lantern lining up the sky here comes the tide put on your war paint it's like they took the nearest
book just flip through a random page andpulled out words and lines and just madea verse out of it you're not laying Brady you can't do that I repeat that I really don't think this song is bad but lyrically it's just a lot to take in and
it doesn't make much sense a lot with a lot of repeated phrases and ants Kermit sounded like they were played through digital audio modifying soft where they found online that adds up to one big problem it's not rock and roll
it's just not I mean I get that Fall Out Boy's considered a pop rock band but it's 100% pop at this point it's like calling Kid Rock rock or country for rap or calling anything - Kid Rock does actual music looks like this isn't rock
my songs know what you did in the dark is the big song from the album that was the first thing Fall Out Boy fans heard after their quote hiatus in instantly shot up the charts at NASA today has been certified five times platinum for a
single that is huge most rock bands have trouble getting a single to go gold let alone five times platinum the members of Fall Out Boy collectively said that this I was the most representative of the album it's the best representation and
heart of save rock and roll I still have trouble saying the name as for the song itself it really kind of echoes the same things I said about the Phoenix stump sounds fine vocally and there's a hook that's easy to get into the issue is
having instruments in chords sound like they were programmed and coded as opposed to scrubbed and played compile that with another oddly worded anti love song with a conflicting message and you have the Fall Out Boy standard it's not
a bad song it's just not Rock it's hot completely it'd be fine if this album was called safe pop which it probably should have been now that I think about it millions of sales tons of usage on TV programs and lyrics about hating the
person you love but needing them in your life written like they were set by someone drunk on sudafed that hasn't left his typewriter in a month and with all that you have what millions of lovestruck girls and nostalgic fanboys
crave is it bad no but it's labeled as rock which it's not I think that's why Fall Out Boy's so polarizing also that and they have lyrics that really make you question the relationships these guys have been in
and what some of their fangirls that our teenagers really want to hear about okay I'm starting to get the point about the whining now while it's definitely not to the level of simple plan whining it's really sinking in on why Fall Out
Boy can be seen on the levels of whining entitled adolescent complaints these are broken heart ballads about being in love with someone you shouldn't be even close to but you keep trying anyway not saying it's a bad subject to sing about but for
every song with wildly random lyrics it comes off a bit the odd it's the whole live journal writing style of making your problems something bigger than they are but at least teens on LiveJournal would
try to explain situations instead of riding in one line proces that barely connect to each other no one will ever understand how I feel about her it's not my fault I'm a maniac she treats me like a stallion she loves it when I'm broken
last night we were alone together than today at school she spit my face when her friends were around this is the road to ruin stop smothering me the song doesn't sound bad and it has a nice beat the chorus with the chanting yeah sounds
nice it also sounds as far away as rock though as Celine Dion does it's produced as pop and that's fine if that's what they want but hiding it under the banner of rock makes zero sense I know I've said this isn't rock a lot so far but
this album keeps giving me examples to reinforce that thought see what I mean happy really any better example than that let's show it one time for the new viewers that number to our songs to try
to pass off Lala's Nonna's and Dooku's as legit lyrics the electronic beat and rhythm sound good and Patrick Stump doesn't sound bad on the mic it really doesn't come off as something people could hate but anyone that calls this
rock let alone something that could save rock and roll needs to clean the Greer's out with bleach lyrically the track does sound more like an actual cohesive song that you can actually follow along with the problem there are more na na Na's in
this song than the Nana Nana Nana insults song on a playground even with the NHANES I can still see that Fall Out Boy was at least trying to do something with this track but these bad romance songs are really getting repetitive save
rock and roll should have just been titled save me from the psycho girl anything you say yes to policy was that a pick-up line hang on a second turns out that's definitely a pick-up
line and a lame one at that the pacing and dynamic steady beat compliment everything in this track and even though I laugh the pickup line there actually is some good riding in here I'm convinced that the lion I trade all my
tomorrows for just one yesterday will be a line in a teenage romance comedy someday do you see what I mean now about the album not being Rock though after every song it feels a little more like it goes further into radio pop
sing-along anthems follow poi have always had elements of that but a song like this really enforces it also that pickup line about anything you say can be held against you is really weak come on even be cheesy 100% with your pickup
line or don't even try there's way better pickup lies out there than that how do you save rock and roll bring in a rapper for your pop song makes sense if you don't think about it for one second my
the mighty fall doesn't really have much in terms of bringing something to the table I actually have one for bringing in someone into a song if they really contribute something different but in this case it feels like it's just
extending a track for a verse that doesn't even need to exist in the first place lyrically it's about the same as the other tracks unless I missed something yeah yeah I'm a big girl a big dancer
you what hell yeah my dig girl a big dance you stupid freakazoo okay this track actually feels like they decided not to play their instruments inside digital effects and a tone finder it sounds quick and it's easy to get
into I mean it's not rock and it's not great but it's better than the other songs on here I mean it this song is not some bad at all miss missing you could have been turned into a rock track it has the writing structure of in and it's
as close to pop hunt that Fall Out Boy gets on this album the problem though is that it gets repetitive fast and there's really no change up in the rhythm or chord for over three minutes assuming a real guitar was actually used in the
recording of this I won't deny that there's a sense of fun to be had while listening because there definitely is an upbeat vibe even if the song sounds likemorbid Valentine's Day cards but the writing is becoming more shallow almost
like stumping company we're running out of fortune cookie lines about love you know who's good at pop rocker alt pop but still feel like they belong at a rock category walk the moon listen to both of their albums you'll see just how
talented they are while being upbeat and having a lot of generic pop lyrics that aren't very deep it still has a lot of fun to listen to though and you can hear just how talented the guitar and rhythm section are even a band like AWOLNATION
which uses a lot of effects with their instruments and their latest album run is quite a bit softer still feels much more like an alternative rock band I mean jeez even the California Dreams have more rock and roll than this. the vocals sound awful it's like a bad auto-tune program what the heck happened here the singing truly sounds terrible it has a bad reverb and it sounds like it's being sang through a White Castle Drive through speaker box there actually is a two second guitar chord melody though I'd call it a solo but you know two seconds isn't exactly a guitar solo and about a minute left in the track everything devolves into a bad dance
club remix it's like they made their own song but decided they had to make it just a touch more douchey so college campus dorm room so it has something to play while guys and pop collars could try to impress a girl they just met I
could at least make an argument for the other songs on the album so far but Death Valley sucks I mean it's a low point for this album as low as Death Valley I'm bad with puns it just sucks okay there's no way this saw was meant
to be taken seriously as a pop rock anthem this was made specifically for some company to buy it out and use it in their commercials really think about it just imagine a target commercial playing this in the background that hasn't been
what this was for play some of this in front of a target commercial and it blends right in I can't believe they played this on the radio without people changing the channel not because it sucks but because people would
instinctively think it's a commercial beginning this is a simple light-hearted song but it also feels pretty light in meaning and depth this feels like filler why was chosen as a single I'll never know the last couple songs and now this
one have now made it more clear that they couldn't even make a full pop album that sounded good we're nine tracks in and I don't expect any rock at this point I mean this was the triumph at Fall Out Boy return where are the big
guns what are they really gonna pull in to save this thing it's corny bitch you brought in Courtney Love okay first of all in my humble opinion the phrase a featuring Courtney Love is never a good thing
Ratatat had potential take out Courtney Love and change up the chorus and you can totally feel a rock vibe in this song in fact if save rock and roll would have been written in this style I think a lot of people would not have regarded
this as Fall Out Boy's worst we finally get something that feels like rock I can't deny it with the bassline it has a punk buy but then the lyrics about bad love and the chorus don't do justice with what this song could be
Courtney Love just kind of uh rants over the song and it actually kind of ruins the track just like Fred Durst into that Aaron Lewis live song it feels more like pop rock or at least it's in the category kind of it's still bad I mean
the slogs a mess but at least it's a little bit more rock I don't know and also on a side note having save rock and roll by bringing in Courtney Love might be the worst idea ever you got Elton John
I knew the economy was bad in 2011 but I didn't think everyone needed an extra payday hearing those opening piano notes by Sir Elton John is kind of surreal it's not something I would have ever expected on a Fall Out Boy album the
build-up is gorgeous and you hear a little more delivery and emotion and stumps Wars than just the same embellishment that's been pretty flat line through the second half of this album as for a title track it's great
even the lyrics about saving rock and roll in the chorus sound good but slow and melodic and the added string section sound great and when Elton John starts singing even just for a little bit it caps off the album but again after
Courtney Love I'm pretty sure anyone sounds good I honestly could see myself listening to the song again with the whole chanting lyrics if we don't know when to quit really are fun to get behind and Elton's contribution is great
and that's what puts the exclamation mark of what I've been saying this entire review this is a pop album and an 11-track album there is roughly one song namely this title track that feels like something a rock band would want to
listen to and even this track doesn't feel like rock at its core despite the lyrics there might be a fast bassline or energetic build in the opening song but that's it the rest is as poppy is Radio Disney like I said before they're going
to be a lot of diehard Fall Out Boy fans who see this video title and comment without listening to anything I say I get that but when it comes down to it the album is OK the first how the album has some good pop songs for sure but
then it gets pretty old hearing the same style and beat thrown some guest musicians and somehow they saved rock and roll I don't think I possess enough sarcasm to really go on about how they saved rock and roll again when Fall Out
Boy came back in 2011 a lot of people lost and had high hopes and for many of their fans they were still happy with the result I kind of get why - because not everything that follow boy has done since 2011 has been completely wretched
the big factor in that though is that they have changed whether it's a new direction or they just evolve or they decided they could cash in easier on Bad Romance songs that they are targeted outside of the rock audience the result
is that Fall Out Boy is a pop band now but even after all that this is not the worst thing I've ever heard there are some saving moments on it it's just not Rock and that's fine but don't tell people it's rock that's
why this is worth we're grey even for Fall Out Boy fans Fall Out Boy has done better than this also whether you like the band or not I think you can agree with that there mid-2000 days actually represented alt rock in a fashion and
while I stand by they are very overrated I still don't think they are terrible but despite that this album still falls into the category of openly supporting an album the second it comes out just because it's from a band people love in
this case you make it the bait and switch from what you expect rock and roll wasn't said's because it didn't need saving especially from Fall Out Boy we should regret when a band no matter how popular loved sells us on
what they are going to do and then do something not even close as a result in this case being rock this album isn't terrible neither is Fall Out Boy but I do think Fall Out Boy is one of the most overrated bands in a long time they are
put on a high pedestal for very generic and odd sounding pop rock especially with the writing which I do agree there should be a Triforce of whining and after an album like this kind of hard to deny that they don't belong in there but
you like Fall Out Boy like them I can kind of see the appeal for some people but there's one thing we can all agree on we need to: stop asking Courtney Love to make music!

All young girls beware
This pup's off the chains
I'm gritty little something here
Putting down pain
Since I was six
Running with the pound
It's been going down
I'm city to city, town to town
They running up screaming my name
Running up grabbing my chain
Running up tryna get in the game
I'm like ma don't get it twisted
If we kick it get your bark on
Hope to God you see me again, when I'm grown
Type of playa but it ain't
It just sounds like that
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that
(I agree)
Hit the movies, hit the mall
Then come out with big bags
Next day do lunch then head to Six Flags
But it don't mean nothin we're just having some fun
Even though I may have told you on the ride you're the one
I'm sorry little shorty I gotta take that back
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that

Even if you're three years older than me
And caught yourself noticing me
In my mind, set don't change
I might up my game
But the story that I tell 'em
When I tell it, it remains the same
You wouldn't believe how they be coming at me
Steady, steady tryna throw something at me
Like I'mma get happy
Just because honey got her learner's permit
Can come and scoop me after school
Like I'm supposed to be on it
Naw ain't no sippin' over here
It's Big Pimpin' over here
And I hope that I make myself clear
That when it comes to honeys yo I got some minutes
And I ain't tryna get serious till I'm up in my twenties
It's just the paper that I'm after
The drop with the top I'mma cop when I'm able

I get it down, get it krunk when I get in the state of mind
That what's mine is mine, nobody get to take
I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down
My mental Rolodex see these words? I just don't know
I know stress, drama, niggas upsettin' my mama
Arrested, put in the lineup, tryin' to put dents in my armor
But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most
Out on bail, fifty thou', still ridin' with toast
I ain't tryin' to collide with folk
But I don't want folk takin Jigga for joke
I guess you niggas just woke, good morning
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got all my mamis
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me what you want from me
Tell me what y'all want from me?
I'm not guilty
I see how you comin at me now, I'm cool
I'm not the snitch I don't go to the cops to get rich
I go to the block and pitch
I go with the Glock and click, I go with the pop I'm sick
I go with you hard, I ain't gon' stop for shit
Look in my eyes dog, right in my pupils
If I'm your rival, why would I have to do you?
Press try to throw dirt on my name, disturbin' my game
Seemed happy when they heard he was arraigned, glad he's indicted
Got big money, big lawyers to fight it
Just like Cochran, cocksuckers you never see me boxed in
Y'all all know it, Jigga's a fighter
Plus I'm claustrophobic, back on the streets before you know it
And my word niggas, I heard you niggas
I'm address each and every one of you cocksuckers
Fuck the white press, the block love us, hip-hop forever
B.I.G. is here, the soul of 2Pac hovers above us
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got all my mamis
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me what you want from me
Tell me what you want from me
(I am the one)
Not guilty
Uhh, okay, you on my radar, I got you too bitch
Got lame bitches tryin' to fuck with my case
Same lame bitch I bust in her face
Honey just mad I got her fuckin' replaced
Plus a birthday pass without me even touchin my safe
But I ain't gon' lie, the head was sick
But what we need to do is put that mouth on a betta bitch
You heart the rhetorhic, Jigga hit me over the head
With a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?
Naw, how do y'all equate your pain
Would it all go away if I bought you a Range?
I got one or two of those, nothin gon' change
For nothin else, you gotta live with yourself
Try and lie on Hov' cause I ride on the road
In what, most would describe as a Rolls
No, that's that Continental T
The only car that fit intercontinental me, not guilty
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
And you wanna charge me when I'm not guilty
I got all my mamis
(I am the one)
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me, what you want from me
Not guilty
I am the one
Y'all, cats, can't touch me
So you can't touch me nigga, you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Said Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I got all my mamis
And I got all my mamis
Tell me what you want from me
I don't know why y'all can't see that
Y'all cats can't touch me
Y'all dudes can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I got all my mamis
I got all my mamis
Tell me what you want from me
So tell me what you want from me
Y'all cats can't touch me
Y'all niggas can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I got all my mamis
And I got all my mamis
Tell me what you want from me
So tell me what you want from me
Y'all cats can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I got all my mamis
Tell me what you want from me

256,She Misses Him,"She shaves his face
She combs his hair
She helps him find his rocking chair
She cooks his meals
She wipes his mouth
And the window that he's looking out
She reads him books
She speaks his name
Oh every day is much the same
She sighs that sigh from deep within
The one that says
She misses him

She misses his gentle touch
And the way he used to make her laugh
She misses the man he was
In all of those old photographs
So strong, so kind, so sweet, so smart
The man who stole her very heart
She misses him

His children come on Saturday
They're at his feet
His grandkids play
It's sad they don't know him at all
He's just the one they call grandpa
They take out his trash
They mow his lawn
Things he can't do since he's been gone
She's grateful that they're pitching in
And like everyone
She misses him

She misses his gentle touch
And the way he used to make her laugh
She misses the man he was
In all of those old photographs
So strong, so kind, so sweet, so smart
The man who stole her very heart
She misses him

And yes they're still together
After all these years
But sometimes you can almost feel
The sadness in her tears

She misses his gentle touch
And the way he used to make her laugh
She misses the man he was
In all of those old photographs
So strong, so kind, so sweet, so smart
The man who stole her very heart
She misses him",Tim Rushlow,Tim Rushlow,2001,"[97, 89, 84, 67, 61, 59, 61, 61, 61, 69, 74]",11

They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in
And we threw it all away

Passion flows like a long white gown
But it ain't easy to keep your love alive
We hoped each other would come around
We'll use the lessons for better luck next time
But how sweet it was back then

264,Just Another Girl,"[Verse 1:]
You think you're slick in every way
Changing up on your calls
On your phone every day

Is there something that
You're trying to hide from me?
I never gave you reason to
Run and take your calls in the other room

[Hook:]
Am I the only one
Or is somebody else kissing at you?
Is this my imagination?
Things ain't always what they seem
'Cause I don't want to be

[Chorus:]
Just another name in your little black book
Just another face in the crowd
And it's got me shook
I've got to mean a little more to you
Than a space in your list of things to do

Another g-shock gun in your Benz
Another dime piece
That you can show all your friends
You can call me crazy
Say I'm insecure
But I don't wanna be just another girl

Ooooh
Ohhhh
Ohhh
Mmm, hhmmm

[Verse 2:]
Strange how you claim to tell all the truth
When the passenger seat
In your car has been moved

And you swore that there was no one else but you
And something else you can't explain
Why'd you called me by somebody else's name?

[Hook:]
You say it's history
Your player days are through
Or so you say
Is this my imagination?
Things ain't always what they seem
'Cause I don't want to be

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Tell me how you lie
Or is it my suspicious mind
I've gotta know the truth
If I am just another girl you treated wrong
Another one you string along

Is it you and me?
Is it two or three?
'Cause I don't want to be

I got a funny feelin'
The moment that your lips touched mine
Somethin' shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time
There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

[Chorus]
You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around

They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again

They make me sick
I know I feel you, that is why we got to stick together
Yep, yep, yep, know it

[Chorus]
You make me sick
I want you and I am hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I am feeling it, I got to get a grip
And it is driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick

[Verse 1]
He was doing 8-0 on the freeway
In the 6 double O, bumping Islay
He was getting kind of close, kind of touch-ay
Because he had a little too much Hennessey
He told me that he want to go home, with me up on the hill to my condo
Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him, ""Boo, I do not really know though""
He got closer to me it started getting deep
He had me in a zone when he started to show me things
I never saw before
Baby was smooth but I knew it was game
Hell-of-a cool but you men are the same
The way he licked his lips and touched my hips
I knew that he was slick

[Chorus]
You make me sick
I want you and I am hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I am feeling it, I got to get a grip
And it is driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick

[Verse 2]
In the 6 now, so hot
Got to pull all the windows down
Eyes lead and I am thinking bout the sheets now
Wondering should I really take it there now
He told me he would make it worth it
Again, how many times have I heard this?
Kind of funny, but I was not even nervous
Well his slick-ass lines were kind of working
I felt my knees get weak his body was calling me
Just could not take the heat
Anyway it was 2 or 3, I had to get off the streets
Baby was cool but I knew it was game
Said, he was too schooled to be screaming my name
Even though we made the best of it
I still told him this

[Chorus]
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I'm feeling it, I got to get a grip
And it's driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick
You make me sick
I want you and I am hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I am feeling it, I got to get a grip
And it's driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick

269,But For The Grace Of God,"[Verse 1]
I can hear the neighbors
They're arguing' again
And there hasn't been peace on our street
Since who knows when
I don't mean to listen in
But the shouting' is so loud
I turn up the radio to drown it out
And silently I say a little prayer

[Chorus]
But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God

[Verse 2]
I can see that old man
He's walking past our door
And I've been told that he's rich
But he seems so poor
Cause no one comes to call on him
And his phone it never rings
He wanders through his empty home
Surrounded by his things
And silently I say a little prayer, yes I do

[Chorus]
But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God

I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me

270,There Is No Arizona,"He promised her a new and better life out in Arizona
Underneath the blue never ending sky
Swore that he was gonna
Get things in order
He'd send for her
When he left her behind
It never crossed her mind

There is no Arizona
No Painted Desert, no Sedona
If there was a Grand Canyon
She could fill it up with the lies he's told her
But they don't exist, those dreams he sold her
She'll wake up and find
There is no Arizona

She got a postcard with no return address, postmarked Tombstone
It said ""I don't know where I'm goin' next but when I do
I'll let you know""
May, June, July, she wonders why
She's still waiting, she'll keep waiting cause

There is no Arizona
No Painted Desert, no Sedona
If there was a Grand Canyon
She could fill it up with the lies he's told her
But they don't exist, those dreams he sold her
She'll wake up and find
There is no Arizona

Each day the sun sets into the west
Her heart sinks lower in her chest and
Friends keep asking when she's going
Finally she tells them don't you know

There is no Arizona
No Painted Desert, no Sedona
If there was a Grand Canyon

[Verse 1]
Yo guys, check out, guess what happened to me
(Another crazy story, come on AC)
I was hanging at the court, just playing some ball
Working on my game (yeah, we heard it all)
I heard the fans screaming, I thought it was for me
But then I saw a shadow, it was 12 foot 3
It was Shaquille O'Neal (what? What did he say?)
(How 'bout some one-on-one, you wanna play?)
I told him why not, I got some time
But when I beat you real bad, try not to cry
(Please Aaron, are you for real?
One-on-one with Shaquille O'Neal?)
Yeah, 34 center from the L.A. Lakers
(You must've been nervous) I knew I could take him
Stared at Shaq, psyche him out
I said O'Neal, you're in my house now
Start the game the whistle blows
Pay attention close 'cause the story goes

[Chorus]
It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

[Verse 2]
So check it out, I thought I had the lead
But then he started scoring mad points on me
I was scorin' the bricks (was he hitting all the shots?)
I knew that there was a way that I could make it stop
I had a plan, I could change the pace
I said, ""Yo Shaq you didn't tie your shoelace""
He looked down, I stole the ball
I'm taking him to school now, watch me all
A 3-pointer, nothing but net
Come on Shaq, had enough yet?
Down by two, I'm catching up
I guess you're getting nervous 'cause you already lost

[Chorus]
It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts

[Verse 3]
Announcers were shocked, couldn't believe it was real
(I can't believe a kid just stuffed O'Neal)
One more second, was all that remained
I put the ball up, I put him in shame
I must admit that it sounds real crazy
But the ball went in, then he cried like a baby
Sorry Shaq, I should've let you win
You're good too and we can still be friends
The fans went nuts, they put me on their shoulders
Then I heard a voice and it sounded like my mother's
(Get up for school, you're gonna be late)
Ma, can't you see that I'm playing a game?
(How you could be playing if you're still in bed?)
(Are you gettin' sick, did you hit your head?)
Aw, man it was all a dream
I guess that kinda thing could never happen to me
If it was a dream and it wasn't real
How'd I get a jersey with the name O'Neal? Woah

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that truck you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling

Bad like that student in the principal office
Put rappers in coffins, they dive like dolphins
I'm the damnedest lyrical marvel you don't come across often

Or fuck around and get beside yourself, I know
Go head though, bounce them titties
Shake that ass, drop that pussy but stay in line ho
Fuck I can't, cause you can can

The pussy cutter, did I stutter
The heart flutter, make your woman drawers melt like butter
Down like Nelly, I'm hype like Belly
The rhyme-seller, kick ass like Jim Kelly
Stand up, round out, boot up and frown
Tell a nigga if he wanna try it then bitch come on down
No sweat, no blood, no tears
And if I tell you it's the shit then, bitch that's what it is

[Verse 1]
On the cross town with the top down
Sounds banging out the backseats (alright)
Me and shorty two deep
She's flashing me thighs
Wind blowing through her hair
Baby we can take it there (take it there)
But first I gotta make my rounds
Baby slow down
My crib's on the other side of town
But from the look in her eyes
She was hypnotized
Rubbed her hands on my chest
And started getting undressed
Tell me why

Could it be my chromed out rims? (baby)
Break you neck when you see a nigga dip (mmm)
Or could it be the ice you see? (ice you see me)
But you tell me that you're really feeling me
(That you're feeling me, feeling me, feeling me, baby)
Could it be the word on the block?
I know they told you that a nigga got it locked (so tight, so tight)
Tell me why you just can't stop (just can't stop)
I'm thinking that it's all about me (all about me)

I got the sixty inch flat TV, what?
Satellite, DVD, whatever you need
I got the bubbles in the tub with the back rub (bathtub)
Silk sheets baby to make love
Oh girl I wanna hit it in the worst way
After that you'll be coming back like every day (oh yeah)
Send you back to your girls with something else to say
How I hit it, split it, had you with it 'til the break of day

Could it be the drop top Benz
That got your friends going out on a limb (huh?)
Sliding me numbers when you ain't watching them (watching them)
Playing me close but I'm not feeling them (oh no, oh no)
Could it be the time piece flooded with chips?
Is it because I flex baguettes around my wrist? (huh)
Or large amounts up in my bank account (my bank account)
You tell me you love me baby but what's that all about (ooohhh)

Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
How ya fi give ya woman access to your villa?
Trespass and a witness all the hackling on the pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player you've to know how to play
If she say, “a night”, convince her, say, “a day”
Never admit to a word what she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, “Baby, no way!”

It has to be three years

Of the wild and crazy times
We used to have with one another

We absolutely didn't care
We would do it anywhere
Eye contact, and it was over, hmm
But that's when I was wild, and now
I couldn't care less about
Someone gettin' hurt
I've done my share of dirt
But I done wised up

Chorus - Seein' you reminds me of
All the nights I used to beat it up
I would do it again, but I can't
Cuz everything is different now
I finally have settled down
And became a one woman man

Ooh
There were many others after you
Quite a few one night stands
Some of their names I can't remember
Imagine wakin' up with someone who
You barely even knew
Time and time again

But there's someone for everyone
I've been blessed to find that one
Who makes me feel like no other
You are lookin' good as hell
But I can't go home with you
Because I'm goin' home to her

Long gone, are the days
When I ran the streets
Tryin' to get laid

Until that dream was you
When I look into your eyes
The sky's a different blue
Cross my heart
I wear no disguise
If I tried, you'd make believe
That you believed my lies

You pick me up when I fall down
You ring the bell before they count me out
If I was drowning you would part the sea
And risk your own life to rescue me

And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that

She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story

On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever??
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool

(I'm trying to hold on to you)
Though it hurts me so
Gotta let you know
That the love we once shared now is through
Say goodbye to you

[Verse 2]
You seem to hurt me purposely
I didn't understand it
Oh girl, why me?
I had no choice
What was best for us
Was to terminate our love and be free

[Bridge 2]
What's a man to do when he just can't take no more?
Oh, what's a man to do?
What am I to do when my heart leads me to the door?
Now we've tried and tried again
But now this is the end
Tell me what's the use of holding on
If we can't be friends

[Chorus (x2)]
I'm emotional
And I can't let go
I am trying to hold on to you
Though it hurts me so
Gotta let you know
That the love we once shared now is through
Say goodbye to you

[Bridge 2]
What's a man to do when he just can't take no more?
What's a man to do?
What am I to do when my heart leads me to the door?
Now we've tried and tried again
But now this is the end
Tell me what's the use of holding on
If we can't be friends

[Chorus]
I'm emotional
And I can't let go
I am trying to hold on to you (I'm trying, I'm trying)
Though it hurts me so
Gotta let you know (Gotta let you go, gotta let you know)
That the love we once shared now is through
Say goodbye to you

I'm emotional (How emotional)
And I can't let go
I am trying to hold on to you
(I can't stop crying, my heart is slowly dying)
Though it hurts me so
Gotta let you know
That the love we once shared now is through
(The love that we once shared, you know it's through)",Carl Thomas,Carl Thomas,2001,"[99, 91, 82, 87, 76, 63, 69, 69, 62, 60, 52, 49, 52, 53]",14
295,Independent Women Part I,"July 5, 1852

Mr. President, Friends and Fellow Citizens:

He who could address this audience without a quailing sensation, has stronger nerves than I have. I do not remember ever to have appeared as a speaker before any assembly more
shrinkingly, nor with greater distrust of my ability, than I do this day. A feeling has crept over me, quite unfavorable to the exercise of my limited powers of speech. The task before me is one which requires much previous thought and study for its proper performance. I know that apologies of this sort are generally considered flat and unmeaning. I trust, however, that mine will not be so considered. Should I seem at ease, my appearance would much misrepresent me. The little experience I have had in addressing public meetings, in country schoolhouses, avails me nothing on the present occasion.

The papers and placards say, that I am to deliver a 4th [of] July oration. This certainly sounds large, and out of the common way, for it is true that I have often had the privilege to speak in this beautiful Hall, and to address many who now honor me with their presence. But neither their familiar faces, nor the perfect gage I think I have of Corinthian Hall, seems to free me from embarrassment.

The fact is, ladies and gentlemen, the distance between this platform and the slave plantation, from which I escaped, is considerable—and the difficulties to be overcome in getting from the latter to the former, are by no means slight. That I am here to-day is, to me, a matter of astonishment as well as of gratitude. You will not, therefore, be surprised, if in what I have to say I evince no elaborate preparation, nor grace my speech with any high sounding exordium. With little experience and with less learning, I have been able to throw my thoughts hastily and imperfectly together; and trusting to your patient and generous indulgence, I will proceed to lay them before you.

This, for the purpose of this celebration, is the 4th of July. It is the birthday of your National Independence, and of your political freedom. This, to you, is what the Passover was to the emancipated people of God. It carries your minds back to the day, and to the act of your great deliverance; and to the signs, and to the wonders, associated with that act, and that day. This celebration also marks the beginning of another year of your national life; and reminds you that the Republic of America is now 76 years old. I am glad, fellow-citizens, that your nation is so young. Seventy-six years, though a good old age for a man, is but a mere speck in the life of a nation. Three score years and ten is the allotted time for individual men; but nations number their years by thousands. According to this fact, you are, even now, only in the beginning of your national career, still lingering in the period of childhood. I repeat, I am glad this is so. There is hope in the thought, and hope is much needed, under the dark clouds which lower above the horizon. The eye of the reformer is met with angry flashes, portending disastrous times; but his heart may well beat lighter at the thought that America is young, and that she is still in the impressible stage of her existence. May he not hope that high lessons of wisdom, of justice and of truth, will yet give direction to her destiny? Were the nation older, the patriot’s heart might be sadder, and the reformer’s brow heavier. Its future might be shrouded in gloom, and the hope of its prophets go out in sorrow. There is consolation in the thought that America is young. Great streams are not easily turned from channels, worn deep in the course of ages. They may sometimes rise in quiet and stately majesty, and inundate the land, refreshing and fertilizing the earth with their mysterious properties. They may also rise in wrath and fury, and bear away, on their angry waves, the accumulated wealth of years of toil and hardship. They, however, gradually flow back to the same old channel, and flow on as serenely as ever. But, while the river may not be turned aside, it may dry up, and leave nothing behind but the withered branch, and the unsightly rock, to howl in the abyss-sweeping wind, the sad tale of departed glory. As with rivers so with nations.

Fellow-citizens, I shall not presume to dwell at length on the associations that cluster about this day. The simple story of it is that, 76 years ago, the people of this country were British subjects. The style and title of your “sovereign people” (in which you now glory) was not then born. You were under the British Crown. Your fathers esteemed the English Government as the home government; and England as the fatherland. This home government, you know, although a considerable distance from your home, did, in the exercise of its parental prerogatives, impose upon its colonial children, such restraints, burdens and limitations, as, in its mature judgment, it deemed wise, right and proper.

But, your fathers, who had not adopted the fashionable idea of this day, of the infallibility of government, and the absolute character of its acts, presumed to differ from the home government in respect to the wisdom and the justice of some of those burdens and restraints. They went so far in their excitement as to pronounce the measures of government unjust, unreasonable, and oppressive, and altogether such as ought not to be quietly submitted to. I scarcely need say, fellow-citizens, that my opinion of those measures fully accords with that of your fathers. Such a declaration of agreement on my part would not be worth much to anybody. It would, certainly, prove nothing, as to what part I might have taken, had I lived during the great controversy of 1776. To say now that America was right, and England wrong, is exceedingly easy. Everybody can say it; the dastard, not less than the noble brave, can flippantly discant on the tyranny of England towards the American Colonies. It is fashionable to do so; but there was a time when to pronounce against England, and in favor of the cause of the colonies, tried men’s souls. They who did so were accounted in their day, plotters of mischief, agitators and rebels, dangerous men. To side with the right, against the wrong, with the weak against the strong, and with the oppressed against the oppressor! here lies the merit, and the one which, of all others, seems unfashionable in our day. The cause of liberty may be stabbed by the men who glory in the deeds of your fathers. But, to proceed.

Feeling themselves harshly and unjustly treated by the home government, your fathers, like men of honesty, and men of spirit, earnestly sought redress. They petitioned and remonstrated; they did so in a decorous, respectful, and loyal manner. Their conduct was wholly unexceptionable. This, however, did not answer the purpose. They saw themselves treated with sovereign indifference, coldness and scorn. Yet they persevered. They were not the men to look back.

As the sheet anchor takes a firmer hold, when the ship is tossed by the storm, so did the cause of your fathers grow stronger, as it breasted the chilling blasts of kingly displeasure. The greatest and best of British statesmen admitted its justice, and the loftiest eloquence of the British Senate came to its support. But, with that blindness which seems to be the unvarying characteristic of tyrants, since Pharaoh and his hosts were drowned in the Red Sea, the British Government persisted in the exactions complained of.

The madness of this course, we believe, is admitted now, even by England; but we fear the lesson is wholly lost on our present ruler.

Oppression makes a wise man mad. Your fathers were wise men, and if they did not go mad, they became restive under this treatment. They felt themselves the victims of grievous wrongs, wholly incurable in their colonial capacity. With brave men there is always a remedy for oppression. Just here, the idea of a total separation of the colonies from the crown was born! It was a startling idea, much more so, than we, at this distance of time, regard it. The timid and the prudent (as has been intimated) of that day, were, of course, shocked and alarmed by it.

Such people lived then, had lived before, and will, probably, ever have a place on this planet; and their course, in respect to any great change, (no matter how great the good to be attained, or the wrong to be redressed by it), may be calculated with as much precision as can be the course of the stars. They hate all changes, but silver, gold and copper change! Of this sort of change they are always strongly in favor.

These people were called Tories in the days of your fathers; and the appellation, probably, conveyed the same idea that is meant by a more modern, though a somewhat less euphonious term, which we often find in our papers, applied to some of our old politicians.

Their opposition to the then dangerous thought was earnest and powerful; but, amid all their terror and affrighted vociferations against it, the alarming and revolutionary idea moved on, and the country with it.

On the 2d of July, 1776, the old Continental Congress, to the dismay of the lovers of ease, and the worshipers of property, clothed that dreadful idea with all the authority of national sanction. They did so in the form of a resolution; and as we seldom hit upon resolutions, drawn up in our day whose transparency is at all equal to this, it may refresh your minds and help my story if I read it. “Resolved, That these united colonies are, and of right, ought to be free and Independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown; and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, dissolved.”

Citizens, your fathers made good that resolution. They succeeded; and to-day you reap the fruits of their success. The freedom gained is yours; and you, therefore, may properly celebrate this anniversary. The 4th of July is the first great fact in your nation’s history—the very ring-bolt in the chain of your yet undeveloped destiny.

Pride and patriotism, not less than gratitude, prompt you to celebrate and to hold it in perpetual remembrance. I have said that the Declaration of Independence is the ring-bolt to the chain of your nation’s destiny; so, indeed, I regard it. The principles contained in that instrument are saving principles. Stand by those principles, be true to them on all occasions, in all places, against all foes, and at whatever cost.

From the round top of your ship of state, dark and threatening clouds may be seen. Heavy billows, like mountains in the distance, disclose to the leeward huge forms of flinty rocks! That bolt drawn, that chain broken, and all is lost. Cling to this day—cling to it, and to its principles, with the grasp of a storm-tossed mariner to a spar at midnight.

The coming into being of a nation, in any circumstances, is an interesting event. But, besides general considerations, there were peculiar circumstances which make the advent of this republic an event of special attractiveness.

The whole scene, as I look back to it, was simple, dignified and sublime.

The population of the country, at the time, stood at the insignificant number of three millions. The country was poor in the munitions of war. The population was weak and scattered, and the country a wilderness unsubdued. There were then no means of concert and combination, such as exist now. Neither steam nor lightning had then been reduced to order and discipline. From the Potomac to the Delaware was a journey of many days. Under these, and innumerable other disadvantages, your fathers declared for liberty and independence and triumphed.

Fellow Citizens, I am not wanting in respect for the fathers of this republic. The signers of the Declaration of Independence were brave men. They were great men too—great enough to give fame to a great age. It does not often happen to a nation to raise, at one time, such a number of truly great men. The point from which I am compelled to view them is not, certainly, the most favorable; and yet I cannot contemplate their great deeds with less than admiration. They were statesmen, patriots and heroes, and for the good they did, and the principles they contended for, I will unite with you to honor their memory.

They loved their country better than their own private interests; and, though this is not the highest form of human excellence, all will concede that it is a rare virtue, and that when it is exhibited, it ought to command respect. He who will, intelligently, lay down his life for his country, is a man whom it is not in human nature to despise. Your fathers staked their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, on the cause of their country. In their admiration of liberty, they lost sight of all other interests.

They were peace men; but they preferred revolution to peaceful submission to bondage. They were quiet men; but they did not shrink from agitating against oppression. They showed forbearance; but that they knew its limits. They believed in order; but not in the order of tyranny. With them, nothing was “settled” that was not right. With them, justice, liberty and humanity were “final;” not slavery and oppression. You may well cherish the memory of such men. They were great in their day and generation. Their solid manhood stands out the more as we contrast it with these degenerate times.

How circumspect, exact and proportionate were all their movements! How unlike the politicians of an hour! Their statesmanship looked beyond the passing moment, and stretched away in strength into the distant future. They seized upon eternal principles, and set a glorious example in their defense. Mark them!

Fully appreciating the hardship to be encountered, firmly believing in the right of their cause, honorably inviting the scrutiny of an on-looking world, reverently appealing to heaven to attest their sincerity, soundly comprehending the solemn responsibility they were about to assume, wisely measuring the terrible odds against them, your fathers, the fathers of this republic, did, most deliberately, under the inspiration of a glorious patriotism, and with a sublime faith in the great principles of justice and freedom, lay deep the corner-stone of the national superstructure, which has risen and still rises in grandeur around you.

Of this fundamental work, this day is the anniversary. Our eyes are met with demonstrations of joyous enthusiasm. Banners and pennants wave exultingly on the breeze. The din of business, too, is hushed. Even Mammon seems to have quitted his grasp on this day. The ear-piercing fife and the stirring drum unite their accents with the ascending peal of a thousand church bells. Prayers are made, hymns are sung, and sermons are preached in honor of this day; while the quick martial tramp of a great and multitudinous nation, echoed back by all the hills, valleys and mountains of a vast continent, bespeak the occasion one of thrilling and universal interest—a nation’s jubilee.

Friends and citizens, I need not enter further into the causes which led to this anniversary. Many of you understand them better than I do. You could instruct me in regard to them. That is a branch of knowledge in which you feel, perhaps, a much deeper interest than your speaker. The causes which led to the separation of the colonies from the British crown have never lacked for a tongue. They have all been taught in your common schools, narrated at your firesides, unfolded from your pulpits, and thundered from your legislative halls, and are as familiar to you as household words. They form the staple of your national poetry and eloquence.

I remember, also, that, as a people, Americans are remarkably familiar with all facts which make in their own favor. This is esteemed by some as a national trait—perhaps a national weakness. It is a fact, that whatever makes for the wealth or for the reputation of Americans, and can be had cheap! will be found by Americans. I shall not be charged with slandering Americans, if I say I think the American side of any question may be safely left in American hands.

I leave, therefore, the great deeds of your fathers to other gentlemen whose claim to have been regularly descended will be less likely to be disputed than mine!

My business, if I have any here to-day, is with the present. The accepted time with God and his cause is the ever-living now.
Trust no future, however pleasant,
Let the dead past bury its dead;
Act, act in the living present,
Heart within, and God overhead.We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and to the future. To all inspiring motives, to noble deeds which can be gained from the past, we are welcome. But now is the time, the important time. Your fathers have lived, died, and have done their work, and have done much of it well. You live and must die, and you must do your work. You have no right to enjoy a child’s share in the labor of your fathers, unless your children are to be blest by your labors. You have no right to wear out and waste the hard-earned fame of your fathers to cover your indolence. Sydney Smith tells us that men seldom eulogize the wisdom and virtues of their fathers, but to excuse some folly or wickedness of their own. This truth is not a doubtful one. There are illustrations of it near and remote, ancient and modern. It was fashionable, hundreds of years ago, for the children of Jacob to boast, we have “Abraham to our father,” when they had long lost Abraham’s faith and spirit. That people contented themselves under the shadow of Abraham’s great name, while they repudiated the deeds which made his name great. Need I remind you that a similar thing is being done all over this country to-day? Need I tell you that the Jews are not the only people who built the tombs of the prophets, and garnished the sepulchres of the righteous? Washington could not die till he had broken the chains of his slaves. Yet his monument is built up by the price of human blood, and the traders in the bodies and souls of men shout—”We have Washington to our father.”—Alas! that it should be so; yet so it is.
The evil that men do, lives after them, The good is oft-interred with their bones.Fellow-citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? and am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?

Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions! Then would my task be light, and my burden easy and delightful. For who is there so cold, that a nation’s sympathy could not warm him? Who so obdurate and dead to the claims of gratitude, that would not thankfully acknowledge such priceless benefits? Who so stolid and selfish, that would not give his voice to swell the hallelujahs of a nation’s jubilee, when the chains of servitude had been torn from his limbs? I am not that man. In a case like that, the dumb might eloquently speak, and the “lame man leap as an hart.”

But, such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. —The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth [of] July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak to-day? If so, there is a parallel to your conduct. And let me warn you that it is dangerous to copy the example of a nation whose crimes, lowering up to heaven, were thrown down by the breath of the Almighty, burying that nation in irrecoverable ruin! I can to-day take up the plaintive lament of a peeled and woe-smitten people!

“By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yea! we wept when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there, they that carried us away captive, required of us a song; and they who wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How can we sing the Lord’s song in a strange land? If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.”

Fellow-citizens; above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wail of millions! whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are, to-day, rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them. If I do forget, if I do not faithfully remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day, “may my right hand forget her cunning, and may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!” To forget them, to pass lightly over their wrongs, and to chime in with the popular theme, would be treason most scandalous and shocking, and would make me a reproach before God and the world. My subject, then fellow-citizens, is AMERICAN SLAVERY. I shall see, this day, and its popular characteristics, from the slave’s point of view. Standing, there, identified with the American bondman, making his wrongs mine, I do not hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this 4th of July! Whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the professions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting. America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future. Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and the Bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can command, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery—the great sin and shame of America! “I will not equivocate; I will not excuse;” I will use the severest language I can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man, whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just.

But I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, it is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind. Would you argue more, and denounce less, would you persuade more, and rebuke less, your cause would be much more likely to succeed. But, I submit, where all is plain there is nothing to be argued. What point in the anti-slavery creed would you have me argue? On what branch of the subject do the people of this country need light? Must I undertake to prove that the slave is a man? That point is conceded already. Nobody doubts it. The slaveholders themselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government. They acknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave. There are seventy-two crimes in the State of Virginia, which, if committed by a black man, (no matter how ignorant he be), subject him to the punishment of death; while only two of the same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment. What is this but the acknowledgement that the slave is a moral, intellectual and responsible being? The manhood of the slave is conceded. It is admitted in the fact that Southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding, under severe fines and penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or to write. When you can point to any such laws, in reference to the beasts of the field, then I may consent to argue the manhood of the slave. When the dogs in your streets, when the fowls of the air, when the cattle on your hills, when the fish of the sea, and the reptiles that crawl, shall be unable to distinguish the slave from a brute, then will I argue with you that the slave is a man!

For the present, it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the Negro race. Is it not astonishing that, while we are ploughing, planting and reaping, using all kinds of mechanical tools, erecting houses, constructing bridges, building ships, working in metals of brass, iron, copper, silver and gold; that, while we are reading, writing and cyphering, acting as clerks, merchants and secretaries, having among us lawyers, doctors, ministers, poets, authors, editors, orators and teachers; that, while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises common to other men, digging gold in California, capturing the whale in the Pacific, feeding sheep and cattle on the hill-side, living, moving, acting, thinking, planning, living in families as husbands, wives and children, and, above all, confessing and worshipping the Christian’s God, and looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave, we are called upon to prove that we are men!

Would you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? that he is the rightful owner of his own body? You have already declared it. Must I argue the wrongfulness of slavery? Is that a question for Republicans? Is it to be settled by the rules of logic and argumentation, as a matter beset with great difficulty, involving a doubtful application of the principle of justice, hard to be understood? How should I look to-day, in the presence of Americans, dividing, and subdividing a discourse, to show that men have a natural right to freedom? speaking of it relatively, and positively, negatively, and affirmatively. To do so, would be to make myself ridiculous, and to offer an insult to your understanding.—There is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven, that does not know that slavery is wrong for him.

What, am I to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes, to rob them of their liberty, to work them without wages, to keep them ignorant of their relations to their fellow men, to beat them with sticks, to flay their flesh with the lash, to load their limbs with irons, to hunt them with dogs, to sell them at auction, to sunder their families, to knock out their teeth, to bum their flesh, to starve them into obedience and submission to their masters? Must I argue that a system thus marked with blood, and stained with pollution, is wrong? No! I will not. I have better employments for my time and strength than such arguments would imply.

What, then, remains to be argued? Is it that slavery is not divine; that God did not establish it; that our doctors of divinity are mistaken? There is blasphemy in the thought. That which is inhuman, cannot be divine! Who can reason on such a proposition? They that can, may; I cannot. The time for such argument is passed.

At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. O! had I the ability, and could I reach the nation’s ear, I would, to-day, pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.

What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy—a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.

Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world, travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.

Take the American slave-trade, which, we are told by the papers, is especially prosperous just now. Ex-Senator Benton tells us that the price of men was never higher than now. He mentions the fact to show that slavery is in no danger. This trade is one of the peculiarities of American institutions. It is carried on in all the large towns and cities in one-half of this confederacy; and millions are pocketed every year, by dealers in this horrid traffic. In several states, this trade is a chief source of wealth. It is called (in contradistinction to the foreign slave-trade) “the internal slave trade.” It is, probably, called so, too, in order to divert from it the horror with which the foreign slave-trade is contemplated. That trade has long since been denounced by this government, as piracy. It has been denounced with burning words, from the high places of the nation, as an execrable traffic. To arrest it, to put an end to it, this nation keeps a squadron, at immense cost, on the coast of Africa. Everywhere, in this country, it is safe to speak of this foreign slave-trade, as a most inhuman traffic, opposed alike to the laws of God and of man. The duty to extirpate and destroy it, is admitted even by our DOCTORS OF DIVINITY. In order to put an end to it, some of these last have consented that their colored brethren (nominally free) should leave this country, and establish themselves on the western coast of Africa! It is, however, a notable fact that, while so much execration is poured out by Americans upon those engaged in the foreign slave-trade, the men engaged in the slave-trade between the states pass without condemnation, and their business is deemed honorable.

Behold the practical operation of this internal slave-trade, the American slave-trade, sustained by American politics and America religion. Here you will see men and women reared like swine for the market. You know what is a swine-drover? I will show you a man-drover. They inhabit all our Southern States. They perambulate the country, and crowd the highways of the nation, with droves of human stock. You will see one of these human flesh-jobbers, armed with pistol, whip and bowie-knife, driving a company of a hundred men, women, and children, from the Potomac to the slave market at New Orleans. These wretched people are to be sold singly, or in lots, to suit purchasers. They are food for the cotton-field, and the deadly sugar-mill. Mark the sad procession, as it moves wearily along, and the inhuman wretch who drives them. Hear his savage yells and his blood-chilling oaths, as he hurries on his affrighted captives! There, see the old man, with locks thinned and gray. Cast one glance, if you please, upon that young mother, whose shoulders are bare to the scorching sun, her briny tears falling on the brow of the babe in her arms. See, too, that girl of thirteen, weeping, yes! weeping, as she thinks of the mother from whom she has been torn! The drove moves tardily. Heat and sorrow have nearly consumed their strength; suddenly you hear a quick snap, like the discharge of a rifle; the fetters clank, and the chain rattles simultaneously; your ears are saluted with a scream, that seems to have torn its way to the center of your soul! The crack you heard, was the sound of the slave-whip; the scream you heard, was from the woman you saw with the babe. Her speed had faltered under the weight of her child and her chains! that gash on her shoulder tells her to move on. Follow the drove to New Orleans. Attend the auction; see men examined like horses; see the forms of women rudely and brutally exposed to the shocking gaze of American slave-buyers. See this drove sold and separated forever; and never forget the deep, sad sobs that arose from that scattered multitude. Tell me citizens, WHERE, under the sun, you can witness a spectacle more fiendish and shocking. Yet this is but a glance at the American slave-trade, as it exists, at this moment, in the ruling part of the United States.

I was born amid such sights and scenes. To me the American slave-trade is a terrible reality. When a child, my soul was often pierced with a sense of its horrors. I lived on Philpot Street, Fell’s Point, Baltimore, and have watched from the wharves, the slave ships in the Basin, anchored from the shore, with their cargoes of human flesh, waiting for favorable winds to waft them down the Chesapeake. There was, at that time, a grand slave mart kept at the head of Pratt Street, by Austin Woldfolk. His agents were sent into every town and county in Maryland, announcing their arrival, through the papers, and on flaming “hand-bills,” headed CASH FOR NEGROES. These men were generally well dressed men, and very captivating in their manners. Ever ready to drink, to treat, and to gamble. The fate of many a slave has depended upon the turn of a single card; and many a child has been snatched from the arms of its mother by bargains arranged in a state of brutal drunkenness.

The flesh-mongers gather up their victims by dozens, and drive them, chained, to the general depot at Baltimore. When a sufficient number have been collected here, a ship is chartered, for the purpose of conveying the forlorn crew to Mobile, or to New Orleans. From the slave prison to the ship, they are usually driven in the darkness of night; for since the antislavery agitation, a certain caution is observed.

In the deep still darkness of midnight, I have been often aroused by the dead heavy footsteps, and the piteous cries of the chained gangs that passed our door. The anguish of my boyish heart was intense; and I was often consoled, when speaking to my mistress in the morning, to hear her say that the custom was very wicked; that she hated to hear the rattle of the chains, and the heart-rending cries. I was glad to find one who sympathized with me in my horror.

Fellow-citizens, this murderous traffic is, to-day, in active operation in this boasted republic. In the solitude of my spirit, I see clouds of dust raised on the highways of the South; I see the bleeding footsteps; I hear the doleful wail of fettered humanity, on the way to the slave-markets, where the victims are to be sold like horses, sheep, and swine, knocked off to the highest bidder. There I see the tenderest ties ruthlessly broken, to gratify the lust, caprice and rapacity of the buyers and sellers of men. My soul sickens at the sight.
Is this the land your Fathers loved,
The freedom which they toiled to win?
Is this the earth whereon they moved?
Are these the graves they slumber in?But a still more inhuman, disgraceful, and scandalous state of things remains to be presented. By an act of the American Congress, not yet two years old, slavery has been nationalized in its most horrible and revolting form. By that act, Mason and Dixon’s line has been obliterated; New York has become as Virginia; and the power to hold, hunt, and sell men, women, and children as slaves remains no longer a mere state institution, but is now an institution of the whole United States. The power is co-extensive with the Star-Spangled Banner and American Christianity. Where these go, may also go the merciless slave-hunter. Where these are, man is not sacred. He is a bird for the sportsman’s gun. By that most foul and fiendish of all human decrees, the liberty and person of every man are put in peril. Your broad republican domain is hunting ground for men. Not for thieves and robbers, enemies of society, merely, but for men guilty of no crime. Your lawmakers have commanded all good citizens to engage in this hellish sport. Your President, your Secretary of State, your lords, nobles, and ecclesiastics, enforce, as a duty you owe to your free and glorious country, and to your God, that you do this accursed thing. Not fewer than forty Americans have, within the past two years, been hunted down and, without a moment’s warning, hurried away in chains, and consigned to slavery and excruciating torture. Some of these have had wives and children, dependent on them for bread; but of this, no account was made. The right of the hunter to his prey stands superior to the right of marriage, and to all rights in this republic, the rights of God included! For black men there are neither law, justice, humanity, not religion. The Fugitive Slave Law makes mercy to them a crime; and bribes the judge who tries them. An American judge gets ten dollars for every victim he con signs to slavery, and five, when he fails to do so. The oath of any two villains is sufficient, under this hell-black enactment, to send the most pious and exemplary black man into the remorseless jaws of slavery! His own testimony is nothing. He can bring no witnesses for himself. The minister of American justice is bound by the law to hear but one side; and that side, is the side of the oppressor. Let this damning fact be perpetually told. Let it be thundered around the world, that, in tyrant-killing, king-hating, people-loving, democratic, Christian America, the seats of justice are filled with judges, who hold their offices under an open and palpable bribe, and are bound, in deciding in the case of a man’s liberty, hear only his accusers!

In glaring violation of justice, in shameless disregard of the forms of administering law, in cunning arrangement to entrap the defenseless, and in diabolical intent, this Fugitive Slave Law stands alone in the annals of tyrannical legislation. I doubt if there be another nation on the globe, having the brass and the baseness to put such a law on the statute-book. If any man in this assembly thinks differently from me in this matter, and feels able to disprove my statements, I will gladly confront him at any suitable time and place he may select.

I take this law to be one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty, and, if the churches and ministers of our country were not stupidly blind, or most wickedly indifferent, they, too, would so regard it.

At the very moment that they are thanking God for the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, and for the right to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, they are utterly silent in respect to a law which robs religion of its chief significance, and makes it utterly worthless to a world lying in wickedness. Did this law concern the “mint, anise, and cumin“—abridge the fight to sing psalms, to partake of the sacrament, or to engage in any of the ceremonies of religion, it would be smitten by the thunder of a thousand pulpits. A general shout would go up from the church, demanding repeal, repeal, instant repeal!—And it would go hard with that politician who presumed to solicit the votes of the people without inscribing this motto on his banner. Further, if this demand were not complied with, another Scotland would be added to the history of religious liberty, and the stern old Covenanters would be thrown into the shade. A John Knox would be seen at every church door, and heard from every pulpit, and Fillmore would have no more quarter than was shown by Knox, to the beautiful, but treacherous queen Mary of Scotland. The fact that the church of our country, (with fractional exceptions), does not esteem “the Fugitive Slave Law” as a declaration of war against religious liberty, implies that that church regards religion simply as a form of worship, an empty ceremony, and not a vital principle, requiring active benevolence, justice, love and good will towards man. It esteems sacrifice above mercy; psalm-singing above right doing; solemn meetings above practical righteousness. A worship that can be conducted by persons who refuse to give shelter to the houseless, to give bread to the hungry, clothing to the naked, and who enjoin obedience to a law forbidding these acts of mercy, is a curse, not a blessing to mankind. The Bible addresses all such persons as “scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites, who pay tithe of mint, anise, and cumin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith.”

But the church of this country is not only indifferent to the wrongs of the slave, it actually takes sides with the oppressors. It has made itself the bulwark of American slavery, and the shield of American slave-hunters. Many of its most eloquent Divines. who stand as the very lights of the church, have shamelessly given the sanction of religion and the Bible to the whole slave system. They have taught that man may, properly, be a slave; that the relation of master and slave is ordained of God; that to send back an escaped bondman to his master is clearly the duty of all the followers of the Lord Jesus Christ; and this horrible blasphemy is palmed off upon the world for Christianity.

For my part, I would say, welcome infidelity! welcome atheism! welcome anything! in preference to the gospel, as preached by those Divines! They convert the very name of religion into an engine of tyranny, and barbarous cruelty, and serve to confirm more infidels, in this age, than all the infidel writings of Thomas Paine, Voltaire, and Bolingbroke, put together, have done! These ministers make religion a cold and flinty-hearted thing, having neither principles of right action, nor bowels of compassion. They strip the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throng of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form. It is a religion for oppressors, tyrants, man-stealers, and thugs. It is not that “pure and undefiled religion” which is from above, and which is “first pure, then peaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.” But a religion which favors the rich against the poor; which exalts the proud above the humble; which divides mankind into two classes, tyrants and slaves; which says to the man in chains, stay there; and to the oppressor, oppress on; it is a religion which may be professed and enjoyed by all the robbers and enslavers of mankind; it makes God a respecter of persons, denies his fatherhood of the race, and tramples in the dust the great truth of the brotherhood of man. All this we affirm to be true of the popular church, and the popular worship of our land and nation – a religion, a church, and a worship which, on the authority of inspired wisdom, we pronounce to be an abomination in the sight of God. In the language of Isaiah, the American church might be well addressed, “Bring no more vain ablations; incense is an abomination unto me: the new moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity even the solemn meeting. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth. They are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear them; and when ye spread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you. Yea! when ye make many prayers, I will not hear. YOUR HANDS ARE FULL OF BLOOD; cease to do evil, learn to do well; seek judgment; relieve the oppressed; judge for the fatherless; plead for the widow.”

The American church is guilty, when viewed in connection with what it is doing to uphold slavery; but it is superlatively guilty when viewed in connection with its ability to abolish slavery. The sin of which it is guilty is one of omission as well as of commission. Albert Barnes but uttered what the common sense of every man at all observant of the actual state of the case will receive as truth, when he declared that “There is no power out of the church that could sustain slavery an hour, if it were not sustained in it.”

Let the religious press, the pulpit, the Sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, Bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds; and that they do not do this involves them in the most awful responsibility of which the mind can conceive.

In prosecuting the anti-slavery enterprise, we have been asked to spare the church, to spare the ministry; but how, we ask, could such a thing be done? We are met on the threshold of our efforts for the redemption of the slave, by the church and ministry of the country, in battle arrayed against us; and we are compelled to fight or flee. From what quarter, I beg to know, has proceeded a fire so deadly upon our ranks, during the last two years, as from the Northern pulpit? As the champions of oppressors, the chosen men of American theology have appeared—men, honored for their so-called piety, and their real learning. The Lords of Buffalo, the Springs of New York, the Lathrops of Auburn, the Coxes and Spencers of Brooklyn, the Gannets and Sharps of Boston, the Deweys of Washington, and other great religious lights of the land have, in utter denial of the authority of Him by whom the professed to he called to the ministry, deliberately taught us, against the example or the Hebrews and against the remonstrance of the Apostles, they teach that we ought to obey man’s law before the law of God.

My spirit wearies of such blasphemy; and how such men can be supported, as the “standing types and representatives of Jesus Christ,” is a mystery which I leave others to penetrate. In speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land. There are exceptions, and I thank God that there are. Noble men may be found, scattered all over these Northern States, of whom Henry Ward Beecher of Brooklyn, Samuel J. May of Syracuse, and my esteemed friend (Rev. R, R. Raymond) on the platform, are shining examples; and let me say further, that upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave’s redemption from his chains.

One is struck with the difference between the attitude of the American church towards the anti-slavery movement, and that occupied by the churches in England towards a similar movement in that country. There, the church, true to its mission of ameliorating, elevating, and improving the condition of mankind, came forward promptly, bound up the wounds of the West Indian slave, and restored him to his liberty. There, the question of emancipation was a high religious question. It was demanded, in the name of humanity, and according to the law of the living God. The Sharps, the Clarksons, the Wilberforces, the Buxtons, and Burchells and the Knibbs, were alike famous for their piety, and for their philanthropy. The anti-slavery movement there was not an anti-church movement, for the reason that the church took its full share in prosecuting that movement: and the anti-slavery movement in this country will cease to be an anti-church movement, when the church of this country shall assume a favorable, instead or a hostile position towards that movement. Americans! your republican politics, not less than your republican religion, are flagrantly inconsistent. You boast of your love of liberty, your superior civilization, and your pure Christianity, while the whole political power of the nation (as embodied in the two great political parties), is solemnly pledged to support and perpetuate the enslavement of three millions of your countrymen. You hurl your anathemas at the crowned headed tyrants of Russia and Austria, and pride yourselves on your Democratic institutions, while you yourselves consent to be the mere tools and body-guards of the tyrants of Virginia and Carolina. You invite to your shores fugitives of oppression from abroad, honor them with banquets, greet them with ovations, cheer them, toast them, salute them, protect them, and pour out your money to them like water; but the fugitives from your own land you advertise, hunt, arrest, shoot and kill. You glory in your refinement and your universal education yet you maintain a system as barbarous and dreadful as ever stained the character of a nation—a system begun in avarice, supported in pride, and perpetuated in cruelty. You shed tears over fallen Hungary, and make the sad story of her wrongs the theme of your poets, statesmen and orators, till your gallant sons are ready to fly to arms to vindicate her cause against her oppressors; but, in regard to the ten thousand wrongs of the American slave, you would enforce the strictest silence, and would hail him as an enemy of the nation who dares to make those wrongs the subject of public discourse! You are all on fire at the mention of liberty for France or for Ireland; but are as cold as an iceberg at the thought of liberty for the enslaved of America. You discourse eloquently on the dignity of labor; yet, you sustain a system which, in its very essence, casts a stigma upon labor. You can bare your bosom to the storm of British artillery to throw off a threepenny tax on tea; and yet wring the last hard-earned farthing from the grasp of the black laborers of your country. You profess to believe “that, of one blood, God made all nations of men to dwell on the face of all the earth,” and hath commanded all men, everywhere to love one another; yet you notoriously hate, (and glory in your hatred), all men whose skins are not colored like your own. You declare, before the world, and are understood by the world to declare, that you “hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal; and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; and that, among these are, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;” and yet, you hold securely, in a bondage which, according to your own Thomas Jefferson, “is worse than ages of that which your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose,” a seventh part of the inhabitants of your country.

Fellow-citizens! I will not enlarge further on your national inconsistencies. The existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretence, and your Christianity as a lie. It destroys your moral power abroad; it corrupts your politicians at home. It saps the foundation of religion; it makes your name a hissing, and a by word to a mocking earth. It is the antagonistic force in your government, the only thing that seriously disturbs and endangers your Union. It fetters your progress; it is the enemy of improvement, the deadly foe of education; it fosters pride; it breeds insolence; it promotes vice; it shelters crime; it is a curse to the earth that supports it; and yet, you cling to it, as if it were the sheet anchor of all your hopes. Oh! be warned! be warned! a horrible reptile is coiled up in your nation’s bosom; the venomous creature is nursing at the tender breast of your youthful republic; for the love of God, tear away, and fling from you the hideous monster, and let the weight of twenty millions crush and destroy it forever!

But it is answered in reply to all this, that precisely what I have now denounced is, in fact, guaranteed and sanctioned by the Constitution of the United States; that the right to hold and to hunt slaves is a part of that Constitution framed by the illustrious Fathers of this Republic.

Then, I dare to affirm, notwithstanding all I have said before, your fathers stooped, basely stooped
To palter with us in a double sense:
And keep the word of promise to the ear,
But break it to the heart.And instead of being the honest men I have before declared them to be, they were the veriest imposters that ever practiced on mankind. This is the inevitable conclusion, and from it there is no escape. But I differ from those who charge this baseness on the framers of the Constitution of the United States. It is a slander upon their memory, at least, so I believe. There is not time now to argue the constitutional question at length – nor have I the ability to discuss it as it ought to be discussed. The subject has been handled with masterly power by Lysander Spooner, Esq., by William Goodell, by Samuel E. Sewall, Esq., and last, though not least, by Gerritt Smith, Esq. These gentlemen have, as I think, fully and clearly vindicated the Constitution from any design to support slavery for an hour.

Fellow-citizens! there is no matter in respect to which, the people of the North have allowed themselves to be so ruinously imposed upon, as that of the pro-slavery character of the Constitution. In that instrument I hold there is neither warrant, license, nor sanction of the hateful thing; but, interpreted as it ought to be interpreted, the Constitution is a GLORIOUS LIBERTY DOCUMENT. Read its preamble, consider its purposes. Is slavery among them? Is it at the gateway? or is it in the temple? It is neither. While I do not intend to argue this question on the present occasion, let me ask, if it be not somewhat singular that, if the Constitution were intended to be, by its framers and adopters, a slave-holding instrument, why neither slavery, slaveholding, nor slave can anywhere be found in it. What would be thought of an instrument, drawn up, legally drawn up, for the purpose of entitling the city of Rochester to a track of land, in which no mention of land was made? Now, there are certain rules of interpretation, for the proper understanding of all legal instruments. These rules are well established. They are plain, common-sense rules, such as you and I, and all of us, can understand and apply, without having passed years in the study of law. I scout the idea that the question of the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of slavery is not a question for the people. I hold that every American citizen has a fight to form an opinion of the constitution, and to propagate that opinion, and to use all honorable means to make his opinion the prevailing one. Without this fight, the liberty of an American citizen would be as insecure as that of a Frenchman. Ex-Vice-President Dallas tells us that the Constitution is an object to which no American mind can be too attentive, and no American heart too devoted. He further says, the Constitution, in its words, is plain and intelligible, and is meant for the home-bred, unsophisticated understandings of our fellow-citizens. Senator Berrien tell us that the Constitution is the fundamental law, that which controls all others. The charter of our liberties, which every citizen has a personal interest in understanding thoroughly. The testimony of Senator Breese, Lewis Cass, and many others that might be named, who are everywhere esteemed as sound lawyers, so regard the constitution. I take it, therefore, that it is not presumption in a private citizen to form an opinion of that instrument.

Now, take the Constitution according to its plain reading, and I defy the presentation of a single pro-slavery clause in it. On the other hand it will be found to contain principles and purposes, entirely hostile to the existence of slavery.

I have detained my audience entirely too long already. At some future period I will gladly avail myself of an opportunity to give this subject a full and fair discussion.

Allow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. There are forces in operation, which must inevitably work The downfall of slavery. “The arm of the Lord is not shortened,” and the doom of slavery is certain. I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope. While drawing encouragement from the Declaration of Independence, the great principles it contains, and the genius of American Institutions, my spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age. Nations do not now stand in the same relation to each other that they did ages ago. No nation can now shut itself up from the surrounding world, and trot round in the same old path of its fathers without interference. The time was when such could be done. Long established customs of hurtful character could formerly fence themselves in, and do their evil work with social impunity. Knowledge was then confined and enjoyed by the privileged few, and the multitude walked on in mental darkness. But a change has now come over the affairs of mankind. Walled cities and empires have become unfashionable. The arm of commerce has borne away the gates of the strong city. Intelligence is penetrating the darkest corners of the globe. It makes its pathway over and under the sea, as well as on the earth. Wind, steam, and lightning are its chartered agents. Oceans no longer divide, but link nations together. From Boston to London is now a holiday excursion. Space is comparatively annihilated. Thoughts expressed on one side of the Atlantic are, distinctly heard on the other. The far off and almost fabulous Pacific rolls in grandeur at our feet. The Celestial Empire, the mystery of ages, is being solved. The fiat of the Almighty, “Let there be Light,” has not yet spent its force. No abuse, no outrage whether in taste, sport or avarice, can now hide itself from the all-pervading light. The iron shoe, and crippled foot of China must be seen, in contrast with nature. Africa must rise and put on her yet unwoven garment. “Ethiopia shall stretch out her hand unto God.” In the fervent aspirations of William Lloyd Garrison, I say, and let every heart join in saying it:
God speed the year of jubilee
The wide world o’er
When from their galling chains set free,
Th’ oppress’d shall vilely bend the knee,

And wear the yoke of tyranny
Like brutes no more.
That year will come, and freedom’s reign,
To man his plundered fights again
Restore.

God speed the day when human blood
Shall cease to flow!
In every clime be understood,
The claims of human brotherhood,
And each return for evil, good,
Not blow for blow;
That day will come all feuds to end.
And change into a faithful friend
Each foe.

God speed the hour, the glorious hour,
When none on earth
Shall exercise a lordly power,
Nor in a tyrant’s presence cower;
But all to manhood’s stature tower,
By equal birth!
That hour will come, to each, to all,
And from his prison-house, the thrall
Go forth.

Until that year, day, hour, arrive,
With head, and heart, and hand I’ll strive,
To break the rod, and rend the gyve,
The spoiler of his prey deprive—
So witness Heaven!
And never from my chosen post,
Whate’er the peril or the cost,
Be driven.",Frederick Douglass,Destiny's Child,2001,"[31, 29, 22, 15, 12, 10, 7, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]",13

Friday night I'm going nowhere
All the lights are changing green to red
Turning over TV stations
Situations running through my head
Looking back through time
You know it's clear that I've been blind
I've been a fool
To open up my heart
To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule

Saturday I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing
Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream
Only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid
To show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

If you want it
Come and get it

Shining , Sky is fading red to blue
I'm kicking through the Autumn leaves

Climbing on the stair
I turn around to see you smiling there
In front of me

So open up and tell her that you love her

Brother I've been right where you are now
And my heart was broke
'Cause I never spoke
Those healing words out loud
But I've learned my lesson well
And now every night
Before I close my eyes
I look at my woman and
I ask myself did you

[Chorus]
Tell her that you love her
Tell her that you need her
Tell her that you want her to stay
Reassure her with a kiss

Show her what your feeling

'Cause she needs to know you're thinking of her
So open up and tell her that you love her

Yo, once the Mo start drippin', hoes start trippin'
Tell em my name Boo, you know we all hittin'
But look mami, I got 3 drinks in me, stuck
And I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna fuck
If the pussy gets wetter, chicks, I never sweat her
I'm gettin' all the cheddar
Bitch, read the letter, I patened the plan
Get a dick suck wit a gat in my hand
Bitch, it's thug passion
Chicks drive by in their whips, they be flashin'
""Do you know Bonic and Lib?"", they be askin'
If the bitch wanna ask me shit, I'mma hit
Attitude just like Cancun, I'm a trip
Now niggas pissed, know why? 'Cause I'm the shit
If you cop a 5, imagine what I'm gon get
Lights out, Most Wanted bring the bikes out
Ball out, bitches on their back, ass all out
I got hoes wit accents, and I don't mean Hyundais
My hands touched more bricks than Kwame's
Ice'll blind you, for real, dog, believe me
Only feel comfortable around Ray Charles and Stevie
So I'mma take it easy

Now is you bout it, mami?
Whoa, let me know
Is it the dick, the car, the looks, or the dough?
She said, ""Mostly the dough, playa, I don't lie""
I hit once, then hit her girlfriend
Ask, ""When can we all get together again?""
Man, I never love hoes, what you talkin about?
I party your wife, nigga, you be eatin her out
And I sat there and told you that I cum in her mouth
And my connect the only reason she be runnin' down south

But there's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you’d found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace
It's a beautiful day
The sky falls And you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don’t let it get away
You’re on the road but you’ve got no destination
You’re in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn’t ring true
You’ve been all over and it’s been all over you
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Touch me, take me to that other place
Teach me love, I know I’m not a hopeless case
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out
It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
A beautiful day
Touch me, take me to that other place
Reach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don’t know you can feel it somehow
What you don’t have you don’t need it now

I made a promise to Diane
No more rodeos
I'd gone my last go 'round
The same promise that I made
In San Antone and Santa Fe
But tonight I saddled up
And let her down

[Chorus]
Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild, and her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away

[Verse 2]
She watched me drive around her block
Gettin' courage up to stop
To make her one more promise
That I can't keep
The way I love the rodeo
I guess I should let her go
Before I hurt her more
Than she loves me

Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild, and her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away

Now two years gone, nothing's been won

Just a tank of gas and a good clear station
Playing our favorite song

Some things we ain't done

And she's so fine designed to blow your mind
She's a dominatrix supermodel beauty queen

(Chours)
I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch of Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile, rolled in a body like Jennifer
You got the star of my liquid dreams

(Verse 1)
Angelina Jolie's lips to kiss in the dark
Underneath Cindy C's beauty mark
When it comes to the test well Tyra's the best
And Salma Hayek brings the rest

(Pre Chorus)
Now this hot girl, she's not your average girl
She's a morpharotic dream from a magazine
And she's so fine designed to blow your mind
She's a dominatrix supermodel beauty queen

I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch of Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile, rolled in a body like Jennifer
You got the star of my liquid dreams

(Verse 2)
Looks ain't everything she's got the sweetest personality
Like Halle B
My mama thinks I'm lazy, my friends all think I'm crazy
But in my mind, I leave the world.. oh.. (world behind every night I dream)

Liquid Dreams, my Liquid Dreams
Waterfalls and streams, these liquid dreams

One for the treble, two for the bass
Welcome to the great incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you want to keep pace

[Hook 1: Nate Dogg]
Oh No!
Niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been 7 days, the same clothes
Ask them originals cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Say my name, say my name
Observe how I stake my claim, I independently lay it down
And played my game, my own two raise my flame
Cause dickriding ain't my thang
I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now I'm getting it and they whole grill is crooked
Mad cause I'm getting caked out from my bookings
When y'all was asking permission I just stepped up and took it
What!? The kid's better buy my rookie card now
Cause after this year the price ain't coming down
And if you got a joint bubbling then get money now
Cause in a minute, there's gonna be some real trouble coming out
Just a warning, as usual some cats won't heed it
The hard-headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame the jealous gaze is too short to see it
But when they face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent, or dirty like the 7-1 Precinct
Call it a day or make it a long evenin
You keep on scheming, man give me some more reason
To have the women in your mama's church screaming ""Lord Jesus!""
Harder than y'all cause I'm smarter than y'all
I know that deep down it's got to be bothering y'all
Pay attention, watch Flaco get larger than y'all
Put your pride on the rocks, make you swallow it all
The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do or die stay rumbling and bumbling hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all
East coast on your neck and you ain't shrugging it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumbling off
I'm Daddy Brooklyn, y'all niggas are the sons of New York
Getting spanked when there's too much trouble to talk
Respect mine

[Hook 2: Nate Dogg]
Oh No!
Look at who they let in the back door
From Long Beach to Brooklyn, they know
We rock from the east to west coast
Queens, salute to Pharoahe
Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Very contagious raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages of wackness, Pharoahe's raps are blazin
And it amazes - me how you claim thug
But go two-ways without Skytel pagers
I'm intellectual, pass more essays
Than motorcade police parades through East L.A
More beef then deli's, thus what I vent is just
What you lust to vent, it's irrele'
Huh, hallelujah, Pharoahe Monch'll do ya
Maintain the same frame of mind - screw ya!
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, greet ya with scriptures
I'm equipped to rip ya, reach ya
Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis
Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dosage is leaving you mentally unfocused here
MC's just come on 'round!
You're the next contestants on ""Catch-A-Beat-Down""
Don't be hesitant, sound cracks the sediment
It's evident we medicine for your whole town
Sky's the limit, game's infinite when I'm in it
All windows is tinted
How you seeing me when I'm in it?
Rap, we got it on lock man, stop that
Put that mic back down, boy, drop that
Pharoahe's flows blows shows like afros
We hate y'all though, that's why Nate Dogg goes

The ending of an era and the turning of a page
Now it’s time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord have mercy on my next thirty years

Hey my next thirty years I’m going to have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things I’ve done
Maybe now I’ve conquered all my adolescent fears
And I’ll do it better in my next thirty years

[Verse 3]
My next thirty years I’m going to settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I’m doing here
In my next thirty years

[Verse 4]
Oh my next thirty years, I’m going to watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Maybe I’ll remember my next thirty years

[Verse 5]
My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear

My life hung on what that tear meant
Then she smiled at me
And I lost it

If I lost it

Well the honeymoon ended and life began
Jobs and bills losing touch with friends
And that apartment it got smaller everyday
Then one night the walls finally closed in
I came home late, She said, ""Where've you been
You used to call and tell me you were on your way""
She said, ""If this is how it's gonna be, then I quit""
Then she walked out the door
I lost it

Lose sight of what you believe and call it a night
This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit that you're used to
Teflon territory you just can't shoot through
You gon' shoot who? (Who?) Not even on your best day
Rollin' the Wild West way, givin' it up
Leavin' the whole world stuck not givin' a fuck
Laid in the cut, now we break through in the rut
Hennesey and orange juice baby fill up a cup
Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze
Loosen up, let your hair down and join the festivities
Overcrowd the house like lockdown facilities
Bitches be quick to give me brains while the pistol range
Goin' up and down my dick like the stock exchange

I run it through and money come out
Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Borrow your spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen
I came to give you what you lackin'
Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin'
Rockin' chains, stadiums, paladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop-top tinted on twenties
Usin' rappers like crash test dummies, stackin' real estate and money
It's funny how things change overnight when you thinkin' right

Makin' it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents
The real deal, how does it feel? No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck, demand the respect
Now all your conversations sound strange to me
Seem like everybody around me done changed but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stab a track, strangle the beat - Restless, no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Grimm
It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend
Straight to the chin (Not these niggas again)
Call Doc, bounce to the spot and slide right in
I ain't tryin' to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle
Hennessy, rock plenty of ice, making a double, and scream

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the 50-yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree
And if you like in the club, we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked, don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots, so they got to wait til the show stop
Or how about on the beach with black sand?
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man Ludacris (woo!) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it, lover-lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I passed 'em
Get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and outlast 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em
While you stash 'em, I'll let 'em free
And they tell me what they fantasy
Like up on the roof, roof
Tell your boyfriend not to be mad at me!

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'

But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit; you give it up 'til they go out
Or we can do it on stage at the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know it got sold out!
A red carpet dick it just roll out
Go ahead and scream, you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train, when it's hot or when it's cold out
How about in the library on top of books?
But you can't be too loud!
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign
Let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name?
A sauna, jacuzzi, in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn
Rose petals on the silk sheets
Eating fresh fruits, sweep your woman right off her feet

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'

But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the back seat, windows up
That's the way you like to fuck
Clogged up, fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex: make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown: that's the way I like it, twerk
Legs jerk, overworked
Underpaid, but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team, off the ropes!
On the ocean or in the boat!
Factories or one hundred spokes!
What about up in the candy store?
That chocolate, chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs
Smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream ""help!"" Play my game!
Dracula, man, I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reins
School teacher, let me get my brains

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes

326,I Wish,"[Intro]
I wish, I wish, I wish
(To every city)
I wish, I wish, I wish
(Every hood)
I wish, I wish, I wish
(And every block)
I wish, I wish, I wish
(Ghetto America!)

[Verse 1]
Rolling through the hood, just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know that your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed, going on four long years
I'm still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days you used to talk to me
Smiling while I'm sipping on this Hennessy
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you hear my songs the radio is playing
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's saying
And boy, I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

[Verse 2]
Now ever since this money come, ut's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say, ""Boy, you've been blessed""
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shooting this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass players get a real player hating 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you hear my songs the radio is playing
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's saying
And, boy, I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of a tragic end
Damn, my condolences

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

[Verse 3]
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies land
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans?

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you hear my songs the radio is playing
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's saying
And, boy, I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to street perform on Friday
(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
(With you)
Instead of you all throwing them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

[Chorus: Choir]
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place

That's when she walked in
I said, ""I'm sorry but we're closed""
And she said ""I know
But I'm afraid I left my purse""
I said, ""I put one back behind the bar
I bet it's probably yours""
And the next thing that I knew
There we were, lost in conversation
And before I handed her her purse
I said, ""You'll only get this back on one condition""

And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced

And from that moment
There was never any doubt
I had found the one
That I had always dreamed about
And then one evening
When she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of my shirt
And as her eyes filled up with tears
She said, ""This is the last thing I expected""
And then she took me by the hand
And said, ""I'll only marry you on one condition""

I've sure enjoyed the rain
But I'm looking forward to the sun
You have to feel the pain
When you lose the love you gave someone
I thought by now the time
Would take away these lonely tears
I hope you're doing fine all alone
But where do I go from here, 'cause...

[Chorus]
Without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you

[Verse 2]
Well I never thought I'd be lying here without you by my side
It seems unreal to me that the life you promised was a lie
You made it look so easy
Making love into memories
I guess you got what you wanted
But what about me, 'cause...

[Chorus]
Without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you

Somebody tell my head to try to tell my heart
That I'm better off without you

I never cared too much for love
It was all a bunch of mush, that I just did not want
Paid, was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game
Couldn't be more fly, getting paid was everything

[Pre-Chorus]
But I am not every girl and I do not need that world to validate me
'Cause shorty has got a job, shorty has got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Do not want to dance if it is not in my heart

[Chorus]
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Do not want to dance if he cannot be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

[Verse 2]
I was a girl about the floss
It was all about the cost, how much he spent on me
Seek, for a man who has got the means
To be giving you diamond rings
It is what every fly girl could want or even dream

[Pre-Chorus]
But I am not every girl and I do not need any G to take care of me
Because shorty has got a job, shorty has got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Do not want to dance if it is not in my heart, no no

[Chorus]
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Do not want to dance if he cannot be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Do not want to dance if he cannot be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

But I am not every girl
And I do not need no G to take care of me, no
Because Shorty has got a job, Shorty has got a car, Shorty can pay her own rent

Do not want to dance if he cannot be everything that I dream of

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got outta bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Couplet 1]
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't calling
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her, I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you for four hours and you just said no
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to, remember
When we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way, I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
I say that shit just clowning dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit

He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan, my nigga from down south
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony, he was Italian
He didn't give a fuck that's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark till the mornin'
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi used to be a Deacon
But now he be suckin' me off on the weekend
And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue

This verse goes out to my niggas in jail
Beatin' they dicks to the double-X-L magazine (uhh)
You like how I look in the aqua green? Get your Vaseline
Roll some weed with some tissue and close your eyes
Then imagine your tongue in between my thighs
Baby, oh, yes oh!
Jailer, open up cell, block eight
Alright nigga, that's enough
Stop, look and listen, get back to your position
Kim got your dick hard, startin' fights in the yard
Hotter than a Pop Tart fresh out of the toaster
Niggas do anything for a Lil' Kim poster
Eses, Bloods, Crips, all the thugs
Up North in the hole, they all wanna know

If you drivin' in the street hold on to your seat
Niggas, grab your meat while I ride the beat
And if you see a shiny black Lamborghini fly by ya
(Shoom!) That's me the Knight Rider
Dressed in all black with the gat in the lap
Lunatics in the street, gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hunnid on the rings
Sittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling
12 a.m., I'm on the way to the club
After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck
Some niggas even put me on their grocery list
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolate
Designer pussy, my shit come in flavors
High-class taste, niggas got to spend paper
Lick it right the first time or you gotta do it over
Like it's rehearsal for a Tootsie commercial

Try to figure out what all this is for

And run through with my gym shorts on
Take a drink right from the hose
And change into some drier clothes
Climb the stairs up to my room
Sleep away the afternoon

I could leave but I'll just stay
All my stuff's here anyway

And the purest one I'll own

Are the reason I could fly
And cause of you

Though these words I say are true
They still fail to capture you
As mere words can only do
How do I explain that smile
And how it turns my world around
Keeping my feet on the ground

I will soothe you if you fall
I'll be right there if you call
You're my greatest love of all

Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl

Never wanted to play, or give kisses and hugs

While her Mom fell asleep, and her Daddy went out

And the drinking and the fighting just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding, oh what a sad little life

With every slap and every curse
Until her Daddy, in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her Mom, and then took his life

356,Thank You In Advance,"[Intro: Mike]
Excuse me, I know we just met
But may I have this dance?

[Verse 1: Nathan]
Sitting here with a drink in my hand
Your presence I can't ignore
I must admit I like watching you dance
But it seems like I've seen this before
Girl, you look like my first wife
Though I've never been married before
So I kiss your hand and tell you, ""Thank you""
You turn and ask me, ""What for?""

[Chorus]
For our first kiss on next week
For when we made love in six weeks
For the ring you wore
Proudly three months from now
For when you said, ""I do"", next March
And for those beautiful children of ours
Yes, I know it might sound strange 'cause we just met
But I thank you in advance
Shawn, help me sing it

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman, Michael & (All)]
Hi, my name is Shawn
Tell me your name although I know the last one
It's funny that we're shaking hands
Wait a minute, I know this hand
It's the same hand
(I'll hold in front of a minister)
Same hand
(When you're having my son and his sister)
I don't mean to sound so bold and forward
But I thank you in advance

[Chorus]
For our first kiss on next week
For when we made love in six weeks
For the ring you wore

It's like I came back in time to tell you, ""Thank you""
You're as beautiful then as you are now
Look in the mirror, there is a picture
Of you and the man you love

For our first kiss on next week
For when we made love in six weeks
For the ring you wore

Scattered by the way the wind blows
Bye-bye, baby, that's the last I'll see of you
Shoebox full of old love letters
I'll tear each one till I feel better
And I won't look back 'cause I don't like the view

What my heart needs now is rest
So I'm packing up and I'm headed west
My mind's made up, I'll put it to the test
Pushing myself and this old machine
Burning fumes and what's left of my dreams
Let 'em go 'cause I don't need no strings
Just give me a road and a little gasoline

We talked in circles till the words ran out
And it all came down to an angry shout
Before I knew it, I was in third gear and gone
Well, this had been coming for a long, long time
If I said, ""I'm sorry,"" well, I'd be lying
If you think I'll never make it, well, you'd be wrong

What my heart needs now is rest
So I'm packing up and I'm headed west
My mind's made up, I'll put it to the test
Pushing myself and this old machine
Burning fumes and what's left of my dreams
Let 'em go 'cause I don't need no strings

360,Best Of Intentions,"Capo 1st

I had big plans for our future
Said I'd give you the whole world somehow
I tried makin' good on that promise
Thought I'd be so much further by now
Never could build you a castle
Even though you're the queen of my heart
But I've had the best of intentions from the start

Now some people think I'm a loser
Cause I seldom get things right
But you make me feel like a winner
When you wrap me in your arms so tight
Please tell me you will remember
No matter how much I do wrong
That I had the best of intentions all along

Chorus:
I'd gave you a ring, and I promised you things
I always thought we'd do

But my best-laid plans slipped right through my hands
To show my love for you
And if you could read my heart
Then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of_ intentions

Instrumental:

Chorus

So here I am asking forgiveness
And praying that you'll understand
Don't think I take you for granted
Girl I know just how lucky I am
Though you deserve so much better
You won't find devotion more true
Cause I've had the best of intentions
Girl I've had the best of intentions
Yes, I've had the best of intentions

364,The Christmas Shoes,"[Verse 1]
It was almost Christmas time
And there I stood in another line
Trying to buy that last gift or two
Not really in the Christmas mood
Standing right in front of me
Was a little boy waiting anxiously
Pacing 'round like little boys do
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes
And his clothes were worn and old
He was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldn't believe what I heard him say

[Chorus]
Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time
You see, she's been sick for quite awhile
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight

[Verse 2]
He counted pennies for what seemed like years
Then the Cashier said, ""Son, there's not enough here""
He searched his pockets frantically
Then he turned and he looked at me
He said, ""Mama made Christmas good at our house
Though most years she just did without""
""Tell me, sir, what am I going to do
Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes""
So I laid the money down, I just had to help him out
And I'll never forget the look on his face when he said
""Mama's gonna look so great""

[Chorus]
Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time
You see, she's been sick for quite awhile
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight

[Bridge]
I knew I'd caught a glimpse of Heaven's love
As he thanked me and ran out
I knew that God had sent that little boy
To remind me, what Christmas is all about

[Chorus]
Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time
You see, she's been sick for quite awhile

Where are you Christmas
Why can't I find you
Why have you gone away
Where is the laughter
You used to bring me
Why can't I hear music play
My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes too

Where are you Christmas
Do you remember
The one you used to know
I'm not the same one
See what the time's done
Is that why you have let me go
Christmas is here
Everywhere, oh
Christmas is here
If you care, oh
If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time

I feel you Christmas
I know I've found you
You never fade away

Stays here inside us
Fills each and every heart with love

What I do
You'll never be the woman I am

Can you tell me why you want a man
That's already someone's man
Fix it
It's out of your hands
Time to stop this
Cause it's getting out of hand

I know that you want my man

368,Kiss This,"She was a woman on a mission
Here to drown him and forget him
So I set her up again to wash him down
She had just about succeeded
When that low-down, no-good cheatin'
Good-for-nothing came strutting through the crowd

Oh, he was laying it on so thick
He never missed a lick
Professing his neverending love
Oh, but I never will forget
When she stood up and said
So I guess you think we're just gonna kiss and make up, don't you
That's when she said

Why don't you kiss, kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
Me and you, we're through
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And kiss this goodbye

Well, the next thing I recall
She had him back against the wall
Chewing him like a bulldog on a bone
She was putting him in his place
And I mean right up in his face
Dragging him down a list of done-me-wrongs

Well, it was just about now
That the crowd gathered 'round
They've come to watch him pay for his every sin
She called him everything under the sun
And when we thought that she was done
She reared back and she let him have it again, man
She said, she said

Why don't you kiss, kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
Hey, me and you, we're through
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And kiss this

Hey, kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips

I don't care about what you think you see
The things you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you, woah, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Dove]
I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want (right)
The loving that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's inviting so visualize the verb
You curve thought waves when you're handling the candelabra
So you sitting on the baby grand
Transmitting like you're made of man
But you paint a funny face like a chick
When I see you I'ma tell you quick that uhh

I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together
No pepperoni
Yeah you wanted extra cheese, sometimes I gave you extras
How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory
I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn Zipporah
Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror
But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that
I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea
It's better for me, I'm satisfied with repping for D

[Verse 3: Pos]
We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claiming never been gone
Niggas who cut us off, wanna reattach us now
(Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some #'s to dial)
Yeah I give that ass a number, and some lumber to pile
Now catch a curve from my kick (or show me loving by brick)
So stick to the same plan, don't come shaking my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you

[Verse 4: Pos & Chaka Khan]
You see them kids be scheming on what we done copped
Always out there scheming!
They steady fiending for the moment they can get us off the block
Why they always fiending?
Your people might have your back, but you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothing guaranteed
That's the truth! Things ain't goin' like you think they should
A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's
Alright then; here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here; keep a clear head
Trying to keep my pockets on stuffed, like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all don't phase
So mind your biz and walk away
'Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

[Bridge: Chaka Khan]
I don't care about what you think you see
The things you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you, woah, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you",De La Soul,De La Soul Featuring Chaka Khan,2001,[100],1
