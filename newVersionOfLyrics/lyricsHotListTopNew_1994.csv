0,On Bended Knee,"[Verse 1]
Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

[Verse 2]
So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
And I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

[Spoken]
Baby, I'm sorry
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

[Bridge]
I'm Gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It'll heal all things
It won't hurt anymore
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended...
Down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee
Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on
Down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Though I might mess around
It's only cause I need some affection

3,Always,"[Verse 1]
This romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

[Verse 2]
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him cause those words are mine
To say to you till the end of time

[Chorus]
Yeah, I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

[Bridge]
If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

[Guitar Solo]

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

4,I Wanna Be Down,"[Verse 1]
I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl you that you could be down for
Cuz when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on
And if I don't let you know
Then I won't be for real
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you the more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me it's only you

[Chorus]
I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter what time of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

[Verse 2]
I know anybody's gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact than I'll be more than you ever could dream of
If all you need is the time that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love until you call baby
I wanna stay by your side
Be there to call you up
And let you know everything will be all right

[Chorus]
I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter what time of day or night it's true

Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul

11,Take A Bow,"[Verse 1: Madona and Babyface]
Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd
Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
No one around
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
One lonely star, you don't know who you are

[Chorus: Madona and Babyface]
I've always been in love with you
Always with you
I guess you've always known it's true
You know it's true
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye
Bye-bye
Say good-bye

[Verse 2: Madona and Babyface]
Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart
Breaking my heart
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
Just make them smile the whole world loves a clown
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
Role that you played
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
One lonely star and you don't know who you are

[Chorus: Madona and Babyface]
I've always been in love with you
Always with you
I guess you've always known it's true
You know it's true
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?

Say good-bye

I've always been in love with you

You know it's true
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye
Bye-bye

[Bridge: Madona and Babyface]
All the world is a stage
World is a stage
And everyone has their part
Has their part
But how was I to know which way the story’d go?
How was I to know you'd break
You'd break, you'd break, you'd break
You'd break my heart?

[Chorus: Madona and Babyface]
I've always been in love with you
I've always been in love with you
I guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?

I've always been in love with you

Hit it!
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is LA!

[Verse 1]
""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William, but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if
He's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Verse 2]
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty
Cars
The sun and the moon but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun

So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
And let's head on down the road, there's somewhere I gotta go
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

My old man was born to rock
He's still tryin' to beat the clock
Think of me what you will
I've got a little space to fill

And let's head on down the road, there's somewhere I gotta go

21,Hold My Hand,"[Verse 1]

We'll walk upon the water, we'll rise above the mess
With a little peace, and some harmony
We'll take the world together, we'll take 'em by the hand

[Refrain]
'Cause I've got a hand for you
'Cause I wanna run with you

[Verse 2]
Yesterday, I saw you standing there
Your head was down, your eyes were red, no comb had touched your hair
I said get up, and let me see you smile
We'll take a walk together, walk the road awhile, 'cause

'Cause I've got a hand for you
(I've got a hand for you)
'Cause I wanna run with you

(Hold my hand) Anything you wanna be because
I wanna love you the best that... the best that I can

[Verse 3]
See I was wasted, and I was wastin' time
'Til I thought about your problems, I thought about your crimes
Then I stood up, and then I screamed aloud
I don't wanna be part of your problems, don't wanna be part of your crowd, no

22,"December 1963 (Oh, What A Night)","Parody of ""December 1963 (Oh What a Night)"" by The Four Seasons
(Colossians 2:16-17, Romans 14:4-6)

Oh, holy night -- Late December 5 or 6 B.C
Was a special time in history
In Bethlehem -- oh, holy night
Oh, holy night -- You know we still don't even know the date
The time of year or month when Jesus came
Celebrate it every night
Oh, I -- I got a funny feeling that the Lord ain't amused
When we fight-- about which holidays we all should use
Oh, holy night -- It's not timing that's the vital thing
Jesus never changes seasonally -- Late December or July
Why raise a fuss about which holy days are better?
Those things are shadows now and Jesus is all that matters
Oh, holy night
FIRST RAP
Scholars ain't sure 'bout the birth of our Lord
It could 6 B.C., 5 B.C. 4
The current way we figure out time was not designed
Till 500 years after Christ arrived and died
And the guy who tried to find the right time when Christ had died
And design the time line with B.C. and A.D
Should get a B, C, or a D for sloppy math
And maybe a new abacus on top of that
Oh, wow, Co-loss-i-ans 2:16, let no one judge you
In regard to sabbaths, holidays or what's good food
Oh, holy night
Put the tinsel on the tree tonight
Read along in Romans 14:5 -- Celebrate it when you like
SECOND RAP
Frankly in the valley of death He's a powerful shepherd in December
Or whatever date the calendar sets
I think I counted 11 months without it and yet
The Christmas holiday gets a vast amount of attention
So I thought I would mention that we don't know just when the
Holy blessed event took place -- It might have been May
The Bible ain't specific about the month or the day
With Orthodox Christmas it's January 6th
For the rest of us Christians December 25th
But the most important thing is that Christ is Lord and King
And that's all the more reason to lift up the Lord Jesus
In all the four seasons
The Christmas rush may be over in December
But up in Heaven they'll be praising the Lord forever
Oh, holy night",ApologetiX,The 4 Seasons,1994,"[26, 24, 22, 21, 17, 19, 19, 18, 15, 15, 16, 14, 19, 24, 29, 36, 47, 50, 64, 73, 79]",21
23,Living In Danger,"Live for yourself, it's a wonderful thing
You can do what you want, you can live in a dream
Get up, get in
Get the rhythm, get down

You're living your life in peace and in harmony
You making your own desisions
That's how it's got to be for you and me

So many people are running around and 'round
Without no sense of logic

I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger

I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger

People are the same today as they used to be
The same expectations
So high no-one can reach that high
Nor I, nor you get satisfied today
We'll never get enough

I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho

That you're my girl or at least my friend

Yo, Mack, I don't even understand
How they didn't understand you in that Mary joint
(Yeah, I know, man)
Kick that old robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, crazy joint!

[Verse 1]
Just like Uniblab, robotic kicking flab
My flavor bidder badder chitter-chatter
Madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you my shit come out phatter
I got the data to turn your body into anti-matter
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between
The king is what I mean, I mean
My man get a cup and put some change inside your hand
Now, hold up, let's make this official
Everybody let's agree that MC's need a tissue
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you
And I bet the Mack take off, like an MX missile
No more of your whinin' on the charts climbin'
As I make the funk kicking out more harder than a diamond
And if you didn't know who's rhymin'
I guess I'm gonna say ""Craig Mack"" with perfect timin'
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse 2]
Craig Mack, one thousand degrees
You'll be on your knees, and you'll be burning, begging please
Brother, freeze! This man's undisputed
In deep-rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tasting MC's for dinner
You're crazy like that glue, to think that you could outdo my one-two that's sick like the flu
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time
‘Cause, boy, the rhyme you kickin' ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around, I'll knock you out position
No flav could ever dig a grave, for the Mack
The power pack in black, making cement crack
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Chorus]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse 3]
Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MC's more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken
Lords of MC's shakin' with this track that my man's makin'
MC's will run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat
Getting hotter than the sun get
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MC's, stop relaxin'
This brand new Sherrif that's in town
Getting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy, watch the MC's I destroy, and…

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear

31,When Can I See You,"[Verse 1]
When can my heart beat again?
When does the pain ever end?
When do the tears stop from running over?
When does ""you'll get over it"" begin?

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear what you're sayin'
But I swear that it's not making sense
So when can I see you

[Chorus]
When can I see you again?
And when can my heart beat again?
When can I see you again?
And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you...

[Verse 2]
When does my someday begin?
When I'll find someone again?
And what if I still am not truly over
What am I supposed to do then, baby, baby?

[Pre-Chorus]
Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense
So when can I see you...

[Chorus]
When can I see you again?
And when can my heart beat again?
When can I see you again, baby?
And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you again?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah baby
Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense, baby
So when can I see you again?

[Chorus]
When can I see you again?
When can my heart beat again? Baby, yeah
When can I see you again, baby?
And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you again?

Now gode. Let us leave theories there and return to here’s here. Now hear. ’Tis gode again. The teak coffin, Pughglasspanelfitted, feets to the east, was to turn in later, and pitly patly near the porpus, materially effecting the cause. And this, liever, is the thinghowe. Any number of conservative public bodies, through a number of select and other committees having power to add to their number, before voting themselves and himself, town, port and garrison, by a fit and proper resolution, following a koorts order of the groundwet, once for all out of plotty existence, as a forescut, so you maateskippey might to you cuttinrunner on a neuw pack of klerds, made him, while his body still persisted, their present of a protem grave in Moyelta of the best Lough Neagh pattern, then as much in demand among misonesans as the Isle of Man today among limniphobes. Wacht even! It was in a fairly fishy kettlekerry, after the Fianna’s foreman had taken his handful, enriched with ancient woods and dear dutchy deeplinns mid which were an old knoll and a troutbeck, vainyvain of her osiery and a chatty sally with any Wilt or Walt who would ongle her as Izaak did to the tickle of his rod and watch her waters of her sillying waters of and there now brown peater arripple (may their quilt gild lightly over his somnolulutent form!)

The other spring offensive on the heights of Abraham may have come about all quite by accidence, Foughtarundser (for Breedabrooda had at length presuaded him to have himself to be as septuply buried as the murdered Cian in Finntown), had not been three monads in his watery grave (what vigilantes and ridings then and spuitwyne pledges with aardappel frittling!) when portrifaction, dreyfussed as ever, began to ramp, ramp, ramp, the boys are parching. A hoodenwinkle gave the signal and a blessing paper freed the flood. Why did the patrizien make him scares with his gruntens? Because the druiven were muskating at the door. From both Celtiberian camps (granting at the onset for the sake of argument that men on the two sides in New South Ireland and Vetera Uladh, bluemin and pillfaces, during the ferment With the Pope or On the Pope, had, moors or letts, grant ideas, grunted) all conditions, poor cons and dives mor, each, of course, on the purely doffensive since the eternals were owlwise on their side every time, were drawn toowards their Bellona’s Black Bottom, once Woolwhite’s Waltz (Ohiboh, how becrimed, becursekissed and bedumbtoit!) some for want of proper feeding in youth, others already caught in the honourable act of slicing careers for family and carvers in conjunction; and, if emaciated nough, the person garrotted may have suggested to whomever he took the ham of, the plain being involved in darkness, low cirque waggery, nay, even the first old wugger of himself in the flesh, whiggissimus incarnadined, when falsesighted by the ifsuchhewas bully on the hill for there had circulated freely fairly among his opposition the feeling that in so hibernating Massa Ewacka, who, previous to that demidetached life, had been known of barmicidal days, cook said, between soups and savours, to get outside his own length of rainbow trout and taerts atta tarn as no man of woman born, nay could, like the great crested brebe, devour his threescoreten of roach per lifeday, ay, and as many minnow a minute (the big mix, may Gibbet choke him!) was, like the salmon of his ladderleap all this time of totality secretly and by suckage feeding on his own misplaced fat.

Ladies did not disdain those pagan ironed times of the firs; city (called after the ugliest Danadune) when a frond was a friend inneed to carry, as earwigs do their dead, their soil to the earthball where indeeth we shall calm decline, our legacy unknown. Venuses were gigglibly temptatrix, vulcans guffawably eruptious and the whole wives’ world frockful of fickles. Fact, any human inyon you liked any erenoon or efter would take her bare godkin out, or an even pair of hem, (lugod ! lugodoo!) and prettily pray with him (or with em even) everyhe to her taste, long for luck, tapette and tape petter and take pettest of all.

Kate Strong, a widow (Tiptip!)— she pulls a lane picture for us, in a dreariodreama setting, glowing and very vidual, of old dumplan as she nosed it, a homelike cottage of elvanstone with droppings of biddies, stinkend pusshies, moggies’ duggies, rotten witchawubbles, festering rubbages and beggars’ bullets, if not worse, sending salmofarious germs in gleefully through the smithereen panes — Widow Strong, then, as her weaker had turned him to the wall (Tiptiptip!), did most all the scavenging from good King Hamlaugh’s gulden dayne though her lean besom cleaned but sparingly and her bare statement reads that, there being no macadamised sidetracks on those old nekropolitan nights in, barring a footbatter, Bryant’s Causeway, bordered with speedwell, white clover and sorrel a wood knows, which left off, being beaten, where the plaintiff was struck, she left down, as scavengers, who will be scavengers must, her filthdump near the Serpentine in Phornix Park (at her time called Finewell’s Keepsacre but later tautaubapptossed Pat’s Purge), that dangerfield circling butcherswood where fireworker oh flaherty engaged a nutter of castlemallards and ah for archer stunned’s turk, all over which fossil footprints, bootmarks, fingersigns, elbowdints, breechbowls, a. s. o. were all successively traced of a most envolving description. What subtler timeplace of the weald than such wolfsbelly castrament to will hide a leabhar from Thursmen’s brandihands or a loveletter, lostfully hers, that would be lust on Ma, than then when ructions ended, than here where race began: and by four hands of forethought the first babe of reconcilement is laid in its last cradle of hume sweet hume.

For hear Allhighest sprack for krischnians as for propagana fidies and his nuptial eagles sharped their beaks of prey: and every morphyl man of us, pome by pome, falls back into this terrine: as it was let it be, says he! And it is as though where Agni araflammed and Mithra monished and Shiva slew as mayamutras the obluvial waters of our noarchic memory withdrew, windingly goharksome, to some hastyswasty timberman torchpriest, flamenfan, the ward of the wind that lightened the fire that lay in the wood that Jove bolt, at his rude word. Posidonius O’Fluctuary! Lave that bloody stone as it is! What are you doing your dirty minx and his big treeblock way up your path? Slip around, you, by the rare of the ministers’! And, you, take that barrel back where you got it, Mac Shane’s, and go the way your old one went, Hatchettsbury Road! And gish! how they gushed away, the pennyfares, a whole school for scamper, with their sashes flying sish behind them, all the little pirlypettes! Issy-la-Chapelle! Any lucans, please?

Yes, the viability of vicinals if invisible is invincible. And we are not trespassing on his corns either. Look at all the plotsch! Fluminian! If this was Hannibal’s walk it was Hercules’ work. And a hungried thousand of the unemancipated slaved the way. The mausoleum lies behind us (O Adgigasta, multipopulipater!) and there are milestones in their cheadmilias faultering along the tramestrack by Brahm and Anton Hermes! Per omnibus secular seekalarum. Amain. But the past has made us this present of a rhedarhoad. So more boher O’Connell! Though rainyhidden, you’re rhinohide. And if he’s not a Romeo you may scallop your hat. Wereupunder in the fane of Saint Fiacre! Halte!

It was hard by the howe’s there, plainly on this disoluded and a buchan cold spot, rupestric then, resurfaced that now is, that Luttrell sold if Lautrill bought, in the saddle of the Brennan’s (now Malpasplace?) pass, versts and versts from true civilisation, not where his dreams top their traums halt (Beneathere! Benathere!) but where livland yontide meared with the wilde, saltlea with flood, that the attackler, a cropatkin, though under medium and between colours with truly native pluck, engaged the Adversary who had more in his eye than was less to his leg but whom for plunder sake, he mistook in the heavy rain to be Oglethorpe or some other ginkus, Parr aparrently, to whom the headandheelless chickenestegg bore some Michelangiolesque resemblance, making use of sacrilegious languages to the defect that he would challenge their hemosphores to exterminate them but he would cannonise the b — y b — r’s life out of him and lay him out contritely as smart as the b — r had his b — y nightprayers said, three patrecknocksters and a couplet of hellmuirries (tout est sacr‚ pour un sacreur, femme … barbe ou hommenourrice) at the same time, so as to plugg well let the blubbywail ghoats out of him, catching holst of an oblong bar he had and with which he usually broke furnitures he rose the stick at him. The boarder incident prerepeated itself. The pair (whethertheywere Nippoluono engaging Wei–Ling-Taou or de Razzkias trying to reconnoistre the general Boukeleff, man may not say), struggled apairently for some considerable time, (the cradle rocking equally to one and oppositely from the other on its law of capture and recapture), under the All In rules around the booksafe, fighting like purple top and tipperuhry Swede, (Secremented Servious of the Divine Zeal!) and in the course of their tussle the toller man, who had opened his bully bowl to beg, said to the miner who was carrying the worm (a handy term for the portable distillery which consisted of three vats, two jars and several bottles though we purposely say nothing of the stiff, both parties having an interest in the spirits): Let me go, Pautheen! I hardly knew ye. Later on, after the solstitial pause for refleshmeant, the same man (or a different and younger him of the same ham) asked in the vermicular with a very oggly chew-chin-grin: Was six victolios fifteen pigeon takee offa you, tell he me, stlongfella, by pickypocky ten to foul months behindaside? There were some further collidabanter and severe tries to convert for the best part of an hour and now a woden affair in the shape of a webley (we at once recognise our old friend Ned of so many illortemporate letters) fell from the intruser who, as stuck as that cat to that mouse in that tube of that christchurch organ, (did the imnage of Girl Cloud Pensive flout above them light young charm, in ribbons and pigtail?) whereupon became friendly and, saying not his shirt to tear, to know wanted, joking and knobkerries, all aside laying, if his change companion who stuck still to the in vention of his strongbox, with a tenacity corrobberating their mutual tenitorial rights, happened to have the loots change of a tenpound crickler about him at the moment, addling that hap so, he would pay him back the six vics odd, do you see, out of that for what was taken on the man of samples last Yuni or Yuly, do you follow me, Capn? To this the other, Billi with the Boule, who had mummed and mauled up to that (for he was hesitency carried to excelcism) rather amusedly replied: Woowoo would you be grossly surprised, Hill, to learn that, as it so happens, I honestly have not such a thing as the loo, as the least chance of a tinpanned crackler anywhere about me at the present mohomoment but I believe I can see my way, as you suggest, it being Yuletide or Yuddanfest and as it’s mad nuts, son, for you when it’s hatter’s hares, mon, for me, to advance you something like four and sevenpence between hopping ar_d trapping which you might just as well have, boy baches, to buy J. J. and S. with. There was a minute silence before memory’s fire’s rekindling and then. Heart alive! Which at very first wind of gay gay and whiskwigs wick’s ears pricked up, the starving gunman, strike him pink, became strangely calm and forthright sware by all his lards porsenal that the thorntree of sheol might ramify up his Sheofon to the lux apointlex but he would go good to him suntime marx my word fort, for a chip off the old Flint, (in the Nichtian glossery which purveys aprioric roots for aposteriorious tongues this is nat language at any sinse of the world and one might as fairly go and kish his sprogues as fail to certify whether the wartrophy eluded at some lives earlier was that somethink like a jug, to what, a coctable) and remarxing in languidoily, seemingly much more highly pleased than tongue could tell at this opening of a lifetime and the foretaste of the Dun Bank pearlmothers and the boy to wash down which he would feed to himself in the Ruadh Cow at Tallaght and then into the Good Woman at Ringsend and after her inat Conway’s Inn at Blackrock and, first to fall, cursed be all, where appetite would keenest be, atte, funeral fare or fun fain real, Adam and Eve’s in Quantity Street by the grace of gamy queen Tailte, her will and testament: You stunning little southdowner! I’d know you anywhere, Declaney, let me truthfully tell you in or out of the lexinction of life and who the hell else, be your blanche patch on the boney part! Goalball I’ve struck this daylit dielate night of nights, by golly! My hat, you have some bully German grit, sundowner! He spud in his faust (axin); he toped the raw best (pardun); he poked his pick (a tip is a tap): and he tucked his friend’s leave.And, with French hen or the portlifowlium of hastes and leisures, about to continue that, the queer mixture exchanged the pax in embrace or poghue puxy as practised between brothers of the same breast, hillelulia, killelulia, allenalaw, and, having ratified before the god of the day their torgantruce which belittlers have schmallkalled the treatyng to cognac, turning his fez menialstrait in the direction of Moscas, he first got rid of a few mitsmillers and hurooshoos and levanted off with tubular jurbulance at a bull’s run over the assback bridge, spitting his teeths on rooths, with the seven and four in danegeld and their humoral hurlbat or other uncertain weapon of lignum vitae, but so evermore rhumanasant of a toboggan poop, picked up to keep some crowplucking appointment with some rival rialtos anywheres between Pearidge and the Littlehorn while this poor delaney, who they left along with the confederate fender behind and who albeit ballsbluffed, bore up wonderfully wunder all of it with a whole number of plumsized contusiums, plus alasalah bruised coccyx, all over him, reported the occurance in the best way he could, to the flabbergaze of the whole lab, giving the Paddybanners the military salute as for his exilicy’s the O’Daffy, in justifiable hope that, in nobiloroman review of the hugely sitisfactuary conclusium of their negotiations and the jugglemonkysh agripment deinderivative, some lotion or fomentation of poppyheads would be jennerously exhibited to the parts, at the nearest watchhouse in Vicar Lane, the white ground of his face all covered with digonally redcrossed nonfatal mammalian blood as proofpositive of the seriousness of his character and that he was bleeding in self defience (stanch it!) from the nostrils, lips, pavilion and palate, while some of his hitter’s hairs had been pulled off his knut’s head by Colt though otherwise his allround health appeared to be middling along as it proved most fortunate that not one of the two hundred and six bones and five hundred and one muscles in his corso was a whit the whorse for her whacking. Herwho?

Nowthen, leaving clashing ash, brawn and muscle and brassmade to oust earthernborn and rockcrystal to wreck isinglass but wurming along gradually for our savings backtowards motherwaters so many miles from bank and Dublin stone (olympiading even till the eleventh dynasty to reach that thuddysickend Hamlaugh) and to the question of boney’s unlawfully obtaining a pierced paraflamme and claptrap fireguard there crops out the still more salient point of the politish leanings and town pursuits of our forebeer, El Don De Dunelli, (may his ship thicked stick in the bottol of the river and all his crewsers stock locked in the burral of the seas!) who, when within the black of your toenail, sir, of being mistakenly ambushed by one of the uddahveddahs, and as close as made no matter, mam, to being kayoed offhand when the hyougono heckler with the Peter the Painter wanted to hole him, was consistently practising the first of the primary and imprescriptible liberties of the pacific subject by circulating (be British, boys to your bellybone and chuck a chum a chance!) alongst one of our umphrohibited semitary thrufahrts, open to buggy and bike, to walk, Wellington Park road, with the curb or quaker’s quacknostrum under his auxter and his alpenstuck in his redhand, a highly commendable exercise, or, number two of our acta legitima plebeia, on the brink (beware to baulk a man at his will!) of taking place upon a public seat, to what, bare by Butt’s, most easterly (but all goes west!) of blackpool bridges, as a public protest and naturlikevice, without intent to annoy either, being praisegood thankfully for the wrathbereaved ringdove and the fearstung boaconstrictor and all the more right jollywell pleased, which he was, at having other people’s weather.

But to return to the atlantic and Phenitia Proper. As if that were not to be enough for anyone but little headway, if any, was made in solving the wasnottobe crime cunundrum when a child of Maam, Festy King, of a family long and honourably associated with the tar and feather industries, who gave an address in old plomansch Mayo of the Saxons in the heart of a foulfamed potheen district, was subsequently haled up at the Old Bailey on the calends of Mars, under an incompatibly framed indictment of both the counts (from each equinoxious points of view, the one fellow’s fetch being the other follow’s person) that is to see, flying cushats out of his ouveralls and making fesses immodst his forces on the field. Oyeh! Oyeh! When the prisoner, soaked in methylated, appeared in dry dock, appatently ambrosiaurealised, like Kersse’s Korduroy Karikature, wearing, besides stains, rents and patches, his fight shirt, straw braces, souwester and a policeman’s corkscrew trowswers, all out of the true (as he had purposely torn up all his cymtrymanx bespokes in the mamertime), deposing for his exution with all the fluors of sparse in the royal Irish vocabulary how the whole padderjagmartin tripiezite suet and all the sulfeit of copperas had fallen off him quatz unaccountably like the chrystalisations of Alum on Even while he was trying for to stick fire to himcell, (in feacht he was dripping as he found upon stripping for a pipkin ofmalt as he feared the coold raine) it was attempted by the crown (P.C. Robort) to show that King, elois Crowbar, once known as Meleky, impersonating a climbing boy, rubbed some pixes of any luvial peatsmoor o’er his face, plucks and pussas, with a clanetourf as the best means of disguising himself and was to the middlewhite fair in Mudford of a Thoorsday, feishts of Peeler and Pole, under the illassumed names of Tykingfest and Rabworc picked by him and Anthony out of a tellafun book, ellegedly with a pedigree pig (unlicensed) and a hyacinth. They were on that sea by the plain of Ir nine hundred and ninetynine years and they never cried crack or ceased from regular paddlewicking till that they landed their two and a trifling selves, amadst camel and ass, greybeard and suckling, priest and pauper, matrmatron and merrymeg, into the meddle of the mudstorm. The gathering, convened by the Irish Angricultural and Prepostoral Ouraganisations, to help the Irish muck to look his brother dane in the face and attended thanks to Larry by large numbers, of christies and jew’s totems, tospite of the deluge, was distinctly of a scattery kind when the ballybricken he could get no good of, after cockofthewalking through a few fancyfought mains ate some of the doorweg, the pikey later selling the gentleman ratepayer because she, Francie’s sister, that is to say, ate a whole side of his (the animal’s) sty, on a struggle Street, Qui Sta Troia, in order to pay off, hiss or lick, six doubloons fifteen arrears of his, the villain’s not the rumbler’s rent.

Remarkable evidence was given, anon, by an eye, ear, nose and throat witness, whom Wesleyan chapelgoers suspected of being a plain clothes priest W.P., situate at Nullnull, Medical Square, who, upon letting down his rice and peacegreen coverdisk and having been sullenly cautioned against yawning while being grilled, smiled (he had had a onebumper at parting from Mrs Molroe in the morning) and stated to his eliciter under his morse mustaccents (gobbless!) that he slept with a bonafides and that he would be there to remember the filth of November, hatinaring, rowdy O, which, with the jiboulees of Juno and the dates of ould lanxiety, was going, please the Rainmaker, to decembs within the ephemerides of profane history, all one with Tournay, Yetstoslay and Temorah, and one thing which would pigstickularly strike a person of such sorely tried observational powers as Sam, him and Moffat, though theirs not to reason why, the striking thing about it was that he was patrified to see, hear, taste and smell, as his time of night, how Hyacinth O’Donnell, B.A., described in the calendar as a mixer and wordpainter, with part of a sivispacem (Gaeltact for dungfork) on the fair green at the hour of twentyfour o’clock sought (the bullycassidy of the friedhoffer!) to sack, sock, stab and slaughter singlehanded another two of the old kings, Gush Mac Gale and Roaring O’Crian, Jr., both changelings, unlucalised, of no address and in noncommunicables, between him and whom, ever since wallops before the Mise of Lewes, bad blood existed on the ground of the boer’s trespass on the bull or because he firstparted his polarbeeber hair in twoways, or because they were creepfoxed andt grousuppers over a nippy in a noveletta, or because they could not say meace, (mute and daft) meathe. The litigants, he said, local congsmen and donalds, kings of the arans and the dalkeys, kings of mud and tory, even the goat king of Killorglin, were egged on by their supporters in the shape of betterwomen with bowstrung hair of Carrothagenuine ruddiness, waving crimson petties and screaming from Isod’s towertop. There were cries from the thicksets in court and from the macdublins on the bohernabreen of: Mind the bank from Banagher, Mick, sir! Prodooce O’Donner. Ay! Exhibit his relics! Bu! Use the tongue mor! Give lip less! But it oozed out in Deadman’s Dark Scenery Court through crossexanimation of the casehardened testis that when and where that knife of knifes the treepartied ambush was laid (roughly spouting around half hours ‘twixt dusk in dawn, by Waterhose’s Meddle Europeic Time, near Stop and Think, high chief evervirens and only abfalltree in auld the land) there was not as much light from the widowed moon as would dim a child’s altar. The mixer, accordingly, was bluntly broached, and in the best basel to boot, as to whether he was one of those lucky cocks for whom the audible-visible-gnosible-edible world existed. That he was only too cognitively conatively cogitabundantly sure of it because, living, loving, breathing and sleeping morphomelosophopancreates, as he most significantly did, whenever he thought he heard he saw he felt he made a bell clipperclipperclipperclipper. Whether he was practically sure too of his lugs and truies names in this king and blouseman business? That he was pediculously so. Certified? As cad could be. Be lying! Be the lonee I will. It was Morbus O’ Somebody? A’Quite. Szerday’s Son? A satyr in weddens. And how did the greeneyed mister arrive at the B.A.? That it was like his poll.

One of the oxmen’s thingabossers, hvad? And had he been refresqued by the founts of bounty playing there — is — a — pain — aleland in Long’s gourgling barral? A loss of Lordedward and a lack of sir-philip a surgeonet showeradown could suck more gargling bubbles out of the five lamps in Portterand’s praise. Wirrgeling and maries? As whose wouldn’t, laving his leaftime in Blackpool. But, of course, he could call himself Tem, too, if he had time to? You butt he could anytom. When he pleased? Win and place. A stoker temptated by evesdripping aginst the driver who was a witness as well? Sacred avatar, how the devil did they guess it! Two dreamyums in one dromium? Yes and no error.

That it was wildfires night on all the bettygallaghers. Mickmichael’s soords shrieking shrecks through the wilkinses and neckanicholas’ toastingforks pricking prongs up the tunnybladders. Let there be fight? And there was. Foght. On the site of the Angel’s, you said? Guinney’s Gap, he said, between what they said and the pussykitties. In the middle of the garth, then? That they mushn’t toucht it. The devoted couple was or were only two disappainted solicitresses on the job of the unfortunate class on Saturn’s mountain fort? That was about it, jah!

Meirdreach an Oincuish! But a new complexion was put upon the matter when to the perplexedly uncondemnatory bench (whereon punic judgeship strove with penal law) the senior king of all, Pegger Festy, as soon as the outer layer of stucckomuck had been removed at the request of a few live jurors, declared in a loudburst of poesy, through his Brythonic interpreter on his oath, mhuith peisth mhuise as fearra bheura muirre hriosmas, whereas take notice be the relics of the bones of the story bouchal that was ate be Cliopatrick (the sow) princess of parked porkers, afore God and all their honours and king’s commons that, what he would swear to the Tierney of Dundalgan or any other Tierney, yif live thurkells folloged him about sure that was no steal and that, nevertheless, what was deposited from that eyebold earbig noseknaving gutthroat, he did not fire a stone either before or after he was born down and up to that time. And, incidentalising that they might talk about Markarthy or they might walk to Baalastartey or they might join the nabour party and come on to Porterfeud this the sockdologer had the neck to endorse with the head bowed on him over his outturned noreaster by protesting to his lipreaders with a justbeencleaned barefacedness, abeam of moonlight’s hope, in the same trelawney what he would impart, pleas bench. to the Llwyd Josus and the gentlemen in Jury’s and the four of Masterers who had been all those yarns yearning for that good one about why he left Dublin, that, amreeta beaker coddling doom, as an Inishman was as good as any cantonnatal, if he was to parish by the market steak before the dorming of the mawn, he skuld never ask to see sight or light of this world or the other world or any either world, of Tyre-nan-Og, as true as he was there in that jackabox that minute, or wield or wind (no thanks t’yous!) the inexousthausthible wassailhorn tot of iskybaush the hailth up the wailth of the endknown abgod of the fire of the moving way of the hawks with his heroes in Warhorror if ever in all his exchequered career he up or lave a chancery hand to take or throw the sign of a mortal stick or stone at man, yoelamb or salvation army either before or after being puptised down to that most holy and every blessed hour. Here, upon the halfkneed castleknocker’s attempting kithoguishly to lilt his holymess the paws and make the sign of the Roman Godhelic faix, (Xaroshie, zdrst!— in his excitement the laddo had broken exthro Castilian into which the whole audience perseguired and pursuited him olla podrida) outbroke much yellachters from owners in the heall (Ha!) in which, under the mollification of methaglin, the testifighter reluctingly, but with ever so ladylike indecorum, joined. (Ha! Ha!)

The hilariohoot of Pegger’s Windup cumjustled as neatly with the tristitone of the Wet Pinter’s as were they isce et ille equals of opposites, evolved by a onesame power of nature or of spirit, iste, as the sole condition and means of its himundher manifestation and polarised for reunion by the symphysis of their antipathies. Distinctly different were their duasdestinies. Whereas the maidies of the bar, (a pairless trentene, a lunarised score) when the eranthus myrrmyrred: Show’m the Posed: fluttered and flattered around the willingly pressed, nominating him for the swiney prize, complimenting him, the captivating youth, on his having all his senses about him, stincking thyacinths through his curls (O feen! O deur!) and bringing busses to his cheeks, their masculine Oirisher Rose (his neece cleur!), and legando round his nice new neck for him and pizzicagnoling his woolywags, with their dindy dandy sugar de candy mechree me postheen flowns courier to belive them of all his untiring young dames and send treats in their times. Ymen. But it was not unobserved of those presents, their worships, how, of one among all, her deputised to defeme him by the Lunar Sisters’ Celibacy Club, a lovelooking leapgirl, all all alonely, Gentia Gemma of the Makegiddyculling Reeks, he, wan and pale in his unmixed admiration, seemed blindly, mutely, tastelessly, tactlessly, innamorate with heruponhim in shining aminglement, the shaym of his hisu shifting into the shimmering of her hers, (youthsy, beautsy, hee’s her chap and shey’ll tell memmas when she gays whom) till the wild wishwish of her sheeshea melted most musically mid Ihe dark deepdeep of his shayshaun.
And whereas distracted (for was not just this in effect which had just caused that the effect of that which it had caused to occur?) the four justicers laid their wigs together, Untius, Muncius, Punchus and Pylax but could do no worse than promulgate their standing verdict of Nolans Brumans whereoneafter King, having murdered all the English he knew, picked out his pockets and left the tribunal scotfree, trailing his Tommeylommey’s tunic in his hurry, thereinunder proudly showing off the blink patch to his britgits to prove himself (an’t plase yous!) a rael genteel. To the Switz bobbyguard’s curial but courtlike: Commodore valley O hairy, Arthre jennyrosy?: the firewaterloover returted with such a vinesmelling fortytudor ages rawdownhams tanyouhide as would the latten stomach even of a tumass equinous (we were prepared for the chap’s clap cap, the accent, but, took us as, by surprise and now we’re geshing it like gush gash from a burner!) so that all the twofromthirty advocatesses within echo, pulling up their briefs at the krigkry: Shun the Punman!: safely and soundly soccered that fenemine Parish Poser, (how dare he!) umprumptu rightoway hames, much to his thanks, gratiasagam, to all the wrong donatrices, biss Drinkbattle’s Dingy Dwellings where (for like your true venuson Esau he was dovetimid as the dears at Bottome) he shat in (zoo), like the muddy goalbind who he was (dun), the chassetitties belles conclaiming: You and your gift of your gaft of your garbage abaht our Farvver! and gaingridando: Hon! Verg! Nau! Putor! Skam! Schams! Shames!

And so it all ended. Artha kama dharma moksa. Ask Kavya for the kay. And so everybody heard their plaint and all listened to their plause. The letter! The litter! And the soother the bitther! Of eyebrow pencilled, by lipstipple penned. Borrowing a word and begging the question and stealing tinder and slipping like soap. From dark Rasa Lane a sigh and a weep, from Lesbia Looshe the beam in her eye, from lone Coogan Barry his arrow of song, from Sean Kelly’s anagrim a blush at the name, from I am the Sullivan that trumpeting tramp, from Suffering Dufferin the Sit of her Style, from Kathleen May Vernon her Mebbe fair efforts, from Fillthepot Curran his scotchlove machreether, from hymn Op. 2 Phil Adolphos the weary O, the leery, O, from Samyouwill Leaver or Damyouwell Lover thatjolly old molly bit or that bored saunter by, from Timm Finn again’s weak tribes, loss of strenghth to his sowheel, from the wedding on the greene, agirlies, the gretnass of joyboys, from Pat Mullen, Tom Mallon, Dan Meldon, Don Maldon a slickstick picnic made in Moate by Muldoons. The solid man saved by his sillied woman. Crackajolking away like a hearse on fire. The elm that whimpers at the top told the stone that moans when stricken. Wind broke it. Wave bore it. Reed wrote of it. Syce ran with it. Hand tore it and wild went war. Hen trieved it and plight pledged peace. It was folded with cunning, sealed with crime, uptied by a harlot, undone by a child. It was life but was it fair? It was free but was it art? The old hunks on the hill read it to perlection. It made ma make merry and sissy so shy and rubbed some shine off Shem and put some shame into Shaun. Yet Una and Ita spill famine with drought and Agrippa, the propastored, spells tripulations in his threne. Ah, furchte fruchte, timid Danaides! Ena milo melomon, frai is frau and swee is too, swee is two when swoo is free, ana mala woe is we! A pair of sycopanties with amygdaleine eyes, one old obster lumpky pumpkin and three meddlars on their slies. And that was how framm Sin fromm Son, acity arose, finfin funfun, a sitting arrows.

Now tell me, tell me, tell me then!
What was it?
A . . . . . . . . ..!

So there you are now there they were, when all was over again, the four with them, setting around upin their judges’ chambers, in the muniment room, of their marshalsea, under the suspices of Lally, around their old traditional tables of the law like Somany Solans to talk it over rallthesameagain. Well and druly dry. Suffering law the dring. Accourting to king’s evelyns. So help her goat and kiss the bouc. Festives and highajinks and jintyaun and her beetyrossy bettydoaty and not to forget now a’duna o’darnel. The four of them and thank court now there were no more of them. So pass the push for port sake. Be it soon. Ah ho! And do you remember, Singabob, the badfather, the same, the great Howdoyoucallem, and his old nickname, Dirty Daddy Pantaloons, in his monopoleums, behind the war of the two roses, with Michael Victory, the sheemen’s preester, before he caught his paper dispillsation from the poke, old Minace and Minster York? Do I mind? I mind the gush off the mon like Ballybock manure works on a tradewinds day. And the O’Moyly gracies and the O’Briny rossies chaffing him bluchface and playing him pranks. How do you do, todo, North Mister? Get into my way! Ah dearome forsailoshe! Gone over the bays! When ginabawdy meadabawdy! Yerra, why would he heed that old gasometer with his hooping coppin and his dyinboosycough and all the birds of the southside after her, Minxy Cunningham, their dear divorcee darling, jimmies and jonnies to be her jo? Hold hard. There’s three other corners to our isle’s cork float. Sure, ’tis well I can telesmell him H2 C E3 that would take a township’s breath away! Gob and I nose him too well as I do meself, heaving up the Kay Wall by the 32 to II with his limelooking horsebags full of sesameseed, the Whiteside Kaffir, and his sayman’s effluvium and his scentpainted voice, puffing out his thundering big brown cabbage! Pa! Thawt I’m glad a gull for his pawsdeen fiunn! Goborro, sez he, Lankyshied! Gobugga ye, sez I! O breezes! I sniffed that lad long before anyone. It was when I was in my farfather out at the west and she and myself, the redheaded girl, firstnighting down Sycomore Lane. Fine feelplay we had of it mid the kissabetts frisking in the kool kurkle dusk of the lushiness. My perfume of the pampas, says she (meaning me) putting out her netherlights, and I’d sooner one precious sip at your pure mountain dew than enrich my acquaintance with that big brewer’s belch.

And so they went on, the fourbottle men, the analists, unguam and nunguam and lunguam again, their anschluss about her whosebefore and his whereafters and how she was lost away away in the fern and how he was founded deap on deep in anear, and the rustlings and the twitterings and the raspings and the snappings and the sighings and the paintings and the ukukuings and the (hist!) the springapartings and the (hast!) the bybyscuttlings and all the scandalmunkers and the pure craigs that used to be (up) that time living and lying and rating and riding round Nunsbelly Square. And all the buds in the bush. And the laughing jackass. Harik! Harik! Harik! The rose is white in the darik! And Sunfella’s nose has got rhinoceritis from haunting the roes in the parik! So all rogues lean to rhyme. And contradrinking themselves about Lillytrilly law pon hilly and Mrs Niall of the Nine Corsages and the old markiss their besterfar, and, arrah, sure there was never a marcus at all at all among the manlies and dear Sir Armoury, queer Sir Rumoury, and the old house by the churpelizod, and all the goings on so very wrong long before when they were going on retreat, in the old gammeldags, the four of them, in Milton’s Park under lovely Father Whisperer and making her love with his stuffstuff in the languish of flowers and feeling to find was she mushymushy, and wasn’t that vely both of them, the saucicissters, a drahereen o machree !, and (peep!) meeting waters most improper (peepette!) ballround the garden, trickle trickle trickle triss, please, miman, may I go flirting? farmers gone with a groom and how they used her, mused her, licksed her and cuddled. I differ with ye! Are you sure of yourself now? You’re a liar, excuse me! I will not and you’re another! And Lully holding their breach of the peace for them. Pool loll Lolly! To give and to take! And to forego the pasht! And all will be forgotten! Ah ho! It was too too bad to be falling out about her kindness pet and the shape of O O O O O O O O Ourang’s time. Well, all right, Lelly. And shakeahand. And schenkusmore. For Craig sake. Be it suck.

Well?

Well, even should not the framing up of such figments in the evidential order bring the true truth to light as fortuitously as a dim seer’s setting of a starchart might (heaven helping it!) uncover the nakedness of an unknown body in the fields of blue or as forehearingly as the sibspeeches of all mankind have foliated (earth seizing them!) from the root of some funner’s stotter all the soundest sense to be found immense our special mentalists now holds (securus iudicat orbis terrarum) that by such playing possum our hagious curious encestor bestly saved his brush with his posterity, you, charming coparcenors, us, heirs of his tailsie. Gundogs of all breeds were beagling with renounced urbiandor- bic bugles, hot to run him, given law, on a scent breasthigh, keen for the worry. View! From his holt outratted across the Juletide’s genial corsslands of Humfries Chase from Mullinahob and Peacockstown, then bearing right upon Tankardstown, the outlier, a white noelan which Mr Lþwensteil Fitz Urse’s basset beaters had first misbadgered for a bruin of some swart, led bayers the run, then through Raystown and Horlockstown and, louping the loup, to Tankardstown again. Ear canny hare for doubling through Cheeverstown they raced him, through Loughlinstown and Nutstown to wind him by the Boolies. But from the good turn when he last was lost, check, upon Ye Hill of Rut in full winter coat with ticker pads, pointing for his rooming house his old nordest in his rolltoproyal hessians a deaf fuchser’s volponism hid him close in covert, miraculously ravenfed and buoyed up, in rumer, reticule, onasum and abomasum, upon (may Allbrewham have his mead!) the creamclotted sherriness of cinnamon syllabub, Mikkelraved, Nikkelsaved. Hence hounds hied home. Preservative perseverance in the reeducation of his intestines was the rebuttal by whilk he sort of git the big bulge on the whole bunch of spasoakers, dieting against glues and gravies, in that sometime prestreet protown. Vainly violence, virulence and vituperation sought wellnigh utterly to attax and abridge, to derail and depontify, to enrate and inroad, to ongoad and unhume the great shipping mogul and underlinen overlord.

But the spoil of hesitants, the spell of hesitency. His atake is it ashe, tittery taw tatterytail, hasitense humponadimply, heyheyheyhey a winceywencky.

Assembly men murmured. Reynard is slow!

One feared for his days. Did there yawn? ’Twas his stommick. Eruct? The libber. A gush? From his visuals. Pung? Delivver him, orelode! He had laid violent hands on himself, it was brought in Fugger’s Newsletter, lain down, all in, fagged out, with equally melancholy death. For the triduum of Saturnalia his goatservant had paraded hiz willingsons in the Forum while the jenny infanted the lass to be greeted raucously (the Yardstated) with houx and epheus and measured with missiles too from a hundred of manhood and a wimmering of weibes. Big went the bang: then wildewide was quiet: a report: silence: last Fama put it under ether. The noase or the loal had dreven him blem, blem, stun blem. Sparks flew. He had fled again (open shunshema!) this country of exile, sloughed off, sidleshomed via the subterranean shored with bedboards, stowed away and ankered in a dutch bottom tank, the Arsa, hod S.S. Finlandia, and was even now occupying, under an islamitic newhame in his seventh generation, a physical body Cornelius Magrath’s (badoldkarakter, commonorrong canbung) in Asia Major, where as Turk of the theater (first house all flatty: the king, eleven sharps) he had bepiastered the buikdanseuses from the opulence of his omnibox while as arab at the streetdoor he bepestered the bumbashaws for the alms of a para’s pence. Wires hummed. Peacefully general astonishment assisted by regrettitude had put a term till his existence: he saw the family saggarth, resigned, put off his remainders, was recalled and scrapheaped by the Maker. Chirpings crossed. An infamous private ailment (vulgovarioveneral) had claimed endright, closed his vicious circle, snap. Jams jarred. He had walked towards the middle of an ornamental lilypond when innebriated up to the point where braced shirts meet knickerbockers, as wangfish daring the buoyant waters, when rodmen’s firstaiding hands had rescued un from very possibly several feel of demifrish water. Mush spread. On Umbrella Street where he did drinks from a pumps a kind workman, Mr Whitlock, gave him a piece of wood. What words of power were made fas between them, ekenames and auchnomes, acnomina ecnumina? That, O that, did Hansard tell us, would gar ganz Dub’s ear wag in every pub of all the citta! Batty believes a baton while Hogan hears a hod yet Heer prefers a punsil shapner and Cope and Bull go cup and ball. And the Cassidy — Craddock rome and reme round e’er a wiege ne’er a waage is still immer and immor awagering over it, a cradle with a care in it or a casket with a kick behind. Toties testies quoties questies. The war is in words and the wood is the world. Maply me, willowy we, hickory he and yew yourselves. Howforhim chirrupeth evereach bird! From golddawn glory to glowworm gleam. We were lowquacks did we not tacit turn. Elsewere there here no concern of the Guinnesses. But only the ruining of the rain has heard. Estout pourporteral! Cracklings cricked. A human pest cycling (pist!) and recycling (past!) about the sledgy streets, here he was (pust!) again! Morse nuisance noised. He was loose at large and (Oh baby!) might be anywhere when a disguised ex-nun, of huge standbuild and masculine manners in her fairly fat forties, Carpulenta Gygasta, hattracted hattention by harbitrary conduct with a homnibus. Aerials buzzed to coastal listeners of an oertax bror collector’s budget, fullybigs, sporran, tie, tuft, tabard and bloody antichill cloak, its tailor’s (Baernfather’s) tab reading V.P.H., found nigh Scaldbrothar’s Hole, and divers shivered to think what kaind of beast, wolves, croppis’s or fourpenny friars, had devoured him. C. W. cast wide. Hvidfinns lyk, drohneth svertgleam, Valkir lockt. On his pinksir’s postern, the boys had it, at Whitweekend had been nailed an inkedup name and title, inscribed in the national cursives, accelerated, regressive, filiform, turreted and envenomoloped in piggotry: Move up.

On the fidd of Verdor the rampart combatants had left him lion with his dexter handcoup wresterected in a pureede paumee bloody proper. Indeed not a few thick and thin wellwishers, mostly of the clontarfminded class, (Colonel John Bawle O’Roarke, fervxamplus), even ventured so far as to loan or beg copies of D. Blayncy’s trilingual triweekly, Scatterbrains’ Aftening Posht, so as to make certain sure onetime and be satisfied of their quasicontribusodalitarian’s having become genuinely quite beetly dead whether by land whither by water. Transocean atalaclamoured him; The latter! The latter! Shall their hope then be silent or Macfarlane lack of lamentation? He lay under leagues of it in deep Bartholoman’s Deep.

But, their bright little contemporaries notwithstanding, on the morrowing morn of the suicidal murder of the unrescued expatriate, aslike as asnake comes sliduant down that oaktree onto the duke of beavers, (you may have seen some liquidamber exude exotic from a balsam poplar at Parteen-a-lax Limestone.

Wherefore let it hardly by any being thinking be said either or thought that the prisoner of that sacred edifice, were he an Ivor the Boneless or an Olaf the Hide, was at his best a onestone parable, a rude breathing on the void of to be, a venter hearing his own bauchspeech in backwords, or, more strictly, but tristurned initials, the cluekey to a worldroom beyond the roomwhorld, for scarce one, or pathetically few of his dode canal sammenlivers cared seriously or for long to doubt with Kurt Iuld van Dijke (the gravitational pull perceived by certain fixed residents and the capture of uncertain comets chancedrifting through our system suggesting an authenticitatem of his aliquitudinis) the canonicity of his existence as a tesseract. Be still, O quick! Speak him dumb! Hush ye fronds of Ulma!

Dispersal women wondered. Was she fast?

Do tell us all about. As we want to hear allabout. So tellus tellas allabouter. The why or whether she looked alottylike like ussies and whether he had his wimdop like themses shut? Notes and queries, tipbids and answers, the laugh and the shout, the ards and downs. Now listed to one aneither and liss them down and smoothen out your leaves of rose. The war is o’er. Wimwim wimwim! Was it Unity Moore or Estella Swifte or Varina Fay or Quarta Quaedam? Toemaas, mark oom for yor ounckel! Pigeys, hold op med yer leg! Who, but who (for second time of asking) was then the scourge of the parts about folkrich Lucalizod it was won't to be asked, as, in ages behind of the Homo Capite Erectus, what price Peabody’s money, or, to put it bluntly, whence is the herringtons’ white cravat, as, in epochs more cainozoic, who struck Buckley though nowadays as thentimes every schoolfilly of sevenscore moons or more who knowher intimologies and every colleen bawl aroof and every redflammelwaving warwife and widowpeace upon Dublin Wall for ever knows as yayas is yayas how it was Buckleyself (we need no blooding paper to tell it neither) who struck and the Russian generals, da! da!, instead of Buckley who was caddishly struck by him when be herselves.

We're not against rap, we're not against rappers
But we are against those thugs (thugs, thugs, thugs)

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
You're feelin' the strength of the rump, step up
Hear the funk of the jump that the thugstas feel
Just be thuggin', straight buzzin'
Lovin' your peoples cause we so real
Chill, better bring your weapon when steppin'
Bring on that ammunition, trip and don't slip
Not to mention, never knew no competition
But I gotta get mine
So scream out ""Mo'!"" and let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the Bone, Mo' Thugs will follow
Chain gang remaining the same
Flaming my dank and drinking brew
Thinking about that hanging, clocking my bank
And thuggin' with trues, foo's

[Hook: Shatasha Williams]
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

[Verse 2: Wish Bone]
Get ready for the Bone and the Mo' Thug
Bustas, you know me as a hustla
Try to creep and get beat
Maybe six feet, peep, gotta put them under
Straitjackets, gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Bailin' in my black trench vest
You gotta be down to bang-bang
Come and get this teaching
You soldiers how thugstas must stack
Me drinkin' me brew 'til me skull crack
Wig blew all the way back

[Hook: Shatasha Williams]
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Now follow me now, roll, stroll off deep in the land
Well creep if you can
Take another swig to the brain rose
Loc'in, steady chokin' off that potent smoke
And running from the po-po now
Gotta get up with my thugstas
Right turn to the double Glock
Pull to the curb, smoke with my hustlas
Puff puff puff to the brain, shot
Love P-O-D'd and tweeded
Gotta get another case for my trunk
Olde English, really don't need it
But in case my trues wanna get drunk
They pump Bone
So leave 'em alone, you don't wanna get shut down
Thug runnin' the nine-quad
And you better believe they be running this thug style
So what now? See the Bone Thug clank
Thug never gonna change so flame up
Sit back and just smoke to the same cut
Leatherface on the creep and I came up

[Hook: Shatasha Williams]
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone]
Gotta give it on up to the Glock-Glock
Pop-pop, better drop when them buckshot blow!
The Bone in me never no hoe so
No creepin' up outta the Ziplock
So Sin sip gin
And Lil Mo Hart run up, nut up and flipped in
Then slipped in the clip in
Next click and me blood the victim
Ever to test nuts, to the chest and put 'em to rest and
But I won't test bucks
Put a hole up into me vest and
Gotta get through my soul but they won't budge
Mug, drug, me picked em
The blood in me running my mental
The thug in me stuck in me keeping it simple
The Thug in me running with thugs so
To the temple, buck when you duck
To the thuggish ruggish T's
St. Clair P's to appeal to the G's
And a buck to all my enemies

We got Layzie, and Krayzie

34,I Never Seen A Man Cry (aka I Seen A Man Die),"[Round 1: Hollow Da Don]
I said, I wanna start this battle sayin' ""I apologize
I'm sorry Math. I fucked up. Bottom line
I failed you as a gangsta. It was hard, I really tried
But I got tired of wearin' them big ass clothes and I couldn't smile.""
You asked when I changed, February 14, 2014 I had a child
So I'm sorry Math, it's over it's done
Loyalty Over Money, to Math means puttin' Math over my son
It's dumb
But you gon' stand up here and say I ain't do right by you
Cause I seen shit goin' left and skkkkrt, made a right by you
Now I gotta sit up here and listen to disses that write by you?
Right
By you approachin' me in Houston I could've found the right bayou
To leave you in with Dizaster right by you!
Y'all both ugly 'bout that fight my dude
But it wasn't until he battled in Toronto
I said, ""Oh, time to intervene. It's on the east coast. Cortez on the card. You gon' be with the team.""
It's by home and ironically that fits the scheme
Cause Diz was in the strike zone and you didn't swing
You've been playin' this tough shit for over ten years my nigga, that's what you really get
Accept your karma, it was a Dose of somethin' Serius!
Little bitch, little bitch, little bitch, little bitch
I know when you like when I steal ya shit
Cause that's exactly how you been actin' ever since Dizaster when in ya shit
I'm feelin' Wavy and me no like
That beefs so old it got e.coli
But Math hold, he still wanna rap beef
Math old, he still come to events actin' super street
So when I found out I had to do this, a tear almost ran past my cheek
Cause when ya dawg get old...you gotta put his ass to sleep
So fuck Math, you ain't gotta be my friend Math
You 'bout to get 3 by 10, and after this I'ma be locked in a 3 by 10
I know the measurements off but y'all ain't never seen my pen'
I'm with all of the action, once I level up, if ya bars isn't matchin'
It's guaranteed to get ugly, that's just the law of attraction
Nigga this how you talk to a has-been
Aye Math, is it lonely down there?
He like, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah
Everybody call Hollow the GOAT, Goat, goat""
It's not fair boy, before I knew you I did 106, Fight Klub but he think Grind Time how I got here
Well then think my Illmac battle cause I came in top tier (tear)
Nigga I got a giant Rocket
So big Hakeem couldn't try to block it
Or find an object, cut Math just to make a science project
Then keep {three stabbing motions} pokin' at him, the knife's obnoxious
Nigga matter of fact, this battle don't make sense to me
It's like challenging Daylyt to a spelling bee
Or seein' ARP seven deep at Born Legacy
I said {record scratching} let's start takin' it back
What if Jones never ad libbed- {record scratching again}
Let's start takin' it back
What if Jones never ad libbed while he rapped?
What if Dose never had on a hat?
Would Math be where he's at?
At the bottom of the barrel to scratch
All them tails out the barrel to scratch is exactly why you there where you at
Takin' who cares type of match
While everything they for us (forest) fire, I'm just baring (bearing) the facts
""Aye Math! I'll be down there in five years, you want me to bring somethin' back?""
{Airplane noise} Damn your career done came and went
Y'all don't ever wanna be that Asian kid against Floyd at the main event
The nigga that used to punch niggas, what's his name again?
Math Hoffa
Been carryin' his ego so long he got...back problems
And bad posture, Math's a bitch
Type to eat Bonnie's ass and let his kids drink after him
Math is sick
Known in the battle world as Dizaster's bitch
Heheheh, I rhymed ""bitch"" twice
But I know y'all want me to get personal, right?
Like y'all want me to stand up here and tell y'all shit about his personal life
Alright well, Math's a Newport smoker
But when he's broke he smokes Blacks & Milds, so Math is a Black & Mild smoker, just ask around
Math passed out razors at my Big T battle, you know fake crazy tryin' to bluff
It's funny passed razors to Verb and Cal' and them the next two niggas that lined you up
No bars about cuttin' class, the gem split him, y'all gon' see double Math
Aye Verb a nigga, hand ARP his other half
Nigga I'll Chi Ali ya and I'll leave ya with Aaliyah
He like, ""You got any idea how to get outta here?"" like IKEA
I know he gon' diss me for LOM
He's wearin' fake LOM by the way
He's wearin' fake LOM under that
He's gonna diss me for LOM but that ain't what I got on
I switched it cause I'm dippin' in HiddenLabelClothing.com
Now here's a preview of his next round
He's gon' be like, ""You ain't loyalty bro
Hidden Label? You can't even be loyal to clothes!
Mike Zombie 'Started From The Bottom' that how-""
Look, don't mention Mike Zombie, he 26 and makin' hits with OVO music crazy
Makes ya boy wonder (Boi-1da) how you 40 and ain't been producin' lately
I was born on the same day as Rakim that's why they said I was dope
So two fingers ring or let 'em hang, you gon' remember the rope
I accomplished my 90's goal, that was to never be broke
Or be a Math, a grown man still livin' at home
Damn Math, well matter of fact you live on the road
Fuck NYB, nah I ain't gonna say that
I fuck wit' NYB that's my niggas you see him
Plus he got the new clique, Spanish/Raggaeton, it's NYBN
Y'all see him?
I know you gon' diss me but that ain't what I got on
I switched it cause I'm dippin' in HiddenLabelClothing.com

[Round 1: Math Hoffa]
I'm 'bout to show y'all what a don is
This little nigga think he's sparin' wit' me
Nigga you should just throw in the towel, save all your apologize please
Cause right now I'm feelin' like Drago, 'bout to show him that he's outta his league
Since shit got Rocky wit' son cause he ain't follow the Creed
I feel like Hollow should bleed
So I'm out for the kill
Shotgun to his chest BAOW! Make him hollow for real
Plan A: I'ma destroy Hollow with skill
Plan B: Baby they gon' have me out on the pill
First I wanna get one thing clear
You said, you wouldn't battle Dizaster 'til he shot me the fair
Is this motherfucker deaf? Can this motherfucker hear?
You said, you wouldn't battle DIzaster 'til he shot me the fair
And that's exactly the reason that got Hollow right here
Now I don't wanna leave none of y'all confused
If you came here for some rappity raps, see your way out the back, this ain't the one for you
But for the rest of y'all that like that real shit, this gon' be fun for you
I'ma talk to this nigga the way I wanted to
Hollow, what's up wit' you?
I had genuine love now I don't fuck witchu
Too many sucker moves I'm uncomfortable
After that Boston shit, I had enough of you
You couldn't tell me Diz' was comin' through?
And you tried to apologize? Why? That make it fuckin' cool?
You knew for like a month or two
Said he called and I was duckin' you
You right, cause you a bird ass nigga I saw the duck in you
Donald or Daffy, either one'll do
Cause he complied with Diz's needs (Disney) and didn't warn a brother (Warner Brothers) so now it's fuck you too
You fuckin' Goof, let me remind you of somethin'
Before you met me I was grimy for nothin'
Type to line up your cousin
Look at my timeline, violent concussions
Before you battlin' Joe [?] was fine for discussion
I was 'Hammer Time' I got other rappers lined up for buttons (Buddens)
I'm from Brooklyn nigga
We run Rikkers and up north
You from Queens but you act like a queen, nigga you butt soft
I give him a knot, make his head look Prego if he want sauce
So work to Roc, knock that Luigi mustache clean the fuck off
Who you playin' wit?
I know you was about that life, I told you, ""Stay legit.""
You ain't never had to take a trip
Try to make a potato fit, find out after the baow the potato don't even make a dif'
[?] man down, shell cases and mad potato's bits
My dawgs that rep that red nose, Hoffa be down to shake for his
My niggas that rep that blue nose, mama Hoffa done raised a Pit
Check my pedigree
Nigga I be cool where it's dumb hot
Chillin' wit' the niggas that run blocks
Me and you? We not the same
In Coney Island a couple gun shots made you run blocks and cannonball yo' ass off of some dock
That's real facts
I know the shit is surprisin'
It's hard to picture the Dininon d-d-divin'
But in Coney Island we had issues
Hollow heard and with all his pride he came out to the water ride...and ended up on a water ride
But, all aside, what the fuck can you say about that?
Let's be frank, the ocean? Ain't nothin' straight about that
But wait wait, you gon' play me like Pat?
""Oooh, I get in that ass, that's colon
Bbbbrrt, K's that's Nolan""
I pull out the strap BAP BAP BAP!
They like, ""Where Hollow at?""
""I'm right here in the ocean...back strokin'!""
I'ma keep it real, can I keep it real?
Look, I just came out here to clown this nigga
Really I ain't out to win
I knew you wasn't a real nigga, know how?
Cause he know how to swim
In all his clothes too, nigga lost a whole shoe
He was drenched, seaweed was hangin' out his pocket, look, look I ain't gon' hold you
We all been in scary situations that made us do some dumb shit
But that one slip, showed me under pressure...you gon' jump ship
So meet my nigga Splish Splash
Splish Splash AKA Nigel Bennett
Even for a light skinned dude this guys too timid
Mr. Bennett you pussy, don't nobody want ya kind of friendship
Cause if you catch beef thinkin' Nigel gon' be ridin' wit' it
And niggas press him like, ""That's ya guy. If you lie you get it.""
You know what he gonna say? ""My name's Bennett. And I ain't did it.""
And I'm offended, cause I use to ride for ya bitch ass
If we would've caught whoever beat up ya sister, they would've been stabbed
I never hated on you, I applauded you gettin' big bags
I even stood behind you in battles like, ""Yeah! Get him Splish Splash!""
But now I gotta spank this bitch, but first I wanna say, ""Thanks for this.""
And for the record, I never asked or expect you to do no gangsta shit
I relationship was like Banks and Fif's
He had them dope lines, get it?
I had that street cred, A1, he got co-signed wit' it
Grind Time was goin' bankrupt, he needed a home
If niggas wanted to check him on my account they left him alone (a loan)
You didn't need any APR, my status gave you equity
First Smack deposit this delinquent seen (delinquency), he was in debt to me
And how you pay that back? You withdrew on a war soldier
So now it's fuck saving bonds, we just standin' here for closure (foreclosure)
So how you wanna rap? I can give you real life and some bars wit' that
15 I was hidin' AK's behind my mommy back
Young nigga, robbin' e'rything like nothin' wrong wit' that
Lumberjack, choppers that bark, just give us all we ask (axe)
Snooze boy I pull bloody moves before that Cardi rap
Speakin' of Cardi, my shit real, these niggas Barbie acts
Bitch I'll hit yo' head wit' the pump, make you Minaj wit' that
A strap on yo' chin with high points, give you a party hat
You don't want no part of that
Razor blade, part ya back
Let's see how low I can go before your parts detach
You spit them corny raps
He throw a hat in the crowd pull another hat out
Let's see if you got another head when I spark ya cap
Math Hoffa the monster's back!
Hoffa!

[Round 2: Hollow Da Don]
How he ended his round? ""Math Hoffa the monster's back""
I wanna complement you, this tracksuit is fire, where you 'bought it at
LOMclothing.com? Thanks for the plug

[Math Hoffa]
I'll tell you

[Hollow]
Now you act like you put in work for my sister, but in the face off I proved that ain't hold no weight
So in actuality, the Jackson family, cause everybody knows (nose) it's fake
That's rebuttal one, I need y'all motherfuckers wait
A prisoner on escape nigga I'm punchin' out the gate
If y'all believe I got shot at on a ship or somethin', then that's the dumbest of notions
Are you sure (shore)? How do I go from the ground and just jump in the ocean
Then in the face off you said I stole ya shit

{To Math's entourage}
Can you tell them, ""Shut up""?
I need some bars Math, give it up
Put ya hands up, nah cause hands down they gon' give it up

Yeah I stole ya shit bitch...nigga what?
It was premeditated to flip ya stuff
It was a sign that 3 16's gon' zip you up
Nigga fuck you, fuck what John John say, I do shit the Don way
Face shot, have Math rappin' like Conway
I just stole my own shit, now bitch what you gon' say?
I'll leave Math stretched out with his feet up it's been a long day
His fire battle was Iron Solomon
The joints with Rex? They was all cool
But them big Summer Madness stages, even ya pet agree (pedigree), ya dawg food
Ya karma startin' to show in ya battles Math, stop actin' like a hard goon
But he's so negative, he only develops in a small room
You're just a human in an immortal war, stuck at a portal door actin' hardcore
When bar for bar I could pull your whole record like Nardwuar
We both was in the projects broke, semi-famous on Youtube
You thought we was makin' moves moves
I seen bigger and you knew so I wasn't disloyal Math, I outgrew you
I had to be like, ""Fuck that nigga and his crew too
There go Murder Mook! Shoot! There go Jones. Fuck. Who knew?
There go [?]"" - you know what? I wasn't disloyal I outgrew you
You Bang 'Em Smurf you 50
You Doughboy I'm Ricky
You Jojo I'm Diggy
You Torey I'm Dri-
No, you Drake and I'm Shiggy
Cause this once dance almost cost you 250
So who's really loyal?
Do y'all remember when I battled overseas, was y'all noticin' Math?
Where was he standin'?
In the front, close to the pack
When I battled Big T, where was he at?
In the front, is that holdin' me down or holdin' me back?
I'll let y'all decide
I guess you had a Phantom out in London that how the boy ride?
Because for some reason you Rolls on the wrong side
Math you choked so bad out there I damn near wanted to call time
So who's really loyal?
You made me look bad
I put in a word for Battle Of The Brave made sure they gave you a bag and I ain't even brag
But Killaz Battle League, you middle man, you ain't plug me with Vlad
Knowin' both of y'all snakes was makin' money off ads
Who's really loyal?
He gon' say I'm disloyal, I'm not LOM and I'ma hoe
Y'all know who's really disloyal?
His hairline it left you a long time ago
Speakin' of long time ago, I had weight nigga and I fronted you, facts
You took a month to flip two ounces, nigga ya hustle was wack
So I gave him some gems, put a QP in front of him he struggle wit' that
He still owe me 4 for 600 it's sad
I guess NYB ain't the first time it fucked up the pack
And don't have me mention [?] the Cali plug and the two plates you fuckin' thief
Because of that he didn't front me P's
See how ya actions fuck it up for me?
But Math loyalty ain't even fair
He be like, ""Yo, Subway just fucked up my sandwich, we no longer eatin' there.""
Nigga the feelin' you got with me, I had with Conceited, yeah
When Grind Time start quotin' his words it reemerged
When he made it to Wild 'N Out and I asked him to post up a shirt
And Conceited said, ""No"", I said, "" Word?"" Boy you know I was hurt
I was thinkin' about all the times we was low in the dirt
Then I thought about dissin' him, but I ain't have enough BITCH in me to go do a verse
See we both got them feelings Math, but who notice it first?
That's when the growth will occur
See, y'all call these ""dry spots"" but I score with mine
You can check points (checkpoints) they don't bored of (boarder) lines
So remember I can get super personal, but the devil do dance
So don't test me cause I can take it to that level too Math
What you tryin' to start? Your career now, Coffee in Green Mile I play a giant part
AR 'bout as long as a limb, I'm talkin' Andre The Giant parts
Talk heavy get ma buried (Marbury) ya head get a giant part
I hate niggas I fire squads I'm talkin' fire, your dialog (you'll die a log)
When I am on I am GOD!
I know y'all gon' diss me but that ain't what I got on
You got LOM but I fuck wit' HiddenLabelClothing.com
Plus LOMclothing.com
Sno' dat

[Round 2: Math Hoffa]
This bitch is thirst
All them lies 'bout givin' work
Talkin' 'bout, ""I AM GOD""
No you not, you tried walkin' on water and it didn't work
But you changed your life, right Hollow? 'I Ain't Mad At Ya'
Now we was once two rappers of the same kind
Text battles boy you used to get slayed slime
You told me ""Hollow Be Thy Name"" was a great line
Then you spit it versus Lux like it ain't mine
I knew we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for ya sister but never went up in her
When you was Gucci soft, but what I truly lost
Seein' her walk around the crib in them booty shorts
Mm, mm, mm
Yo, I'ma keep it real, I was gonna leave this out the rounds
But sometimes I used to go knock on ya door...when I knew that you was out town

(Ya sister was nice! Whoo
How she doin'? You gotta hear this. I wanna keep it real witchu bro. C'mon you gotta hear this. Whatchu want me to say?)

She was nice, slim redbone...nice lips
Look like she give crazy neck
Yo she came out the shower and said, ""Hi"" to me once, her body smellin' like baby breath
Yo I'd be talkin' to Hollow and she'll bend over in the background, that shit used to have me crazy stressed
In the gym doin' crazy reps
Thinkin' if she gave me sex, boy I'd beat that so bad she'd turn around and take my kids like ACS
It's shady, yes
If she watchin' right now, I know she's smilin'
Pussy gettin' mad wet, like Hollow in Coney Island
Yo Splish Splash, Spishy! What are we doin' here?
Cause a year ago you was scared
My heart's a freezer full of old beef, I don't got no room for fear
I had lessons, I learned from my L's and grabbed lessons
I'm sorry, you salad, the doctor's gon' add dressing
This fag wrestlin', get in the ring now he hyper
Ain't you the one that Roc killed in the ring? Rowdy Piper
Yeah, you beat Ars', but ain't matter cause he was punkin' you
John John took ya Don status and put a slump in you
Now ya name ain't the same and it troubles you
Cause Hollow's just a ho and two L's now he owe (O) y'all a W
My name should be ""Big Facts""
I don't care 'bout your angles and how you spin that
Cause Hollow points shatter upon impact
I'm a father of four and I take care of moms, I keep shit intact
I do charities every year for the kids I even give back
You in the hood, your rents $750, what's with the rich act?
Duplex, big ass balcony, see where I lived at
I went down a scale but still know the ways (weights) so I can give back
You sold weed, I sold coke and I was gettin' that
But now? I talk to kids in jail, inspire them with a chit chat
They can lean on me, the lean on you will get them sent back
That's big facts
Fame aside, you say that you changed but it ain't the same as I
Cause once I elevated I started changin' lives
This lame should die, this whole act is deceiving
He the biggest snake in that Apple
If I snap and just sleep him, ARP stay outta this, won't be no guarding (Garden) from Adam this Eve-ning
This gon' be biblical
Cause how you livin' is ruthless
You think you know a (Noah) nigga 'til the rain come and it give you the deuces, but I was clueless
But God was wit' me, I ain't see at times
This snake couldn't lend me a hand, that's not how he designed
At first I was sick about this shit but now I'm feelin' fine
Cause in the Bible, findin' a snake in ya staff is really a healin' sign
So I'm ridin' out
What the fuck you 'bout to lie about?
You gonna tell the fans that I'm dyin' out?
Like what? I'ma cry and pout?
If that's ya view lil' nigga you still don't know what life's about
It don't matter how far you fall it's about how high you bounce
Look at me now nigga
Yeah I lost some battles but I survived the war
Sometimes I just wanted the other half, I was broke and couldn't find a score
Personal shit was cloudin' my mind from writin' rhymes and more
But you can't judge me for my losses...like you ain't never take a dive before
Splish Splash! Splish Splash! Splishy! Splishy! Splishy!
Ayo Splish Splash, you ain't never rocked wit' the killers
The way I'm beatin' this bitch, I could tell you learned a lot from ya sister
You thought that you could come out here and get the spot of the realest?
I solidified my spot with gorillas and I don't rock wit' you niggas!
It's time to purge this nigga, I really wanna hurt this nigga
But both feet right through this pussy and breach birth this nigga
Twin cannons, squeeze out one clip to murk this nigga
Then drop that Iron and pick up the Loaded one and Verb this nigga
What I need to beat this coward?
These'll make him sleep for hours
I could slice him like pizza (Pisa) or turn him to the Leaning Tower
Go 'head pussy, throw a punch, I bet I weave and out ya
Fuck boy, a bus boy ain't got a cleaner counter
Now the knife, that's my wifey
My side bitch? She's a Ruge'
Whatever wifey fall short at, my side bitch be geeked to do
But wifey? She's just rude
Cause she don't ever say she's hungry, but she'll still reach over and eat ya food
Keep it cool, cause I would hate to take it further, I would hate to hurt ya
In battle rap it's finger guns, nigga outside I raise them burners
Either way, after killin' yo' ass I might be facin' Murda
So let's talk to that nigga
Ayo, I know you buns, but let us (lettuce) get this cheese and may yo (mayo)
Cause rappin' like that, I'll flame that burger
But back to you, you ain't a gat tucker or a cap buster

{Argument between the entourages ensues for over two minutes}

But back to you, you ain't a gat tucker or a cap buster
Steph and Clay as shooters, how does one dunk make you a Splash Brother?
Deuce in my boot, I bring it to whatever fool start it
Knock at ya door, they come out my shoes like you got new carpet
Hollow hit the ground, I'm backin' him down
Neighbors heard him scream like bitch, thought he was practicin' rounds, clappin' him now
Cause really, I can't stand all the fake shit
This mag (MAGA) will leave your hat red outta hatred
I say shit, it be deep but it sound so basic
I said ""MAGA"" ""hat red"", ""hat red"" read out is ""hatred""
Just face it
You don't got bars like that
Hollow, do you know what ""unilateral"" means?
Nah, you ain't smart like that
So try not to fall asleep, you know his bars type wack
And I'll be here next round to bring the bars right back!

[Round 3: Hollow Da Don]
You get mad at my cousin but that's a real Blood
So if I told him ""Math have to die"" he won't even ask me why
He'll just ask the time
And when you hear about the murder know how to act surprised
Look, I would rebuttal that round, but I wasn't listening half the time

[Girl in the crowd]
You shoulda!

[Hollow]
I said before Diz', you had a problem with Smack and you owed that man grands on grands
Showed no remorse, can't put another man before the man
Goddamn, you actually got banned before the BANNED
And my man told me, ""Remember who you talkin' to
A gangsta that get jumped and his response is to sue.""
This is big bad Math?
The one that get mad when I fronted you bags
Of course I made you pump nigga, you ain't never had nothin' on gas
A Brooklyn nigga with no bread!
But when it come to real drama shit, he fuckin' down
Math's the type that's a real ass nigga 'til some hoes come around
Then he's switchin' his aura, this nigga done gained 100 pounds
What a clown
You begged me to be in NYB, but at first I didn't truly see
I was like, ""Down witcha crew? Sweet.""
I mean, we knew each other like two weeks
On the first week, Math took his course and it was major
He's the first rapper to record another rapper askin, ""Are we rappers or are we [?]?""
Then he's mad at this rapper for not settin' up another rapper cause you got jumped by a bunch of rappers
This all rap shit
My nigga we knew each other for a decade and had street dealings
Ain't no flaw in none of that shit
So if you gotta say ""Hollow did this"" and ""Hollow did that"" then that's girl shit
Cause if you ain't approach Hollow when he did then it ain't real shit
But y'all know what real, to him it's ""Get the .9 and peel""
Y'all know what real to me is
If ya boy's sittin' inside the cell and don't go to One Time and tell then provide his bail
That still applies
Cause real to Math is GS9 lettin' they weapons off
Real to me is Bobby doin' extra time so Rowdy could get a lesser charge
But he gon' say, ""But I ain't never change Hollow. I always kept it real.""
And that's why I agree witchu, you ain't never change Math, you the same person still
You know what you ain't change? Your environment, that's why you never made it out
You know what else ain't change? Ya attitude, neither did ya bank account
He look at change as somethin' bad so I'ma leave you dead how you are
Y'all remember what he just said? ""I solidify my spot with gorillas.""
Which makes sense cause apes never evolved
He walk in a room like, ""I'm Math Hoffa! I rep the crooks!""
I walk in the room like, ""I'm Hollow."" And you wonder why I get better looks
See he the type that'll harm somebody for his lack of communication skills
You might as well say, ""I kill cause I can't explain the way I feel.""
Just like with Tax Stone he was in jail when you dissed him, nigga that's my word
That was foul
But you got a big check comin' once Tax return
I said Arian Foster texted me he said, ""Both of y'all my guys
So at the end of the battle give him five
And remember, an updated truth is just as bad as a lie.""
That shit hit town
I guarantee he watchin' this clip wild cause he told me this the other night and I'm rappin' 'bout this shit now!
See who legendary Math? When you can switch styles mid-round
I could've threw in somethin' 'bout Offset and Chris Brown
But I'm makin' history, current events ain't how I 'Get Down'
I'm tired of this shit, this is all personal shit
What happened and who's a better lyrically
Battle rap is startin' to turn into couples therapy
I remember....it's really becomin' a new sport
Everybody's peaceful but a few fought
For words Math never wanna hear:

[Dizaster sounding guy in the crowd]
I'M IN NEW YORK!

[Hollow]
C'mon Diz'. Yo Diz' come on. Dizaster come up
Look at you. Look at you. Look at him. He maaaaaad. He maaaaad

[Math]
He wouldn't have made it through the door

[Hollow]
Math like to go into these stories where he talk real vivid
About meetin' his homie Randy durin' a killin'
Like, ""I still got the blood on my Timberlands from when I met him.""
And real niggas listen like, ""Damn, Math out here tellin' all Randy business.""
And then you ask him what happened he like, ""Oh it was a grimy way
I had to stake out his house, hide behind the gate.""
You ask Math the time and date he's like, ""It was '98.""
Then he say, ""How you gonna  be loyal to yourself?""
I'm teachin' self love Math, if you can't be loyal to yourself you can't be loyal to no one else
I know y'all wonderin' ""Loyalty and business don't mix.""
Well I'ma show you how that works
Like ARP hit me for the Mook battle, what y'all think I did?
Called Smack first
But Smack can't tell me not to work witchu
Cause you paid money to feed my family, see that's where it get personal
My personal loyalty is Jim Dutch and Friday cause they hold it down
My nigga Jim Dutch I know any day I can hit him like, ""Yo the rent's up.""
He like, ""Here"", that's loyalty over money
You gon' respect us and you wanna kick him out the crowd cause you mad
Unzip that shows that fake LOM, look at him
That's what he got on, but I switched it cause I'm dippin' in HiddenLabelClothing.com

[Math]
That's it?

[Hollow]
I'm not going 30 minutes. That's five minutes

[Math leans into Hollow and whispers]
I guess you really do me a favor huh

[Hollow]
You're an asshole

[Round 3: Math Hoffa]
He said this battle gon' be ""logic versus emotions""
Okay, so let's reverse the stance
You rep Loyalty Over Money, being disloyal, don't you hurt ya brand?
But you said, ""There's no loyalty in business.""
Aight, you used to serve them grams
Well hustling's a business, so that tells me at any circumstance
That you would even snitch on ya niggas or go and murk ya mans
Anyway you play it, your logic just ain't worth a damn
Now loyalty, what's loyalty to you?
Devotion to something or someone outside yourself
Feels good knowin' that you got homies to hear your cries for help
People that won't let you die cause inside they couldn't survive themselves
A guy to catch you when you backslide, keep you in mind or health
I told you, ""Stop drinkin' lean"", cause it could take ya life
I told you, ""Move OT wit' Lennon"", so you could raise him right
I told you, as far as John John don't even end the fight
Let him create the hype and battle that nigga when the paper's right
From the looks of things, nigga I gave you some great advice
But let's rewind though, to way before you played this passive shit
Used to come to my crib with the gats, a couple of raps to spit
We'd talk about life, some nights he even crashed then dipped
Y'all heard him yellin' ""NYB! Nigga that's the clique!""
So what reason was half legit for you to suck Dizaster's dick?
Cause you was on my line like, ""Fuck them niggas. They need to catch a clip.""
Now it's karma that I brought on myself? Ain't that a bitch?
Well I guess the night John John beat yo' ass, karma was movin' fast as shit
Maybe karma heard about him and Lux and said, ""That match ups sick
I'ma take the day off, go to this face off, maybe catch a pic.""
Then you swung on John and karma whipped out the badge real quick
And gave John John the power to throw you through a glass and crack ya shit
Nah nigga, niggas fight everyday B, that ain't it
It was that Bodied movie, cause DIzaster helped them cast the flick
You literally switched up on the set before ya actin' clip
Seein' ya man work with the ops will really have you pissed
I ain't wanna clap him, just slap him, bloody his faggot lips
But Hollow how could I expect the right aid out of an addict?
Knowin' you would risk gettin' drugged if someone passed a script
This sad as shit cause he was on-line shit poppin'
Dissin' Charlie Clips cause he ain't rockin'
I'm sittin' back just watchin'
Oh you was mad he had them slippers on like it was wrong, now you the nigga that's flip floppin'?
It's just shockin'
What's up wit' ya pride? If you had any issues wit' me nigga, that ain't somethin' you hide
You said you could've talked to me, motherfucker you lied
Ya name's Hollow, you not supposed to keep nothin' inside!

{Crowd starts chanting 3-0}

Nigga, we was Boyz N The Hood them NYB days
I was Doughboy, a product the streets made
You should've been Ricky, cause street wise you need to be sprayed
But he jumped out the car in the beef stage
And that's ironic that your actions would show that you would be Tre (betray)
Hollow come on, your whole motto's a con
You pushin' loyalty is like the pope preachin' out the Koran
Niggas thought I was emotional
""Oh, oh Math don't know how to move on.""
I'ma chess player, I made Hollow a pawn
I knew if I kept pushin' Hollow eventually Hollow'd respond
Cause son'll (sun'll) come up early, get it? Hollow Da Don (dawn)
But hold on Hollow, I can't lie nigga, ya following's strong
Them niggas will follow you anywhere...except to iTunes to download ya songs
You ever heard one of Hollow's songs?
Yo, yo this be the beat, right? Then after Hollow come on
And after awhile this nigga Hollow is GONE
So when them pictures of you and Diz' surfaced and they was shoutin' ""You wrong""
For me it wasn't nothin' outta the norm'
Cause I'm used to Hollow losin' track and not ridin' along
See y'all see a star
Me? I only see the clouds that he form
They sayin' ""Battle rap's Mook is Jordan and Hollow's Lebron.""
Now that's relatable, cause on stage he pull the greatest moves then he play it cool
But if you on his team, just know you tradeable
I felt like Cleveland, in LA niggas made him choose
The love is still there, but this chip that I got, really came from you
My beef with Dizaster really started with you
When you pressed him in New York and I backed you up cause you was part of the crew
They set me up in LA, now you call him your dude?
Hood rules? I'm supposed to break the jaw of this fool
But you know what? I'ma chill Hollow
Cause you changed ya life, right?
Okay, where's the fuckin' evidence?
You ain't hangin' wit' me no more so what? You hangin' wit reverends?
Are you Hollow Da Don the entrepreneur makin' moves for the betterment?
Or are you a disloyal snake guilty of grand larceny and embezzlement?
Let's talk about it
I'd like to introduce y'all Rob and Duck
These are the co-owners of LOM
The investors that helped start it up
Now the irony of all this stuff is Rob and Duck are the two niggas that believed in Hollow before he robbed and ducked
See, Hollow was runnin' the company, but he was fuckin' shit up
Not payin' taxes, just runnin' amok
So Rob started checkin' the books thinkin' somethin' was up
First thing he discovers is what?
It seems Hollow's cut wasn't enough
This fuck boy was stealin' from his partners tryin' to cover it up
Let's play Swear To God Hollow
That Audi that you love to brag about didn't come from Rob
Swear to God that you not a thief
Swear to God that you not a rat
Swear to God it ain't your signature on these paperwork that you stole and you'd pay him back
Swear to God this ain't the facts
You like to talk like you makin' money, well that's cool
If none of this is true, take these papers from me
Okay, we'll just say today you've been served
For months you talkin' 'bout you elevated nigga
How you elevated nigga? Look how you livin' nigga
The first time you stole from 'em you gave 'em your word
That you would pay it back so they told you only scrape up a third
But that was a mistake, cause they let you outta the trap
They ain't realize they was housing a rat
You knew where the cheese was and you knew how to come back
So when the company started doin' good and makin' mountains of stacks
Hollow turned Thanos and cleaned out the accounts with a snap
What the fuck fuck?!
Nigga how you rob Rob and duck Duck?
If you would've stole $50,000 from me, nigga you'd be more than fucked up
But this is what you talkin' 'bout? I'm mad at your elevation?
You out here stealin' from niggas with families and what? It's a celebration?
You didn't even think about the safety of Lennon
Cause if you would've stole from me and I couldn't find you, that's the next place that we headin'
So Rob got mad, he just wanted to pop on him
Went to Florida, pulled up to his crib and got the drop on him
Hollow ran left his sons and his moms to take a shot for him
Then he called up talkin' tough tellin' Rob to have his Glock on him
And then what you do after that bitch nigga? You called the cops on him
What happened to you man?!
What happened to you bro?
You doin' all this frontin', turns out you ain't loyal to nothin'
But Loyalty Over Money, that ain't a brand you should rep, nigga you foo foo
It's cool dude, cause guess who's the newest partner with you too?
Yeah nigga, I'm makin' it mine
You ain't seen the other papers I sign
So everything that you doin' now, all the money you makin' is fine
But after that court date make sure you make my payments on time
And while you standin' here tryin' to get it all straight in ya mind
We already collaborated, y'all can check out LOM's latest design
But wait, it's-now it's HiddenLabelClothing, right?
With Mike Zombie, who put the bread in nigga?
Okay you went from pushin' loyalty to a hidden agenda
I get it nigga
Yo Mike, if you watchin' check your accounts and your credit nigga
Cause chances are he's only workin' with Zombie cause he's so used to deadin' niggas
Look Hollow, this what you gon' do, right
You gon' get them hard workin' brothers back they money and save ya life
As far as our relationship goes, if you wanna make it right
There's two things you can do: give me DIzaster's home address and tell your sister come to my crib so she can take this pipe
Other than that, don't be worried what I got on

35,If You Love Me,"[Verse 1]
I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
Want a love that is based on truth, not just dare

[Bridge]
You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine, in the light and the dark

[Chorus]
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it

[Verse 2]
You see now actions speak louder than words
So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul
I don't want a love who will come here and go

[Bridge]
You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine, in the light and the dark

[Chorus]
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it
If you love me, say it

If you want me, show it
Prove it
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
Show it
Prove it
Say it
Do it
Show it
Prove it

Oh I, Oh I, I wanna touch you baby
And spread my love, all around you honey
And if you care, you gotta show it baby
True love to share

Show it
Prove it

36,Playaz Club,"[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

[Verse 1]
I got a ho named Reel-To-Reel
She got a buddy named SP-12, now you know the deal
We gets freaky in the studio late-night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin' real tight
Somethin' to roll to, somethin' to stroll to
If you's a player in the game this'll hold you
More money, more money for the bank roll
Stick to the script, don't slip in the '94
A lot of fools put the salt in the game
To where these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
Huh, I run my own, and I'm my own self-person
No respect make the situation worsen
Fillmore, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a Playaz Club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town, a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on remote at the Playaz Club

[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
(More champagne, Mr. Forté?)

[Verse 2]
From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Frankie J, we took an airplane flight
Huh, they wanted to hear a rap, I said ""Alright, bet""
We dropped a beat, I grabbed the mic, and then they wrote a check
A few G's for the pocket, no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State, and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
The word was gettin' out, 4-Tay's out-rappable
Don't need a Glock, but I bought one just in case
A sucka try to stop me from pursuing my paper chase
Know the chase is on, because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap, you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way, just in case you never heard of Rappin' 4-Tay
I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' on them suckas poppin' off at the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank, bro
Leave the gat at the house, bring some dominoes
Kick off your shoes, relax, and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin' at these women at the Playaz Club

[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

[Verse 3]
You can't resist it, but don't get it twisted
VIP, that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout
And how you carry yourself; now homie, what you all about?
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G.'s
Some got a nine-to-five, some took a lot of kis
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
A lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme-sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start drifting in the wrong direction
Miss Goody Two-Shoe, I'll see you later
I ain't got time, you ain't nothing but a playa-hater
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show, another flow, a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership, but never slip to lameness fast
Or else Fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground, and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the Playaz Club

[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it in the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Sucka-free Club

[Outro: Rappin' 4 Tay & Lil Fly]
Yeah, I'd like to send this shout out
To all the Playaz Clubs throughout the world
I know they got a Playaz Club in Chicago
Huh, what about that one they got in Philly, Fo'?
You know they got one out there in Atlanta
The way they be choppin' it
You understand, shit; Detroit, New York, Texas
Yeah, but we gonna move on down to these Playaz Clubs
Closer to home, like Seattle, L.A., Bakersfield, San Diego
P.A., V-Town, Richmond, Sacramento
Yeah, but a special shout goes out to the Playaz Club
Right across the water in the Biggity Biggity O
Yeah, and last but definitely not least, yeah
Them Playa Clubs they got right there in the
San Francisco mothafuckin' bay, yeah
Where your Playaz Club at 4?
My Playaz Club right in the heart of Fillmo'e
Uh, I feel you boy
Where yours at Fly?

37,When We Dance,"[Intro]
If he loves you
Like I love you
I would walk away in shame
I'd move town
I'd change my name

[Chorus 1]
When he watches you
When he counts to buy your soul
On your hand his golden rings
Like he owns a bird that sings

[Chorus]
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

[Verse 1]
The priest has said my soul's salvation
Is in the balance of the angels
And underneath the wheels of passion
I keep the faith in my fashion
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
I'm still in love with you
I'm going to find a place to live
Give you all I've got to give

[Chorus]
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

[Verse 2]
If I could break down these walls
And shout my name at heaven's gate
I'd take these hands
And I'd destroy the dark machineries of fate
Cathedrals are broken
Heaven's no longer above
And hellfire's a promise away
I'd still be saying
I'm still in love

He won't love you
Like I love you
He won't care for you this way
He'll mistreat you if you stay
Come and live with me
We'll have children of our own
I would love you more than life
If you'll come and be my wife

[Chorus]
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

38,Bring The Pain,"[Verse]
Master of the lyrical Samurai Sword
Blast a rapper with my flow, damn, I'm fly, raw
Pass the mic-phone, go slam a guy's jaw
Acid rain like, own the whole the shop floor
Drop the track, I'll get down with my method
For God's sake, Will'll rip it then I'll wreck it
Not the cake but my quotes are so sweet
Knock the break out the motherfucking beat
Cooking heat, rhyme scheme looking neat
Other MCs get back on their fucking knees
Suckers tempt me to slash at their head piece
So I spit so much,I'm leaving with wet teeth
Mic in my clutch, I'm breeding techniques
My DNA's so dope my semen wreck beats
Bringing the pain, ready to rip all

And if a mental picture 's all I've got, to go on
For a while or more
Girl you know I'll always think of you, think of you
Yes if a mental picture's all I've got, to go on, I know
You're a picture to remember

Time was of the essence
And as usual the day turns into minutes
Sharing love and tenderness
That's the nerve you struck in me that sent a signal
To the other side
Girl I don't know
I'm saying my blind side

Chorus
And if a mental picture 's all I've got, to go on
For a while or more
Girl you know I'll always think of you, think of you
Yes if a mental picture's all I've got, to go on, I know
You're a picture to remember

Take me to the other side
Why can't I feel?
Out of my blind side

And oh if a mental picture's all I've got
All I've got to go on
For a while or more
Girl you know I'll always think of you, think of you
Yes if a mental picture's all I've got, to go on, I know

41,Blind Man,"[Verse 1]
I took a course in Hallelujah
I went to night school for de blues
I took some stuff they said would cool ya
But nothing seemed to light my fuse

But that's all in the past
Like a check that's in the mail
She was a tall whiskey glass
I was an old hound dog
That just loved to chase his tail

[Chorus]
Until I met a Blind Man
Who taught me how to see
A Blind Man
Who could change night into day
And if I can
I'm going to make you come with me
Because here come the sun
And we'll be chasing all the clouds away

[Verse 2]
I've had some lovers like a joyride
Some things are never what they seem
My heaven's turned into a landslide
Thank God I woke up from that dream

[Chorus]
I met a Blind Man
Who taught me how to see
Blind Man
Who could change night into day
And if I can
I'm going to make you come with me

Because here comes the sun
And we'll be chasing all the clouds away

The bee's chase honey
And drink all the flowers dry
We'll be saving us a little money
And if that doesn't do it, yeah
I know the reason why

[Bridge]
Don't make no sense lighting candles
There's too much moonlight in our eyes

[Chorus]
I met a Blind Man
Who taught me how to see
Blind Man
Who could change night into day
And if I can
I'm going to make you come with me

Because here come the sun
Ain't no surprise
Ain't no doubt about it
Going to open up my eyes",Aerosmith,Aerosmith,1994,"[48, 49, 55, 57, 59, 68, 74, 78]",8
42,Far Behind,"Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad
But I did it anyway

And then maybe some would say your life was sad
But you lived it anyway

And so maybe your friends they stand around they watch you crumble
As you fall down to the ground

And then somedayyour friends they stand beside as you were flyin'
Oh, you were flyin' oh so high
But then someday people look at you
For what they call their own
They watch you suffer
Yeah they hear you calling home
And then someday we can take our time
To brush the leaves aside so you can reach us
Hey but you left me far behind

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now I'm saying, maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no
Couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer

Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes
But I lived with what I've known

And then maybe we might share in something great
Won't you look at where we've grown
Won't you look at where we've gone

And then someday comes, tomorrow holds
A sense of what I feel for you in my mind
As you trip the final line
And that cold day when you lost control
Shame you left my life so soon
You should have told me, hey
Hey but you left me far behind

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no

Oh, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Oh my lord
See I know
See I know

But maybe, said maybe
I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway, sayin' now maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain
Now I've said, but times have changed
Your friends they come and watch you crumble to the ground
They watch you suffer, yeah they hold you down, hold on down
Now I said maybe, maybe
I didn't mean to treat you bad
But you left me far behind
Left me far behind
Left me far behind",Candlebox,Candlebox,1994,"[50, 46, 43, 36, 31, 35, 31, 26, 24, 26, 24, 23, 20, 18, 22, 32, 34, 37, 58]",19
43,Do You See,"[Intro: Gil Scott-Heron]
The blues has always been totally American
As American as apple pie
As American as the blues
As American as apple pie
The question is why
Why should the blues be so at home here?
Well, America provided the atmosphere

[Verse 1]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
I take a look over my shoulder, as I get older
Getting tired of mothafuckas saying, ""Warren I told ya""
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
With these funny-bunny niggas, ain't shit changing
Got my Mama wondering if I'm gang banging
But I don't pay attention to these father figures
I just handle mine, and I'm rolling with my niggas
Off to the VIP, you see Snoop Dogg and Warren G
Unbelievable how time just flies
Right before your eyes, but you don't recognize
Now who's the real victim, can you answer that
The nigga that's jacking or the fool getting jacked?

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

[Verse 2]
Another sunny day, another bright blue sky
Another day, another muthafucka die
These are the things I went through when I was growing up
There's only one hood, and niggas shit be throwing up
And I knew it, there really ain't nothing to it
Thinking every fool's gotta go through it
Now let's go back, how far, back in time
Dragging to these hookas trying to mack for mine
I remember when we all used to stop at the spot
Back then my nigga-name was Snoop Rock
It was all so clear, '87, '88, then '89s the year
You say everywhere we roll, you can say we roll thick
Way back then 2-1-3 was the clique
Something to stay paid I was just a young hog
Warren G, Snoop Rock and Nate Dogg

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

[Verse 3]
You make me wanna holla, get out the game
Too many muthafuckas know my name
While Snoop Dogg's serving time up in Wayside
I puts it down on the street, don't try to take mine
I had to reassure the homie that he wasn't alone
We'd talk, and him and Nate'd conversate on the phone
He kept saying, ""Nigga, it won't be long
Before a little skinny nigga like me'll be home""
I said ""Snoop, things done changed, it's not the same
We need to get up out the game
Cause we can get paid in a different way
With you kicking dope rhymes and I DJ""
Well as time goes past, slowly we try to make it
But things are getting hectic, I just can't take it
Should I, A: Go back to slanging dope
Or should I, B: Maintain and try to cope
Or should I, C: Just get crazy and wild
But no, I chose D: Create the G-Child
It's been on ever since with me and Mista Grimm
This shit is getting so hectic that I can't even trust him now
What would you do for a Warren G cut
Would you act the fool and nut the fuck up
Back the fuck up, act the fuck up
Niggas talk shit they get smacked the fuck up, straight up

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G",Warren G,Warren G,1994,"[51, 52, 66, 67, 73]",5
44,Fa All Y'all,"[Verse 1]
I am..... quick to pull the trigger quick to pull your card
Hard late for the boulevard
It's Da B to the R-A-T with the bump
Sendin good vibrations from the trunk to the front
Of your ride (ride) where I live that's what they like (like)
So that's what I give
Somethin for them fools when they crawl and creep
And creep and crawl, it's fa all y'all
Well..........

[Chorus]
Who's that makin that funky noise?
It's Da Brat-tat-tat-tat bustin out on that ass
Fa All Y'all, Fa All Y'all hey hey hey (you don't hear me, though)
Who's that makin that funky noise?
It's like that, it's like that, it's Da Brat
Fa All Y'all, Fa All Y'all hey hey

[Verse 2]
Now that Da Brat's in the house yo the house is packed
Guys and girls everywhere with a hump in they back
As I slang my funk like a boulder moves through the hood
All Fa Y'all cause everything is good
Now..... lay back listen to the phattest
Listen to the baddest rhymin' apparatus
At a status you ain't got to check
Cause y'all knows that I definitely gets wrecked
So,  uh

[Chorus]
Who's that makin that funky noise?
It's Da Brat-tat-tat-tat bustin out on that ass
Fa All Y'all, Fa All Y'all hey hey hey (you don't hear me, though)
Who's that makin that funky noise?
It's like that, it's like that, it's Da Brat
Fa All Y'all, Fa All Y'all hey hey

[Verse 3]
Gotta give thanks to the funk when it's time to pray
With some fine ass dank now it's time to play
That shit from that ghetto ass bitch me be
B to the R A to the T
Just niggas and bitches on every side
Waitin for the chance to get funkdafied
And all they gotta do is learn the words of this anthem
I'll grant them if you can chant them
Like everybody else..

[Chorus]
Who's that makin that funky noise?
It's Da Brat-tat-tat-tat bustin out on that ass
Fa All Y'all, Fa All Y'all hey hey hey (you don't hear me, though)
Who's that makin that funky noise?
It's like that, it's like that, it's Da Brat

45,The Most Beautifullest Thing In This World,"[Produced by Erick Sermon]

[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Y'all mythalogical niggas is comical
The astronomical is coming through like the flu bombing you
And embalming in your crew too
With the musical mystical magical, you know how I do
With word attack skills and vocabulary too
Come to hit you with this edition, it's all brand New
You're through, I'm interplanetarian like Doctor Who
(Who? Who?) So who? (Who?)
Born to get tripped on, word is bond
I'm kicking rhymes 'til the A.M. vultures swarm
Not Quincy, but I'm back on the block and not selling crack
Accompanied with the fat funk flows and tracks
So what you saying black, with all that yackedy yack
My artifacts can't be beat with bats
I'm saying, I eat up everything up on the menu
And bend you and send you swaying, to be continued

[Hook]
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya

[Verse 2]
Spur of the moment opponents is suspects
Caught up in precipitation reign of the tech-
Niques, I speak my concepts freak
The ichi ni san shi funk figures of speech
Now that shit is in the open, I'm open, hoking, scoping
Waitin for the next nigga to get opened on
And break him down like a organic compound
That's the weight of the world as the Earth goes round
Now, how the fuck you sound
I represent my clique, like a four-pound
You better pack your levodopa medication for the shaking
Meditation from the earth, that quaking shit that we be making
Never faking I gets down for my crown clown
Shaking the membrane of Encyclopedia Brown
Freaking the funk in any throw down
While you sustained to the sounds, up in you

[Hook]
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya

[Verse 3]
I comes down breaking ground
So back up off of me and sit your ass down
Now when I'm on the microphone I roam through zones
But don't be trying this shit at home
No matter what race, creed, color him or her
I comes cleaner than Jeru and Damage an amateur
As chronical facial disorders occur
I'll assassinate your character's caliber
I channel my anger, from the double edged banger
And turn into the microphone strangler
So stop tryna see where your eyes can't follow
Say goodnight to the world and goodbye to tomorrow
You rave and cuss so it's a must you get bust
We're not to be fucked with, Toys Ain't Us
For eternity, through infinity
I internally, get in you

[Hook]
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya

""I'll be practicing in my mind""

Wha-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baaa
Whoa-oh-oh
Catch the vibes... the reggae and the ragtime
Whoa-oh-oh
Catch the vibes, catch the vibes
Whoa-oh-oh
Cause it's Lucas with the lid off
Catch the vibes, catch the vibes
Whoa-oh-oh
Cause it's Lucas with the lid off
Zem, Zem
DaZem, Zem
DaZow, Zem

Watch me now you hear me now
Watch me go-oh

[Bridge]
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)

I feeeeeel... so good

Zow, zow, zow

Watch me go-oh

[Verse 1: Lucas]
Strike the right chord, and I rap, rap my skull cap
Electric, until I blow my top off
I wrap my lyrics right around the globe
I lay lobes and all
Bit by bit I make it fit
Cause I'm here to knit myself together
And whatever split for my format
And after that
I never stay the same
And treat the freak like a doormat
Jump around on it
I'm here to spray poetic confetti already
Open open open up your skull cap
And let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Let it drain

All the I'm-too-cool-to-have-a-good-time-
But-really-I'm-a-muted-trumpet type of talkaway
Hey-ey-ey
Move to the front, take it off, take it off
Catch the vibes
Cause it's Lucas with the lid off

[Chorus]
Catch the vibes, catch the vibes
Whoa-oh-oh
Cause it's Lucas with the lid off
Catch the vibes, catch the vibes
Whoa-oh-oh
Cause it's Lucas with the lid off
Zem, Zem
DaZow, Zow
Skedadle-lah-ooh
Watch me now you hear me now
Uh now, now, now

[Bridge]
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)
Whatever bubbles, bubbles up... (I feeeeeel)
Come follow me around come follow me now (yeah, yeah-eah)

I feeeeeel... so good
I feeeeeel... so good

[Verse 2: Lucas]
Welcome to my brain, I got the lid off
My chest I got my nut off
The type of spirit that can break your framework
The same by the end will stay the same
Hear the voice of summer
Zow za zow zow
But once I gotta hum a melody
That represents the type of flow I kick
When my tongue is swingin' like a drumstick
Of a jazzy type of lick
Everybody's got the lid on tightly
Afraid of what might be lurking right behind
And out of safety
So undo yourself and watch my rhyme go
Out of my lyrical chimney
But don't repeat my voice to the beat

When you hear the track again make up your own words
Cause the rhythm is a conduit to break a split from the homegrown
The well known is on to the unknown

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn what you think you know
There are times when I find
You want to keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why

When you feel what you feel
Oh how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But when you feel, oh like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why

58,Pickup Man,"Well, I got my first truck when I was three
Drove a hundred thousand miles on my knees
Hauled marbles and rocks and thought twice before
I hauled a Barbie Doll bed for the girl next door
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand
There's something women like about a pickup man

When I turned sixteen, I saved a few hundred bucks
My first car was a pickup truck
I was cruising the town and the first girl I seen
Was Bobbie Jo Gentry, the homecoming queen
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab
And said, ""I never knew you were a pickup man""

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Most Friday nights I can be found
In the bed of my truck on an old chaise lounge
Backed into my spot at the drive-in show
You know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand
Cause there's something women like about a pickup man

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

A bucket of rust or a brand new machine
Once around the block and you'll know what I mean

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made

'Cause the Mack’s on the Earth just to spoil your plans
More pep than the pepper that's in ya pepper shaker
Ruff earthquaker, couldn't take me if ya mama make ya
I back up the funk that I bring with unknown to man slang
With bigger bite than the Devil fang

Got me dressin' for ya funeral session
Man, it won't even matter no more

My style was definite to take ya over
Have ya sittin' lookin' over in a four door Chevy Nova (Why I oughta)

65,"I Can Go Deep (From ""A Low Down Dirty Shame"")","The Education Of George

As I have said, Strelley Mill lies at the north end of the long Nethermere valley. On the northern slopes lay its pasture and arable lands. The shaggy common, now closed and part of the estate, covered the western slope, and the cultivated land was bounded on the east by the sharp dip of the brook course, a thread of woodland broadening into a spinney and ending at the upper pond; beyond this, on the east, rose the sharp, wild, grassy hillside, scattered with old trees, ruinous with the gaunt, ragged bones of old hedge-rows, grown into thorn trees. Along the rim of the hills, beginning in the northwest, were dark woodlands, which swept round east and south till they raced down in riot to the very edge of southern Nethermere, surrounding our house. From the eastern hill crest, looking straight across, you could see the spire of Selsby Church, and a few roofs, and the head-stocks of the pit.

So on three sides the farm was skirted by woods, the dens of rabbits, and the common held another warren.

Now the squire of the estate, head of an ancient, once even famous, but now decayed house, loved his rabbits. Unlike the family fortunes, the family tree flourished amazingly; Sherwood could show nothing comparable. Its ramifications were stupendous; it was more like a banyan than a British oak. How was the good squire to nourish himself and his lady, his name, his tradition, and his thirteen lusty branches on his meagre estates? An evil fortune discovered to him that he could sell each of his rabbits, those bits of furry vermin, for a shilling or thereabouts in Nottingham; since which time the noble family subsisted by rabbits.

Farms were gnawed away; corn and sweet grass departed from the face of the hills; cattle grew lean, unable to eat the defiled herbage. Then the farm became the home of a keeper, and the country was silent, with no sound of cattle, no clink of horses, no barking of lusty dogs.

But the squire loved his rabbits. He defended them against the snares of the despairing farmer, protected them with gun and notices to quit. How he glowed with thankfulness as he saw the dishevelled hillside heave when the gnawing hosts moved on!

""Are they not quails and manna?"" said he to his sporting guest, early one Monday morning, as the high meadow broke into life at the sound of his gun. ""Quails and manna—in this wilderness?""

""They are, by Jove!"" assented the sporting guest as he took another gun, while the saturnine keeper smiled grimly.

Meanwhile, Strelley Mill began to suffer under this gangrene. It was the outpost in the wilderness. It was an understood thing that none of the squire's tenants had a gun.

""Well,"" said the squire to Mr. Saxton, ""you have the land for next to nothing—next to nothing—at a rent really absurd. Surely the little that the rabbits eat——""

""It's not a little—come and look for yourself,"" replied the farmer. The squire made a gesture of impatience.

""What do you want?"" he inquired.

""Will you wire me off?"" was the repeated request.

""Wire is—what does Halkett say—so much per yard—and it would come to—what did Halkett tell me now?—but a large sum. No, I can't do it.""

""Well, I can't live like this.""

""Have another glass of whisky? Yes, yes, I want another glass myself, and I can't drink alone—so if I am to enjoy my glass.—That's it! Now surely you exaggerate a little. It's not so bad.""

""I can't go on like it, I'm sure.""

""Well, we'll see about compensation—we'll see. I'll have a talk with Halkett, and I'll come down and have a look at you. We all find a pinch somewhere—it's nothing but humanity's heritage.""

I was born in September, and love it best of all the months. There is no heat, no hurry, no thirst and weariness in corn harvest as there is in the hay. If the season is late, as is usual with us, then mid-September sees the corn still standing in stook. The mornings come slowly. The earth is like a woman married and fading; she does not leap up with a laugh for the first fresh kiss of dawn, but slowly, quietly, unexpectantly lies watching the waking of each new day. The blue mist, like memory in the eyes of a neglected wife, never goes from the wooded hill, and only at noon creeps from the near hedges. There is no bird to put a song in the throat of morning; only the crow's voice speaks during the day. Perhaps there is the regular breathing hush of the scythe—even the fretful jar of the mowing machine. But next day, in the morning, all is still again. The lying corn is wet, and when you have bound it, and lift the heavy sheaf to make the stook, the tresses of oats wreathe round each other and droop mournfully.

As I worked with my friend through the still mornings we talked endlessly. I would give him the gist of what I knew of chemistry, and botany, and psychology. Day after day I told him what the professors had told me; of life, of sex and its origins; of Schopenhauer and William James. We had been friends for years, and he was accustomed to my talk. But this autumn fruited the first crop of intimacy between us. I talked a great deal of poetry to him, and of rudimentary metaphysics. He was very good stuff. He had hardly a single dogma, save that of pleasing himself. Religion was nothing to him. So he heard all I had to say with an open mind, and understood the drift of things very rapidly, and quickly made these ideas part of himself.

We tramped down to dinner with only the clinging warmth of the sunshine for a coat. In this still, enfolding weather a quiet companionship is very grateful. Autumn creeps through everything. The little damsons in the pudding taste of September, and are fragrant with memory. The voices of those at table are softer and more reminiscent than at haytime.

Afternoon is all warm and golden. Oat sheaves are lighter; they whisper to each other as they freely embrace. The long, stout stubble tinkles as the foot brushes over it; the scent of the straw is sweet. When the poor, bleached sheaves are lifted out of the hedge, a spray of nodding wild raspberries is disclosed, with belated berries ready to drop; among the damp grass lush blackberries may be discovered. Then one notices that the last bell hangs from the ragged spire of fox-glove. The talk is of people, an odd book; of one's hopes—and the future; of Canada, where work is strenuous, but not life; where the plains are wide, and one is not lapped in a soft valley, like an apple that falls in a secluded orchard. The mist steals over the face of the warm afternoon. The tying-up is all finished, and it only remains to rear up the fallen bundles into shocks. The sun sinks into a golden glow in the west. The gold turns to red, the red darkens, like a fire burning low, the sun disappears behind the bank of milky mist, purple like the pale bloom on blue plums, and we put on our coats and go home.
———

In the evening, when the milking was finished, and all the things fed, then we went out to look at the snares. We wandered on across the stream and up the wild hillside. Our feet rattled through black patches of devil's-bit scabius; we skirted a swim of thistle-down, which glistened when the moon touched it. We stumbled on through wet, coarse grass, over soft mole-hills and black rabbit-holes. The hills and woods cast shadows; the pools of mist in the valleys gathered the moonbeams in cold, shivery light.

We came to an old farm that stood on the level brow of the hill. The woods swept away from it, leaving a great clearing of what was once cultivated land. The handsome chimneys of the house, silhouetted against a light sky, drew my admiration. I noticed that there was no light or glow in any window, though the house had only the width of one room, and though the night was only at eight o'clock. We looked at the long, impressive front. Several of the windows had been bricked in, giving a pitiful impression of blindness; the places where the plaster had fallen off the walls showed blacker in the shadow. We pushed open the gate, and as we walked down the path, weeds and dead plants brushed our ankles. We looked in at a window. The room was lighted also by a window from the other side, through which the moonlight streamed on to the flagged floor, dirty, littered with paper, and wisps of straw. The hearth lay in the light, with all its distress of grey ashes, and piled cinders of burnt paper, and a child's headless doll, charred and pitiful. On the border-line of shadow lay a round fur cap—a game-keeper's cap. I blamed the moonlight for entering the desolate room; the darkness alone was decent and reticent. I hated the little roses on the illuminated piece of wallpaper, I hated that fireside.

With farmer's instinct George turned to the outhouse. The cow-yard startled me. It was a forest of the tallest nettles I have ever seen—nettles far taller than my six feet. The air was soddened with the dank scent of nettles. As I followed George along the obscure brick path, I felt my flesh creep. But the buildings, when we entered them, were in splendid condition; they had been restored within a small number of years; they were well-timbered, neat, and cosy. Here and there we saw feathers, bits of animal wreckage, even the remnants of a cat, which we hastily examined by the light of a match. As we entered the stable there was an ugly noise, and three great rats half rushed at us and threatened us with their vicious teeth. I shuddered, and hurried back, stumbling over a bucket, rotten with rust, and so filled with weeds that I thought it part of the jungle. There was a silence made horrible by the faint noises that rats and flying bats give out. The place was bare of any vestige of corn or straw or hay, only choked with a growth of abnormal weeds. When I found myself free in the orchard I could not stop shivering. There were no apples to be seen overhead between us and the clear sky. Either the birds had caused them to fall, when the rabbits had devoured them, or someone had gathered the crop.


""This,"" said George bitterly, ""is what the mill will come to.""

""After your time,"" I said.

""My time—my time. I shall never have a time. And I shouldn't be surprised if father's time isn't short—with rabbits and one thing and another. As it is, we depend on the milk-round, and on the carting which I do for the council. You can't call it farming. We're a miserable mixture of farmer, milkman, greengrocer, and carting contractor. It's a shabby business.""

""You have to live,"" I retorted.

""Yes—but it's rotten. And father won't move—and he won't change his methods.""

""Well—what about you?""

""Me! What should I change for?—I'm comfortable at home. As for my future, it can look after itself, so long as nobody depends on me.""

""Laissez faire,"" said I, smiling.

""This is no laissez faire,"" he replied, glancing round, ""this is pulling the nipple out of your lips, and letting the milk run away sour. Look there!""

Through the thin veil of moonlit mist that slid over the hillside we could see an army of rabbits bunched up, or hopping a few paces forward, feeding.

We set off at a swinging pace down the hill, scattering the hosts. As we approached the fence that bounded the Mill fields, he exclaimed, ""Hullo!""—and hurried forward. I followed him, and observed the dark figure of a man rise from the hedge. It was a game-keeper. He pretended to be examining his gun. As we came up he greeted us with a calm ""Good-evenin'!""

George replied by investigating the little gap in the hedge.

""I'll trouble you for that snare,"" he said.

""Will yer?"" answered Annable, a broad, burly, black-faced fellow. ""An' I should like ter know what you're doin' on th' wrong side th' 'edge?""

""You can see what we're doing—hand over my snare—and the rabbit,"" said George angrily.

""What rabbit?"" said Annable, turning sarcastically to me.

""You know well enough—an' you can hand it over—or——"" George replied.

""Or what? Spit it out! The sound won't kill me""—the man grinned with contempt.

""Hand over here!"" said George, stepping up to the man in a rage.

""Now don't!"" said the keeper, standing stock still, and looking unmovedly at the proximity of George:

""You'd better get off home—both you an' 'im. You'll get neither snare nor rabbit—see!""

""We will see!"" said George, and he made a sudden move to get hold of the man's coat. Instantly he went staggering back with a heavy blow under the left ear.

""Damn brute!"" I ejaculated, bruising my knuckles against the fellow's jaw. Then I too found myself sitting dazedly on the grass, watching the great skirts of his velveteens flinging round him as if he had been a demon, as he strode away. I got up, pressing my chest where I had been struck. George was lying in the hedge-bottom. I turned him over, and rubbed his temples, and shook the drenched grass on his face. He opened his eyes and looked at me, dazed. Then he drew his breath quickly, and put his hand to his head.

""He—he nearly stunned me,"" he said.

""The devil!"" I answered.

""I wasn't ready.""

""No.""

""Did he knock me down?""

""Ay—me too.""

He was silent for some time, sitting limply. Then he pressed his hand against the back of his head, saying, ""My head does sing!"" He tried to get

up, but failed. ""Good God!—being knocked into this state by a damned keeper!""


""Come on,"" I said, ""let's see if we can't get indoors.""

""No!"" he said quickly, ""we needn't tell them—don't let them know.""

I sat thinking of the pain in my own chest, and wishing I could remember hearing Annable's jaw smash, and wishing that my knuckles were more bruised than they were—though that was bad enough. I got up, and helped George to rise. He swayed, almost pulling me over. But in a while he could walk unevenly.

""Am I,"" he said, ""covered with clay and stuff?""

""Not much,"" I replied, troubled by the shame and confusion with which he spoke.

""Get it off,"" he said, standing still to be cleaned.

I did my best. Then we walked about the fields for a time, gloomy, silent, and sore.

Suddenly, as we went by the pond-side, we were startled by great, swishing black shadows that swept just above our heads. The swans were flying up for shelter, now that a cold wind had begun to fret Nethermere. They swung down on to the glassy mill-pond, shaking the moonlight in flecks across the deep shadows; the night rang with the clacking of their wings on the water; the stillness and calm were broken; the moonlight was furrowed and scattered, and broken. The swans, as they sailed into shadow, were dim, haunting spectres; the wind found us shivering.

""Don't—you won't say anything?"" he asked as I was leaving him.

""No.""

""Nothing at all—not to anybody?""

""No.""

""Good-night.""

———

About the end of September, our countryside was alarmed by the harrying of sheep by strange dogs. One morning, the squire, going the round of his fields as was his custom, to his grief and horror found two of his sheep torn and dead in the hedge-bottom, and the rest huddled in a corner swaying about in terror, smeared with blood. The squire did not recover his spirits for days.

There was a report of two grey wolvish dogs. The squire's keeper had heard yelping in the fields of Dr. Collins of the Abbey, about dawn. Three sheep lay soaked in blood when the labourer went to tend the flocks.

Then the farmers took alarm. Lord, of the White House farm, intended to put his sheep in pen, with his dogs in charge. It was Saturday, however, and the lads ran off to the little travelling theatre that had halted at Westwold. While they sat open-mouthed in the theatre, gloriously nicknamed the ""Blood-Tub,"" watching heroes die with much writhing and heaving, and struggling up to say a word, and collapsing without having said it, six of their silly sheep were slaughtered in the field. At every house it was enquired of the dog; nowhere had one been loose.

Mr. Saxton had some thirty sheep on the Common. George determined that the easiest thing was for him to sleep out with them. He built a shelter of hurdles interlaced with brushwood, and in the sunny afternoon we collected piles of bracken, browning to the ruddy winter-brown now. He slept there for a week, but that week aged his mother like a year. She was out in the cold morning twilight watching, with her apron over her head, for his approach. She did not rest with the thought of him out on the Common.

Therefore, on Saturday night he brought down his rugs, and took up Gyp to watch in his stead. For some time we sat looking at the stars over the dark hills. Now and then a sheep coughed, or a rabbit rustled beneath the brambles, and Gyp whined. The mist crept over the gorse-bushes, and the webs on the brambles were white;—the devil throws his net over the blackberries as soon as September's back is turned, they say.

""I saw two fellows go by with bags and nets,"" said George, as we sat looking out of his little shelter.

""Poachers,"" said I. ""Did you speak to them?""

""No—they didn't see me. I was dropping asleep when a rabbit rushed under the blanket, all of a shiver, and a whippet dog after it. I gave the whippet a punch in the neck, and he yelped off. The rabbit stopped with me quite a long time—then it went.""

""How did you feel?""

""I didn't care. I don't care much what happens just now. Father could get along without me, and mother has the children. I think I shall emigrate.""

""Why didn't you before?""

""Oh, I don't know. There are a lot of little comforts and interests at home that one would miss. Besides, you feel somebody in your own countryside, and you're nothing in a foreign part, I expect.""

""But you're going?""

""What is there to stop here for? The valley is all running wild and unprofitable. You've no freedom for thinking of what the other folks think of you, and everything round you keeps the same, and so you can't change yourself—because everything you look at brings up the same old feeling, and stops you from feeling fresh things. And what is there that's worth anything?—What's worth having in my life?""

""I thought,"" said I, ""your comfort was worth having.""

He sat still and did not answer.

""What's shaken you out of your nest?"" I asked.

""I don't know. I've not felt the same since that row with Annable. And Lettie said to me: 'Here, you can't live as you like—in any way or circumstance. You're like a bit out of those coloured marble mosaics in the hall, you have to fit in your own set, fit into your own pattern, because you're put there from the first. But you don't want to be like a fixed bit of a mosaic—you want to fuse into life, and melt and mix with the rest of folk, to have some things burned out of you——' She was downright serious.""
""Well, you need not believe her. When did you see her?""

""She came down on Wednesday, when I was getting the apples in the morning. She climbed a tree with me, and there was a wind, that was why I was getting all the apples, and it rocked us, me right up at the top, she sitting half way down holding the basket. I asked her didn't she think that free kind of life was the best, and that was how she answered me.""

""You should have contradicted her.""

""It seemed true. I never thought of it being wrong, in fact.""

""Come—that sounds bad.""


""No—I thought she looked down on us—on our way of life. I thought she meant I was like a toad in a hole.""

""You should have shown her different.""

""How could I when I could see no different?""

""It strikes me you're in love.""

He laughed at the idea, saying, ""No, but it is rotten to find that there isn't a single thing you have to be proud of.""

""This is a new tune for you.""

He pulled the grass moodily.

""And when do you think of going?""

""Oh—I don't know—I've said nothing to mother. Not yet,—at any rate not till spring.""

""Not till something has happened,"" said I.

""What?"" he asked.


""Something decisive.""

""I don't know what can happen—unless the Squire turns us out.""

""No?"" I said.

He did not speak.

""You should make things happen,"" said I.

""Don't make me feel a worse fool, Cyril,"" he replied despairingly.

Gyp whined and jumped, tugging her chain to follow us. The grey blurs among the blackness of the bushes were resting sheep. A chill, dim mist crept along the ground.

""But, for all that, Cyril,"" he said, ""to have her laugh at you across the table; to hear her sing as she moved about, before you are washed at night, when the fire's warm, and you're tired; to have her sit by you on the hearth seat, close and soft. . . .""

""In Spain,"" I said. ""In Spain.""

He took no notice, but turned suddenly, laughing.

""Do you know, when I was stooking up, lifting the sheaves, it felt like having your arm round a girl. It was quite a sudden sensation.""

""You'd better take care,"" said I, ""you'll mesh yourself in the silk of dreams, and then——""

He laughed, not having heard my words.

""The time seems to go like lightning—thinking"" he confessed—""I seem to sweep the mornings up in a handful.""

""Oh, Lord!"" said I. ""Why don't you scheme forgetting what you want, instead of dreaming fulfilments?""

""Well,"" he replied. ""If it was a fine dream, wouldn't you want to go on dreaming?"" and with that he finished, and I went home.

I sat at my window looking out, trying to get things straight. Mist rose, and wreathed round Nethermere, like ghosts meeting and embracing sadly. I thought of the time when my friend should not follow the harrow on our own snug valley side, and when Lettie's room next mine should be closed to hide its emptiness, not its joy. My heart clung passionately to the hollow which held us all; how could I bear that it should be desolate! I wondered what Lettie would do.

In the morning I was up early, when daybreak came with a shiver through the woods. I went out, while the moon still shone sickly in the west. The world shrank from the morning. It was then that the last of the summer things died. The wood was dark,—and smelt damp and heavy with autumn. On the paths the leaves lay clogged.

As I came near the farm I heard the yelling of dogs. Running, I reached the Common, and saw the sheep huddled and scattered in groups, something leaped round them. George burst into sight pursuing. Directly, there was the bang, bang of a gun. I picked up a heavy piece of sandstone and ran forwards. Three sheep scattered wildly before me. In the dim light I saw their grey shadows move among the gorse bushes. Then a dog leaped, and I flung my stone with all my might. I hit. There came a high-pitched howling yelp of pain; I saw the brute make off, and went after him, dodging the prickly bushes, leaping the trailing brambles. The gunshots rang out again, and I heard the men shouting with excitement. My dog was out of sight, but I followed still, slanting down the hill. In a field ahead I saw someone running. Leaping the low hedge, I pursued, and overtook Emily, who was hurrying as fast as she could through the wet grass. There was another gunshot and great shouting. Emily glanced round, saw me, and started.

""It's gone to the quarries,"" she panted. We walked on, without saying a word. Skirting the spinney, we followed the brook course, and came at last to the quarry fence. The old excavations were filled now with trees. The steep walls, twenty feet deep in places, were packed with loose stones, and trailed with hanging brambles. We climbed down the steep bank of the brook, and entered the quarries by the bed of the stream. Under the groves of ash and oak a pale primrose still lingered, glimmering wanly beside the hidden water. Emily found a smear of blood on a beautiful trail of yellow convolvulus. We followed the tracks on to the open, where the brook flowed on the hard rock bed, and the stony floor of the quarry was only a tangle of gorse and bramble and honeysuckle.

""Take a good stone,"" said I, and we pressed on, where the grove in the great excavation darkened again, and the brook slid secretly under the arms of the bushes and the hair of the long grass. We beat the cover almost to the road. I thought the brute had escaped, and I pulled a bunch of mountain-ash berries, and stood tapping them against my knee. I was startled by a snarl and a little scream. Running forward, I came upon one of the old, horse-shoe lime kilns that stood at the head of the quarry. There, in the mouth of one of the kilns, Emily was kneeling on the dog, her hands buried in the hair of its throat, pushing back its head. The little jerks of the brute's body were the spasms of death; already the eyes were turning inward, and the upper lip was drawn from the teeth by pain.

""Good Lord, Emily! But he is dead!"" exclaimed.

""Has he hurt you?"" I drew her away. She shuddered violently, and seemed to feel a horror of herself.

""No—no,"" she said, looking at herself, with blood all on her skirt, where she had knelt on the wound which I had given the dog, and pressed the broken rib into the chest. There was a trickle of blood on her arm.

""Did he bite you?"" I asked, anxious.

""No—oh, no—I just peeped in, and he jumped. But he had no strength, and I hit him back with my stone, and I lost my balance, and fell on him.""

""Let me wash your arm.""

""Oh!"" she exclaimed, ""isn't it horrible! Oh, I think it is so awful.""

""What?"" said I, busy bathing her arm in the cold water of the brook.

""This—this whole brutal affair.""

""It ought to be cauterised,"" said I, looking at a score on her arm from the dog's tooth.

""That scratch—that's nothing! Can you get that off my skirt—I feel hateful to myself.""

I washed her skirt with my handkerchief as well as I could, saying:

""Let me just sear it for you; we can go to the Kennels. Do—you ought—I don't feel safe otherwise.""

""Really,"" she said, glancing up at me, a smile coming into her fine dark eyes.

""Yes—come along.""

""Ha, ha!"" she laughed. ""You look so serious.""

I took her arm and drew her away. She linked her arm in mine and leaned on me.

""It is just like Lorna Doone,"" she said as if she enjoyed it.

""But you will let me do it,"" said I, referring to the cauterising.

""You make me; but I shall feel—ugh, I daren't think of it. Get me some of those berries.""

I plucked a few bunches of guelder-rose fruits, transparent, ruby berries. She stroked them softly against her lips and cheek, caressing them. Then she murmured to herself:

""I have always wanted to put red berries in my hair.""

The shawl she had been wearing was thrown across her shoulders, and her head was bare, and her black hair, soft and short and ecstatic, tumbled wildly into loose light curls. She thrust the stalks of the berries under her combs. Her hair was not heavy or long enough to have held them. Then, with the ruby bunches glowing through the black mist of curls, she looked up at me, brightly, with wide eyes. I looked at her, and felt the smile winning into her eyes. Then I turned and dragged a trail of golden-leaved convolvulus from the hedge, and I twisted it into a coronet for her.

""There!"" said I, ""you're crowned.""

She put back her head, and the low laughter shook in her throat.

""What!"" she asked, putting all the courage and recklessness she had into the question, and in her soul trembling.

""Not Chloë, not Bacchante. You have always got your soul in your eyes, such an earnest, troublesome soul.""

The laughter faded at once, and her great seriousness looked out again at me, pleading.

""You are like Burne-Jones' damsels. Troublesome shadows are always crowding across your eyes, and you cherish them. You think the flesh of the apple is nothing, nothing. You only care for the eternal pips. Why don't you snatch your apple and eat it, and throw the core away?""

She looked at me sadly, not understanding, but believing that I in my wisdom spoke truth, as she always believed when I lost her in a maze of words. She stooped down, and the chaplet fell from her hair, and only one bunch of berries remained. The ground around us was strewn with the four-lipped burrs of beechnuts, and the quaint little nut-pyramids were scattered among the ruddy fallen leaves. Emily gathered a few nuts.

""I love beechnuts,"" she said, ""but they make me long for my childhood again till I could almost cry out. To go out for beechnuts before breakfast; to thread them for necklaces before supper;—to be the envy of the others at school next day! There was as much pleasure in a beech necklace then as there is in the whole autumn now—and no sadness. There are no more unmixed joys after you have grown up."" She kept her face to the ground as she spoke, and she continued to gather the fruits.

""Do you find any with nuts in?"" I asked.

""Not many—here—here are two, three. You have them. No—I don't care about them.""

I stripped one of its horny brown coat and gave it to her. She opened her mouth slightly to take it, looking up into my eyes. Some people, instead of bringing with them clouds of glory, trail clouds of sorrow; they are born with ""the gift of sorrow""; ""sorrows"" they proclaim ""alone are real. The veiled grey angels of sorrow work out slowly the beautiful shapes. Sorrow is beauty, and the supreme blessedness."" You read it in their eyes, and in the tones of their voices. Emily had the gift of sorrow. It fascinated me, but it drove me to rebellion.

We followed the soft, smooth-bitten turf road under the old beeches. The hillside fell away, dishevelled with thistles and coarse grass. Soon we were in sight of the Kennels, the red old Kennels which had been the scene of so much animation in the time of Lord Byron. They were empty now, overgrown with weeds. The barred windows of the cottages were grey with dust; there was no need now to protect the windows from cattle, dog or man. One of the three houses was inhabited. Clear water trickled through a wooden runnel into a great stone trough outside near the door.

""Come here,"" said I to Emily. ""Let me fasten the back of your dress.""

""Is it undone?"" she asked, looking quickly over her shoulder, and blushing.

As I was engaged in my task, a girl came out of the cottage with a black kettle and a tea-cup. She was so surprised to see me thus occupied that she forgot her own duty, and stood open-mouthed.

""S'r Ann! S'r Ann,"" called a voice from inside. ""Are ter goin' ter come in an' shut that door?""

Sarah Ann hastily poured a few cupfuls of water into the kettle, then she put down both utensils and stood holding her bare arms to warm them. Her chief garment consisted of a skirt with grey bodice and red flannel skirt, very much torn. Her black hair hung in wild tails on to her shoulders.

""We must go in here,"" said I, approaching the girl. She, however, hastily seized the kettle and ran indoors with an ""Oh, mother!""

A woman came to the door. One breast was bare, and hung over her blouse, which, like a dressing-jacket, fell loose over her skirt. Her fading, red-brown hair was all frowsy from the bed. In the folds of her skirt clung a swarthy urchin with a shockingly short shirt. He stared at us with big black eyes, the only portion of his face undecorated with egg and jam. The woman's blue eyes questioned us languidly. I told her our errand.

""Come in—come in,"" she said, ""but dunna look at th' 'ouse. Th' childers not been long up. Go in, Billy, wi' nowt on!""

We entered, taking the forgotten kettle lid. The kitchen was large, but scantily furnished save, indeed, for children. The eldest, a girl of twelve or so, was standing toasting a piece of bacon with one hand, and holding back her nightdress in the other. As the toast hand got scorched, she transferred the bacon to the other, gave the hot fingers a lick to cool them, and then held back her nightdress again. Her auburn hair hung in heavy coils down her gown. A boy sat on the steel fender, catching the dropping fat on a piece of bread. ""One, two, three, four, five, six drops,"" and he quickly bit off the tasty corner, and resumed the task with the other hand. When we entered he tried to draw his shirt over his knees, which caused the fat to fall wasted. A fat baby, evidently laid down from the breast, lay kicking on the squab, purple in the face, while another lad was pushing bread and butter into its mouth. The mother swept to the sofa, poked out the bread and butter, pushed her finger into the baby's throat, lifted the child up, punched its back, and was highly relieved when it began to yell. Then she administered a few sound spanks to the naked buttocks of the crammer. He began to howl, but stopped suddenly on seeing us laughing. On the sack-cloth which served as hearth rug sat a beautiful child washing the face of a wooden doll with tea, and wiping it on her nightgown. At the table, an infant in a high chair sat sucking a piece of bacon, till the grease ran down his swarthy arms, oozing through his fingers. An old lad stood in the big arm-chair, whose back was hung with a calf-skin, and was industriously pouring the dregs of the teacups into a basin of milk. The mother whisked away the milk, and made a rush for the urchin, the baby hanging over her arm the while.

""I could half kill thee,"" she said, but he had slid under the table,—and sat serenely unconcerned.

""Could you""—I asked when the mother had put her bonny baby again to her breast—""could you lend me a knitting needle?""

""Our S'r Ann, wheer's thy knittin' needles?"" asked the woman, wincing at the same time, and putting her hand to the mouth of the sucking child. Catching my eye, she said:

""You wouldn't credit how he bites. 'E's nobbut two teeth, but they like six needles."" She drew her brows together and pursed her lips, saying to the child, ""Naughty lad, naughty lad! Tha' shanna hae it, no, not if ter bites thy mother like that.""

The family interest was now divided between us and the private concerns in process when we entered;—save, however, that the bacon sucker had sucked on stolidly, immovable, all the time.


""Our Sam, wheer's my knittin', tha's 'ad it?"" cried S'r Ann after a little search.

""'A 'e na,"" replied Sam from under the table.

""Yes, tha' 'as,"" said the mother, giving a blind prod under the table with her foot.

""'A 'e na then!"" persisted Sam.

The mother suggested various possible places of discovery, and at last the knitting was found at the back of the table drawer, among forks and old wooden skewers.

""I 'an ter tell yer wheer ivrythink is,"" said the mother in mild reproach. S'r Ann, however, gave no heed to her parent. Her heart was torn for her knitting, the fruit of her labours; it was a red woollen cuff for the winter; a corkscrew was bored through the web, and the ball of red wool was bristling with skewers.

""It's a' thee, our Sam,"" she wailed. ""I know it's a' thee an' thy A. B. C.""

Samuel, under the table, croaked out in a voice of fierce monotony:

""P. is for Porkypine, whose bristles so strong


Kill the bold lion by pricking 'is tongue.""

The mother began to shake with quiet laughter.

""His father learnt him that—made it all up,"" she whispered proudly to us—and to him.

""Tell us what 'B' is Sam.""

""Shonna,"" grunted Sam.

""Go on, there's a duckie; an' I'll ma' 'e a treacle puddin'.""

""Today?"" asked S'r Ann eagerly.

""Go on, Sam, my duck,"" persisted the mother.

""Tha' 'as na got no treacle,"" said Sam conclusively.

The needle was in the fire; the children stood about watching.

""Will you do it yourself?"" I asked Emily.

""I!"" she exclaimed, with wide eyes of astonishment, and she shook her head emphatically.

""Then I must."" I took out the needle, holding it in my handkerchief. I took her hand and examined the wound. But when she saw the hot glow of the needle, she snatched away her hand, and looked into my eyes, laughing in a half-hysterical fear and shame. I was very serious, very insistent. She yielded me her hand again, biting her lips in imagination of the pain, and looking at me. While my eyes were looking into hers she had courage; when I was forced to pay attention to my cauterising, she glanced down, and with a sharp ""Ah!"" ending in a little laugh, she put her hands behind her, and looked again up at me with wide brown eyes, all quivering with apprehension, and a little shame, and a laughter that held much pleading.

One of the children began to cry.

""It is no good,"" said I, throwing the fast cooling needle on to the hearth.

I gave the girls all the pennies I had—then I offered Sam, who had crept out of the shelter of the table, a sixpence.

""Shonna a'e that,"" he said, turning from the small coin.

""Well—I have no more pennies, so nothing will be your share.""

I gave the other boy a rickety knife I had in my pocket. Sam looked fiercely at me. Eager for revenge, he picked up the ""porkypine quill"" by the hot end. He dropped it with a shout of rage, and, seizing a cup off the table, flung it at the fortunate Jack. It smashed against the fire-place. The mother grabbed at Sam, but he was gone. A girl, a little girl, wailed, ""Oh, that's my rosey mug—my rosey mug."" We fled from the scene of confusion. Emily had hardly noticed it. Her thoughts were of herself, and of me.


""I am an awful coward,"" said she humbly.

""But I can't help it——"" she looked beseechingly.

""Never mind,"" said I.

""All my flesh seems to jump from it. You don't know how I feel.""

""Well—never mind.""

""I couldn't help it, not for my life.""

""I wonder,"" said I, ""if anything could possibly disturb that young bacon-sucker? He didn't even look round at the smash.""

""No,"" said she, biting the tip of her finger moodily.

Further conversation was interrupted by howls from the rear. Looking round we saw Sam careering after us over the close-bitten turf, howling scorn and derision at us. ""Rabbit-tail, rabbit-tail,"" he cried, his bare little legs twinkling, and his little shirt fluttering in the cold morning air. Fortunately, at last he trod on a thistle or a thorn, for when we looked round again to see why he was silent, he was capering on one leg, holding his wounded foot in his hands.",D. H.

66,Fade Into You,"[Verse 1]
I want to hold the hand inside you
I want to take a breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there

[Chorus]
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew

[Verse 2]
A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart

Now, um, underground's my style
To this I have vows
And I swear to my god
I'll always rock a crowd
So (um) peace to my area, N.W.K
Which is scarier
So if your on the deals
Who cares, the more the merrier
Now right off South Orange
On the block of one-nine
Of course, thirteenth ave
Is my stomping grounds
I open up my chest
And to my 'hood give my heart
Cause without the heart
Then your 'hood falls apart
So respect to the cement
The park called ""the Corner""
Cause that's where the DoItAlldo was performing
Runnin' from the cops
I couldn't be stopped
Cause I was jumpin' big gates that connected the blocks
Now before making records
The 'hood was my savior
But now I'm making tunes to make you jam wit 'cha neighbor

Half you rappers out there couldn't see me with binoculars
Anyone who thinks he'll take me out is just a dreamer
If you think you're the bomb, then I'm Hiroshima
When I die
I hope they're making records up in heaven
On a scale of one to ten
I'm like 100-5th-11
And sticks-and-stones-may-break-my-bones
But if you ever try to diss the Lords, then it's on
Now I go on beat...
Off beat...
Then jump right back on time
I drop another rhyme
And talk about your fat ugly mama (EEWWW!!)
M.C.'s cannot rock me
I'm stone-proof
Me grabbin' the mic
Is like Superman running to a phone booth
Straight from Martin Luther King Boulevard
In the heart of Newark, New Jersey
Make you say ""Lord have mercy""
If you step up in my face
Then it's do or die
And I'm gonna make you cry (waaahhhhh!!)

Well, times have changed
Not only for the urban
But also for suburban
We get props, we're deservin'
From black kids, to white kids
I see them bob their heads
From the blonde hair, to redhead
I even seen a dread
So now it doesn't matter
As the clock winds down
With the tic and the toc
Because they love the sound
But people 'round your area
Say you sell out
Because you sell a million copies
And your tone goes BAAAAOOWW!
So do it for yourself
And do it for the 'hood
But do it from the heart
Cause that's when it's good
Now tell me what's gonna happen
After the rappin'
When the clock ticks away
And ain't nothin' happenin'...

[Verse 4: Mr. Funke]
I remember way back in the days on my block
When the kids used to meet up in the hallway and rock
On Martin Luther King's boulevard
With P.C., wise, Easy Ed, and my brother hard Bernard
Used to hit the ill rhymes from the head
While I'd hit the beat on the wall until my hands turned red
You had the Shorty two MC's
The Educated Three
I have to give them props for helping me be me
Now I'm the one who's educated
I suffered but I made it
I only write rhymes that will be appreciated
No matter how large I get
The fire still burns
Cause from the 'hood I came
And to the 'hood I must return

Don't say good...don't say goodbye, girl
Hey, take a look inside and read my mind, girl

Don't leave me crying, crying
Don't say goodbye, girl
Take a look inside and read my mind, girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying, crying
Don't say goodbye, girl

75,Biological Didn't Bother,"Yo, Yo
I want to dedicate this song to Philip Arthur Harrison
Word up
Cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he is my father cause my biological didn't bother

[Verse 1]
Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but you're not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad
So we left you with no remorsal pity
Took the first bus from Newark to Jersey City
Woman and child alone, now that's pressure
Moms got to go to work, drop me off by Obesa
Momma, Aunt DeDe, whoever
Aunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together
A year went by and I could walk y'all
Moms got that good ol job at city hall
She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Moms offered him a million dollar package deal
She said you want me you gotta take my son
Or else its like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

[Hook]
Took me from a boy to a man
So I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother (4x)

[Verse 2]
January 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)
He joined the army we moved to fort Monmouth
He disciplined me right from the get go
Age 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let go
Actin spoiled, rotten, trippin
Got a butt whippin because I didn't listen
Back then you see privates made no bucks
Had to get another job driven trucks
Workin hard as hell didn't satisfy him
Had to another job working at the gym
He wasn't ""Gone with the Wind"" like Clark Gable
Work all them jobs to put food on the table
Phil's my father, daddy and thats the scoop
Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops
Come on he put me under his wing
Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team
Sometimes he even made me mad
But it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dad
But a little bit better
Encouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters
I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard
Got to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report card
All types, all sorts
Disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports
I learned to dribble from right to left
I couldn't do a damn thang with all them F's
Age 15 father and son confrontation that's nothin
But father and son trials and tribulation
Back then I could under stand but I'm glad you did it
Cause now I'm a man
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

(chorus)

[Verse 3]
Look at me now successful for sure
Phil raised me well, to be an entrepreneur
And if you're making big dope be materialistic
Cause you'll end up another statistic
Everything's going well following my dreams
I dunked on Patrick Ewing
I want the ring like Hakeem
Uh oh what do you know
Biological ones on the Ricky Lake show
What does he want, does he want money
What people do for money!!!
It's kinda funny to me
He ain't gettin no check from me (check it)
He can go on all the talk shows he want
Phil is my dad so don't even front
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

76,I Apologize,"[Verse 1]
Operator, get my baby on the line
'Cause just the other night
We had a horrible fight
I admit that I, I was out of control
But I still love my man
With my body and soul

[Pre-Chorus]
When the road gets rough
You say thangs you should not say
I never meant to treat my baby that way

And so I'll sing you this song
And I'm tryna get through

And Lord you should have heard
The way he shouted and the way that I screamed
I regret it 'cause I was unfair
I took it all out on him
Just because he was there

When the road gets rough
You say thangs you should not say
I never meant to treat my daddy that way

Erase the good-byes
And rewrite my life
But come rain or come shine

That's why I'm singing my my my song

77,Picture Postcards From L.A.,"I'm the piano player down at Eddie's bar
And Rachel she's the waitress who wants to be a star
She swears she's gonna make it, make it big someday
And she'll send me picture postcards from L.A

When it's time for closing, I play while Rachel cleans
She listens to my music, I listen to her dreams
She swears she's gonna make it, she's going all the way
And I say, ""Send me picture postcards from L.A

""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""

When Rachel shares my pillow she always asks me things
Like do I really think she's pretty, do I like the way she sings?
I don't know how to answer, so I always smile and say
I say, ""Send me picture postcards from L.A

""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""

Sometimes Rachel stands up in the middle of the bar
And does a scene from the late show
We all clap our hands as she puts her apron on
And says, ""Next week, I'm gonna go.""

She'll even buy a ticket and pack her things to leave
Though we all know the story we pretend that we believe
But something always comes up, something always makes her stay
And still no picture postcards from L.A

""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""

78,Whutcha Want?,"[Verse 1]
I gets banned if I do gets banned if I don't
So sometimes I will and sometimes I won't
Puff mad stick crack a forty down the back
Sit fat and relax and plan my attack
Not the one to test I possess mad finesse
My Buddha was blessed one bird in the nest
Chills with my peeps steady bouncing in Jeeps
On the New York streets hittin' urban concrete
I'm the man untestable, with the extra-
Terrestrial flow, Four Fifty Six Cee-Lo
Pop the top off the forty ounce bottle
I'm not the one to follow, I'm not the role model
Hollow tips in my clips money grip and my Glock
Only spits when I react to the bullshit
So give me room to breathe and get up off DEEZ
And save the confessions for JEESuz
Plus I don't need to hear no sorrow
Eff it, the sun will still come out tomorrow
Long as I'm breathing, needing, even like
Steven, achieving, gettin some cheese and
Representin' lovely, Boogie Down Bronx major
With the project flavor, I made ya
Daze ya, my behavior is mad ill if you front
You know what I want!

[Chorus]
(Whutcha want Nine?) Fat beats for my rhymes
(So whutcha want Nine?) Mad clips for my nines
(So whutcha want Nine?) A ill posse
And my name up in lights, N-I-N-E

[Verse 2]
I'mma let you know how I feel on the real, I pack
Steel, it's like a jungle, makes me wonder where my heel hits the
Bricks, skips the dog shit, completin' my cipher
Temper like Rowdy Roddy Piper, hyper like a
Viper, I'mma strike if I gotta
Goin' for the jugular stretch you like a copper stoppah
Stoppah, but you can't stop me
Just clock me, just watch me blow up the spot G
Came a long way from back in the day
We did it for no pay, just rhymin' hit the hay and
Sleep, wake up, write another rhyme
Hit the park after dark, drop the beat one time
That's when shit was real, no phonies no bologna
Just a homie, mics and wheels of steel
Backup from the roof, amp plugged in the street light
Everything right, jam over: street fight
Back to the lab I grab my pen and pad
Raw lyrics make a sore and a scab
Had no dinero, enough get fo' chicken wings and rice
A forty ounce a nickel bag to get nice
And now I might make a million, and still son
It makes the heart pump, you know what I want

[Chorus]
(Whutcha want Nine?) Fat beats for my rhymes
(So whutcha want Nine?) Mad clips for my nines
(So whutcha want Nine?) A ill posse
And my name up in lights, N-I-N-E

[Verse 3]
Be like Elmer J. Fudd with the mansion and the yacht
Brand new Glock non-stop hip-hop
Remote control boombox lampin' on my dresser
The God ain't no lesser as the pressure comes to test ya
Hundred pound weight around the neck, daily
Nuff treasons, nuff reasons like Philip Bailey
Can't get enough of that funky stuff
Rhymin' astronomical, original, shit is phenomenal
Heat up the ghetto put the pedal to the metal
Speed like Racer treat you like a wack rhyme and erase ya
Right off the paper, roll a big fat spliff
Four-fifth on the hip, Heineken in the grip shit
I'm ready, get the keys for the Jeep, let's bounce
Cruise avenues, get some brews and sing the blues with the
Funkmaster Flex cassette in the deck
I'm in effect I move my neck while Son gets wreck
Oh what a feeling, I'm on the wheels of steel and
I snatch up some skins for some sexual healing
Erything's kosher copacetic, groovy hip-hop moves me
Soothes me, I'm letting off like an Uzi
But first steps a doozy and bruise me
Now I'm choosy before I start to freak it like a floozy
I wanna get big get paid true stunt
You know what I want!

That what you say is true
Everyday of my life, I'll be there through the night
And I'll give myself to you

The feelings that won't disappear
The magic you bring when you're near
Don't take that from me

You might be a redneck
If your dad walks you to school because your in the same grade...
You might be a redneck
If you've ever been too drunk to fish...

If somebody asks to see your ID and you show them your belt buckle..

If every day somebody comes to your house mistakenly thinking your having a
Yard sale

If you've ever had to haul a can of paint to the top of a water tower to defend
Your sister's honor..
You might be a redneck
If your dog and your wallet are both on a chain...

Real surprised when you get into the habit in St. Petersburg and say
""Y'all get into the truck, we goin up to the big house.""

If you've ever made change in the offering plate...

Now, you come to the south, we have words like...yu'nt to
We goin to the mall, yu'nt to?
What letter does that start with, does anybody know?
I like this word alot...aight
That's a word in Texas...aight
Round lunch time every day, you'll hear somebody say
""hey jeet yet, naw, dju? Yu'nt to? Aight.""

If you smoked during your wedding....

And it reminds you to pull your jeans up...

82,Pimp Of The Year,"[Intro]
Mack playas, ballas, grindas
Yeah I'm the real true pimp of the year
Will ya feel me
Ha ha, pimp of the mutha' fuckin' year

[Verse 1]
Give it up give it up a give it to me
A big mack capitalized Double D, see
And it's on, so I'ma get sick with it
A give me drank and bomb and let me get with it
Yeeyah, cause I'm gonna be the biggest pimp of the year
Goin' around doin' shit like this here
Cause a nigga is strong
And way too long when it comes to my ding dong
But, bet, I get a check when I sign on the dotted line
So now I know I gotta get mine
It's really no thang to me
See, to be a real true P.I.M.P
Cause I had me a ho or two or mo'
Way back in 80 fuckin' 4
That's when I was a teen
But my dick was still big to make a bitch bleed, see
And of coarse I'm slappin' hoes
Smackin' hoes, up and down the fuckin' avenues
And ever I do that
I dig a deep in the pocket for the fat gat
Feel me. I'm so goddamn bad
That I had to kick off in a ho's ass
Cause the girl tried to do me
Ride of with her man in the mustang pony
And I know it'd catch up with her
Next day in the paper, yeah, the nigga raped her
But I'm not trippin'
Bitches like you wanna keep on slippin'
So I had to move on
To the next young bitch that had it goin' on
Ugh, and I'm not here to pump no fear
I'm just the mack playa' pimp of the year, bitch

[Hook]
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies

[Verse 2]
First thang first on the second verse
I learned a hell of a lot
A get from the get down start
So I had my hoes hoin'
Had every tramp thinkin' I was the orthidano goin'
Cause all the game I spit is good shit
And the shit that I spit made me rich
Cause I was all about money
If the girl says she down, well bees come and get the honey
Cause I'm givin' it up quick
Take a hit, take a lick at them pink lips
Uh, and a bet is better than grey
Not knowin' that I bought this broad out of state
And I met her in Mentley
Lookin' just like the actress singer Whitney
But I knew she was a fake one
But to me young bra' it didn't really make me none
I just walked up to her
I said my name's Dru Down and I'll Slick Rick the ruler
And from the get go
I'm just a pimp, ho, ya comin' with me, a to the east side O
And then she said, ""Okay
I'm on my way, let me pack my bags before today""
Yeeyah, then I said, ""Get with it
And don't be a bitch and try to split""
Uh, She was right up under my wing
At the airport at 5:15
She said ""Who are you and why are ya here?""
I said I'm Dru Down and pimp of the year

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've got a thang for makin' hoes
Every woman that I touch bitch turns into gold
And I don't go for talk back
Have respect when ya speakin' to a pimp fuck that
Deduct from the paycheck
Matter of fact get yo ass in the back of the Cadillac
So I can ride and checkmate
Like rule number eight I keep a bitch in a plate
And no I don't play around, fuck around
A when it comes to my money, nigga
And when it comes to gettin' a bitch sprung
I give her Hennessy, a with the one on one
So she can get so high, real high
And that she that knows I'm that type a guy
Cause I'm a kick something just for the hoes
And for myself I keep indo'
And when a ho finds out I'm real, yes I am

94,Tremor Christ/Spin The Black Circle,"The Comet

He stood a moment on the steps of the bank, watching the human river that swirled down Broadway. Few noticed him. Few ever noticed him save in a way that stung. He was outside the world—""nothing!"" as he said bitterly. Bits of the words of the walkers came to him.

""The comet?""

""The comet——""

Everybody was talking of it. Even the president, as he entered, smiled patronizingly at him, and asked:

""Well, Jim, are you scared?""

""No,"" said the messenger shortly.

""I thought we'd journeyed through the comet's tail once,"" broke in the junior clerk affably.

""Oh, that was Halley's,"" said the president; ""this is a new comet, quite a stranger, they say—wonderful, wonderful! I saw it last night. Oh, by the way, Jim,"" turning again to the messenger, ""I want you to go down into the lower vaults today.""

The messenger followed the president silently. Of course, they wanted him to go down to the lower vaults. It was too dangerous for more valuable men. He smiled grimly and listened.

""Everything of value has been moved out since the water began to seep in,"" said the president; ""but we miss two volumes of old records. Suppose you nose around down there,—it isn't very pleasant, I suppose.""

""Not very,"" said the messenger, as he walked out.

""Well, Jim, the tail of the new comet hits us at noon this time,"" said the vault clerk, as he passed over the keys; but the messenger passed silently down the stairs. Down he went beneath Broadway, where the dim light filtered through the feet of hurrying men; down to the dark basement beneath; down into the blackness and silence beneath that lowest cavern. Here with his dark lantern he groped in the bowels of the earth, under the world.

He drew a long breath as he threw back the last great iron door and stepped into the fetid slime within. Here at last was peace, and he groped moodily forward. A great rat leaped past him and cobwebs crept across his face. He felt carefully around the room, shelf by shelf, on the muddied floor, and in crevice and corner. Nothing. Then he went back to the far end, where somehow the wall felt different. He sounded and pushed and pried. Nothing. He started away. Then something brought him back. He was sounding and working again when suddenly the whole black wall swung as on mighty hinges, and blackness yawned beyond. He peered in; it was evidently a secret vault—some hiding place of the old bank unknown in newer times. He entered hesitatingly. It was a long, narrow room with shelves, and at the far end, an old iron chest. On a high shelf lay the two missing volumes of records, and others. He put them carefully aside and stepped to the chest. It was old, strong, and rusty. He looked at the vast and old-fashioned lock and flashed his light on the hinges. They were deeply incrusted with rust. Looking about, he found a bit of iron and began to pry. The rust had eaten a hundred years, and it had gone deep. Slowly, wearily, the old lid lifted, and with a last, low groan lay bare its treasure—and he saw the dull sheen of gold!

""Boom!""

A low, grinding, reverberating crash struck upon his ear. He started up and looked about. All was black and still. He groped for his light and swung it about him. Then he knew! The great stone door had swung to. He forgot the gold and looked death squarely in the face. Then with a sigh he went methodically to work. The cold sweat stood on his forehead; but he searched, pounded, pushed, and worked until after what seemed endless hours his hand struck a cold bit of metal and the great door swung again harshly on its hinges, and then, striking against something soft and heavy, stopped. He had just room to squeeze through. There lay the body of the vault clerk, cold and stiff. He stared at it, and then felt sick and nauseated. The air seemed unaccountably foul, with a strong, peculiar odor. He stepped forward, clutched at the air, and fell fainting across the corpse.

He awoke with a sense of horror, leaped from the body, and groped up the stairs, calling to the guard. The watchman sat as if asleep, with the gate swinging free. With one glance at him the messenger hurried up to the sub-vault. In vain he called to the guards. His voice echoed and re-echoed weirdly. Up into the great basement he rushed. Here another guard lay prostrate on his face, cold and still. A fear arose in the messenger's heart. He dashed up to the cellar floor, up into the bank. The stillness of death lay everywhere and everywhere bowed, bent, and stretched the silent forms of men. The messenger paused and glanced about. He was not a man easily moved; but the sight was appalling! ""Robbery and murder,"" he whispered slowly to himself as he saw the twisted, oozing mouth of the president where he lay half-buried on his desk. Then a new thought seized him: If they found him here alone—with all this money and all these dead men—what would his life be worth? He glanced about, tiptoed cautiously to a side door, and again looked behind. Quietly he turned the latch and stepped out into Wall Street.

How silent the street was! Not a soul was stirring, and yet it was high-noon—Wall Street? Broadway? He glanced almost wildly up and down, then across the street, and as he looked, a sickening horror froze in his limbs. With a choking cry of utter fright he lunged, leaned giddily against the cold building, and stared helplessly at the sight.

In the great stone doorway a hundred men and women and children lay crushed and twisted and jammed, forced into that great, gaping doorway like refuse in a can—as if in one wild, frantic rush to safety, they had rushed and ground themselves to death. Slowly the messenger crept along the walls, wetting his parched mouth and trying to comprehend, stilling the tremor in his limbs and the rising terror in his heart. He met a business man, silk-hatted and frock-coated, who had crept, too, along that smooth wall and stood now stone dead with wonder written on his lips. The messenger turned his eyes hastily away and sought the curb. A woman leaned wearily against the signpost, her head bowed motionless on her lace and silken bosom. Before her stood a street car, silent, and within—but the messenger but glanced and hurried on. A grimy newsboy sat in the gutter with the ""last edition"" in his uplifted hand: ""Danger!"" screamed its black headlines. ""Warnings wired around the world. The Comet's tail sweeps past us at noon. Deadly gases expected. Close doors and windows. Seek the cellar."" The messenger read and staggered on. Far out from a window above, a girl lay with gasping face and sleevelets on her arms. On a store step sat a little, sweet-faced girl looking upward toward the skies, and in the carriage by her lay—but the messenger looked no longer. The cords gave way—the terror burst in his veins, and with one great, gasping cry he sprang desperately forward and ran,—ran as only the frightened run, shrieking and fighting the air until with one last wail of pain he sank on the grass of Madison Square and lay prone and still.

When he rose, he gave no glance at the still and silent forms on the benches, but, going to a fountain, bathed his face; then hiding himself in a corner away from the drama of death, he quietly gripped himself and thought the thing through: The comet had swept the earth and this was the end. Was everybody dead? He must search and see.

He knew that he must steady himself and keep calm, or he would go insane. First he must go to a restaurant. He walked up Fifth Avenue to a famous hostelry and entered its gorgeous, ghost-haunted halls. He beat back the nausea, and, seizing a tray from dead hands, hurried into the street and ate ravenously, hiding to keep out the sights.

""Yesterday, they would not have served me,"" he whispered, as he forced the food down.

Then he started up the street,—looking, peering, telephoning, ringing alarms; silent, silent all. Was nobody—nobody—he dared not think the thought and hurried on.

Suddenly he stopped still. He had forgotten. My God! How could he have forgotten? He must rush to the subway—then he almost laughed. No—a car; if he could find a Ford. He saw one. Gently he lifted off its burden, and took his place on the seat. He tested the throttle. There was gas. He glided off, shivering, and drove up the street. Everywhere stood, leaned, lounged, and lay the dead, in grim and awful silence. On he ran past an automobile, wrecked and overturned; past another, filled with a gay party whose smiles yet lingered on their death-struck lips; on past crowds and groups of cars, pausing by dead policemen; at 42nd Street he had to detour to Park Avenue to avoid the dead congestion. He came back on Fifth Avenue at 57th and flew past the Plaza and by the park with its hushed babies and silent throng, until as he was rushing past 72nd Street he heard a sharp cry, and saw a living form leaning wildly out an upper window. He gasped. The human voice sounded in his ears like the voice of God.

""Hello—hello—help, in God's name!"" wailed the woman. ""There's a dead girl in here and a man and—and see yonder dead men lying in the street and dead horses—for the love of God go and bring the officers——"" And the words trailed off into hysterical tears.

He wheeled the car in a sudden circle, running over the still body of a child and leaping on the curb. Then he rushed up the steps and tried the door and rang violently. There was a long pause, but at last the heavy door swung back. They stared a moment in silence. She had not noticed before that he was a Negro. He had not thought of her as white. She was a woman of perhaps twenty-five—rarely beautiful and richly gowned, with darkly-golden hair, and jewels. Yesterday, he thought with bitterness, she would scarcely have looked at him twice. He would have been dirt beneath her silken feet. She stared at him. Of all the sorts of men she had pictured as coming to her rescue she had not dreamed of one like him. Not that he was not human, but he dwelt in a world so far from hers, so infinitely far, that he seldom even entered her thought. Yet as she looked at him curiously he seemed quite commonplace and usual. He was a tall, dark workingman of the better class, with a sensitive face trained to stolidity and a poor man's clothes and hands. His face was soft and slow and his manner at once cold and nervous, like fires long banked, but not out.

So a moment each paused and gauged the other; then the thought of the dead world without rushed in and they started toward each other.

""What has happened?"" she cried. ""Tell me! Nothing stirs. All is silence! I see the dead strewn before my window as winnowed by the breath of God,—and see——"" She dragged him through great, silken hangings to where, beneath the sheen of mahogany and silver, a little French maid lay stretched in quiet, everlasting sleep, and near her a butler lay prone in his livery.

The tears streamed down the woman's cheeks and she clung to his arm until the perfume of her breath swept his face and he felt the tremors racing through her body.

""I had been shut up in my dark room developing pictures of the comet which I took last night; when I came out—I saw the dead!

""What has happened?"" she cried again.

He answered slowly:

""Something—comet or devil—swept across the earth this morning and—many are dead!""

""Many? Very many?""

""I have searched and I have seen no other living soul but you.""

She gasped and they stared at each other.

""My—father!"" she whispered.

""Where is he?""

""He started for the office.""

""Where is it?""

""In the Metropolitan Tower.""

""Leave a note for him here and come.""

Then he stopped.

""No,"" he said firmly—""first, we must go—to Harlem.""

""Harlem!"" she cried. Then she understood. She tapped her foot at first impatiently. She looked back and shuddered. Then she came resolutely down the steps.

""There's a swifter car in the garage in the court,"" she said.

""I don't know how to drive it,"" he said.

""I do,"" she answered.

In ten minutes they were flying to Harlem on the wind. The Stutz rose and raced like an airplane. They took the turn at 110th Street on two wheels and slipped with a shriek into 135th.

He was gone but a moment. Then he returned, and his face was gray. She did not look, but said:

""You have lost—somebody?""

""I have lost—everybody,"" he said, simply—""unless——""

He ran back and was gone several minutes—hours they seemed to her.

""Everybody,"" he said, and he walked slowly back with something film-like in his hand which he stuffed into his pocket.

""I'm afraid I was selfish,"" he said. But already the car was moving toward the park among the dark and lined dead of Harlem—the brown, still faces, the knotted hands, the homely garments, and the silence—the wild and haunting silence. Out of the park, and down Fifth Avenue they whirled. In and out among the dead they slipped and quivered, needing no sound of bell or horn, until the great, square Metropolitan Tower hove in sight. Gently he laid the dead elevator boy aside; the car shot upward. The door of the office stood open. On the threshold lay the stenographer, and, staring at her, sat the dead clerk. The inner office was empty, but a note lay on the desk, folded and addressed but unsent:

Dear Daughter:

I've gone for a hundred mile spin in Fred's new Mercedes. Shall not be back before dinner. I'll bring Fred with me.

J.B.H.

""Come,"" she cried nervously. ""We must search the city.""

Up and down, over and across, back again—on went that ghostly search. Everywhere was silence and death—death and silence! They hunted from Madison Square to Spuyten Duyvel; they rushed across the Williamsburg Bridge; they swept over Brooklyn; from the Battery and Morningside Heights they scanned the river. Silence, silence everywhere, and no human sign. Haggard and bedraggled they puffed a third time slowly down Broadway, under the broiling sun, and at last stopped. He sniffed the air. An odor—a smell—and with the shifting breeze a sickening stench filled their nostrils and brought its awful warning. The girl settled back helplessly in her seat.

""What can we do?"" she cried.

It was his turn now to take the lead, and he did it quickly.

""The long distance telephone—the telegraph and the cable—night rockets and then—flight!""

She looked at him now with strength and confidence. He did not look like men, as she had always pictured men; but he acted like one and she was content. In fifteen minutes they were at the central telephone exchange. As they came to the door he stepped quickly before her and pressed her gently back as he closed it. She heard him moving to and fro, and knew his burdens—the poor, little burdens he bore. When she entered, he was alone in the room. The grim switchboard flashed its metallic face in cryptic, sphinx-like immobility. She seated herself on a stool and donned the bright earpiece. She looked at the mouthpiece. She had never looked at one so closely before. It was wide and black, pimpled with usage; inert; dead; almost sarcastic in its unfeeling curves. It looked—she beat back the thought—but it looked,—it persisted in looking like—she turned her head and found herself alone. One moment she was terrified; then she thanked him silently for his delicacy and turned resolutely, with a quick intaking of breath.

""Hello!"" she called in low tones. She was calling to the world. The world must answer. Would the world answer? Was the world——

Silence!

She had spoken too low.

""Hello!"" she cried, full-voiced.

She listened. Silence! Her heart beat quickly. She cried in clear, distinct, loud tones: ""Hello—hello—hello!""

What was that whirring? Surely—no—was it the click of a receiver?

She bent close, she moved the pegs in the holes, and called and called, until her voice rose almost to a shriek, and her heart hammered. It was as if she had heard the last flicker of creation, and the evil was silence. Her voice dropped to a sob. She sat stupidly staring into the black and sarcastic mouthpiece, and the thought came again. Hope lay dead within her. Yes, the cable and the rockets remained; but the world—she could not frame the thought or say the word. It was too mighty—too terrible! She turned toward the door with a new fear in her heart. For the first time she seemed to realize that she was alone in the world with a stranger, with something more than a stranger,—with a man alien in blood and culture—unknown, perhaps unknowable. It was awful! She must escape—she must fly; he must not see her again. Who knew what awful thoughts—

She gathered her silken skirts deftly about her young, smooth limbs—listened, and glided into a sidehall. A moment she shrank back: the hall lay filled with dead women; then she leaped to the door and tore at it, with bleeding fingers, until it swung wide. She looked out. He was standing at the top of the alley,—silhouetted, tall and black, motionless. Was he looking at her or away? She did not know—she did not care. She simply leaped and ran—ran until she found herself alone amid the dead and the tall ramparts of towering buildings.

She stopped. She was alone. Alone! Alone on the streets—alone in the city—perhaps alone in the world! There crept in upon her the sense of deception—of creeping hands behind her back—of silent, moving things she could not see,—of voices hushed in fearsome conspiracy. She looked behind and sideways, started at strange sounds and heard still stranger, until every nerve within her stood sharp and quivering, stretched to scream at the barest touch. She whirled and flew back, whimpering like a child, until she found that narrow alley again and the dark, silent figure silhouetted at the top. She stopped and rested; then she walked silently toward him, looked at him timidly; but he said nothing as he handed her into the car. Her voice caught as she whispered:

""Not—that.""

And he answered slowly: ""No—not that!""

They climbed into the car. She bent forward on the wheel and sobbed, with great, dry, quivering sobs, as they flew toward the cable office on the east side, leaving the world of wealth and prosperity for the world of poverty and work. In the world behind them were death and silence, grave and grim, almost cynical, but always decent; here it was hideous. It clothed itself in every ghastly form of terror, struggle, hate, and suffering. It lay wreathed in crime and squalor, greed and lust. Only in its dread and awful silence was it like to death everywhere.

Yet as the two, flying and alone, looked upon the horror of the world, slowly, gradually, the sense of all-enveloping death deserted them. They seemed to move in a world silent and asleep,—not dead. They moved in quiet reverence, lest somehow they wake these sleeping forms who had, at last, found peace. They moved in some solemn, world-wide Friedhof, above which some mighty arm had waved its magic wand. All nature slept until—until, and quick with the same startling thought, they looked into each other's eyes—he, ashen, and she, crimson, with unspoken thought. To both, the vision of a mighty beauty—of vast, unspoken things, swelled in their souls; but they put it away.

Great, dark coils of wire came up from the earth and down from the sun and entered this low lair of witchery. The gathered lightnings of the world centered here, binding with beams of light the ends of the earth. The doors gaped on the gloom within. He paused on the threshold.

""Do you know the code?"" she asked.

""I know the call for help—we used it formerly at the bank.""

She hardly heard. She heard the lapping of the waters far below,—the dark and restless waters—the cold and luring waters, as they called. He stepped within. Slowly she walked to the wall, where the water called below, and stood and waited. Long she waited, and he did not come. Then with a start she saw him, too, standing beside the black waters. Slowly he removed his coat and stood there silently. She walked quickly to him and laid her hand on his arm. He did not start or look. The waters lapped on in luring, deadly rhythm. He pointed down to the waters, and said quietly:

""The world lies beneath the waters now—may I go?""

She looked into his stricken, tired face, and a great pity surged within her heart. She answered in a voice clear and calm, ""No.""

Upward they turned toward life again, and he seized the wheel. The world was darkening to twilight, and a great, gray pall was falling mercifully and gently on the sleeping dead. The ghastly glare of reality seemed replaced with the dream of some vast romance. The girl lay silently back, as the motor whizzed along, and looked half-consciously for the elf-queen to wave life into this dead world again. She forgot to wonder at the quickness with which he had learned to drive her car. It seemed natural. And then as they whirled and swung into Madison Square and at the door of the Metropolitan Tower she gave a low cry, and her eyes were great! Perhaps she had seen the elf-queen?

The man led her to the elevator of the tower and deftly they ascended. In her father's office they gathered rugs and chairs, and he wrote a note and laid it on the desk; then they ascended to the roof and he made her comfortable. For a while she rested and sank to dreamy somnolence, watching the worlds above and wondering. Below lay the dark shadows of the city and afar was the shining of the sea. She glanced at him timidly as he set food before her and took a shawl and wound her in it, touching her reverently, yet tenderly. She looked up at him with thankfulness in her eyes, eating what he served. He watched the city. She watched him. He seemed very human,—very near now.

""Have you had to work hard?"" she asked softly.

""Always,"" he said.

""I have always been idle,"" she said. ""I was rich.""

""I was poor,"" he almost echoed.

""The rich and the poor are met together,"" she began, and he finished:

""The Lord is the Maker of them all.""

""Yes,"" she said slowly; ""and how foolish our human distinctions seem—now,"" looking down to the great dead city stretched below, swimming in unlightened shadows.

""Yes—I was not—human, yesterday,"" he said.

She looked at him. ""And your people were not my people,"" she said; ""but today——"" She paused. He was a man,—no more; but he was in some larger sense a gentleman,—sensitive, kindly, chivalrous, everything save his hands and—his face. Yet yesterday——

""Death, the leveler!"" he muttered.

""And the revealer,"" she whispered gently, rising to her feet with great eyes. He turned away, and after fumbling a moment sent a rocket into the darkening air. It arose, shrieked, and flew up, a slim path of light, and scattering its stars abroad, dropped on the city below. She scarcely noticed it. A vision of the world had risen before her. Slowly the mighty prophecy of her destiny overwhelmed her. Above the dead past hovered the Angel of Annunciation. She was no mere woman. She was neither high nor low, white nor black, rich nor poor. She was primal woman; mighty mother of all men to come and Bride of Life. She looked upon the man beside her and forgot all else but his manhood, his strong, vigorous manhood—his sorrow and sacrifice. She saw him glorified. He was no longer a thing apart, a creature below, a strange outcast of another clime and blood, but her Brother Humanity incarnate, Son of God and great All-Father of the race to be.

He did not glimpse the glory in her eyes, but stood looking outward toward the sea and sending rocket after rocket into the unanswering darkness. Dark-purple clouds lay banked and billowed in the west. Behind them and all around, the heavens glowed in dim, weird radiance that suffused the darkening world and made almost a minor music. Suddenly, as though gathered back in some vast hand, the great cloud-curtain fell away. Low on the horizon lay a long, white star—mystic, wonderful! And from it fled upward to the pole, like some wan bridal veil, a pale, wide sheet of flame that lighted all the world and dimmed the stars.

In fascinated silence the man gazed at the heavens and dropped his rockets to the floor. Memories of memories stirred to life in the dead recesses of his mind. The shackles seemed to rattle and fall from his soul. Up from the crass and crushing and cringing of his caste leaped the lone majesty of kings long dead. He arose within the shadows, tall, straight, and stern, with power in his eyes and ghostly scepters hovering to his grasp. It was as though some mighty Pharaoh lived again, or curled Assyrian lord. He turned and looked upon the lady, and found her gazing straight at him.

Silently, immovably, they saw each other face to face—eye to eye. Their souls lay naked to the night. It was not lust; it was not love—it was some vaster, mightier thing that needed neither touch of body nor thrill of soul. It was a thought divine, splendid.

Slowly, noiselessly, they moved toward each other—the heavens above, the seas around, the city grim and dead below. He loomed from out the velvet shadows vast and dark. Pearl-white and slender, she shone beneath the stars. She stretched her jeweled hands abroad. He lifted up his mighty arms, and they cried each to the other, almost with one voice, ""The world is dead.""

""Long live the——""

""Honk! Honk!"" Hoarse and sharp the cry of a motor drifted clearly up from the silence below. They started backward with a cry and gazed upon each other with eyes that faltered and fell, with blood that boiled.

""Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk!"" came the mad cry again, and almost from their feet a rocket blazed into the air and scattered its stars upon them. She covered her eyes with her hands, and her shoulders heaved. He dropped and bowed, groped blindly on his knees about the floor. A blue flame spluttered lazily after an age, and she heard the scream of an answering rocket as it flew.

Then they stood still as death, looking to opposite ends of the earth.

""Clang—crash—clang!""

The roar and ring of swift elevators shooting upward from below made the great tower tremble. A murmur and babel of voices swept in upon the night. All over the once dead city the lights blinked, flickered, and flamed; and then with a sudden clanging of doors the entrance to the platform was filled with men, and one with white and flying hair rushed to the girl and lifted her to his breast. ""My daughter!"" he sobbed.

Behind him hurried a younger, comelier man, carefully clad in motor costume, who bent above the girl with passionate solicitude and gazed into her staring eyes until they narrowed and dropped and her face flushed deeper and deeper crimson.

""Julia,"" he whispered; ""my darling, I thought you were gone forever.""

She looked up at him with strange, searching eyes.

""Fred,"" she murmured, almost vaguely, ""is the world—gone?""

""Only New York,"" he answered; ""it is terrible—awful! You know,—but you, how did you escape—how have you endured this horror? Are you well? Unharmed?""

""Unharmed!"" she said.

""And this man here?"" he asked, encircling her drooping form with one arm and turning toward the Negro. Suddenly he stiffened and his hand flew to his hip. ""Why!"" he snarled. ""It's—a—nigger—Julia! Has he—has he dared——""

She lifted her head and looked at her late companion curiously and then dropped her eyes with a sigh.

""He has dared—all, to rescue me,"" she said quietly, ""and I—thank him—much."" But she did not look at him again. As the couple turned away, the father drew a roll of bills from his pockets.

""Here, my good fellow,"" he said, thrusting the money into the man's hands, ""take that,—what's your name?""

""Jim Davis,"" came the answer, hollow-voiced.

""Well, Jim, I thank you. I've always liked your people. If you ever want a job, call on me."" And they were gone.

The crowd poured up and out of the elevators, talking and whispering.

""Who was it?""

""Are they alive?""

""How many?""

""Two!""

""Who was saved?""

""A white girl and a nigger—there she goes.""

""A nigger? Where is he? Let's lynch the damned——""

""Shut up—he's all right-he saved her.""

""Saved hell! He had no business——""

""Here he comes.""

Into the glare of the electric lights the colored man moved slowly, with the eyes of those that walk and sleep.

""Well, what do you think of that?"" cried a bystander; ""of all New York, just a white girl and a nigger!""

The colored man heard nothing. He stood silently beneath the glare of the light, gazing at the money in his hand and shrinking as he gazed; slowly he put his other hand into his pocket and brought out a baby's filmy cap, and gazed again. A woman mounted to the platform and looked about, shading her eyes. She was brown, small, and toil-worn, and in one arm lay the corpse of a dark baby. The crowd parted and her eyes fell on the colored man; with a cry she tottered toward him.

""Jim!""

He whirled and, with a sob of joy, caught her in his arms.

A Hymn to the Peoples

O Truce of God!
And primal meeting of the Sons of Man,
Foreshadowing the union of the World!
From all the ends of earth we come!
Old Night, the elder sister of the Day,
Mother of Dawn in the golden East,
Meets in the misty twilight with her brood,
Pale and black, tawny, red and brown,
The mighty human rainbow of the world,
Spanning its wilderness of storm.

Softly in sympathy the sunlight falls,
Rare is the radiance of the moon;
And on the darkest midnight blaze the stars—
The far-flown shadows of whose brilliance
Drop like a dream on the dim shores of Time,
Forecasting Days that are to these
As day to night.

So sit we all as one.
So, gloomed in tall and stone-swathed groves,
The Buddha walks with Christ!
And Al-Koran and Bible both be holy!
Almighty Word!
In this Thine awful sanctuary,
First and flame-haunted City of the Widened World,
Assoil us, Lord of Lands and Seas!
We are but weak and wayward men,
Distraught alike with hatred and vainglory;

Prone to despise the Soul that breathes within—
High visioned hordes that lie and steal and kill,
Sinning the sin each separate heart disclaims,
Clambering upon our riven, writhing selves,
Besieging Heaven by trampling men to Hell!
We be blood-guilty! Lo, our hands be red!
Not one may blame the other in this sin!
But here—here in the white Silence of the Dawn,
Before the Womb of Time,
With bowed hearts all flame and shame,
We face the birth-pangs of a world:

We hear the stifled cry of Nations all but born—
The wail of women ravished of their stunted brood!
We see the nakedness of Toil, the poverty of Wealth,
We know the Anarchy of Empire, and doleful Death of Life!
And hearing, seeing, knowing all, we cry:

Save us, World-Spirit, from our lesser selves!
Grant us that war and hatred cease,
Reveal our souls in every race and hue!
Help us, O Human God, in this Thy Truce,
To make Humanity divine!",W.E.B. Du Bois,Pearl Jam,1994,"[100, 73, 54, 29, 18, 58]",6

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend

[Verse 1]
I can't do nothing, girl, without somebody bugging
I used to think that it was me, but now I see it wasn't
They told me to change, they called me names, and so I popped one
Opinions are like assholes and everybody's got one
I never put my nose where I'm not supposed to
Believe me, if he's something that I want, I'm stepping closer
I'm not one for playing high-pole
Like the high soditty 90210 type of ho
I treat a man like he treats me
The difference between a hooker and a ho ain't nothing but a fee
So hold your tongue tightly, wish you could be like me
You're popping all that mess only to stress and to spite me
Now you can get with that or you can get with this
But I don't give a shit cause really it's none of your business

That your double-standards don't mean shit to me?

Now every move I make somebody's clocking
Don't ask me nothing, will you just leave me alone?
Never mind who's the guy that I took home...to bone

[Verse 2: Pepa]
OK, Miss Thing never giving up skins
If you don't like him or his friends what about that Benz?
Your Pep-Pep's got an ill rep
With all that macaroni trap for rap you better step
Or better yet get your head checked
Cause I refuse to be played like a penny cent trick deck of cards
No, I ain't hard like the bitches on a boulevard
My face ain't scarred, and I don't dance in bars
You can call me a tramp if you want to
But I remember the punk who just humped and dumped you
Or you can front if you have to
But everybody gets horny just like you
So, yo, so, yo, ho - check it, double deck it on a record butt-naked
Pep's ass gets respected miss but its none of your business

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight

Please forgive me
'Cause I don't ever want to rush you
I might sound a little hasty
But let's do what we came to do
You know our time is really precious
And you wasted a lot of mine
I'm gonna have to keep on moving
If you can't make up your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
One day we could be together
Cause you know that I wanna be down, baby
But right now, we can all forget it
You know I gots to get around
I don't have much money (don't have none)
I can't buy a diamond ring (and a diamond ring)
I ain't trying to be funny (no)

I wants to get fucked up when I'm chillin', whoa
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill-in
You let her funk me cause my funk is the best
Comin from the West
Kickin that shit be occupied, dedicated to the preservation motion of hips
Hittin them dips, cd skips but I'm straight
As I bounce, rock, skate, now I'll toast to that
If it's rough, make the girls say
""Do that stuff! Aw, do that stuff!""
But ya got to be, you got to be a freak of the week
For the top gun, hit you with the bop gun

Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There ain't nothin' wrong, so hit the bong
Waitin' on the double dutch bus for a ride
As the buffalo bitch go round the outside
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
Got Daytons on the mothership
And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass
The dutchie on the left hand side for the sale
Cuz nobody knows where the nose goes when the doors close
Dog chow got the hoes
Lookin' for the theme from the Black Hole
Now I'll big bang you with my black pole
Flashlight, red light, we don't like cops on the bike
Just made bail, tonight
So whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna have some funwith the bop gun

No I can't come out today
It's not the wind that cracked your shoulder
And threw you to the ground
Who's there that makes you so afraid
You're shaken to the bone
And no I don't understand
You deserve so much more than this

So don't tell me why he's never been good to you
Don't tell me why he's never been there for you

Just kidding, no offend to it, finally he ended it
Case dismissed, but your honor, DA kindly prevented it
He told to the judge, don't free him, this brother trigger wars

I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go, darling
Maybe it's better that way

Walk out that door, see if I care
Go on and go, but...

Guess I never learned my lesson well
I went straight back into hell

No one cares about who'll be left to cry
And there ain't no reason why
Yes I know I led the chase before
The chase is gonna end

That everything that you do gives me

Shut up and kiss me

Didn't expect to have to rise above

That everything that you do gives me
It's been too long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me

There's something 'bout the silent type
Attracting me to you
All business, baby, none of the hype
That no talker can live up to

[Verse 3]
Come closer baby, I can't hear you
Just another whisper if you please
Don't worry 'bout the details darling
You've got the kind of mind I love to read
Talk is cheap and baby, time's expensive
So why waste another minute more
And life's too short to be so apprehensive
Love's as much the symptom, darling, as the cure

[Chorus 2]
Oh baby, when I feel this feeling
It's like genuine voodoo hits me
It's been too long since somebody whispered...

Oh baby, I can feel this feeling
That everything that you do gives me

Grab you gat with the extra clip
And close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it, kick it, kick it
Yea that's the ticket

Ain't no punk ass niggas set trippin'
Everybody got a stack and it ain't no crack

If ya can't take the heat get ya ass out the kitchen

I'm tryin to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin in fear of a drive by
And even if I get away from them drive by killaz
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggas
I keep on searchin' and I keep on lookin'
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin' like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

And only down ass niggas can ride with me

Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot, swing low

If I'd have known she'd come my way
The lonely nights would have been okay
I have her promise that she's gonna stay

Let me tell you 'bout
The way she loved me
Ooh, I want the world to know
I'm crazy 'bout
The way she loved me
Ooh, I'm proud to let it show
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Nobody else could do me so right
A breath of heaven in my darkest night
I'm gonna hold on with all of my might

Let me tell you 'bout
The way she loved me
Ooh, I want the world to know
I'm crazy 'bout
The way she loved me
Ooh, I'm proud to let it show
Yeah, yeah, yeah",Richard Marx,Richard Marx,1994,"[98, 87, 80, 77, 71, 64, 53, 37, 27, 22, 24, 20, 20, 25, 27, 27, 33, 37, 42]",19
118,Hit By Love,"I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit

CHORUS:
I've been hit by your love and it's all that I see
So much happiness now belongs to me
I've been hit by your love for the very first time
And I know you're the one, baby you're mine

It turns out that we like the same movies
We even like the same songs
I can't believe that there is someone like you
I can't believe I waited so long
What we have is something so special
A connection I hope won't be broken too soon
I just need you to tell me you love me
So I can be with you

CHORUS

I never thought that I needed another
Until the day I saw you
Everything I said I didn't want was
In front of me and so true
When you smiled I knew I was in for it
Your sweet face told me all that I needed to know
From that moment I knew what love was
And I hope that you did too

CHORUS

I'm hit, I'm hit by love, I'm hit
I'm hit by your love, baby
I'm hit, I'm hit by love, I'm hit
I'm hit by your love, baby",CeCe Peniston,CeCe Peniston,1994,"[99, 90, 95]",3
119,Watermelon Crawl,"[Verse 1]
I was drivin' through Georgia in late July
On a day hot enough to make the devil sigh
I saw a homemade sign writtin' in red
Rhine county watermelon festival ahead

[Verse 2]
Well, I wasn't in a hurry so I slowed down
Took a two lane road to a one horse town
There was a party goin' on when I got there
I heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor

[Chorus]
He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law
If you drink don't drive do the watermelon crawl

[Verse 3]
When the band started playin the watermelon queen
Said let me show you somethin' that you ain't never seen
She grabbed me by the arm said come on let's go
She dipped down, spun around, and do-ce-doed

[Verse 4]
She rocked back on her heels dropped down to her knees
She craweled across the floor and jumped back to her feet
She wiggled and she giggled and be all you ever saw
She said this is how you do the watermelon crawl

[Chorus]
He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law
If you drink don't drive do the watermelon crawl

[Bridge]
If your ever down in Georgia around about July
If you ain't in a hurry then you oughta stop by
I can guarantee that you're goin have a ball
Learnin' how to do the watermelon crawl

[Chorus]
He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law
If you drink don't drive do the watermelon crawl
Yeah, do the watermelon crawl
Have fun you all
Do the watermelon crawl",Tracy Byrd,Tracy Byrd,1994,"[100, 88, 81, 85, 87]",5

I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my part
Cause I stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes
I'll never break your heart

[Chorus]
And I swear by the moon
And the stars in the sky I'll be there
I swear like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there for better or worse
Till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
And I swear
Oooh

[Verse 2]
I'll give you everything I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls
And when (and when) just the two of us are there
You won't have to ask if I still care
Cause as the time turns the page
My love won't age at all

[Chorus]
And I swear (I swear) by the moon
And the stars in the sky I'll be there (I'll be there)
I swear (and I swear) like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there (I'll be there) for better or worse
'Til death do us part I'll love you
With every beat of my heart and I swear
Oh yeah

I swear (I swear) by the moon
And the stars in the sky I'll be there (I'll be there)
I swear like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there (I'll be there)
For better or worse (better or worse)
Till death do us part (oh no) I'll love you
With every single beat of my heart
I swear
I swear
Oh, I swear",All-4-One,All-4-One,1994,"[50, 47, 41, 35, 33, 22, 22, 15, 11, 8, 6, 5, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 85, 1, 84, 1, 87, 1, 78, 1, 75, 1, 72, 8, 69, 18, 73, 39, 69, 70, 72, 62, 68, 59, 60, 56, 51, 42, 46, 58, 81]",50
122,Nuttin' But Love,"[Round 1: Mike P]
Y'all think B. Dot fire, right?
Well, I guess that's what them likes get you
You know this battle is kinda like the building
The heat is on and you 'bout to have some serious Mike (mic) issues!
What, y'all think I can't freestyle for nothin'?
Boy, I'm wild seasoned
Geechi battled just now, I start a TEC (Tech), half the crowd leavin'
No time wastin'
Though this a waste of time, I figured I'd shake up with the best
This is ""disrespected"" versus ""can't seem to get respected""
And well, that's a problem I need to take up with the rest
Until then, I'm in Cali, shiieeet, I took a- pay cut just to flex
Parallel universe, you believe in it?
You here to try to Trump a white man and I'm here to Wake Up Mr. West
It all starts, with a Glock spittin'
Iron, Mike versus the Vegas, the kid like 'Pac did it
Born Legacy Supreme, R Streetz
'Cause by the third went Top missin'
We two different elements, separated
And Kemetics, is where the plot thickens
So excuse my punctuation, mark
You half-assed; semi colon
Pause, that's for people thinkin' Dot different
Nah, are you progressin' or talkin', you either build or boast
Aye, I (AI) flew to West World, Bernard told me to kill the host
With steel lines, to heat up a square, he a radiator
Fuck a knife fight, we ain't joustin'
What I blew (blue) knock red off his pedestal: American Gladiators
I've seen people tougher than you, and you ain't built like ours
You lack Courage, dawg (dog), and I use this (Eustace) bag just to kill a coward
Your queen? As beautiful as a rose, and I love pickin' flowers
That box, the most exciting place to bust (bus) and drop in: Tilted Towers!
Fortnite bars!
B. Dot what you gon' do wit' me?
I'm meal toting, max shield potions, holdin' two 50's
BAOW, that's what he get for bringin' me the drama
Cheapskate, shitty teammate, he ain't see the Llama
Bro you too paranoid so I doubt your performance
All you gon' do is cry, nothin' but a clown we recordin'
Whatchu gon' talk about? My suicide?
Bro, that sound get aborted like, ""What you knew Blood?""
I drew Blood without the extortion
Fuck a B. Dot, I'll murder the whole Left Side Connection
Buck-50, he gon' need his whole left side connected
I booked your funeral soon as I booked my Airbnb
The knife I got, IHOP, it go from P to B!
Or the Desert E, fire into this queer chin
He took every single round, y'all know I can't get a clear win
Fear him? Boy, I played Suge since I had a shot drawn
Now it's a shot drawn, I'm in front of your house, now it's your door gettin' knocked on
Versus EK, it looked like Smack you was about to pop on
But we copped the pay-per-view
Just watch the battle live...Dot calm (.com)!
Get tossed, somethin' without the pen
But fuck a credit scheme, let it scream
Back of the whip, you playin' Kennedy
I clown on you, aim down on you, I'm in a mezzanine
Gat named ""The Saurus"", deuce deuce, Two Time Everything
I let it ring
Boy The Beatles can't even Let It Be
Your girl wanted Nuttin' But Love, I gave her Heavy D
I crack a bottle on Blood head, I'm spillin' Grenadine
I'm just comparin' Kemetic Science to kinetic energy
I'll weave, put Dot to sleep, he'll need pajama pants
The only dude annoying to Mike would be Banana Man
If it's work involved, I'll search for Charles, that's an anagram
I'll stomp your Cali ass the fuck out, you'll get the Hammer Dance
I didn't have much room to do the Hammer Dance but, keep comin' with that lost mentality
Your ignorance is leadin' to your loss in salary
You here to act like you still a boss and battle me
I'm here to put some life into your false reality
Time

[Round 1: B. Dot]
Check this, you'll remember this
Who wanna scrap wit' me? Mikey P
Tell your boss to show me the money get your Jerry Maguire on
I'm known for being fire on cam', you known for being on cam' gettin' fired on
L.A. let's turn this riot on
New York, we done studied the game tapes and we see why y'all bang late
See a nigga like me wouldn't let you slide, and why (NY)?
Because initially, mentally we not in the same state
See out east, you told Suge he was the biggest known slob since Biz and Owens
Blood is you dumb?
Do you know where you at?
Do you know where I'm from?
Didn't you say ""Fuck the West""?
Then called a triple OG that started Westside Ps a ""slob"", wow the disrespect
The irony, I wanna Just Do It but then I know I won't get the check
Respect the west
What the fuck you know about gangbangin'?
White boy from New York, middle class maintainin'
My niggas really in the field, the only shit you kill is Call Of Duty game playin'
Callin' out Brizz and Roc, like you top tier main stagin'
This neanderthal only want to battle y'all to show who's really Cave Gangin'
I came sprayin'
Haters gon' say it's Photoshop when I come through with more machinery than Robocop
They'll take your bitch for ransom, you gon' have to put money on your heart like them weak ass clothes you rock
The flow don't stop
Think Pacquiao when I pack him out, givin' him the same treatment Cotto got
Or flash with the cannon (Canon), you here standin' next to me brings a whole new meanin' to photo op'
The fo' fo' cocked, and I'm shootin' big bullets, it'll feel like a boulder block
And some guys only about that thing, and when it sing, you better duck like you know the wop
You know this Dot, I'm only here to address you Mike
""You had a lot to say about a league you said yes to twice.""
That's that slave mentality
Thinkin' I say ""yes"" to a league ain't gon' sway or rattle me
Nigga I say ""yes"" for the west, show some respect, if I ain't accept this there ain't no way we battling
Thanks for travelling
We heard the hype just figured you for the nervous type
Thought I had a different opponent til I noticed they subbed you in the game and had you throw on a jersey, Mike
Well this gon' be American History, X-cept we gon' change the script and word it tight
Give you the curb to bite
Rest in peace Emmett Till
We'll tie this white bitch to the front of the whip, I'm reversin' life
You gon' reimburse them, right?
I mean they paid for the flight I'm sure the purse was nice
You was racin', they told you ""be patient"" but they didn't explain you was goin' under the surgeon's knife
You suburban white, and write like you live some sort of urban life
From New York, all the way to L.A., do it BIG, well that's just gon' get your Suburban striked
I'm in an urge to fight, they done put a real life in front of the poltergeist
So I'm checkin' you with the one, two like I think it's a broken mic
I get up close to strike, poke him twice, razor sharp Logan knife
With that over right then it's, ""Oh goodnight.""
White boys always wanna wrestle, til somethin' open they chest like Hogan hype
You better hold on Mike, you the mom that's driftin' here with the paradigm shiftin'
On URL, where all the stars are at the top of the mountain, actin'
Paramount Pictures, KG, where is my digits?
After this we gon' talk bro'
This will be the last time you get me for the cost low
I figured they'd put me in front of the wigger cause they gettin' somethin' big for the cheap price and he used to workin' at Costco
My fault though, for tryin' to help you Mike
You said I wanted more money for this battle, well you right
Was tryin' to get you more money too, but that's what they not gon' tell you Mike
You're so connected to URL
You think you're free but can't see how they handheld you Mike
No Henny bottle but they treat you like canned goods the way they shelf you Mike
I see you're not gelled too tight
All kind of cracks in the guy cranium
I mean, what kind of (Wakanda) shit is this?
Smack is T'challa sendin' a white agent to the sky to stop Killmonger from passin' the Vibranium
Ain't no savin' him, Smack I'll drop another third round, don't make me go there
I find it Strange, you can't create fire rounds but get to jumpin' in my world outta nowhere
This is no fair, y'all done stuffed dynamite inside of the wheel barrel
And rode in front of battle raps Will Farrell
All this jokin' and fuckin' around, and still can't make it baby, you should feel sterile
Why air you? I'm not here to let a gun go blam
I'd rather pull out, pistol whip him in the mouth
You know, smack his lips like Twork when his punch don't land
I got a hunch though fam', you gon' be like my last competition
I'm used to the opposition and hit the fans with the proposition
Like, ""B. Dot is street and he conscious. And that's conflictin'"", a sick disposition
Now I just fuse my future with my past
He once tried to decide on a half, that ain't gon' help you get no split decision
This for my Crips in prison and all my Bloods behind the walls in the wicked system that don't fit this description
Yeah you know this Matrix hates us
All these codes I'm tryin' to Control/Alt/Delete and shift encryptions
Even your team's indifferent
I talked to Mickey on the phone he was like, ""Dot I don't know. You got superlative raps
But Mike's pen's gettin' better. He could Trump you.""
I say, ""Well that's fake news. The wrong alternative facts.""
And besides, Mickey gon' be turnin' his back the same way he did with Joe Budden
Watchin' his homie gettin' punched on and looked away like he don't know nothin'
Y'all hoes frontin'
Yellow Tape Gang, which one of y'all gon' throw fists and clap?
Nigga, Bonnie Godiva's the only G from your Unit we've ever seen go get the strap
You better roll a clip back
This that black African power
And if these was your last days Mikey, this is your last hour

[Round 2: Mike P]
I thought to touch on your Kemetic Science but my mind was stressed so I diverted
More to pure shit, and tell that every line complex, a wordsmith
To this herb shit, there is nothin' that this guy can test
And if his people wanna jump in, I'm splittin' Dot Mobb in half; Shine vs Rex
Let's turn up
Flame life, I'll put the heat on ops
Use your pussy white angles, Mike P no cop
Get K.O.'d you wouldn't see those shots
A fist to lame, it's Twister game, so when son hit the floor, hands and feet on Dot
I've been the nicest
Long before Thanos I've been a Titan
Spine shot, he start convulsin', that's meningitis
Brush me wrong, it's a Scope in your mouth, that's gingivitis
Shoulder shot, he can't lift an arm up, that's tendinitis
I said I ride with a pocket pistol, miniature, but I like the hammer
It's small, but does the job cause it's the little things in life that matters
I snuck it in the venue, they ask how the GP did it
It's easy to sneak a pistol in if it's 3D printed
I flew here, for a tag, puttin' you up in a grave
DNA, with the piece, I can maneuver with a K
Home court what?
Bitch you ain't know what I would do up in this place
Corky Romano, you here for a white bag but it blew up in your face
Oh you fire in L.A., but let's be honest, you don't stack bars
Canada vs Verb, boy you barley even scratched god
You terrible at road trips, wack god
You hate to camp so when you cook you only comfortable makin' fires in your backyard
How dare you test the pen, like you do it better
The white skin peel in L.A. I ain't used to the weather
For a band, I'll pop punks in Cali without Rufio
You shit on the tree and URL, but never gave yourself room to grow
You diva, vs Mike I'm Tyson, with what I do to hoes
Bullets Caillou, bald heads goin' through your clothes
I'm evil Ryu, no remorse for what I do to souls
And if I try you, I'm puttin' ten on your back like a [?]
Silly wit' that
If I Reed Dollaz I get silly wit' cats
Two rounds is all I need, I Surf verse Nitty a cat
The bulldog bitin' and I don't give a shit if he strapped
Soon as he feels the nips he (Nipsey) Hustle
But I turn back around for a victory lap
You wanna argue URL? Fine, let's talk holmes
Issues I had, I hashed out wit' 'em, not cried and throwed stones
And any argument, can end wit' a knife
So point chrome, cause even if I lose this debate, I still drive the point home
Be honest, thank me for doin' this in the west for you
I could've extra killed you in New York, but I want the best of you
I took the disadvantage, cause I ain't scared like the rest of you
Nobody said ""yes"" to you, pussy I requested you!
And the fact that you here right now, I've lost respect for you
But I guess it's ""Fuck URL"" til URL throws some checks to you
Time

[Round 2: B. Dot]
They say Mike P punch crazy, CRAZY, Mike
The dopest white battle rapper on Smack
How is that?
You not even the dopest white battle rapper in your camp
I mean it's quite apparent that you ain't fuckin' with Aaron
And white battle rap that's such a small space to be sharin'
It's gettin' over crowded but you allowed it
Can't put your trust in connivers
Jealous Ones Envy, especially when you see them on the road to success
And that's a car you was just in (Justin), Driver
Now you the hitchhiker searchin' for the newest road
You blew it bro
White Battle Rapper On Smack was your own little world
And we stopped watchin' your Truman Show to view Glue' and Joe
But I brought the coolest scope
These fans deserve a brand new optic
I'm here to widen the lens and zoom in on the microscopic to show y'all how Mike views profit (Prophet)
We all watched it, as you came in this game and changed lanes cause you had a few options
It was either Smack/URL or you could've been King Of The Dot'in'
Which one will get the views poppin'?
You first made the news when dude socked him, dropped him
Boo bopped, clocked him
And that was the first time you had a few dudes watchin'
That's when that short fuse popped in
Your Ascension in the game when dude took flight
I mean you took takin' punchin', in a battle, to whole new heights
But I can't understand you Mike
Cause fuck a contractual obligation
Let somebody snuff me, I'ma pop you, that's an actual confirmation
And I ain't makin' up with nobody in these battle situations
I mean you, plus a body bag will be the only thing y'all add in my Math-ematical equation
But I get the evaluation
You vs Tink The Demon was hot, but see I dug a lil' deeper
Looked down in the grave and I seen through the plot
This wigger write like he fight for civil rights, Mike, we all agree that you not
Just cause you Rose a little bit don't mean that you can Park here and not relinquish your spot
I mean, why not fight with ICE?
Try to kill the Wolf in a small corridor like Leonidas when he was [?]
Maybe it's cause you know if you went up north to the cold you'd get exposed
As just another flake that blends in with the snow over at King Of The Dot
And we see this a lot
White boys wanna ball with the blacks
We go hard in the paint, they never seen on the block
This is our lane
We draw the attention and only dish it to wiggers when we needin' a shot
But believe it or not
If you go over there with 'Ganik you'd do damage
And you know this, right?
But see it's all part of his gang, he claim he wanna stick to his Genesis
Play Station'ed in his slot where he can be this token white
Keep focus sight
You gotta see through the bloggin', Facebook lies and how he markets it
I got foresight to see through Fort Nite and now you put up a shield and build
Fortifications to hide behind and not get your target hit
It's obvious, your demo is in the graphics
That's how you grow audience?
Well where we from this system don't work for us
That's why we blow cartridges
The awkwardness, all fusin' to a dude that use video game schemes and make y'all applaud the shit?
But y'all wouldn't accept that from a nigga like Dre Vishiss or Geechi Gotti, some of the hardest Crips
But you was able to hit Tink wit', everything on the move list
That Hadouken!
That you did!
Only got approved when
We gave you a pass and didn't laugh at the bullshit
'Cause of your skin
And you knew this
And I'm just gettin' it all of my chest like a nudist
I thought I figured out these squares
It appears I'm still havin' trouble with the Rubix
So the tool is
Makin' arrangements to blossom his top like a tulip
Pussy nigga, two lips
The heat will make him cool it
You can catch a blue flame, that's that Crip and that Piru shit!
You're foolish, thinkin' I'ma just let you walk into hip hop
See the goal he has is to stand in front of the net, upload a clip
If it's funny or controversial his shit pop
And what we do? Give him a Lil' Pump, some aahs, a Lil' Uzi Vert to the tip top
Got these pussies suckin' they own dick in the race to get to 69 position
Well, this is that pit stop
Get your shit clocked
More niggas flamed up than what the Dips got
Big Dot, soon as I went viral, there was a two year big stop
URL contract, sign that, shit nah
New slaves, but I know how to evade the slipknot
Hitchcock, put him in the Twilight, fif' cocked
Silencer on it, the shit'll sound like a rim shot
Who hot? Him not
Grown man? Kid not
Barrel pointed at an undercover cop like, ""You killed Big Pop""
Gridlocked, what make you think you can beat me?
My nigga, I studied etymology, and honestly
I know your last name is pronounced ""Poo-lee-see"" and I digged deeply
Do the research like I'm supposed to
In Italian, ""Pulice"" means ""something small and annoying""
Well, what a fitting name for what he means to this culture
And y'all chose to, put the updated PCs in front of the archive
Not smart, guys
So when I separate 'em, think segregation, ropes around each wrist, we pull 'em apart tied (apartheid)
This the dark side
Nah, I ain't Brizz but it's gon' be a Raw deal when the fif' flyin'
Send half the clip at your clique, have your men dyin'
And send you eight (insinuate) for anything you was implyin'
You gon' die tryin'
This that Black African Power
And if these was your last days, Mikey, this is yo' last hour

[Round 3: Mike P]
I said, you know what? L.A., this ain't even about competition
Look, y'all, he's charged with fallin' in love with the URL system
Think of this as a filmed inquisition
I'm 'bout to give y'all a chance to make sure you don't dance around these topics your deposition
True or false: LA been runnin' battle rap?
True or false? Y'all been lined with some killers
And every year, URL throws an event around this time for the realest
Danny, Diz, Nitty, Geechi, EK: these fuckin' guys are gorillas
Puts in all the damn work without cryin' a river
Now, hear me out, cause he got the feelin' he a side piece, he insecure
Convinced that he's missin' out on a ride, sweet
He Drake new album, and this goes way beyond rhymes deep
Cause A: he raps great, but you turn a little soft when you start to side B
Dot! Find peace
Cause a lot of great writers like you done came and went
The more you show your cards, the more give them different ways to vent
Like your contradictions
And we gon' touch on all those mind games you pitch
Like how you don't care about battle rap, but you cared that you weren't the main event
Main event?
Bro, co-main event, I wouldn't hand you that
You said you cared about music more but you couldn't even handle that
My first song in five years, SMOKED YOU, you couldn't even handle tracks
Dawg, how you from LA (*chk-chk*) and you couldn't even handle Wax
Don't even answer that
Address the switch in your steez in that third round vs EK when you shit on the league
I do not get what it means
How you were shittin' on Beas' for puttin' Diz on the stage but you got Diz on your team
But ooooh
FACTS
Let's just ignore that from the pseudo-righteous race-baiter
Besides, it was a haymaker
We felt that shit a day later
Even though it was bullshit lies while he was starin' y'all down
Cause he a jealous ass rapper that likes to pander to crowds
Let's get to panderin' now
Grippin', I'm eyein' somethin' crazy
He froze up, I rose up, you'll be lyin' in the daisies
The tiny little snub nose, got him flyin' to the gate
He, thought he was incredible, too (Incredible 2), 'til he saw the kid firin' (fire in) the baby
I see right through all the bullshit that this cat scan
Colt .45 and I use it, as a back hand
There's levels to this maze of a game, so let the gat blam
I'll ghost 'em, 'til he blue
'Cause what's a Dot compared to what I pack? Man! (Pac-Man)
I heard of his troops, there's birds to recoup
Got in the Benz, drive it and park
I peeked in his house, then seen him get out
Dot on the ledge, got out the car
I'm turnin' to Mook if I'm yearnin' to shoot
Plot on his death, shot on this mark
Gun to his head, then one in his chest
Dot on his head, dot on his heart!
What UP!? What up!?
I said, I'm gettin' at him
For your rhymes, I'm airin' at a mark
Donald Trump: the .45 splittin' families apart
Fuck this guy dumpin', if Dot want it, the blade Tony Hawk
Six buck fifties, cause I'll spin 'em into a 900
So keep comin' with that lost mentality
Your ignorance is leadin' to your loss in salary
YOU here to act like a boss and battle me
I'M here to put some life into your false reality

[Round 3: B. Dot]
I wanna share somethin' wit' you Mikey, I'm not sure if you remember this
It was back in the day when we would exchange, you know, have our little differences
You DM'd me an apology, that was man of you, but it was interestin' how you ended it
""Oh you fake Lux you wrong for bringin' the DM up.""
Nah nigga he was wrong for sendin' it
But let's get into it
We gon' skip right to the end
Where you say, ""As one of the good Europeans, it's hard to not to instinctively defend.""
Now, European instinct, that's what I wanna talk about
The first two rounds was the head shot, this the autopsy after we chalk him out
Let me walk you out
So there's no confusion about evolution
We migrated out of Africa up into Europe, I'm talkin' archaic humans
Used to the humid, 'til we get caught in the cold,  grey skies
UV rays couldn't get through them
In order to receive vitamin D that was heaven sent we lost melanin and turned into mutants
And that biology, fucks wit' your psychology
Appearance started to change and the mind gets caught up in rage
Dirty Europeans, until my ancestors the Moors went up into Spain and Italy and taught 'em to bath
Just flip through the page, this is history
This ain't facts I gotta spit, now look at you
Another dirty European gettin' washed up by an African again
I don't battle rap to win, I'm here to contend with the ancestry from which you descend
Them Greeks that came over to speak on my people
Called us ""Ethiots"" which meant ""burnt skin""
And y'all want some type of utopia
Well, I want revenge for Ethiopia
The only un-colonized country on the continent, that's why your Italian ancestors bombed the shit
And I'm astonished wit', the fact that blacks don't see we been beefin' with Italians since that Hannibal/Carthage shit
So it's that mobster hit
Dome shot to the back of the head, face first in a pasta dish
You make me sick
The fuck did you do to beat me when you a descendant of Mussolini?
Drugs? You use 'em freely
I highly doubt we can go that route
Every cell I see got brothers doin' years for grams of kiwi
Y'all peep me?
Haile Selassie, I know you prolly ain't catch it
But I practice ancestor worship, I'm just invokin' the spirit
I'm 'bout to hold up this mirror
I want to see yourself through a scientific perspective
Your genetics? Recessive
And that's what lead to the depression durin' your early adolescence
You're tellin' Suge, ""My depression had to do with my pops.""
You slit your wrists and got me up here killin' time, I guess we both on suicide watch
What should I do to my op'?
Let the heater fly? Nah, I'd rather slit your wrist
Put another white bitch in the tub, let him bleed and die
Me and 12 other niggas you battled can be the 13 Reasons Why
Aye, my nigga, we can't slice no even pie
You make a hit, run base get home safe, don't even slide
We hit and miss, that's three strikes, get life without even cryin'
You don't see this crime?
All these obstacles, you never got accustomed to the cops accosting you
Constantly, to the point you wanna take off the black skin like it's a costumed suit
What was so hard for you?
Couldn't meet daddy's expectations of graduation from them Harvard schools?
Pops was hard on you
So you went psychotic, turn to narcotics, sniffin' lines, pill pop and shoot just to get him off of you
You lost your screws
Thoughts confused
Ever since daddy left you've been alone and suicide been in the dome
You do all this bloggin', then wanna hide behind madness and use drugs, but when in Rome
We can't skip the tone
Yeah you rap black but still act Vic Damone
Mike my words can never hurt you
But you an addict and you know what they say about sticks and stones
Let's switch the mold
I'm not even from New York, but I know the history of the mafia that put
Drugs in the black communities that fuck nigga's mamas up and put nigga's pops in cuffs
Didn't want to sell to your own communities so y'all cut deals with black drug dealers to get the profits up
I can take you on a crash course on how they dump drugs in LA and came back around with the armor trucks
Put us on smack to kill us, now you on Smack gettin' killed
Nigga, karma sucks
But, be honest brah, would you swap wit' us?
Would you trade your life Mike and give up your white rights?
To be reincarnated as a young black durin' the crack era of the '80s when the crime spiked
It was beyond trife
They gave us guns and drugs in the dark, but in hindsight
What an evil genius, to make us move weight like limestone and put us all under that limelight
Now, would you trade your life Mike, to be a young black always under suspiscion
Get arrest cause you fit the description
Three years in prison never given a sentence
Solitary confinement, gettin' beat by the C.O.'s and the inmates, and all you do is defend it?
Til you finally release cause they couldn't provide evidence or give' em a witness
Are y'all seein' the difference?
Between your suicidal admittance you spit in your writtens
And a brother like Kalief Browder who needed relief, but couldn't get it 'cause the tone of his pigment
So suicide was committed
I don't condone it, but I get it
Here's a way for you to relate:
Think of a game where the whole system is against you, but you can't remotely control it
You've been chosen for moments
Your childhood trauma you went through you want this culture to notice is bogus
You sold weight on the corners, copped some piff, wasn't ""stop and frisk"" 'cause a white boy like you would never be noticed
You from Long Island, complainin' cause your pops was controllin'
He was on Riker's Island, detained him cause a backpack was stolen
I'm just exposin' the motives
White men lack resources so they go around stealin' wealth
Genocide, then when all men have died, he turn the gun around and kill himself
How destructive of you
And you wanna bring all of that into battle rap, how fucked up is you?
Man this culture needs substance from a brother, like me not substance abuse
I don't fuck wit' you dudes
I got no empathy for white male misery, somethin' gotta give
Rich whites wanna kill they selves, poor black just wanna live
This shit is sick
If you ask me, battle rap deserves a better switch
Like you should've died when you slit your wrists, Young B should've been never hit
You are evidence that white rappers are guests in hip-hop, never residents
Don't insult my intelligence
Claimin' you culturally relevant cause your suicidal embellishment
I've been negligent, but now I'm back to cast out demons like the Exorcist
The black man is god Mikey, and as always, the white man remains devilish
This western shit
And this that black African power
And if these was yo' last days Mikey, this was your last hour",URLtv,Heavy D & The Boyz,1994,"[72, 71, 65, 61, 52, 54, 50, 51, 42, 41, 40, 42, 44, 48, 51, 55, 69, 79, 84, 99]",20
123,Right Beside You,"I'm dancing in the shadows of life
And death is all around me tonight
I miss you making love to me right
Beside myself I'm holding you tight
Someone is waiting for me to rise
And dive into the ocean I cried
And I cried and I cried my baby to sleep
Beside myself my soul to keep

Right beside you I see
Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be
Right beside you always

We're dancing in the shade of the summer sun
The drums are playing
The change to come was yesterday
In the heat beside myself I need to keep

Right beside you I feel
Right beside you I am
Right beside you I kneel
Right beside you I stand
Right beside you I see
Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be
Right beside you always

Driving into town with the top down
Sun sinking low into the water I can feel your speed
One hand on the wheel one hand on my knee
I can tell you what I want you can do what you need
Darling nights are getting cooler in the city so close
There's a place we can do it somewhere right along the coast
We'll arrive on time just a little bit late
It's not a matter of style just a lesson in taste

I remember when I was your child
You made me up to be your lover
Now I'm standing right beside you
Other people still exsist
I don't pretend to love them less but darling
When you drive this way I lose my breath

Right beside you I feel
Right beside you I am
Right beside you I kneel
Right beside you I stand
Right beside you I see
Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be

Welcome to Earth, third rock from the sun

She walks into Smokey's
One hip at a time
Like a broken field runner
Slippin' through the lines
He likes the way she looks
So he calls a little wife
Says don't wait up for me
I'll be workin late tonight
Wife hangs up the phone bursts into tears
Calls her sister up and cries get over here

Sister tells her boyfriend be back in awhile
Boyfriend wants a beer, the store is just a mile
Leaves the motor runnin' he'll only be a minute
His car drives away with teenagers in it
Driver tells his buddies, got one life to live
They scream into the night, lets get it over with

Cause and effect, chain of events
All of the chaos makes perfect sense
When we're spinnin' round
Things come undone
Welcome to the Earth, third rock from the sun

The kid guns the gas, car starts to swerve
Heads for a semi-truck, jumps the curb
Truck hits a bigboy in the Shoney's parking lot
Flies through the air, takes out the bank clock
Clock strikes a light pole, transformer sparks
Lines go down, town goes dark

Waitress calls the cops says she saw it all
Swears a giant alien has landed at the mall
Cops ring up the mayor says there's panic in the street
Hate to wake you up but we can't find the chief
Mayor says use your head, if he ain't in his car
He's hiding from his wife, down at Smokey's bar

Cause and effect, chain of events
All of the chaos makes perfect sense
When we're spinnin' round
Things come undone
Welcome to the Earth, third rock from the sun

Cause and effect, chain of events
All of the chaos makes perfect sense

In a flash put that ass in the grass
Flag is half-mast, somebody must've passed
We're makin your ass drip into the stands
Fold my cash at last, my task to teach the class
And receive somethin' more than brass and some glass
Make a brother work hard, long and fast

[Verse 3: Lord Jamar]
Dreadlock, I set to rock for my block
Clock wax like crack, samplin' from old stacks
That's where the soul's at in this whole rap universe
We kick the funky tunes with a verse
Sun, moon and star, some boom for Jamar
To get me in the flow, now I'm read' to go
Set to show everybody in the party that we're nice
Without sippin' on Bacardi and ice

[Verse 4: Sadat X]
This style flash, Jamar'll be the shinin' star
No matter who you are, no matter who you are
I'll rape the tape, drive along the interstate
With weight, wipe the slate and mob the gate
And by fate, I'll avoid the court date, no legal aid
Everythin' is paid, why cause a tirade?
If the money ain't made, talkin' millions
But spendin' pennies and gettin' cheap shoes from Kenny's

Now, let's take time out to say peace to the Gods (Peace!)
Bust how I release 'cause this beat is hard
We be the squad Fard taught to rule
Take a thought to the top, now I drop the jewel

[Verse 5: Sadat X]
I push the Cadillac DeVille and still be real
I drive a garbage truck and not give a ...
I need to earn a buck fo' the year
I'm through with buyin' wild gear
Just somethin' I can wear, somethin' fly when I appear

[Verse 6: Lord Jamar]
Well, now we're here to take the gold and the cash for the bill fold
I told their ass to chill and they're still cold
Frozen 'cause they're not amongst the chosen one
Sun shines like a beacon, similar to how I'm speakin'

[Verse 7: Sadat X]
As I receive the mic for the last time, I clear up your past crime
All felonies can go, as long as you know
Brand Nubian will stand without the use of a band
We always work with a plan

135,You Mean The World To Me,"[Verse 1]
If you could give me one good reason
Why I should believe you
Believe in all the things that you tell
I would sure like to believe you
My heart wants to receive you
Just make me know that you are sincere
You know I'd love for you to lead me
And follow through completely
So won't you give me all I ask for?
And if you give your very best
To bring me happiness
I'll show you just how much I adore you

Now it's gonna take some workin'
But I believe you're worth it
Long as your intentions are good (so good)
There is just one way to show it
And boy I hope you know it
That no one could love you like I could
Lord knows I want to trust you
And always how I'd love you
I'm not sure if love is enough
And I will not be forsaken
And I hope there's no mistakin'
So tell me that you'll always be true

'Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything

[Bridge]
There's a feeling in my heart that I know I can't escape
So please don't let me fall, don't let it be too late
There's a time when words are good then they just get in the way
So show me how you feel, baby I'm for real
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
'Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

138,Your Love Is A...,"CHAPTER XX.

HUMAN BODY.

It would be difficult to enumerate the manifold forms of superstition which have, in most countries, in the course of past centuries, clustered round the human body. Many of these, too, may still be found scattered, here and there, throughout our own country. One of the most deep-rooted being palmistry, several allusions to which are made by Shakespeare.

According to a popular belief current in years past, a trembling of the body was supposed to be an indication of demoniacal possession. Thus, in the ""Comedy of Errors"" (iv. 4), the courtezan says of Antipholus of Ephesus—

""Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.""
and Pinch adds—

""I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,
To yield possession to my holy prayers,
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight;
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.""

In the ""Tempest"" (ii. 2), Caliban says to Stephano, ""Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I know it by thy trembling.""

It was formerly supposed that our bodies consisted of the four elements—fire, air, earth, and water, and that all diseases arose from derangement in the due proportion of these elements. Thus in Antony's eulogium on Brutus in ""Julius Cæsar"" (v. 5) this theory is alluded to:—

""His life was gentle, and the elements
So mix’d in him that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world, 'this was a man!'""


In ""Twelfth Night"" (ii. 3) it is also noticed:—

""Sir Toby. Do not our life consist of the four elements?
Sir Andrew. ’Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists of eating and drinking.
Sir Toby. Thou art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink. Marian, I say! a stoop of wine!""

In ""Antony and Cleopatra"" (v. 2), Shakespeare makes the latter say—

""I am fire and air, my other elements
I give to baser life.""

This theory is the subject, too, of the 44th and 45th sonnets, and is set forth at large in its connection with physic in Sir Philip Sydney's ""Arcadia"":—

""O elements, by whose (men say) contention,
Our bodies be in living power maintained,
Was this man's death the fruit of your dissension?
O physic's power, which (some say) hath restrained
Approach of death, alas, thou keepest meagerly,
When once one is for Atropos distrained,
Great be physicians’ brags, but aide is beggarly
When rooted moisture fails, or groweth drie
They leave off all, and say, death comes too eagerly.
They are but words therefore that men doe buy
Of any, since God Esculapius ceased.""

This notion was substantially adopted by Galen, and embraced by the physicians of the olden times.

Blood.—In old phraseology this word was popularly used for disposition or temperament. In ""Timon of Athens"" (iv. 2), Flavius says:—""Strange, unusual blood, when man's worst sin is, he does too much good!"" In the opening passage of ""Cymbeline"" it occurs in the same sense—

""You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
Still seem as does the king.""

the meaning evidently being that, ""our dispositions no longer obey the influences of heaven; they are courtiers, and still seem to resemble the disposition the king is in.""

Again, in ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (ii. 3)—""Wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory.""

Once more, in ""King Lear"" (iv. 2), the Duke of Albany says to Goneril—

""Were't my fitness
To let these hands obey my blood,
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
Thy flesh and bones.""

Again, the phrase ""to be in blood,"" was a term of the chase, meaning to be in good condition, to be vigorous. In ""1 Henry VI."" (iv. 2), Talbot exclaims—

""If we be English deer, be then in blood;
Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch.""

—the expression being put in opposition to ""rascal,"" which was the term for the deer when lean and out of condition. In ""Love's Labour's Lost"" (iv. 2), Holofernes says—""The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood.""

The notion that the blood may be thickened by emotional influences, is mentioned by Polixenes in the ""Winter's Tale"" (i. 2), where he speaks of ""thoughts that would thick my blood."" In King John's temptation of Hubert to murder Arthur (iii. 3), it is thus referred to—.

""Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-sick,
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,"" etc.

Red blood was considered a traditionary sign of courage. Hence in the ""Merchant of Venice"" (ii. x), the Prince of Morocco, when addressing himself to Portia, and urging his claims for her hand, says—

""Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
Where Phoebus’ fire scarce thaws the icicles,
And let us make incision for your love,
To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.""


Again, in the present play, cowards are said to ""have livers as white as milk,"" and an effeminate man is termed a ""milksop."" Macbeth, too, (v. 3) calls one of his frighted soldiers a ""lily-liver’d boy."" And in ""King Lear"" (ii. 2), the Earl of Kent makes use of the same phrase. In illustration of this notion Mr Douce 1 quotes from Bartholomew Glantville, who says—""Reed clothes have been layed upon deed men in remembrance of theyr hardynes and boldnes, whyle they were in theyr bloudde.""

The absence of blood in the liver as the supposed property of a coward, originated, says Dr Bucknill, 2 in the old theory of the circulation of the blood, which explains Sir Toby's remarks on his dupe in ""Twelfth Night"" (iii. 2)—""For Andrew, if he were opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of the anatomy.""

We may quote here a notion referred to in ""Lucrece"" (1747–50) that, ever since the sad death of Lucrece, corrupted blood has watery particles—

""About the mourning and congealed face
Of that blood a watery rigol goes,
Which seems to weep upon the tainted place:
And ever since, as pitying Lucrece's woes,
Corrupted blood some watery token shows;
And blood untainted still doth red abide,
Blushing at that which is so putrified.""

Brain.—By old anatomists the brain was divided into three ventricles, in the hindermost of which they placed the memory. That this division was not unknown to Shakespeare, is apparent from ""Love's Labour's Lost"" (iv. 2), where Holofernes says—""A foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of memory."" Again, Lady Macbeth (i. 7), speaking of Duncan's two chamberlains, says—

""Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory, the warder of the brain,
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
A limbeck only.""


The ""third ventricle is the cerebellum, by which the brain is connected with the spinal marrow and the rest of the body; the memory is posted in the cerebellum like a warder or sentinel to warn the reason against attack. Thus, when the memory is converted by intoxication into a mere fume,  then it fills the brain itself—the receipt or receptacle of reason, which thus becomes like an alembic or cap of a still.""

A popular nickname, in former times, for the skull, was ""brain-pan;"" to which Cade, in ""2 Henry VI."" (iv. 10), refers:—""Many a time, but for a sallet, my brain-pan had been cleft with a brown bill."" The phrase ""to beat out the brains"" is used by Shakespeare metaphorically in the sense of defeat or destroy; just as now-a-days we popularly speak of knocking a scheme on the head. In ""Measure for Measure"" (v. 1), the Duke addressing Isabel tells her:—

""O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity of his death
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain’d my purpose.""

The expression ""to bear a brain,"" which is used by the Nurse in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (i. 3):—

""Nay, I do bear a brain,""
denoted ""much mental capacity either of attention, ingenuity, or remembrance."" 3 Thus in Marston's ""Dutch Courtezan"" (1605), we read:—

""My silly husband, alas! knows nothing of it, ’tis
I that must beare a braine for all.""

The notion of the brain as the seat of the soul is mentioned by Prince Henry, who, referring to King John (v. 7), says:—

""His pure brain
Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house
Doth by the idle comments that it makes
Foretell the ending of mortality.""


Ear.—According to a well-known superstition, much credited in days gone by, and still extensively believed, a tingling of the right ear is considered lucky, being supposed to denote that a friend is speaking well of one, whereas a tingling of the left is said to imply the opposite. This notion, however, varies in different localities, as in some places it is the tingling of the left ear which denotes the friend, and the tingling of the right ear the enemy. In ""Much ado about Nothing"" (iii. 1), Beatrice asks Ursula and Hero, who had been talking of her:—

""What fire is in mine ears?""

the reference, no doubt, being to this popular fancy. Sir Thomas Browne ascribes the idea to the belief in guardian angels, who touch the right or left ear according as the conversation is favourable or not to the person.

In Shakespeare's day it was customary for young gallants to wear a long lock of hair dangling by the ear, known as a ""love-lock."" Hence in ""Much ado about Nothing"" (iii. 3), the Watch identifies one of his delinquents:—

""I know him; a’ wears a lock.""

Again, further on (v. 1), Dogberry gives another allusion to this practice:—""He wears a key in his ear, and a lock hanging by it.""

An expression of endearment current in years gone by was ""to bite the ear."" In ""Romeo and Juliet"" (ii. 4), Mercutio says:—

""I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.""

a passage which is explained in Nares’ (""Glossary,"" i. p. 8i), by the following one from Ben Jonson's ""Alchemist"" (ii. 3):—

""Mammon. Th’ hast witch’d me, rogue; take, go.
Face. Your jack, and all, sir.
Mammon. Slave, I could bite thine ear . . . Away, thou dost not care for me!""

Gifford, in his notes on Jonson's Works (ii. p. 184), says the odd mode of expressing pleasure by biting the ear seems ""to be taken from the practice of animals, who, in a playful mood, bite each other's ears.""

Whilst speaking of the ear, it may be noted that the so-called want of ear for music has been regarded as a sign of an austere disposition. Thus Cæsar says of Cassius (i. 2):—

""He hears no music,
Seldom he smiles.""

There is too the well-known passage in the ""Merchant of Venice"" (v. 1):—

""The man that hath no music in himself,
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils.""

According to the Italian proverb:—""Whom God loves not, that man loves not music.""

Elbow.—According to a popular belief the itching of the elbow denoted an approaching change of some kind or other. 2 Thus in ""1 Henry IV."" (v. 1), the King speaks of—

""Fickle changelings and poor discontents,
Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
Of hurlyburly innovation.""

With this idea we may compare similar ones connected with other parts of the body. Thus in ""Macbeth"" (iv. 1), one of the Witches exclaims:—

""By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.""

Again, in ""Troilus and Cressida"" (ii. 1), Ajax says, ""My fingers itch,""  and an itching palm was said to be an indication that the person would shortly receive money. Hence it denoted a hand ready to receive bribes. Thus in ""Julius Cæsar"" (iv. 3), Brutus says to Cassius:—

""Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemn’d to have an itching palm;
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers.""

So in ""Merry Wives of Windsor"" (ii. 3), Shallow says:—""If I see a sword out, my finger itches to make one.""


Again, in ""Othello"" (iv. 3), poor Desdemona says to Emilia:—

""Mine eyes do itch;
Doth that bode weeping?""

Grose alludes to this superstition, and says, ""when the right eye itches, the party affected will shortly cry; if the left, they will laugh."" The itching of the eye as an omen is spoken of by Theocritus, who says:—

""My right eye itches now, and I will see my love.""

Eyes.—A good deal of curious folk-lore has, at one time or another, clustered round the eye; and the well-known superstition known as the ""evil eye"" has already been described in the chapter on ""Birth and Baptism."" Blueness above the eye was, in days gone by, considered a sign of love, and as such is alluded to by Rosalind in ""As You Like It"" (iii. 2), where she enumerates the marks of love to Orlando:—""A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not.""

The term ""baby in the eye"" was sportively applied by our forefathers to the miniature reflection of himself, which a person may see in the pupil of another's eye. In ""Timon of Athens"" (i. 2), one of the Lords says:—

""Joy had the like conception in our eyes,
And at that instant like a babe sprung up.""

—an allusion probably being made to this whimsical notion. It is often referred to by old writers, as for instance by Drayton in his ""Ideas""—

""But O, see, see! we need enquire no further,
Upon your lips the scarlet drops are found,
And in your eye, the boy that did the murder.""

We may compare the expression, ""to look babies in the eyes,"" a common amusement of lovers in days gone by. In Beaumont and Fletcher's ""Loyal Subject"" (iii. 2), Theodore asks—

""Can ye look babies, sisters,
In the young gallants’ eyes, and twirl their band-strings?""

And once more to quote from Massinger's ""Renegado"" (ii. 4), where Donusa says:—

""When a young lady wrings you by the hand, thus,
Or with an amorous touch presses your foot;
Looks babies in your eyes, plays with your locks."" &c.

Another old term for the eyes was ""crystal,"" which is used by Pistol to his wife, Mrs Quickly, in ""Henry V."" (ii. 3):—

""Therefore Caveto be thy counsellor.
Go, clear thy crystals;""
that is, dry thine eyes.

In ""Romeo and Juliet"" (i. 2), the phrase is employed by Benvolio:—

""Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d
Your lady's love against some other maid,"" &c.

It also occurs in Beaumont and Fletcher's ""Double Marriage"" (v. 3), where Juliana exclaims:—

""Sleep you, sweet glasses!
An everlasting slumber crown those crystals.""

The expression ""wall-eyed"" denotes, says Dyce (""Glossary,"" p. 486), ""eyes with a white or pale-gray iris—glaring-eyed."" It is used by Lucius in ""Titus Andronicus"" (v. 1):—

""Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey
This growing image of thy fiend-like face?""

In ""King John"" (iv. 3), Salisbury speaks of ""wall-eyed wrath.""

Brockett, in his ""Glossary of North Country Words,"" says:—""In those parts of the north with which I am best acquainted, persons are said to be wall-eyed when the white of the eye is very large and to one side; on the borders 'sic folks' are considered lucky. The term is also occasionally applied to horses with similar eyes, though its wider general acceptation seems to be when the iris of the eye is white, or of a very pale colour. A wall-eyed horse sees perfectly well.""

Face.—A common expression ""to play the hypocrite,"" or feign, was ""to face."" So in ""1 Henry VI."" (v. 3), Suffolk declares how—

""Fair Margaret knows
That Suffolk does not flatter, face, or feign.""

Hence the name of one of the characters in Ben Jonson's ""Alchemist."" So in the ""Taming of the Shrew"" (ii. 1):—

""Yet have I faced it with a card of ten.""


The phrase, also, ""to face me down,"" implied insisting upon anything in opposition. So in the ""Comedy of Errors"" (iii.), Antipholus of Ephesus says:—

""But here's a villain that would face me down
He met me on the mart.""

Feet.—Stumbling has from the earliest period been considered ominous. Thus Cicero mentions it amongst the superstitions of his day; and numerous instances of this unlucky act have been handed down from bygone times. We are told by Ovid how Myrrha, on her way to Cinyra's chamber stumbled thrice, but was not deterred by the omen from an unnatural and fatal crime; and Tibullus (Lib. I., Eleg. iii. 20), refers to it:—

""O! quoties ingressus iter, mihi tristia dixi,
Offensum in porta signa dedisse pedem.""

This superstition is alluded to by Shakespeare, who in ""3 Henry VI."" (iv. 7) makes Gloucester say:—

""For many men that stumble at the threshold
Are well foretold that danger lurks within.""

In ""Richard III."" (iii. 4), Hastings relates:—

""Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble
And startled, when he look’d upon the Tower,
As loath to bear me to the slaughter house.""

In the same way, stumbling at a grave has been regarded as equally unlucky, and in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (v. 3), Friar Laurence says:—

""How oft to-night
Have my old feet stumbled at graves.""

Hair.—From time immemorial there has been a strong antipathy to red hair, which originated, according to some antiquarians, in a tradition that Judas had hair of this colour.

One reason, it may be, why the dislike to it arose, was that this colour was considered ugly and unfashionable, and on this account a person with red hair would soon be regarded with contempt. It has been conjectured, too, that the odium took its rise from the aversion to the red-haired Danes. In ""As You Like It"" (iii. 4), Rosalind, when speaking of Orlando, refers to this notion:—

""His very hair is of the dissembling colour.""
Whereupon Celia replies:—

""Something browner than Judas's.""

Yellow hair, too, was in years gone by regarded with ill-favour, and esteemed a deformity. In ancient pictures and tapestries both Cain and Judas are represented with yellow beards, in allusion to which Simple, in the ""Merry Wives of Windsor"" (i. 4), when interrogated, says of his master, ""He hath but a little wee face, with a little yellow beard—a Cain coloured beard.""

In speaking of beards, it may be noted that formerly they gave rise to various customs. Thus, in Shakespeare's day, dyeing beards was a fashionable custom, and so Bottom, in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (i. 2), is perplexed as to what beard he should wear when acting before the Duke. He says, ""I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.""

To mutilate a beard in any way was considered an irreparable outrage, a practice to which Hamlet refers (ii. 2):—

""Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?""

And in ""King Lear"" (iii. 7), Gloucester exclaims—

""By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly done
To pluck me by the beard.""

Stroking the beard before a person spoke was preparatory to favour. Hence in ""Troilus and Cressida"" (i. 3), Ulysses, when describing how Achilles asks Patroclus to imitate certain of their chiefs, represents him as saying:—

""Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
As he being drest to some oration.""

Again, the phrase ""to beard"" meant to oppose face to face in a hostile manner. Thus in ""1 Henry IV."" (iv. 1), Douglas declares:—

""No man so potent breathes upon the ground
But I will beard him.""

And in ""1 Henry VI."" (i. 3), the Bishop of Winchester says to Gloucester:—

""Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face.""

It seems also to have been customary to swear by the beard, an allusion to which is made by Touchstone in ""As You Like It"" (i. 2):—""Stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave.""

We may also compare what Nestor says in ""Troilus and Cressida"" (iv. 5):—

""By this white beard, I’ld fight with thee to-morrow.""

Our ancestors paid great attention to the shape of their beards, certain cuts being appropriated to certain professions and ranks. In ""King Henry V."" (iii. 6), Gower speaks of ""a beard of the general's cut."" As Mr Staunton remarks, ""Not the least odd among the fantastic fashions of our forefathers was the custom of distinguishing certain professions and classes by the cut of the beard; thus we hear, inter alia, of the bishop's beard, the judge's beard, the soldier's beard, the citizen's beard, and even the clown's beard."" Randle Holme tells us, ""The broad or cathedral beard [is] so-called because bishops and gown-men of the church anciently did wear such beards."" By the military man, the cut adopted was known as the stiletto or spade. The beard of the citizen was usually worn round, as Mrs Quickly describes it in ""Merry Wives of Windsor"" (i. 4), ""like a glover's paring knife."" The clown's beard was left bushy or untrimmed.

Malone quotes from an old ballad entitled ""Le Prince d’ Amour,"" 1660:—

""Next the clown doth out-rush
With the beard of the bush.""

According to an old superstition, much hair on the head has been supposed to indicate an absence of intellect, a notion referred to by Antipholus of Syracuse in the ""Comedy of Errors"" (ii. 2):—""There's many a man hath more hair than wit."" In the ""Two Gentlemen of Verona"" (iii. 1), the same proverbial sentence is mentioned by Speed. Malone quotes the following lines upon Suckling's ""Aglaura,"" as an illustration of this saying 1:—

""This great voluminous pamphlet may be said
To be like one that hath more hair than head;
More excrement than body: trees which sprout
With broadest leaves have still the smallest fruit.""

Steevens gives an example from ""Florio"":—""A tisty-tosty wag-feather, more haire than wit.""

Excessive fear has been said to cause the hair to stand on end; an instance of which Shakespeare records in ""Hamlet"" (iii. 4), in that celebrated passage where the Queen, being at a loss to understand her son's strange appearance during his conversation with the Ghost, which is invisible to her, says:—

""And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
Starts up, and stands an end.""

A further instance occurs in the ""Tempest"" (i. 2), where Ariel, describing the shipwreck, graphically relates how—

""All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring—then like reeds, not hair—
Was the first man that leap’d.""
Again, Macbeth says (i. 3):—

""Why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair?""

And further on he says (v. 5):—

""The time has been, my senses would have cool’d
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in’t.""

In ""2 Henry VI."" (iii. 2), it is referred to by Suffolk as a sign of madness:—

""Mine hair be fix’d on end, as one distract.""

And once more, in ""King Richard III."" (i. 3), Hastings declares

""Mine hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.""

Another popular notion, mentioned by Shakespeare, is that sudden fright or great sorrow will cause the hair to turn white. In ""1 Henry IV."" (ii. 4), Falstaff, in his speech to Prince Henry, tells him:—

""Thy father's beard is turned white with the news.""

Among the many instances recorded to establish the truth of this idea, it is said that the hair and beard of the Duke of Brunswick whitened in twenty-four hours, upon his hearing that his father had been mortally wounded in the battle of Auerstadt. Marie Antoinette, the unfortunate queen of Louis XVI., found her hair suddenly changed by her troubles; and a similar change happened to Charles I., when he attempted to escape from Carisbroke Castle. Mr Timbs, in his ""Doctors and Patients"" (1876, p. 201), says that ""chemists have discovered that hair contains an oil, a mucous substance, iron, oxide of manganese, phosphate and carbonate of iron, flint, and a large proportion of sulphur. White hair contains also phosphate of magnesia, and its oil is nearly colourless. When hair becomes suddenly white from terror, it is probably owing to the sulphur absorbing the oil, as in the operation of whitening woollen cloths.""

Hair was formerly used metaphorically for the colour, complexion, or nature of a thing. In ""1 Henry IV."" (iv. 1), Worcester says

""I would your father had been here,
The quality and hair of our attempt
Brooks no division.""


In Beaumont and Fletcher's ""Nice Valour,"" it is so used:—

""A lady of my hair cannot want pitying.""
Hands.—Various superstitions have at different times clustered round the hand. Thus in palmistry a moist one is said to denote an amorous constitution. In ""Othello"" (iii. 4), we have the following allusion to this popular notion

""Othello. Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.
Desdemona. It yet have felt no age nor known no sorrow.
Othello. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.""

Again in ""Antony and Cleopatra"" (i. 2), Iras says—""There's a palm presages chastity;"" whereupon Charmian adds—""If an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear."" And in the ""Comedy of Errors"" (iii. 2), Dromio of Syracuse speaks of barrenness as ""hard in the palm of the hand.""

A dry hand, however, has been supposed to denote age and debility. In ""2 Henry IV."" (i. 2), the Lord Chief Justice enumerates this amongst the characteristics of such a constitution.

In the ""Merchant of Venice"" (ii. 2), Launcelot, referring to the language of palmistry, calls the hand ""the table,"" meaning thereby the whole collection of lines on the skin, within the hand:—""Well, if any man in Italy hath a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune."" He then alludes to one of the lines in the hand, known as the ""line of life:""—""Go to, here's a simple line of life.""

In the ""Two Noble Kinsmen"" (iii. 5), palmistry is further mentioned:—

""Gaoler's Daughter. Give me your hand.
Gerrold. Why?
Gaoler's Daughter. I can tell your fortune.""

It was once supposed that little worms were bred in the fingers of idle servants. To this notion Mercutio refers in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (i. 4), where, in his description of Queen Mab, he says:—

""Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little worm
Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid.""


This notion is alluded to by John Banister, a famous surgeon in Shakespeare's day, in his ""Compendious Chyrurgerie"" (1585, p. 465):—""We commonly call them worms, which many women, sitting in the sunshine, can cunningly picke out with needles, and are most common in the handes.""

A popular term formerly in use for the nails on the ten fingers was the ""ten commandments,"" which, says Nares, 1 ""doubtless led to the swearing by them, as by the real commandments."" Thus, in ""2 Henry VI."" (i. 3), the Duchess of Gloucester says to the Queen:—

""Could I come near your beauty with my nails
I’ld set my ten commandments in your face.""

In the same way the fingers were also called the ""ten bones,"" as a little further on in the same play where Peter swears ""by these ten bones.""

The phrase ""of his hands"" was equivalent to ""of his inches, or of his size; a hand being the measure of four inches."" So in the ""Merry Wives of Windsor"" (i. 4), Simple says:—""Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his hands as any is between this and his head,"" ""the expression being used probably for the sake of a jocular equivocation in the word tall, which meant either bold or high.""

Again, in the ""Winter's Tale"" (v. 2), the Clown tells the Shepherd:—""I'll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk; but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.""

A proverbial phrase for being tall from necessity was ""to blow the nail."" In ""3 Henry VI."" (ii. 5), the King says:—

""When dying clouds contend with growing light
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
Can neither call it perfect day or night.""

It occurs in the song at the end of ""Love's Labour's Lost"":—

""And Dick the shepherd blows his nails.""

""To bite the thumb"" at a person implied an insult; hence in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (i. 1), Sampson says:—""I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they hear it.""

The thumb in this action we are told ""represented a fig, and the whole was equivalent to a fig for you."" Decker in his ""Dead Term"" (1608), speaking of the various groups that daily frequented St Pauls’ Church, says:—""What swearing is there, what shouldering, what justling, what jeering, what byting of thumbs, to beget quarrels?""

Hare-lip.—A cleft lip so called from its supposed resemblance to the upper lip of a hare. It was popularly believed to be the mischievous act of an elf or malicious fairy. So in ""King Lear"" (iii. 4), Edgar says of Gloucester:—""This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet:—He squints the eye and makes the hare-lip."" In the ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" (v. 2), Oberon, in blessing the bridal bed of Theseus and Hippolyta, says:—""Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,"" &c., ""shall upon their children be.""

The expression ""hang the lip"" meant to drop the lip in sullenness or contempt. Thus in ""Troilus and Cressida"" (iii. 1), Helen explains why her brother Troilus is not abroad by saying:—""He hangs the lip at something."" We may compare, too, the words in ""1 Henry IV."" (ii. 4):—""A foolish hanging of thy nether lip.""

Head—According to the old writers on physiognomy, a round head denoted foolishness, a notion to which reference is made by ""Cleopatra"" (iii. 3), in the following dialogue, who enquiring about Octavia, says to the messenger—

""Bear’st thou her face in mind? Is’t long or round?
Messenger. Round even to faultiness.
Cleopatra. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.""

In Hill's ""Pleasant History,"" etc. (1613) we read:—""The head very round, to be forgetful and foolish."" Again—""The head long, to be prudent and wary.""

Heart.—The term ""broken heart"" as commonly applied to death from excessive grief, is not a vulgar error, but may arise from violent muscular exertion, or strong mental emotions. In ""Macbeth"" (iv. 3) Malcolm says:—

""The grief that does not speak
Whispers the o’er fraught heart and bids it break.""

We may compare, too, Queen Margaret's words to Buckingham in ""King Richard III."" (i. 3) where she prophesies how Gloucester—

""Shall split thy very heart with sorrow.""

Mr Timbs, in his ""Mysteries of Life, Death, and Futurity"" (1861, p. 149), has given the following note on the subject ""This affection was, it is believed, first described by Harvey; but since his day several cases have been observed. Morgagni has recorded a few examples: amongst them, that of George II., who died suddenly of this disease in 1760; and, what is very curious, Morgagni himself fell a victim to the same malady. Dr Elliotson, in his Lumleyan Lectures on Diseases of the Heart in 1839, stated that he had only seen one instance; but in the 'Cyclopædia of Practical Medicine,' Dr Townsend gives a table of twenty-five cases, collected from various authors.""

In olden times the heart was esteemed the seat of the understanding. Hence in ""Coriolanus"" (i. 1) the Citizen speaks of ""the counsellor heart."" With the ancients, also, the heart was considered the seat of courage, to which Shakespeare refers in ""Julius Cæsar"" (iii 2):—

""Ser. Plucking the entrails of an offering forth
They could not find a heart within the beast.
Cæs. The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
Cæsar should be a beast without a heart,
If he should stay at home to-day for fear.""

Liver.—By a popular notion the liver was anciently supposed to be the seat of love, a superstition to which Shakespeare frequently alludes. Thus, in ""Love's Labour's Lost"" (iv. 3), Biron, after listening to Longaville's sonnet, remarks:—

""This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
A green goose a goddess; pure, pure idolatry.""
In ""Much ado about Nothing"" (iv. 1), Friar Francis says:—

""If ever love had interest in his liver.""

Again, in ""As You Like It"" (iii. 2), Rosalind professing to be able to cure love, which, he says, is ""merely a madness,"" says to Orlando, ""I will take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in’t."" In ""Twelfth Night"" (ii. 4), the Duke, speaking of women's love, says:—

""Their love may be call’d appetite,
No motion of the liver, but the palate,"" &c.

And Fabian (ii. 5), alluding to Olivia's supposed letter to Malvolio, says:—

""This wins him, liver and all.""
Once more, in ""Merry Wives of Windsor"" (ii. 1), Pistol alludes to the liver as being the inspirer of amorous passions, for, speaking of Falstaff, he refers to his loving Ford's wife ""with liver burning hot."" Douce says, ""there is some reason for thinking that this superstition was borrowed from the Arabian physicians, or at least adopted by them; for in the Turkish tales, an amorous tailor is made to address his wife by the titles of 'thou corner of my liver, and soul of my love;' and in another place the King of Syria, who had sustained a temporary privation of his mistress, is said to have had 'his liver, which had been burnt up by the loss of her, cooled and refreshed at the sight of her.'"" According to an old Latin distich—

""Cor sapit, pulmo loquitur, fel commoret iras
Splen ridere facit, cogit amare jecur.""
Bartholomæus in his ""De Proprietatibus Rerum"" (lib. v. 39), informs us that ""the liver is the place of voluptuousness and lyking of the flesh.""

Moles.—These have from time immemorial been regarded as ominous, and special attention has been paid by the superstitious to their position on the body. 3 In ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (v. 1), a mole on a child is spoken of by Oberon as a bad omen, who, speaking of the three who had lately been married, says:—

""And the blots of Nature's hand
Shall not in their issue stand;
Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,
Nor mark prodigious, such as are
Despised in nativity,
Shall upon their children be.""

Iachimo (""Cymbeline,"" ii. 2) represents Imogene as having—

""On her left breast
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
I’ the bottom of a cowslip.""

And we may also compare the words of Cymbeline (v. 5)—

""Guiderius had
Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
It was a mark of wonder.""

Spleen.—This was once supposed to be the cause of laughter, a notion probably referred to by Isabella in ""Measure for Measure"" (ii. 2), where, telling how the angels weep over the follies of men she adds—

""Who, with our spleens,
Would all themselves laugh mortal.""

In ""Taming of the Shrew"" (Induction, sc. i.), the lord says:—

""Haply my presence
May well abate the over-merry spleen
Which otherwise would grow into extremes.""

And Maria says to Sir Toby in ""Twelfth Night"" (iii. 2):—""If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me.""

Wits.—With our early writers, the five senses were usually called the ""five wits."" So, in ""Much ado about Nothing"" (i. 1), Beatrice says:—""In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one."" In his 141st Sonnet, Shakespeare makes a distinction between wits and senses—

""But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee.""


The five wits, says Staunton, being ""common wit, imagination, fantasy, estimation, memory."" Johnson says the ""wits seem to have been reckoned five, by analogy to the five senses, or the five inlets of ideas."" In ""King Lear"" (iii. 4), we find the expression, ""Bless thy five wits.""

According to a curious fancy, eating beef was supposed to impair the intellect, to which notion Shakespeare has several allusions. Thus, in ""Twelfth Night"" (i. 3), Sir Andrew says—""Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a great eater of beef and I believe, that does harm to my wit."" In ""Troilus and Cressida"" (ii. 1), Thersites says to Ajax—""The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel beef-witted lord!""",T.F.

I grab the mic in a RAGE...

[Verse 1: Wyclef]
You maintain to put a negro in pain you used to diss me
""You sure you wanna hang with old Eddie Kane?""
Ain't nuttin wrong, so snap your head to the song
Word is bond, you get wrong, I'll have you sing like Louis Armstrong
''And I say to myself, what a wonderful world''
But what the fuck was so wonderful
Bout picking cotton -- on a farm?!
The harder they come, the harder they fall
So come one come all
Don't stall or I'mma stick you like a voodoo doll
Doors locked stop draw for the count, who drops?
Ten-nine-eight-seven-six-five-four-three-two-one-
-you-slept-on-a-kid-from-the-boondocks
Out of Hooterville land of the ill kill
Bellsburg Viking so you know I'm top ranking Phil
Some say newcomer like the yuma but save the rumor
Cause I've been rockin ever since eighty-three
When I used to rock my Pumas
Rap, narcotic psychotic, so hear the statistic
One out of ten, I'm passin the mic next time I'll get WICKED
Heard the man who went before, got intimated
You tried to gas me up, too much gas, you got intoxicated
You wasn't ready for the real'n, dealin, chillin
Wyclef, no competition when I'm bringin pure death
I'm jumpin like a monkey to get mines off
A-from a caterpillar, to the mic moth

You put, one and one together now you think you a rapper
Baseball cap backward, forearms swingin like a hip-hopper
You do the rhyme, thinkin no one can stop ya
I be the followin that chop ya down as I clock ya, hah
When I say five-oh, I mean fifty not guns or cops
Now here's the heavyweight knocker, the freedom fighter
Natural rhythm rock a mic I always rhyme I'm never drinkin vodka
Any old style, I throw it in a locker

[Lauryn Hill]
Well I'm a Gucci rocker, I never drank no vodka
Me got no bag of cheeba cause I never had a knocker
My cousin's name was Shaka, for short we called him 'Aka
I flip it on wack MC's because to me they flow like caca

[Pras]
You boogie move the groove, nothing to prove you lose
Your style remind of yesterday, old news
Sad sung blues who's, chose the one to feel the pain
Or bring the cane, tick-tock I come to pick your lock
It's not for capital gain
So watch out for the remain, or cry from bloodstain
Bustin nuts, bustin style
Gettin buckwild some think I'm the descendant of a wilder child
Comin on the mic, from a higher level
Broke is no joke, choke the hell out of the devil

[Wyclef]
Yo who got the power, to make a man raise from the dead?
Some said that it was Jesus, they said he was a notty dread
But I don't mean to confuse a world that's confused
Mind's atomic, so like a bomb, let me drop it
Can't get too deep, cause some sleep while I wake
In a dream that's made of wine but let me bring it back to grapes
Teacher, explain the parable, it's simple:
It's easier for the camel to go through the eye of a needle
Than for you to enter the kingdom, or battle
And walk away, with the title when I get, brutal
Feelings are mutual so sign your life, to Prudential
Don't even flinch, the other becomin spiritual
There's six million ways to die but choose four
Cause I can still be in the desert buttnaked and be HARDCORE!

[Lauryn Hill]
When ? checks that means pump your fist
Remember Moses people, this is Exodus
Don't try to stop this, the force comes from Genesis
Them who did us wrong, ask the Lord for forgiveness
The land that I’m from ain’t the land of the dumb
We droppin the bass drum, then we ??
You can’t kill the battle with a horn, blam blam, Silly Joshua
So march to St. Lawrence
Yo march I got your back, march!

Great things can come in a small bag

If this love is gonna last forever

[Verse 1]
I remember (back in the days)
When I just a little niggarole
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go tagging along
Nagging if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggas singing the blues
That be always trying to bag with the shag and karate shoes
Sayin ""Yo momma black; his momma this, his momma that""
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows
Then switch to playing ding dong ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers cuz they bell wearing Gazelles
And if they really had money raised be sporting BK's
And, all the girls had they turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

I'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87
'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high
In 7th grade, I hated school (wish it'd blown up)
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)
But let me finish this reminiscing and telling
'Bout when girls was belling tight corduroys like for the boys
Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks
And eating pickles, with tootsie pops
And it don't stop, I'm glad cause when J.J. Fad hit
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies had Poison airbrushed on they asses
Dudes had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with
The fat laces cause it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishing all I had to do now, was finish homework
It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holding
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbing
You steady bobbing your head and I'm paid, so I got it made
But, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central L.A
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first

But someday you'll change your mind""

Grabbed her by the arm
Said, ""If you do what I tell you to, there
Won't be any harm""

Here is a very vicious circle. And how to get out of it? In the first place, we have to break the love-ideal, once and for all. Love, as we see, is not the only dynamic. Taking love in its greatest sense, and making it embrace every form of sympathy, every flow from the great sympathetic centers of the human body, still it is not the whole of the dynamic flow, it is only the one-half. There is always the other voluntary flow to reckon with, the intense motion of independence and singleness of self, the pride of isolation, and the profound fulfillment through power.

The very first thing of all to be recognized is the danger of idealism. It is the one besetting sin of the human race. It means the fall into automatism, mechanism, and nullity.

We know that life issues spontaneously at the great nodes of the psyche, the great nerve-centers. At first these are four only: then, after puberty, they become eight: later there may still be an extension of the dynamic consciousness, a further polarization. But eight is enough at the moment.

First at four, and then at eight dynamic centers of the human body, the human nervous system, life starts spontaneously into being. The soul bursts day by day into fresh impulses, fresh desire, fresh purpose, at these our polar centers. And from these dynamic generative centers issue the vital currents which put us into connection with our object. We have really no will and no choice, in the first place. It is our soul which acts within us, day by day unfolding us according to our own nature.

From the objective circuits and from the subjective circuits which establish and fulfill themselves at the first four centers of consciousness we derive our first being, our child-being, and also our first mind, our child-mind. By the objective circuits we mean those circuits which are established between the self and some external object: mother, father, sister, cat, dog, bird, or even tree or plant, or even further still, some particular place, some particular inanimate object, a knife or a chair or a cap or a doll or a wooden horse. For we must insist that every object which really enters effectively into our lives does so by direct connection. If I love my mother, it is because there is established between me and her a direct, powerful circuit of vital magnetism, call it what you will, but a direct flow of dynamic vital interchange and intercourse. I will not call this vital flow a force, because it depends on the incomprehensible initiative and control of the individual soul or self. Force is that which is directed only from some universal will or law. Life is always individual, and therefore never controlled by one law, one God. And therefore, since the living really sway the universe, even if unknowingly; therefore there is no one universal law, even for the physical forces. Because we insist that even the sun depends, for its heartbeat, its respiration, its pivotal motion, on the beating hearts of men and beast, on the dynamic of the soul-impulse in individual creatures. It is from the aggregate heartbeat of living individuals, of we know not how many or what sort of worlds, that the sun rests stable.

Which may be dismissed as metaphysics, although it is quite as valid or even as demonstrable as Newton's Law of Gravitation, which law still remains a law, even if not quite so absolute as heretofore.

But this is a digression. The argument is, that between an individual and any external object with which he has an affective connection, there exists a definite vital flow, as definite and concrete as the electric current whose polarized circuit sets our tram-cars running and our lamps shining, or our Marconi wires vibrating. Whether this object be human, or animal, or plant, or quite inanimate, there is still a circuit. My dog, my canary has a polarized connection with me. Nay, the very cells in the ash-tree I loved as a child had a dynamic vibratory connection with the nuclei in my own centers of primary consciousness. And further still, the boots I have worn are so saturated with my own magnetism, my own vital activity, that if anyone else wear them I feel it is a trespass, almost as if another man used my hand to knock away a fly. I doubt very much if a blood-hound, when it takes a scent, smells, in our sense of the word. It receives at the infinitely sensitive telegraphic center of the dog's nostrils the vital vibration which remains in the inanimate object from the individual with whom the object was associated. I should like to know if a dog would trace a pair of quite new shoes which had merely been dragged at the end of a string. That is, does he follow the smell of the leather itself, or the vibration track of the individual whose vitality is communicated to the leather?

So, there is a definite vibratory rapport between a man and his surroundings, once he definitely gets into contact with these surroundings. Any particular locality, any house which has been lived in has a vibration, a transferred vitality of its own. This is either sympathetic or antipathetic to the succeeding individual in varying degree. But certain it is that the inhabitants who live at the foot of Etna will always have a certain pitch of life-vibration, antagonistic to the pitch of vibration even of a Palermitan, in some measure. And old houses are saturated with human presence, at last to a degree of indecency, unbearable. And tradition, in its most elemental sense, means the continuing of the same peculiar pitch of vital vibration.

Such is the objective dynamic flow between the psychic poles of the individual and the substance of the external object, animate or inanimate. The subjective dynamic flow is established between the four primary poles within the individual. Every dynamic connection begins from one or the other of the sympathetic centers: is, or should be, almost immediately polarized from the corresponding voluntary center. Then a complete flow is set up, in one plane. But this always rouses the activity on the other, corresponding plane, more or less intense. There is a whole field of consciousness established, with positive polarity of the first plane, negative polarity of the second. Which being so, a whole fourfold field of dynamic consciousness now working within the individual, direct cognition takes place. The mind begins to know, and to strive to know.

The business of the mind is first and foremost the pure joy of knowing and comprehending the pure joy of consciousness. The second business is to act as medium, as interpreter, as agent between the individual and his object. The mind should not act as a director or controller of the spontaneous centers. These the soul alone must control: the soul being that forever unknowable reality which causes us to rise into being. There is continual conflict between the soul, which is for ever sending forth incalculable impulses, and the psyche, which is conservative, and wishes to persist in its old motions, and the mind, which wishes to have ""freedom,"" that is spasmodic, idea-driven control. Mind, and conservative psyche, and the incalculable soul, these three are a trinity of powers in every human being. But there is something even beyond these. It is the individual in his pure singleness, in his totality of consciousness, in his oneness of being: the Holy Ghost which is with us after our Pentecost, and which we may not deny. When I say to myself: ""I am wrong,"" knowing with sudden insight that I am wrong, then this is the whole self speaking, the Holy Ghost. It is no piece of mental inference. It is not just the soul sending forth a flash. It is my whole being speaking in one voice, soul and mind and psyche transfigured into oneness. This voice of my being I may never deny. When at last, in all my storms, my whole self speaks, then there is a pause. The soul collects itself into pure silence and isolation—perhaps after much pain. The mind suspends its knowledge, and waits. The psyche becomes strangely still. And then, after the pause, there is fresh beginning, a new life adjustment. Conscience is the being's consciousness, when the individual is conscious in toto, when he knows in full. It is something which includes and which far surpasses mental consciousness. Every man must live as far as he can by his own soul's conscience. But not according to any ideal. To submit the conscience to a creed, or an idea, or a tradition, or even an impulse, is our ruin.

To make the mind the absolute ruler is as good as making a Cook's tourist-interpreter a king and a god, because he can speak several languages, and make an Arab understand that an Englishman wants fish for supper. And to make an ideal a ruling principle is about as stupid as if a bunch of travelers should never cease giving each other and their dragoman sixpence, because the dragoman's main idea of virtue is the virtue of sixpence-giving. In the same way, we know we cannot live purely by impulse. Neither can we live solely by tradition. We must live by all three, ideal, impulse, and tradition, each in its hour. But the real guide is the pure conscience, the voice of the self in its wholeness, the Holy Ghost.

We have fallen now into the mistake of idealism. Man always falls into one of the three mistakes. In China, it is tradition. And in the South Seas, it seems to have been impulse. Ours is idealism. Each of the three modes is a true life-mode. But any one, alone or dominant, brings us to destruction. We must depend on the wholeness of our being, ultimately only on that, which is our Holy Ghost within us. Whereas, in an ideal of love and benevolence, we have tried to automatize ourselves into little love-engines always stoked with the sorrows or beauties of other people, so that we can get up steam of charity or righteous wrath. A great trick is to pour on the fire the oil of our indignation at somebody else's wickedness, and then, when we've got up steam like hell, back the engine and run bish! smash! against the belly of the offender. Because he said he didn't want to love any more, we hate him for evermore, and try to run over him, every bit of him, with our love-tanks. And all the time we yell at him: ""Will you deny love, you villain? Will you?"" And by the time he faintly squeaks, ""I want to be loved! I want to be loved!"" we have got so used to running over him with our love-tanks that we don't feel in a hurry to leave off.

       &nbsp""Sois mon frère, ou je te tue.""
       &nbsp""Sois mon frère, ou je me tue.""

There are the two parrot-threats of love, on which our loving centuries have run as on a pair of railway-lines. Excuse me if I want to get out of the train. Excuse me if I can't get up any love-steam any more. My boilers are burst.

We have made a mistake, laying down love like the permanent way of a great emotional transport system. There we are, however, running on wheels on the lines of our love. And of course we have only two directions, forwards and backwards. ""Onward, Christian soldiers, towards the great terminus where bottles of sterilized milk for the babies are delivered at the bedroom windows by noiseless aeroplanes each morn, where the science of dentistry is so perfect that teeth are planted in a man's mouth without his knowing it, where twilight sleep is so delicious that every woman longs for her next confinement, and where nobody ever has to do anything except turn a handle now and then in a spirit of universal love—"" That is the forward direction of the English-speaking race. The Germans unwisely backed their engine. ""We have a city of light. But instead of lying ahead it lies direct behind us. So reverse engines. Reverse engines, and away, away to our city, where the sterilized milk is delivered by noiseless aeroplanes, at the very precise minute when our great doctors of the Fatherland have diagnosed that it is good for you: where the teeth are not only so painlessly planted that they grow like living rock, but where their composition is such that the friction of eating stimulates the cells of the jaw-bone and develops the superman strength of will which makes us gods: and where not only is twilight sleep serene, but into the sleeper are inculcated the most useful and instructive dreams, calculated to perfect the character of the young citizen at this crucial period, and to enlighten permanently the mind of the happy mother, with regard to her new duties towards her child and towards our great Fatherland—""

Here you see we are, on the railway, with New Jerusalem ahead, and New Jerusalem away behind us. But of course it was very wrong of the Germans to reverse their engines, and cause one long collision all along the line. Why should we go their way to the New Jerusalem, when of course they might so easily have kept on going our way. And now there's wreckage all along the line! But clear the way is our motto—or make the Germans clear it. Because get on we will.

Meanwhile we sit rather in the cold, waiting for the train to get a start. People keep on signaling with green lights and red lights. And it's all very bewildering.

As for me, I'm off. I'm damned if I'll be shunted along any more. And I'm thrice damned if I'll go another yard towards that sterilized New Jerusalem, either forwards or backwards. New Jerusalem may rot, if it waits for me. I'm not going.

So good-by! There we leave humanity, encamped in an appalling mess beside the railway-smash of love, sitting down, however, and having not a bad time, some of 'em, feeding themselves fat on the plunder: others, further down the line, with mouths green from eating grass. But all grossly, stupidly, automatically gabbling about getting the love-service running again, the trains booked for the New Jerusalem well on the way once more. And occasionally a good engine gives a screech of love, and something seems to be about to happen. And sometimes there is enough steam to set the indignation-whistles whistling. But never any more will there be enough love-steam to get the system properly running. It is done.

Good-by, then! You may have laid your line from one end to the other of the infinite. But still there's plenty of hinterland. I'll go. Good-by. Ach, it will be so nice to be alone: not to hear you, not to see you, not to smell you, humanity. I wish you no ill, but wisdom. Good-by!

To be alone with one's own soul. Not to be alone without my own soul, mind you. But to be alone with one's own soul! This, and the joy of it, is the real goal of love. My own soul, and myself. Not my ego, my conceit of myself. But my very soul. To be at one in my own self. Not to be questing any more. Not to be yearning, seeking, hoping, desiring, aspiring. But to pause, and be alone.

And to have one's own ""gentle spouse"" by one's side, of course, to dig one in the ribs occasionally. Because really, being alone in peace means being two people together. Two people who can be silent together, and not conscious of one another outwardly. Me in my silence, she in hers, and the balance, the equilibrium, the pure circuit between us. With occasional lapses of course: digs in the ribs if one gets too vague or self-sufficient.

They say it is better to travel than to arrive. It's not been my experience, at least. The journey of love has been rather a lacerating, if well-worth-it, journey. But to come at last to a nice place under the trees, with your ""amiable spouse"" who has at last learned to hold her tongue and not to bother about rights and wrongs: her own particularly. And then to pitch a camp, and cook your rabbit, and eat him: and to possess your own soul in silence, and to feel all the clamor lapse. That is the best I know.

I think it is terrible to be young. The ecstasies and agonies of love, the agonies and ecstasies of fear and doubt and drop-by-drop fulfillment, realization. The awful process of human relationships, love and marital relationships especially. Because we all make a very, very bad start to-day, with our idea of love in our head, and our sex in our head as well. All the fight till one is bled of one's self-consciousness and sex-in-the-head. All the bitterness of the conflict with this devil of an amiable spouse, who has got herself so stuck in her own head. It is terrible to be young.—But one fights one's way through it, till one is cleaned: the self-consciousness and sex-idea burned out of one, cauterized out bit by bit, and the self whole again, and at last free.

The best thing I have known is the stillness of accomplished marriage, when one possesses one's own soul in silence, side by side with the amiable spouse, and has left off craving and raving and being only half one's self. But I must say, I know a great deal more about the craving and raving and sore ribs, than about the accomplishment. And I must confess that I feel this self-same ""accomplishment"" of the fulfilled being is only a preparation for new responsibilities ahead, new unison in effort and conflict, the effort to make, with other men, a little new way into the future, and to break through the hedge of the many.

But—to your tents, my Israel. And to that precious baby you've left slumbering there. What I meant to say was, in each phase of life you have a great circuit of human relationship to establish and fulfill. In childhood, it is the circuit of family love, established at the first four consciousness centers, and gradually fulfilling itself, completing itself. At adolescence, the first circuit of family love should be completed, dynamically finished. And then, it falls into quiescence. After puberty, family love should fall quiescent in a child. The love never breaks. It continues static and basic, the basis of the emotional psyche, the foundation of the self. It is like the moon when the moon at last subsides into her eternal orbit, round the earth. She travels in her orbit so inevitably that she forgets, and becomes unaware. She only knits her brows over the earth's greater aberrations in space.

The circuit of parental love, once fulfilled, is not done away with, but only established into silence. The child is then free to establish the new connections, in which he surpasses his parents. And let us repeat, parents should never try to establish adult relations, of sympathy or interest or anything else, between themselves and their children. The attempt to do so only deranges the deep primary circuit which is the dynamic basis of our living. It is a clambering upwards only by means of a broken foundation. Parents should remain parents, children children, for ever, and the great gulf preserved between the two. Honor thy father and thy mother should always be a leading commandment. But this can only take place when father and mother keep their true parental distances, dignity, reserve, and limitation. As soon as father and mother try to become the friends and companions of their children, they break the root of life, they rupture the deepest dynamic circuit of living, they derange the whole flow of life for themselves and their children.

For let us reiterate and reiterate: you cannot mingle and confuse the various modes of dynamic love. If you try, you produce horrors. You cannot plant the heart below the diaphragm or put an ocular eye in the navel. No more can you transfer parent love into friend love or adult love. Parent love is established at the great primary centers, where man is father and child, playmate and brother, but where he cannot be comrade or lover. Comrade and lover, this is the dynamic activity of the further centers, the second four centers. And these second four centers must be active in the parent, their intense circuit established even if not fulfilled, long before the child is born. The circuit of friendship, of personal companionship, of sexual love must needs be established before the child is begotten, or at least before it attains to adolescence. These circuits of the extended field are already fully established in the parent before the centers of correspondence in the child are even formed. When therefore the four great centers of the extended consciousness arouses in a child, at adolescence, they must needs seek a strange complement, a foreign conjunction.

Not only is this the case, but the actual dynamic impulse of the new life which rouses at puberty is alien to the original dynamic flow. The new wave-length by no means corresponds. The new vibration by no means harmonizes. Force the two together, and you cause a terrible frictional excitement and jarring. It is this instinctive recognition of the different dynamic vibrations from different centers, in different modes, and in different directions of positive and negative, which lies at the base of savage taboo. After puberty, members of one family should be taboo to one another. There should be the most definite limits to the degree of contact. And mothers-in-law should be taboo to their daughters' husbands, and fathers-in-law to their sons' wives. We must again begin to learn the great laws of the first dynamic life-circuits. These laws we now make havoc of, and consequently we make havoc of our own soul, psyche, mind and health.

This book is written primarily concerning the child's consciousness. It is not intended to enter the field of the post-puberty consciousness. But yet, the dynamic relation of the child is established so directly with the physical and psychical soul of the parent, that to get any inkling of dynamic child-consciousness we must understand something of parent-consciousness.

We assert that the parent-child love-mode excludes the possibility of the man-and-woman, or friend-and-friend love mode. We assert that the polarity of the first four poles is inconsistent with the polarity of the second four poles. Nay, between the two great fields is a certain dynamic opposition, resistance, even antipathy. So that in the natural course of life there is no possibility of confusing parent love and adult love.

But we are mental creatures, and with the explosive and mechanistic aid of ideas we can pervert the whole psyche. Only, however, in a destructive degree, not in a positive or constructive.

Let us return then. In the ordinary course of development, by the time that the child is born and grown to puberty the whole dynamic soul of the mother is engaged: first, with the children, and second, on the further, higher plane, with the husband, and with her own friends. So that when the child reaches adolescence it must inevitably cast abroad for connection.

But now let us remember the actual state of affairs to-day, when the poles are reversed between the sexes. The woman is now the responsible party, the law-giver, the culture-bearer. She is the conscious guide and director of the man. She bears his soul between her two hands. And her sex is just a function or an instrument of power. This being so, the man is really the servant and the fount of emotion, love and otherwise.

Which is all very well, while the fun lasts. But like all perverted processes, it is exhaustive, and like the fun wears out. Leaving an exhaustion, and an irritation. Each looks on the other as a perverter of life. Almost invariably a married woman, as she passes the age of thirty, conceives a dislike, or a contempt of her husband, or a pity which is too near contempt. Particularly if he be a good husband, a true modern. And he, for his part, though just as jarred inside himself, resents only the fact that he is not loved as he ought to be.

Then starts a new game. The woman, even the most virtuous, looks abroad for new sympathy. She will have a new man-friend, if nothing more. But as a rule she has got something more. She has got her children.

A relation between mother and child to-day is practically never parental. It is personal—which means, it is critical and deliberate, and adult in provocation. The mother, in her new rôle of idealist and life-manager never, practically for one single moment, gives her child the unthinking response from the deep dynamic centers. No, she gives it what is good for it. She shoves milk in its mouth as the clock strikes, she shoves it to sleep when the milk is swallowed, and she shoves it ideally through baths and massage, promenades and practice, till the little organism develops like a mushroom to stand on its own feet. Then she continues her ideal shoving of it through all the stages of an ideal up-bringing, she loves it as a chemist loves his test-tubes in which he analyzes his salts. The poor little object is his mother's ideal. But of her head she dictates his providential days, and by the force of her deliberate mentally-directed love-will she pushes him up into boyhood. The poor little devil never knows one moment when he is not encompassed by the beautiful, benevolent, idealistic, Botticelli-pure, and finally obscene love-will of the mother. Never, never one mouthful does he drink of the milk of human kindness: always the sterilized milk of human benevolence. There is no mother's milk to-day, save in tigers' udders, and in the udders of sea-whales. Our children drink a decoction of ideal love, at the breast.

Never for one moment, poor baby, the deep warm stream of love from the mother's bowels to his bowels. Never for one moment the dark proud recoil into rest, the soul's separation into deep, rich independence. Never this lovely rich forgetfulness, as a cat trots off and utterly forgets her kittens, utterly, richly forgets them, till suddenly, click, the dynamic circuit reverses itself in her, and she remembers, and rages round in a frenzy, shouting for her young.

Our miserable infants never know this joy and richness and pang of real maternal warmth. Our wonderful mothers never let us out of their minds for one single moment. Not for a second do they allow us to escape from their ideal benevolence. Not one single breath does a baby draw, free from the imposition of the pure, unselfish, Botticelli-holy, detestable love-will of the mother. Always the will, the will, the love-will, the ideal will, directed from the ideal mind. Always this stone, this scorpion of maternal nourishment. Always this infernal self-conscious Madonna starving our living guts and bullying us to death with her love.

We have made the idea supplant both impulse and tradition. We have no spark of wholeness. And we live by an evil love-will. Alas, the great spontaneous mode is abrogated. There is no lovely great flux of vital sympathy, no rich rejoicing of pride into isolation and independence. There is no reverence for great traditions of parenthood. No, there is substitute for everything—life-substitute—just as we have butter-substitute, and meat-substitute, and sugar-substitute, and leather-substitute, and silk-substitute, so we have life-substitute. We have beastly benevolence, and foul good-will, and stinking charity, and poisonous ideals.

The poor modern brat, shoved horribly into life by an effort of will, and shoved up towards manhood by every appliance that can be applied to it, especially the appliance of the maternal will, it is really too pathetic to contemplate. The only thing that prevents us wringing our hands is the remembrance that the little devil will grow up and beget other similar little devils of his own, to invent more aeroplanes and hospitals and germ-killers and food-substitutes and poison gases. The problem of the future is a question of the strongest poison-gas. Which is certainly a very sure way out of our vicious circle.

There is no way out of a vicious circle, of course, except breaking the circle. And since the mother-child relationship is to-day the viciousest of circles, what are we to do? Just wait for the results of the poison-gas competition presumably.

Oh, ideal humanity, how detestable and despicable you are! And how you deserve your own poison-gases! How you deserve to perish in your own stink.

It is no use contemplating the development of the modern child, born out of the mental-conscious love-will, born to be another unit of self-conscious love-will: an ideal-born beastly little entity with a devil's own will of its own, benevolent, of course, and a Satan's own seraphic self-consciousness, like a beastly Botticelli brat.

Once we really consider this modern process of life and the love-will, we could throw the pen away, and spit, and say three cheers for the inventors of poison-gas. Is there not an American who is supposed to have invented a breath of heaven whereby, drop one pop-cornful in Hampstead, one in Brixton, one in East Ham, and one in Islington, and London is a Pompeii in five minutes! Or was the American only bragging? Because anyhow, whom has he experimented on? I read it in the newspaper, though. London a Pompeii in five minutes. Makes the gods look silly!",D. H.

166,Willing To Forgive,"[Verse 1]
I read her letters
And I saw her picture
And I smelled her cheap perfume
It must have come from you
How could you touch her?
Lay down beside her?
Well, there just ain't no excuse
You shouldn't have been so loose

[Pre-Chorus]
I saw the telephone bill
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can smooth it over
Then you're wasting your time

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

[Verse 2]
You're such a liar
You took her and her children
Out for the afternoon
While I was sittin' waitin' on you
How could you do it?
You should've been here with me
You just couldn't do it
You had to be in the streets

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I heard through the grapevine
You've been messin' around
When you thought you were gettin' over
That's when a baby girl found out

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(You really hurt me)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

[Bridge]
I gave my heart, gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man, of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent, washed your clothes
Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess (Guess I) I'm in love

I gave my heart, gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man, of a boy who was born to lose

Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess I...I'm in love

170,You Let Your Heart Go Too Fast,"Having been by that old bank tower
I'm inclined to wonder why you feel so strong
You can't have really seen the hour
If you think she's trying to do you wrong
I see you got that lump in your throat
I hear you mumbling, ""That's all she wrote.""
Love is in the next room drinking antidote

You ought to know that girl by now
She'll never settle down anyhow
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast

Broken glass turns back to flint and sand
I only cease to love as love demands
As you know it takes a while to clap those
Fragments from your idle hands
Couple months could dry a sea of tears
Leave only salt beneath our dried up piers
We won't believe we cared, I swear, in a couple years

You ought to know that girl by now
She'll never settle down anyhow
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast

If time heals all wounds, don't you know that
Time also deals them
The days go by, and everybody feels them
We struggle with our fates
But our action only seals them

They say that murder ain't the fault of the weapon
I'm smoking sad to be the gun
I want to blow you all away, but I don't want to put no
Bullets into anyone
I see the feathers that infringe your heart
I see the blood ooze from around the dart
Cupid spites the sense that keeps two
Mismatched souls apart

You ought to know that girl by now
She'll never settle down anyhow
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast

You ought to know that girl by now
She'll never turn you down anyhow

Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo' heaters 'cause you 'sposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go

175,Your Love Is So Divine,"        For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily, tremulous smile. He escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands, and talking at the top of his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever. He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him. At least he declared he did, and insisted on shaking him by the hand, and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet. Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side. They talked to each other across the theatre, and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them. Some women were laughing in the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant. The sound of the popping of corks came from the bar.

        ""What a place to find one's divinity in!"" said Lord Henry.

        ""Yes!"" answered Dorian Gray. ""It was here I found her, and she is divine beyond all living things. When she acts you will forget everything. These common, rough people, with their coarse faces and brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage. They sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualises them, and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one's self.""

        ""The same flesh and blood as one's self! Oh, I hope not!"" exclaimed Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his opera-glass.

        ""Don't pay any attention to him, Dorian,"" said the painter. ""I understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Anyone you love must be marvellous, and any girl that has the effect you describe must be fine and noble. To spiritualise one's age—that is something worth doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world. This marriage is quite right. I did not think so at first, but I admit it now. The gods made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her you would have been incomplete.""

        ""Thanks, Basil,"" answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand. ""I knew that you would understand me. Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me. But here is the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for about five minutes. Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything that is good in me.""

        A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage. Yes, she was certainly lovely to look at—one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought, that he had ever seen. There was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes. A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded, enthusiastic house. She stepped back a few paces, and her lips seemed to tremble. Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud. Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her. Lord Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, ""Charming! charming!""

        The scene was the hall of Capulet's house, and Romeo in his pilgrim's dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends. The band, such as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began. Through the crowd of ungainly, shabbily-dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a creature from a finer world. Her body swayed, while she danced, as a plant sways in the water. The curves of her throat were the curves of a white lily. Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.

        Yet she was curiously listless. She showed no sign of joy when her eyes rested on Romeo. The few words she had to speak—

        Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss—

        with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly artificial manner. The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view of tone it was absolutely false. It was wrong in colour. It took away all the life from the verse. It made the passion unreal.

        Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her. He was puzzled and anxious. Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him. She seemed to them to be absolutely incompetent. They were horribly disappointed.

        Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of the second act. They waited for that. If she failed there, there was nothing in her.

        She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight. That could not be denied. But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew worse as she went on. Her gestures became absurdly artificial. She over-emphasised everything that she had to say. The beautiful passage—

        Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night—

        was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution. When she leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines—

        Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say, ""It lightens."" Sweet, good-night!
This bud of love by summer's ripening breath
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet—

        she spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her. It was not nervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was absolutely self-contained. It was simply bad art. She was a complete failure.

        Even the common, uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their interest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk loudly and to whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage. The only person unmoved was the girl herself.

        When the second act was over there came a storm of hisses, and Lord Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat. ""She is quite beautiful, Dorian,"" he said, ""but she can't act. Let us go.""

        ""I am going to see the play through,"" answered the lad, in a hard, bitter voice. ""I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an evening, Harry. I apologise to you both.""

        ""My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,"" interrupted Hallward. ""We will come some other night.""

        ""I wish she were ill,"" he rejoined. ""But she seems to me to be simply callous and cold. She has entirely altered. Last night she was a great artist. This evening she is merely a commonplace, mediocre actress.""

        ""Don't talk like that about anyone you love, Dorian. Love is a more wonderful thing than Art.""

        ""They are both simply forms of imitation,"" remarked Lord Henry. ""But do let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting. Besides, I don't suppose you will want your wife to act. So what does it matter if she plays Juliet like a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience. There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating—people who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing. Good heavens, my dear boy, don't look so tragic! The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming. Come to the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful. What more can you want?""

        ""Go away, Harry,"" cried the lad. ""I want to be alone. Basil, you must go. Ah! can't you see that my heart is breaking?"" The hot tears came to his eyes. His lips trembled, and, rushing to the back of the box, he leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.

        ""Let us go, Basil,"" said Lord Henry, with a strange tenderness in his voice; and the two young men passed out together.

        A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up, and the curtain rose on the third act. Dorian Gray went back to his seat. He looked pale, and proud, and indifferent. The play dragged on, and seemed interminable. Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots, and laughing. The whole thing was a fiasco. The last act was played to almost empty benches. The curtain went down on a titter, and some groans.

        As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the greenroom. The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph on her face. Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire. There was a radiance about her. Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of their own.

        When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy came over her. ""How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!"" she cried.

        ""Horribly!"" he answered, gazing at her in amazement—""horribly! It was dreadful. Are you ill? You have no idea what it was. You have no idea what I suffered.""

        The girl smiled. ""Dorian,"" she answered, lingering over his name with long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to the red petals of her mouth—""Dorian, you should have understood. But you understand now, don't you?""

        ""Understand what?"" he asked, angrily.

        ""Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall never act well again.""

        He shrugged his shoulders. ""You are ill, I suppose. When you are ill you shouldn't act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends were bored. I was bored.""

        She seemed not to listen to him. She was transfigured with joy. An ecstasy of happiness dominated her.

        ""Dorian, Dorian,"" she cried, ""before I knew you, acting was the one reality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night, and Portia the other. The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine also. I believed in everything. The common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my world. I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You came—oh, my beautiful love!—and you freed my soul from prison. You taught me what reality really is. To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had always played. To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to say. You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is but a reflection. You had made me understand what love really is. My love! my love! Prince Charming! Prince of life! I have grown sick of shadows. You are more to me than all art can ever be. What have I to do with the puppets of a play? When I came on to-night, I could not understand how it was that everything had gone from me. I thought that I was going to be wonderful. I found that I could do nothing. Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite to me. I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love such as ours? Take me away, Dorian—take me away with you, where we can be quite alone. I hate the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you understand now what it signifies? Even if I could do it, it would be profanation for me to play at being in love. You have made me see that.""

        He flung himself down on the sofa, and turned away his face. ""You have killed my love,"" he muttered.

        She looked at him in wonder, and laughed. He made no answer. She came across to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair. She knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips. He drew them away, and a shudder ran through him.

        Then he leaped up, and went to the door. ""Yes,"" he cried, ""you have killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don't even stir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you because you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you realised the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and stupid. My God! how mad I was to love you! What a fool I have been! You are nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never think of you. I will never mention your name. You don't know what you were to me, once. Why, once.... Oh, I can't bear to think of it! I wish I had never laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled the romance of my life. How little you can know of love, if you say it mars your art! Without your art you are nothing. I would have made you famous, splendid, magnificent. The world would have worshipped you, and you would have borne my name. What are you now? A third-rate actress with a pretty face.""

        The girl grew white, and trembled. She clenched her hands together, and her voice seemed to catch in her throat. ""You are not serious, Dorian?"" she murmured. ""You are acting.""

        ""Acting! I leave that to you. You do it so well,"" he answered bitterly.

        She rose from her knees, and, with a piteous expression of pain in her face, came across the room to him. She put her hand upon his arm, and looked into his eyes. He thrust her back. ""Don't touch me!"" he cried.

        A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet, and lay there like a trampled flower. ""Dorian, Dorian, don't leave me!"" she whispered. ""I am so sorry I didn't act well. I was thinking of you all the time. But I will try—indeed, I will try. It came so suddenly across me, my love for you. I think I should never have known it if you had not kissed me—if we had not kissed each other. Kiss me again, my love. Don't go away from me. I couldn't bear it. Oh! don't go away from me. My brother.... No; never mind. He didn't mean it. He was in jest.... But you, oh! can't you forgive me for to-night? I will work so hard, and try to improve. Don't be cruel to me because I love you better than anything in the world. After all, it is only once that I have not pleased you. But you are quite right, Dorian. I should have shown myself more of an artist. It was foolish of me; and yet I couldn't help it. Oh, don't leave me, don't leave me."" A fit of passionate sobbing choked her. She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain. There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic. Her tears and sobs annoyed him.

        ""I am going,"" he said at last, in his calm, clear voice. ""I don't wish to be unkind, but I can't see you again. You have disappointed me.""

        She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer. Her little hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him. He turned on his heel, and left the room. In a few moments he was out of the theatre.

        Where he went to he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through dimly-lit streets, past gaunt black-shadowed archways and evil-looking houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after him. Drunkards had reeled by cursing, and chattering to themselves like monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children huddled upon doorsteps, and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.

        As the dawn was just breaking he found himself close to Covent Garden. The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain. He followed into the market, and watched the men unloading their waggons. A white-smocked carter offered him some cherries. He thanked him, and wondered why he refused to accept any money for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. A long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge jade-green piles of vegetables. Under the portico, with its grey sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls, waiting for the auction to be over. Others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffee-house in the Piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings. Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris-necked, and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.

        After a little while, he hailed a hansom, and drove home. For a few moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent Square with its blank, close-shuttered windows, and its staring blinds. The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like silver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke was rising. It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.

        In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge's barge, that hung from the ceiling of the great oak-panelled hall of entrance, lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire. He turned them out, and, having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had decorated for himself, and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal. As he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait Basil Hallward had painted of him. He started back as if in surprise. Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled. After he had taken the buttonhole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate. Finally he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it. In the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed. The expression looked different. One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in the mouth. It was certainly strange.

        He turned round, and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. The bright dawn flooded the room, and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky corners, where they lay shuddering. But the strange expression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be more intensified even. The quivering, ardent sunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.

        He winced, and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory Cupids, one of Lord Henry's many presents to him, glanced hurriedly into its polished depths. No line like that warped his red lips. What did it mean?

        He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it again. There were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had altered. It was not a mere fancy of his own. The thing was horribly apparent.

He threw himself into a chair, and began to think. Suddenly there flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward's studio the day the picture had been finished. Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood. Surely his wish had not been fulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to think of them. And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the touch of cruelty in the mouth.

        Cruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl's fault, not his. He had dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he had thought her great. Then she had disappointed him. She had been shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little child. He remembered with what callousness he had watched her. Why had he been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him? But he had suffered also. During the three terrible hours that the play had lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, æon upon æon of torture. His life was well worth hers. She had marred him for a moment, if he had wounded her for an age. Besides, women were better suited to bear sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of their emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely to have someone with whom they could have scenes. Lord Henry had told him that, and Lord Henry knew what women were. Why should he trouble about Sibyl Vane? She was nothing to him now.

        But the picture? What was he to say of that? It held the secret of his life, and told his story. It had taught him to love his own beauty. Would it teach him to loathe his own soul? Would he ever look at it again?

        No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. Suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think so.

        Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue eyes met his own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted image of himself, came over him. It had altered already, and would alter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its red and white roses would die. For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness. But he would not sin. The picture, changed or unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience. He would resist temptation. He would not see Lord Henry any more—would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil Hallward's garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things. He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends, marry her, try to love her again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She must have suffered more than he had. Poor child! He had been selfish and cruel to her. The fascination that she had exercised over him would return. They would be happy together. His life with her would be beautiful and pure.

        He got up from his chair, and drew a large screen right in front of the portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. ""How horrible!"" he murmured to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of Sibyl. A faint echo of his love came back to him. He repeated her name over and over again. The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.",Oscar Wilde,Miranda,1994,"[99, 90, 86, 86, 81, 67, 72, 66, 80, 77, 69, 76, 90, 86]",14

I'll take your breath away

Wipe away the tears

So many times betrayed
Trying to find an honest word
To find the truth enslaved

Oh you speak to me in riddles
And you speak to me in rhymes

And I would be the one
To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear

Into this night I wander
It's morning that I dread
Another day of knowing of
The path I fear to tread

Oh into the sea of waking dreams
I follow without pride
It's nothing stands between us here
And I won't be denied

[Chorus]
And I would be the one
To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away

Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear

182,"Baby I Love Your Way (From ""Reality Bites"")","PROLOGUE

Two tires fly. Two wail.

A bamboo grove, all chopped down

From it, warring songs

....IS THE BEST THAT CORPORAL BOBBY SHAFTOE CAN DO ON short notice--he's standing on the running board, gripping his Springfield with one hand and the rearview mirror with the other, so counting the syllables on his fingers is out of the question. Is ``tires'' one syllable or two? How about ``wail?'' The truck finally makes up its mind not to tip over, and thuds back onto four wheels. The wail--and the moment--are lost. Bobby can still hear the coolies singing, though, and now too there's the gunlike snicking of the truck's clutch linkage as Private Wiley downshifts. Could Wiley be losing his nerve? And, in the back, under the tarps, a ton and a half of file cabinets clanking, code books slaloming, fuel spanking the tanks of Station Alpha's electrical generator. The modern world's hell on haiku writers: ``Electrical generator'' is, what, eight syllables? You couldn't even fit that onto the second line!

""Are we allowed to run over people?'' Private Wiley inquires, and then mashes the horn button before Bobby Shaftoe can answer. A Sikh policeman hurdles a night soil cart. Shaftoe's gut reaction is: Sure, what're they going to do, declare war on us? but as the highest-ranking man on this truck he's probably supposed to be using his head or something, so he doesn't blurt it out just yet. He takes stock of the situation:

Shanghai, 1645 hours, Friday, the 28th of November 1941. Bobby Shaftoe, and the other half-dozen Marines on his truck, are staring down the length of Kiukiang Road, onto which they've just made this careening high-speed turn. Cathedral's going by to the right, so that means they are, what? two blocks away from the Bund. A Yangtze River Patrol gunboat is tied up there, waiting for the stuff they've got in the back of this truck. The only real problem is that those particular two blocks are inhabited by about five million Chinese people.

Now these Chinese are sophisticated urbanites, not suntanned yokels who've never seen cars before--they'll get out of your way if you drive fast and honk your horn. And indeed many of them flee to one side of the street or the other, producing the illusion that the truck its moving faster than the forty-three miles an hour shown on its speedometer.

But the bamboo grove in Bobby Shaftoe's haiku has not been added just to put a little Oriental flavor into the poem and wow the folks back home in Oconomowoc. There is a lot of heavy bamboo in front of this truck, dozens of makeshift turnpikes blocking their path to the river, for the officers of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, and of the Fourth Marines, who dreamed up this little operation forgot to take the Friday Afternoon factor into account. As Bobby Shaftoe could've explained to them, if only they'd bothered to ask a poor dumb jarhead, their route took them through the heart of the banking district. Here you've got the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank of course, City Bank, Chase Manhattan, the Bank of America, and BBME and the Agricultural Bank of China and any number of crappy little provincial banks, and several of those banks have contracts with what's left of the Chinese Government to print currency. It must be a cutthroat business because they slash costs by printing it on old newspapers, and if you know how to read Chinese, you can see last year's news stories and polo scores peeking through the colored numbers and pictures that transform these pieces of paper into legal tender.

As every chicken-peddler and rickshaw operator in Shanghai knows, the money-printing contracts stipulate that all of the bills these banks print have to be backed by such-and-such an amount of silver; i.e., anyone should be able to walk into one of those banks at the end of Kiukiang Road and slap down a pile of bills and (provided that those bills were printed by that same bank) receive actual metallic silver in exchange.

Now if China weren't right in the middle of getting systematically drawn and quartered by the Empire of Nippon, it would probably send official bean counters around to keep tabs on how much silver was actually present in these banks' vaults, and it would all be quiet and orderly. But as it stands, the only thing keeping these banks honest is the other banks.

Here's how they do it: during the normal course of business, lots of paper money will pass over the counters of (say) Chase Manhattan Bank. They'll take it into a back room and sort it, throwing into money boxes (a couple of feet square and a yard deep, with ropes on the four corners) all of the bills that were printed by (say) Bank of America in one, all of the City Bank bills into another. Then, on Friday afternoon they will bring in coolies. Each coolie, or pair of coolies, will of course have his great big long bamboo pole with him--a coolie without his pole is like a China Marine without his nickel-plated bayonet--and will poke their pole through the ropes on the corners of the box. Then one coolie will get underneath each end of the pole, hoisting the box into the air. They have to move in unison or else the box begins flailing around and everything gets out of whack. So as they head towards their destination--whatever bank whose name is printed on the bills in their box--they sing to each other, and plant their feet on the pavement in time to the music. The pole's pretty long, so they are that far apart, and they have to sing loud to hear each other, and of course each pair of coolies in the street is singing their own particular song, trying to drown out all of the others so that they don't get out of step.

So ten minutes before closing time on Friday afternoon, the doors of many banks burst open and numerous pairs of coolies march in singing, like the curtain-raiser on a fucking Broadway musical, slam their huge boxes of tattered currency down, and demand silver in exchange. All of the banks do this to each other. Sometimes, they'll all do it on the same Friday, particularly at times like 28 November 1941, when even a grunt like Bobby Shaftoe can understand that it's better to be holding silver than piles of old cut-up newspaper. And that is why, once the normal pedestrians and food-cart operators and furious Sikh cops have scurried out of the way, and plastered themselves up against the clubs and shops and bordellos on Kiukiang Road, Bobby Shaftoe and the other Marines on the truck still cannot even see the gunboat that is their destination, because of this horizontal forest of mighty bamboo poles. They cannot even hear the honking of their own truck horn because of the wild throbbing pentatonic cacophony of coolies singing. This ain't just your regular Friday P.M. Shanghai bank-district money-rush. This is an ultimate settling of accounts before the whole Eastern Hemisphere catches fire. The millions of promises printed on those slips of bumwad will all be kept or broken in the next ten minutes; actual pieces of silver and gold will move, or they won't. It is some kind of fiduciary Judgment Day.

``Jesus Christ, I can't--'' Private Wiley hollers.

""The captain said don't stop for any reason whatsofuckinever,'' Shaftoe reminds him. He's not telling Wiley to run over the coolies, he's reminding Wiley that if he refrains from running over them, they will have some explaining to do--which will be complicated by the fact that the captain's right behind them in a car stuffed with Tommy Gun-toting China Marines. And from the way the captain's been acting about this Station Alpha thing, it's pretty clear that he already has a few preliminary strap marks on his ass, courtesy of some admiral in Pearl Harbor or even (drumroll) Marine Barracks, Eight and Eye Streets Southeast, Washington, D.C.

Shaftoe and the other Marines have always known Station Alpha as a mysterious claque of pencil-necked swabbies who hung out on the roof of a building in the International Settlement in a shack of knot-pocked cargo pallet planks with antennas sticking out of it every which way. If you stood there long enough you could see some of those antennas moving, zeroing in on something out to sea. Shaftoe even wrote a haiku about it:

Antenna searches

Retriever's nose in the wind

Ether's far secrets

This was only his second haiku ever--clearly not up to November 1941 standards--and he cringes to remember it.

But in no way did any of the Marines comprehend what a big deal Station Alpha was until today. Their job had turned out to involve wrapping a ton of equipment and several tons of paper in tarps and moving it out of doors. Then they spent Thursday tearing the shack apart, making it into a bonfire, and burning certain books and papers.

``Sheeeyit!'' Private Wiley hollers. Only a few of the coolies have gotten out of the way, or even seen them. But then there is this fantastic boom from the river, like the sound of a mile-thick bamboo pole being snapped over God's knee. Half a second later there're no coolies in the street anymore--just a lot of boxes with unmanned bamboo poles teeter-tottering on them, bonging into the streets like wind-chimes. Above, a furry mushroom of grey smoke rises from the gunboat. Wiley shifts up to high gear and floors it. Shaftoe cringes against the truck's door and lowers his head, hoping that his campy Great War doughboy helmet will be good for something. Then money-boxes start to rupture and explode as the truck rams through them. Shaftoe peers up through a blizzard of notes and sees giant bamboo poles soaring and bounding and windmilling toward the waterfront.

The leaves of Shanghai:

Pale doorways in a steel sky.

Winter has begun.


BARRENS

Let's set the existence-of-god issue aside for a later volume, and just stipulate that in some way, self-replicating organisms came into existence on this planet and immediately began trying to get rid of each other, either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves, or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored. Most of them failed, and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever, but a few found some way to survive and to propagate. After about three billion years of this sometimes zany, frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage, Godfrey Waterhouse IV was born, in Murdo, South Dakota, to Blanche, the wife of a Congregational preacher named Bunyan Waterhouse. Like every other creature on the face of the earth, Godfrey was, by birthright, a stupendous badass, albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self-replicating gizmo--which, given the number and variety of its descendants, might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time. Everyone and everything that wasn't a stupendous badass was dead.



As nightmarishly lethal, memetically programmed death-machines went, these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet. In the tradition of his namesake (the Puritan writer John Bunyan, who spent much of his life in jail, or trying to avoid it) the Rev. Waterhouse did not preach in any one place for long. The church moved him from one small town in the Dakotas to another every year or two. It is possible that Godfrey found the lifestyle more than a little alienating, for, sometime during the course of his studies at Fargo Congregational College, he bolted from the fold and, to the enduring agony of his parents, fell into worldy pursuits, and ended up, somehow, getting a Ph.D. in Classics from a small private university in Ohio. Academics being no less nomadic than Congregational preachers, he took work where he could find it. He became a Professor of Greek and Latin at Bolger Christian College (enrollment 322) in West Point, Virginia, where the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers came together to form the estuarial James, and the loathsome fumes of the big paper mill permeated every drawer, every closet, even the interior pages of books. Godfrey's young bride, nee Alice Pritchard, who had grown up following her itinerant-preacher father across the vastnesses of eastern Montana--where air smelt of snow and sage--threw up for three months. Six months later she gave birth to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.



The boy had a peculiar relationship with sound. When a fire engine passed, he was not troubled by the siren's howl or the bell's clang. But when a hornet got into the house and swung across the ceiling in a broad Lissajous, droning almost inaudibly, he cried in pain at the noise. And if he saw or smelled something that scared him, he would clap his hands over his ears.



One noise that troubled him not at all was the pipe organ in the chapel at Bolger Christian College. The chapel itself was nothing worth mentioning, but the organ had been endowed by the paper mill family and would have sufficed for a church four times the size. It nicely complemented the organist, a retired high school math teacher who felt that certain attributes of the Lord (violence and capriciousness in the Old Testament, majesty and triumph in the New) could be directly conveyed into the souls of the enpewed sinners through a kind of frontal sonic impregnation. That he ran the risk of blowing out the stained-glass windows was of no consequence since no one liked them anyway, and the paper mill fumes were gnawing at the interstitial lead. But after one little old lady too many staggered down the aisle after a service, reeling from tinnitus, and made a barbed comment to the minister about the exceedingly dramatic music, the organist was replaced.

Nevertheless, he continued to give lessons on the instrument. Students were not allowed to touch the organ until they were proficient at the piano, and when this was explained to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, he taught himself, in three weeks, how to play a Bach fugue, and signed up for organ lessons. Since he was only five years old at the time, he was unable to reach both the manuals and the pedals, and had to play standing--or rather strolling, from pedal to pedal.

When Lawrence was twelve, the organ broke down. That paper mill family had not left any endowment for maintenance, so the math teacher decided to have a crack at it. He was in poor health and required a nimble assistant: Lawrence, who helped him open up the hood of the thing. For the first time in all those years, the boy saw what had been happening when he had been pressing those keys.

For each stop--each timbre, or type of sound, that the organ could make (viz. blockflote, trumpet, piccolo)--there was a separate row of pipes, arranged in a line from long to short. Long pipes made low notes, short high. The tops of the pipes defined a graph: not a straight line but an upward-tending curve. The organist/math teacher sat down with a few loose pipes, a pencil, and paper, and helped Lawrence figure out why. When Lawrence understood, it was as if the math teacher had suddenly played the good part of Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor on a pipe organ the size of the Spiral Nebula in Andromeda--the part where Uncle Johann dissects the architecture of the Universe in one merciless descending ever-mutating chord, as if his foot is thrusting through skidding layers of garbage until it finally strikes bedrock. In particular, the final steps of the organist's explanation were like a falcon's dive through layer after layer of pretense and illusion, thrilling or sickening or confusing depending on what you were. The heavens were riven open. Lawrence glimpsed choirs of angels ranking off into geometrical infinity.

The pipes sprouted in parallel ranks from a broad flat box of compressed air. All of the pipes for a given note--but belonging to different stops--lined up with each other along one axis. All of the pipes for a given stop--but tuned at different pitches--lined up with each other along the other, perpendicular axis. Down there in the flat box of air, then, was a mechanism that got air to the right pipes at the right times. When a key or pedal was depressed, all of the pipes capable of sounding the corresponding note would speak, as long as their stops were pulled out.

Mechanically, all of this was handled in a fashion that was perfectly clear, simple, and logical. Lawrence had supposed that the machine must be at least as complicated as the most intricate fugue that could be played on it. Now he had learned that a machine, simple in its design, could produce results of infinite complexity.

Stops were rarely used alone. They tended to be piled on top of each other in combinations that were designed to take advantage of the available harmonics (more tasty mathematics here!). Certain combinations in particular were used over and over again. Lots of blockflo[autes, in varying lengths, for the quiet Offertory, for example. The organ included an ingenious mechanism called the preset, which enabled the organist to select a particular combination of stops--stops he himself had chosen--instantly. He would punch a button and several stops would bolt out from the console, driven by pneumatic pressure, and in that instant the organ would become a different instrument with entirely new timbres.

The next summer both Lawrence and Alice, his mother, were colonized by a distant cousin--a stupendous badass of a virus. Lawrence escaped from it with an almost imperceptible tendency to drag one of his feet. Alice wound up in an iron lung. Later, unable to cough effectively, she got pneumonia and died.

Lawrence's father Godfrey freely confessed that he was not equal to the burdens now laid on his shoulders. He resigned from his position at the small college in Virginia and moved, with his son, to a small house in Moorhead, Minnesota, next door to where Bunyan and Blanche had settled. Later he got a job teaching at a nearby normal school.

At this point, all of the responsible adults in Lawrence's life seemed to arrive at a tacit agreement that the best way to raise him--certainly the easiest--was to leave him alone. On the rare occasions when Lawrence requested adult intervention in his life, he was usually asking questions that no one could answer. At the age of sixteen, having found nothing in the local school system to challenge him, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse went off to college. He matriculated at Iowa State College, which among other things was the site of a Naval ROTC installation in which he was forcibly enrolled.

The Iowa State Naval ROTC had a band, and was delighted to hear that Lawrence had an interest in music. Since it was hard to drill on the deck of a dreadnought while playing a pipe organ, they issued him a glockenspiel and a couple of little dingers.

When not marching back and forth on the flood plain of the Skunk River making loud dinging noises, Lawrence was majoring in mechanical engineering. He ended up doing poorly in this area because he had fallen in with a Bulgarian professor named John Vincent Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, who were building a machine that was intended to automate the solution of some especially tedious differential equations.

The basic problem for Lawrence was that he was lazy. He had figured out that everything was much simpler if, like Superman with his X-ray vision, you just stared through the cosmetic distractions and saw the underlying mathematical skeleton. Once you found the math in a thing, you knew everything about it, and you could manipulate it to your heart's content with nothing more than a pencil and a napkin. He saw it in the curve of the silver bars on his glockenspiel, saw it in the catenary arch of a bridge and in the capacitor-studded drum of Atanasoff and Berry's computing machine. Actually pounding on the glockenspiel, riveting the bridge together, or trying to figure out why the computing machine wasn't working were not as interesting to him.

Consequently he got poor grades. From time to time, though, he would perform some stunt on the blackboard that would leave his professor weak in the knees and the other students baffled and hostile. Word got around.

At the same time, his grandmother Blanche was invoking her extensive Congregational connections, working the angles on Lawrence's behalf, totally unbeknownst to him. Her efforts culminated in triumph when Lawrence was awarded an obscure scholarship, endowed by a St. Paul oat-processing heir, whose purpose was to send Midwestern Congregationalists to the Ivy League for one year, which (evidently) was deemed a long enough period of time to raise their IQs by a few crucial points but not long enough to debauch them. So Lawrence got to be a sophomore in Princeton.

Now Princeton was an august school and going there was a great honor, but no one got around to mentioning either of these facts to Lawrence, who had no way of knowing. This had bad and good consequences. He accepted the scholarship with a faintness of gratitude that infuriated the oat lord. On the other hand, he adjusted to Princeton easily because it was just another place. It reminded him of the nicer bits of Virginia, and there were some nice pipe organs in town, though he was not all that happy with his engineering homework of bridge-designing and sprocket-cutting problems. As always, these eventually came down to math, most of which he could handle easily. From time to time he would get stuck, though, which led him to the Fine Hall: the headquarters of the Math Department.

There was a motley assortment of fellows wandering around in Fine Hall, many sporting British or European accents. Administratively speaking, many of these fellows were not members of the Math Department at all, but a separate thing called IAS, which stood for Institute for Advanced something-or-other. But they were all in the same building and they all knew a thing or two about math, so the distinction didn't exist for Lawrence.

Quite a few of these men would pretend shyness when Lawrence sought their advice, but others were at least willing to hear him out. For example: he had come up with a way to solve a difficult sprocket tooth shape problem that, as normally solved by engineers, would require any number of perfectly reasonable but aesthetically displeasing approximations. Lawrence's solution would provide exact results. The only drawback was that it would require a quintillion slide-rule operators a quintillion years to solve. Lawrence was working on a radically different approach that, if it worked, would bring those figures down to a trillion and a trillion respectively. Unfortunately, Lawrence was unable to interest anyone at Fine Hall in anything as prosaic as gears, until all of a sudden he made friends with an energetic British fellow, whose name he promptly forgot, but who had been doing a lot of literal sprocket-making himself lately. This fellow was trying to build, of all things, a mechanical calculating machine--specifically a machine to calculate certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.


certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.

[equation cannot be rendered in text]

where s is a complex number.

Lawrence found this zeta function to be no more and no less interesting than any other math problem until his new friend assured him that it was frightfully important, and that some of the best mathematicians in the world had been gnawing on it for decades. The two of them ended up staying awake until three in the morning working out the solution to Lawrence's sprocket problem. Lawrence presented the results proudly to his engineering professor, who snidely rejected it, on grounds of practicality, and gave him a poor grade for his troubles.

Lawrence finally remembered, after several more contacts, that the name of the friendly Brit was Al something-or-other. Because Al was a passionate cyclist, he and Al went on quite a few bicycle rides through the countryside of the Garden State. As they rode around New Jersey, they talked about math, and particularly about machines for taking the dull part of math off their hands.

But Al had been thinking about this subject for longer than Lawrence, and had figured out that computing machines were much more than just labor-saving devices. He'd been working on a radically different sort of computing mechanism that would work out any arithmetic problem whatsoever, as long as you knew how to write the problem down. From a pure logic standpoint, he had already figured out everything there was to know about this (as yet hypothetical) machine, though he had yet to build one. Lawrence gathered that actually building machinery was looked on as undignified at Cambridge (England, that is, where this Al character was based) or for that matter at Fine Hall. Al was thrilled to have found, in Lawrence, someone who did not share this view.

Al delicately asked him, one day, if Lawrence would terribly mind calling him by his full and proper name, which was Alan and not Al. Lawrence apologized and said he would try very hard to keep it in mind.

One day a couple of weeks later, as the two of them sat by a running stream in the woods above the Delaware Water Gap, Alan made some kind of an outlandish proposal to Lawrence involving penises. It required a great deal of methodical explanation, which Alan delivered with lots of blushing and stuttering. He was ever so polite, and several times emphasized that he was acutely aware that not everyone in the world was interested in this sort of thing.

Lawrence decided that he was probably one of those people.

Alan seemed vastly impressed that Lawrence had paused to think about it at all and apologized for putting him out. They went directly back to a discussion of computing machines, and their friendship continued unchanged. But on their next bicycle ride--an overnight camping trip to the Pine Barrens--they were joined by a new fellow, a German named Rudy von something-or-other.

Alan and Rudy's relationship seemed closer, or at least more multilayered, than Alan and Lawrence's. Lawrence concluded that Alan's penis scheme must have finally found a taker.

It got Lawrence to thinking. From an evolution standpoint, what was the point of having people around who were not inclined to have offspring? There must be some good, and fairly subtle, reason for it.

The only thing he could work out was that it was groups of people--societies--rather than individual creatures, who were now trying to out-reproduce and/or kill each other, and that, in a society, there was plenty of room for someone who didn't have kids as long as he was up to something useful.

Alan and Rudy and Lawrence rode south, anyway, looking for the Pine Barrens. After a while the towns became very far apart, and the horse farms gave way to a low stubble of feeble, spiny trees that appeared to extend all the way to Florida--blocking their view, but not the headwind. ``Where are the Pine Barrens I wonder?'' Lawrence asked a couple of times. He even stopped at a gas station to ask someone that question. His companions began to make fun of him.

``Vere are ze Pine Barrens?'' Rudy inquired, looking about quizzically.

``I should look for something rather barren-looking, with numerous pine trees,'' Alan mused.

There was no other traffic and so they had spread out across the road to pedal three abreast, with Alan in the middle.

``A forest, as Kafka would imagine it,'' Rudy muttered.

By this point Lawrence had figured out that they were, in fact, in the Pine Barrens. But he didn't know who Kafka was. ``A mathematician?'' he guessed.

``Zat is a scary sing to sink of,'' Rudy said.

``He is a writer,'' Alan said. ``Lawrence, please don't be offended that I ask you this, but: do you recognize any other people's names at all? Other than family and close friends, I mean.''

Lawrence must have looked baffled. ``I'm trying to figure out whether it all comes from in here,'' Alan said, reaching out to rap his knuckles on the side of Lawrence's head, ``or do you sometimes take in new ideas from other human beings?''


``When I was a little boy, I saw angels in a church in Virginia,'' Lawrence said, ``but I think that they came from inside my head.''

``Very well,'' Alan said.

But later Alan had another go at it. They had reached the fire lookout tower and it had been a thunderous disappointment: just an alienated staircase leading nowhere, and a small cleared area below that was glittery with shards of liquor bottles. They pitched their tent by the side of a pond that turned out to be full of rust-colored algae that stuck to the hairs on their bodies. Then there was nothing left to do but drink schnapps and talk about math.


Alan said, ``Look, it's like this: Bertrand Russell and another chap named Whitehead wrote Principia Mathematica...''


``Now I know you're pulling my leg,'' Waterhouse said. ``Even I know that Sir Isaac Newton wrote that.''


``Newton wrote a different book, also called Principia Mathematica, which isn't really about mathematics at all; it's about what we would today call physics.''


``Then why did he call it Principia Mathematica?''


``Because the distinction between mathematics and physics wasn't especially clear in Newton's day--''


``Or maybe even in zis day,'' Rudy said.


``--which is directly relevant to what I'm talking about,'' Alan continued. ``I am talking about Russell's P.M., in which he and Whitehead started absolutely from scratch, I mean from nothing, and built it all up--all mathematics--from a small number of first principles. And why I am telling you this, Lawrence, is that--Lawrence! Pay attention!''


``Hmmm?''


``Rudy--take this stick, here--that's right--and keep a close eye on Lawrence, and when he gets that foggy look on his face, poke him with it!''


``Zis is not an English school, you can't do zese kind of sing.''


``I'm listening,'' Lawrence said.


``What came out of P.M., which was terrifically radical, was the ability to say that all of math, really, can be expressed as a certain ordering of symbols.''

``Leibniz said it a long time before zen!'' protested Rudy.

``Er, Leibniz invented the notation we use for calculus, but--''

``I'm not talking about zat!''

``And he invented matrices, but--''

``I'm not talking about zat eezer!''

``And he did some work with binary arithmetic, but--''

``Zat is completely different!''

``Well, what the hell are you talking about, then, Rudy?''

``Leibniz invented ze basic alphabet--wrote down a set of symbols, for expressing statements about logic.''

``Well, I wasn't aware that Herr Leibniz counted formal logic among his interests, but--''

``Of course! He wanted to do what Russell and Whitehead did, except not just with mathematics, but with everything in ze whole world!''

``Well from the fact that you are the only man on the planet, Rudy, who seems to know about this undertaking of Leibniz's, can we assume that he failed?''

``You can assume anything that pleases your fancy, Alan,'' Rudy responded, ``but I am a mathematician and I do not assume anything.''

Alan sighed woundedly, and gave Rudy a Significant Look which Waterhouse assumed meant that there would be trouble later. ``If I may just make some headway, here,'' he said, ``all I'm really trying to get you to agree on, is that mathematics can be expressed as a series of symbols,'' (he snatched the Lawrence-poking stick and began drawing things like  the dirt) ``and frankly I could not care less whether they happen to be Leibniz's symbols, or Russell's, or the hexagrams of the I Ching....''

``Leibniz was fascinated by the I Ching!'' Rudy began.

``Shut up about Leibniz for a moment, Rudy, because look here: You--Rudy--and I are on a train, as it were, sitting in the dining car, having a nice conversation, and that train is being pulled along at a terrific clip by certain locomotives named The Bertrand Russell and Riemann and Euler and others. And our friend Lawrence is running alongside the train, trying to keep up with us--it's not that we're smarter than he is, necessarily, but that he's a farmer who didn't get a ticket. And I, Rudy, am simply reaching out through the open window here, trying to pull him onto the fucking train with us so that the three of us can have a nice little chat about mathematics without having to listen to him panting and gasping for breath the whole way.''

``All right, Alan.''

``Won't take a minute if you will just stop interrupting.''

``But there is a locomotive too named Leibniz.''

``Is it that you don't think I give enough credit to Germans? Because I am about to mention a fellow with an umlaut.''

``Oh, would it be Herr Turing?'' Rudy said slyly.

``Herr Turing comes later. I was actually thinking of Godel.''

``But he's not German! He's Austrian!''

``I'm afraid that it's all the same now, isn't it?''

``Ze Anschluss wasn't my idea, you don't have to look at me that way, I think Hitler is appalling.''

``I've heard of Godel,'' Waterhouse put in helpfully. ``But could we back up just a sec?''

``Of course Lawrence.''

``Why bother? Why did Russell do it? Was there something wrong with math? I mean, two plus two equals four, right?''

Alan picked up two bottlecaps and set them down on the ground. ``Two. One-two. Plus--'' He set down two more. ``Another two. One-two. Equals four. One-two-three-four.''

``What's so bad about that?'' Lawrence said.

``But Lawrence--when you really do math, in an abstract way, you're not counting bottlecaps, are you?''

``I'm not counting anything.''

Rudy broke the following news: ``Zat is a very modern position for you to take.''

``It is?''

Alan said, ``There was this implicit belief, for a long time, that math was a sort of physics of bottlecaps. That any mathematical operation you could do on paper, no matter how complicated, could be reduced--in theory, anyway--to messing about with actual physical counters, such as bottlecaps, in the real world.''

``But you can't have two point one bottlecaps.''

``All right, all right, say we use bottlecaps for integers, and for real numbers like two point one, we use physical measurements, like the length of this stick.'' Alan tossed the stick down next to the bottlecaps.

``Well what about pi, then? You can't have a stick that's exactly pi inches long.''

``Pi is from geometry--ze same story,'' Rudy put in.

``Yes, it was believed that Euclid's geometry was really a kind of physics, that his lines and so on represented properties of the physical world. But--you know Einstein?''

``I'm not very good with names.''

``That white-haired chap with the big mustache?''

``Oh, yeah,'' Lawrence said dimly, ``I tried to ask him my sprocket question. He claimed he was late for an appointment or something.''

``That fellow has come up with a general relativity theory, which is sort of a practical application, not of Euclid's, but of Riemann's geometry--''

``The same Riemann of your zeta function?''

``Same Riemann, different subject. Now let's not get sidetracked here Lawrence--''

``Riemann showed you could have many many different geometries that were not the geometry of Euclid but that still made sense internally,'' Rudy explained.

``All right, so back to P.M. then,'' Lawrence said.

``Yes! Russell and Whitehead. It's like this: when mathematicians began fooling around with things like the square root of negative one, and quaternions, then they were no longer dealing with things that you could translate into sticks and bottlecaps. And yet they were still getting sound results.''

``Or at least internally consistent results,'' Rudy said.

``Okay. Meaning that math was more than a physics of bottlecaps.''

``It appeared that way, Lawrence, but this raised the question of was mathematics really true or was it just a game played with symbols? In other words--are we discovering Truth, or just wanking?''

``It has to be true because if you do physics with it, it all works out! I've heard of that general relativity thing, and I know they did experiments and figured out it was true.''

``Ze great majority of mathematics does not lend itself to experimental testing,'' Rudy said.

``The whole idea of this project is to sever the ties to physics,'' Alan said.

``And yet not to be vanking ourselves.''

``That's what P.M. was trying to do?''

``Russell and Whitehead broke all mathematical concepts down into brutally simple things like sets. From there they got to integers, and so on.''

``But how can you break something like pi down into a set?''

``You can't,'' Alan said, ``but you can express it as a long string of digits. Three point one four one five nine, and so on.''

``And digits are integers,'' Rudy said.

``But no fair! Pi itself is not an integer!''

``But you can calculate the digits of pi, one at a time, by using certain formulas. And you can write down the formulas like so!'' Alan scratches this in the dirt:



``I have used the Leibniz series in order to placate our friend. See, Lawrence? It is a string of symbols.''

``Okay. I see the string of symbols,'' Lawrence said reluctantly.

``Can we move on? Godel said, just a few years ago, `Say! If you buy into this business about mathematics being just strings of symbols, guess what?' And he pointed out that any string of symbols--such as this very formula, here--can be translated into integers.''

``How?''

``Nothing fancy, Lawrence--it's just simple encryption. Arbitrary. The number `538' might be written down instead of this great ugly £, and so on.''

``Seems pretty close to wanking, now.''

``No, no. Because then Godel sprang the trap! Formulas can act on numbers, right?''

``Sure. Like 2x.''

``Yes. You can substitute any number for x and the formula 2x will double it. But if another mathematical formula, such as this one right here, for calculating pi, can be encoded as a number, then you can have another formula act on it. Formulas acting on formulas!''

``Is that all?''

``No. Then he showed, really through a very simple argument, that if formulas really can refer to themselves, it's possible to write one down saying `this statement cannot be proved.' Which was tremendously startling to Hilbert and everyone else, who expected the opposite result.''

``Have you mentioned this Hilbert guy before?''

``No, he is new to this discussion, Lawrence.''

``Who is he?''

``A man who asks difficult questions. He asked a whole list of them once. Go[audel answered one of them.''

``And Turing answered another,'' Rudy said.

``Who's that?''

``It's me,'' Alan said. ``But Rudy's joking. `Turing' doesn't really have an umlaut in it.''

``He's going to have an umlaut in him later tonight,'' Rudy said, looking at Alan in a way that, in retrospect, years later, Lawrence would understand to have been smoldering.

``Well, don't keep me in suspense. Which one of his questions did you answer?''

``The Entscheidungsproblem,'' Rudy said.

``Meaning?''

Alan explained, ``Hilbert wanted to know whether any given statement could, in principle, be found true or false.''

``But after Godel got finished, it changed,'' Rudy pointed out.

``That's true--after Godel it became `Can we determine whether any given statement is provable or non-provable?' In other words, is there some sort of mechanical process we could use to separate the provable statements from the nonprovable ones?''

`` `Mechanical process' is supposed to be a metaphor, Alan....''

``Oh, stop it, Rudy! Lawrence and I are quite comfortable with machinery.''

``I get it,'' Lawrence said.

``What do you mean, you get it?'' Alan said.

``Your machine--not the zeta-function calculator, but the other one. The one we've been talking about building--''

``It is called Universal Turing Machine,'' Rudy said.

``The whole point of that gizmo is to separate provable from nonprovable statements, isn't it?''

``That's why I came up with the basic idea for it,'' Alan said. ``So Hilbert's question has been answered. Now I just want to actually build one so that I can beat Rudy at chess.''

``You haven't told poor Lawrence the answer yet!'' Rudy protested.

``Lawrence can figure it out,'' Alan said. ``It'll give him something to do.''

Soon it became clear that Alan really meant: It'll give him something to do while we're fucking. Lawrence shoved a notebook into the waistband of his trousers and rode his bicycle a few hundred yards to the fire tower, then climbed up the stairs to the platform at the top and sat down, back to the setting sun, notebook propped up on his knees to catch the light.

He could not collect his thoughts, and then he was distracted by a false sunrise that lit up the clouds off to the northeast. He thought at first that some low clouds were bouncing fragments of the sunset back to him, but it was too concentrated and flickering for that. Then he thought it was lightning. But the color of the light was not blue enough. It fluctuated sharply, modulated by (one had to assume) great, startling events that were occulted by the horizon. As the sun went down on the opposite side of the world, the light on the New Jersey horizon focused to a steady, lambent core the color of a flashlight when you shine it through the palm of your hand under the bedsheets.

Lawrence climbed down the stairs and got on his bicycle and rode through the Pine Barrens. Before long he came to a road that led in the general direction of the light. Most of the time he could not see anything, not even the road, but after a couple of hours the glow bouncing off the low cloud layer lit up flat stones in the road, and turned the barrens' wandering rivulets into glowing crevices.

The road began to tend in the wrong direction and so Lawrence cut directly into the woods, because he was very close now, and the light in the sky was strong enough that he could see it through the sparse carpet of scrubby pines--black sticks that appeared to have been burned, though they hadn't. The ground had turned into sand, but it was damp and compacted, and his bicycle had fat tires that rode over it well. At one point he had to stop and throw the bike over a barbed-wire fence. Then he broke out of the sticks and onto a perfectly flat expanse of white sand, stitched down with tufts of beach grass, and just then he was dazzled by a low fence of quiet steady flames that ran across a part of the horizon about as wide as the harvest moon when it sinks into the sea. Its brightness made it difficult to see anything else--Lawrence kept riding into little ditches and creeks that meandered across the flats. He learned not to stare directly at the flames. Looking off to the sides was more interesting anyway: the table-land was marked at wide intervals by the largest buildings he had ever seen, cracker-box structures built by Pharaohs, and in the mile-wide plazas between them, gnomons of triangulated steel were planted in wide stances: the internal skeletons of pyramids. The largest of these pierced the center of a perfectly circular railway line a few hundred feet in diameter: two argent curves scored on the dull ground, interrupted in one place where the tower's shadow, a stopped sundial, told the time. He rode by a building smaller than the others, with oval tanks standing next to it. Steam murmured from valves on the tops of the tanks, but instead of rising into the air it dribbled down the sides and struck the ground and spread out, coating the sea-grass with jackets of silver.

A thousand sailors in white were standing in a ring around the long flame. One of them held up his hand and waved Lawrence down. Lawrence came to a stop next to the sailor and planted one foot on the sand to steady himself. He and the sailor stared at each other for a moment and then Lawrence, who could not think of anything else, said, ``I am in the Navy also.'' Then the sailor seemed to make up his mind about something. He saluted Lawrence through, and pointed him towards a small building off to the side of the fire.

The building looked only like a wall glowing in the firelight, but sometimes a barrage of magnesium blue light made its windowframes jump out of the darkness, a rectangular lightning-bolt that echoed many times across the night. Lawrence started pedaling again and rode past that building: a spiraling flock of alert fedoras, prodding at slim terse notebooks with stately Ticonderogas, crab-walking photogs turning their huge chrome daisies, crisp rows of people sleeping with blankets over their faces, a sweating man with Brilliantined hair chalking umlauted names on a blackboard. Finally coming around this building he smelled hot fuel oil, felt the heat of the flames on his face and saw beach-glass curled toward it and desiccated.

He stared down upon the world's globe, not the globe fleshed with continents and oceans but only its skeleton: a burst of meridians, curving backwards to cage an inner dome of orange flame. Against the light of the burning oil those longitudes were thin and crisp as a draftsman's ink-strokes. But coming closer he saw them resolve into clever works of rings and struts, hollow as a bird's bones. As they spread away from the pole they sooner or later began to wander, or split into bent parts, or just broke off and hung in the fire oscillating like dry stalks. The perfect geometry was also mottled, here and there, by webs of cable and harnesses of electrical wiring. Lawrence almost rode over a broken wine bottle and decided he should now walk, to spare his bicycle's tires, so he laid the bike down, the front wheel covering an aluminum vase that appeared to have been spun on a lathe, with a few charred roses hanging out of it. Some sailors had joined their hands to form a sort of throne, and were bearing along a human-shaped piece of charcoal dressed in a coverall of immaculate asbestos. As they walked the toes of their shoes caught in vast, ramified snarls of ropes and piano-wires, cables and wires, creative furtive movements in the grass and the sand dozens of yards every direction. Lawrence began planting his feet very thoughtfully one in front of the other, trying to measure the greatness of what he had come and seen. A rocket-shaped pod stuck askew from the sand, supporting an umbrella of bent-back propellers. The duralumin struts and catwalks rambled on above him for miles. There was a suitcase spilled open, with a pair of women's shoes displayed as if in the window of a downtown store, and a menu that had been charred to an oval glow, and then some tousled wall-slabs, like a whole room that had dropped out of the sky--these were decorated, one with a giant map of the world, great circles arcing away from Berlin to pounce on cities near and far, and another with a photograph of a famous, fat German in a uniform, grinning on a flowered platform, the giant horizon of a new Zeppelin behind him.

After a while he stopped seeing new things. Then he got on his bicycle and rode back through the Pine Barrens. He got lost in the dark and so didn't find his way back to the fire tower until dawn. But he didn't mind being lost because while he rode around in the dark he thought about the Turing machine. Finally he came back to the shore of the pond where they had camped. The dawn-light shining on the saucer of calm reddish water made it look like a pool of blood. Alan Mathison Turing and Rudolf von Hacklheber were lying together like spoons on the shore, still smudged a little bit from their swim yesterday. Lawrence started a little fire and made some tea and they woke up eventually.

``Did you solve the problem?'' Alan asked him.

``Well you can turn that Universal Turing Machine of yours into any machine by changing the presets--''

``Presets?''

``Sorry, Alan, I think of your U.T.M. as being kind of like a pipe organ.''

``Oh.''

``Once you've done that, anyway, you can do any calculation you please, if the tape is long enough. But gosh, Alan, making a tape that's long enough, and that you can write symbols on, and erase them, is going to be sort of tricky--Atanasoff's capacitor drum would only work up to a certain size--you'd have to--''

``This is a digression,'' Alan said gently.

``Yeah, okay, well--if you had a machine like that, then any given preset could be represented by a number--a string of symbols. And the tape that you would feed into it to start the calculation would contain another string of symbols. So it's Go[audel's proof all over again--if any possible combination of machine and data can be represented by a string of numbers, then you can just arrange all of the possible strings of numbers into a big table, and then it turns into a Cantor diagonal type of argument, and the answer is that there must be some numbers that cannot be computed.''

``And ze Entscheidungsproblem?'' Rudy reminded him.

``Proving or disproving a formula--once you've encrypted the formula into numbers, that is--is just a calculation on that number. So it means that the answer to the question is, no! Some formulas cannot be proved or disproved by any mechanical process! So I guess there's some point in being human after all!''

Alan looked pleased until Lawrence said this last thing, and then his face collapsed. ``Now there you go making unwarranted assumptions.''

``Don't listen to him, Lawrence!'' Rudy said. ``He's going to tell you that our brains are Turing machines.''

``Thank you, Rudy,'' Alan said patiently. ``Lawrence, I submit that our brains are Turing machines.''

``But you proved that there's a whole lot of formulas that a Turing machine can't process!''

``And you have proved it too, Lawrence.''

``But don't you think that we can do some things that a Turing machine couldn't?''

``Godel agrees with you, Lawrence,'' Rudy put in, ``and so does Hardy.''

``Give me one example,'' Alan said.

``Of a noncomputable function that a human can do, and a Turing machine can't?''

``Yes. And don't give me any sentimental nonsense about creativity. I believe that a Universal Turing Machine could show behaviors that we would construe as creative.''

``Well, I don't know then... I'll try to keep my eye out for that kind of thing in the future.''

But later, as they were riding back towards Princeton, he said, ``What about dreams?''

``Like those angels in Virginia?''

``I guess so.''

``Just noise in the neurons, Lawrence.''

``Also I dreamed last night that a zeppelin was burning.''



Soon, Alan got his Ph.D. and went back to England. He wrote Lawrence a couple of letters. The last of these stated, simply, that he would not be able to write Lawrence any more letters ``of substance'' and that Lawrence should not take it personally. Lawrence perceived right away that Alan's society had put him to work doing something useful--probably figuring out how to keep it from being eaten alive by certain of its neighbors. Lawrence wondered what use America would find for him.

He went back to Iowa State, considered changing his major to mathematics, but didn't. It was the consensus of all whom he consulted that mathematics, like pipe-organ restoration, was a fine thing, but that one needed some way to put bread on the table. He remained in engineering and did more and more poorly at it until the middle of his senior year, when the university suggested that he enter a useful line of work, such as roofing. He walked straight out of college into the waiting arms of the Navy.

They gave him an intelligence test. The first question on the math part had to do with boats on a river: Port Smith is 100 miles upstream of Port Jones. The river flows at 5 miles per hour. The boat goes through water at 10 miles per hour. How long does it take to go from Port Smith to Port Jones? How long to come back?

Lawrence immediately saw that it was a trick question. You would have to be some kind of idiot to make the facile assumption that the current would add or subtract 5 miles per hour to or from the speed of the boat. Clearly, 5 miles per hour was nothing more than the average speed. The current would be faster in the middle of the river and slower at the banks. More complicated variations could be expected at bends in the river. Basically it was a question of hydrodynamics, which could be tackled using certain well-known systems of differential equations. Lawrence dove into the problem, rapidly (or so he thought) covering both sides of ten sheets of paper with calculations. Along the way, he realized that one of his assumptions, in combination with the simplified Navier-Stokes equations, had led him into an exploration of a particularly interesting family of partial differential equations. Before he knew it, he had proved a new theorem. If that didn't prove his intelligence, what would?

Then the time bell rang and the papers were collected. Lawrence managed to hang onto his scratch paper. He took it back to his dorm, typed it up, and mailed it to one of the more approachable math professors at Princeton, who promptly arranged for it to be published in a Parisian mathematics journal.

Lawrence received two free, freshly printed copies of the journal a few months later, in San Diego, California, during mail call on board a large ship called the U.S.S. Nevada. The ship had a band, and the Navy had given Lawrence the job of playing the glockenspiel in it, because their testing procedures had proven that he was not intelligent enough to do anything else.

The sack of mail carrying Lawrence's contribution to the mathematical literature arrived just in the nick of time. Lawrence's ship, and quite a few of her sisters, had until then been based in California. But at just this moment, all of them were transferred to some place called Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in order to show the Nips who was boss.

Lawrence had never really known what he wanted to do with his life, but he quickly decided that being glockenspiel player on a battleship in Hawaii during peacetime was a long way from the worst life you could possibly have. The harshest part of the job was sometimes having to sit or march in very warm conditions, and enduring occasional fluffed notes by other band members. He had abundant free time, which he spent working on a series of new theorems in the field of information theory. The field had been invented and pretty much encompassed by his friend Alan, but there was much detail work to be done. He and Alan and Rudy had sketched out a general plan of what needed to be proved or disproved. Lawrence tore through the list. He wondered what Alan and Rudy were up to in Britain and Germany, but he couldn't write to them and find out, so he kept his work to himself. When he wasn't playing the glockenspiel or working out theorems, there were bars and dances to go to. Waterhouse did some penis work of his own, got the clap, had it cured,* bought condoms. All of the sailors did this. They were like three-year olds who shove pencils in their ears, discover that it hurts, and stop doing it. Lawrence's first year went by almost instantly. Time just blazed by. Nowhere could be sunnier, more relaxing, than Hawaii.

*1940 being a good year to begin experimenting with venereal diseases in that the new injectable penicillin was just becoming available



NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM

``Filipinos are a warm, gentle, caring, giving people,'' avi says, ``which is a good thing since so many of them carry concealed weapons.''

Randy is in Tokyo's airport, ambling down a concourse with a slowness that is infuriating to his fellow travelers. They have all spent the last half-day strapped into bad chairs, stuffed into an aluminum tube aslosh with jet fuel. Over the safety-engineered nubs molded into the jetway floor, their rolling suitcases drone like fighter planes. They graze the backs of his knees as they bank around his husky columnar body. Randy is holding his new GSM phone to the side of his head. Supposedly it works anywhere in the world, except for the United States. This is his first chance to try it out.

``You sound clear as a bell,'' Avi says. ``How was the flight over?''

``All right,'' Randy says. ``They had one of those animated maps up on the video screen.''

Avi sighs. ``All the airlines have those now,'' he announces monotonically.

``The only feature between San Francisco and Tokyo was Midway Island.''

``So?''

``It kind of hung there for hours. MIDWAY. Mute embarrassment all around.''

Randy reaches the departure gate for Manila, and pauses to admire a five-foot-wide high-definition TV set bearing the logo of a major Nipponese consumer-electronics company. It is running a video in which a wacky cartoon professor and his adorable canine sidekick cheerfully tick off the three transmission routes of the AIDS virus.

``I have a fingerprint for you,'' Randy says.

``Shoot.''

Randy stares at the palm of his hand, on which he has written a string of numbers and letters in ballpoint pen. ``AF 10 06 E9 99 BA 11 07 64 C1 89 E3 40 8C 72 55.''

``Got it,'' Avi says. ``That's from Ordo, right?''

``Right. I e-mailed you the key from SFO.''

``The apartment situation is still resolving,'' Avi says. ``So I just reserved you a suite at the Manila Hotel.''

``What do you mean, it's still resolving?''

``The Philippines is one of those post-Spanish countries with no clear boundaries between business and personal relationships,'' Avi says. ``I don't think you can secure lodgings there without marrying into a family with a major street named after it.''

Randy takes a seat in the departure area. Perky gate attendants in jaunty, improbable hats zero in on Filipinos with too many carry-ons, and subject them to a public ritual of filling out little tags and surrendering their possessions. The Filipinos roll their eyes and stare longingly out the windows. But most of the waiting passengers are Nipponese--some businessmen, mostly vacationers. They are watching an educational video about how to get mugged in foreign countries.

``Huh,'' Randy says, looking out the window, ``got another 747 down to Manila.''

``In Asia, no decent airline bothers to dick around anything smaller than a 747,'' Avi snaps. ``If someone tries to pack you on board a 737 or god forbid an Airbus, run, don't walk, away from the boarding lounge, and call me on my Sky Pager and I'll send in a chopper to evacuate you.''

Randy laughs.

Avi continues. ``Now, listen. This hotel you're going to is very old, very grand, but it's in the middle of nowhere.''

``Why would they build a grand hotel in the middle of nowhere?''

``It used to be a happening place--it's on the waterfront, right on the edge of Intramuros.''

Randy's high-school Spanish is enough to translate that: Inside the Walls.

``But Intramuros was annihilated by the Nipponese in 1945,'' Avi continues. ``Systematically. All of the business hotels and office buildings are in a new neighborhood called Makati, much closer to the airport.''

``So you want to put our office in Intramuros.''

``How'd you guess?'' Avi says, sounding a little spooked. He prides himself on unpredictability.

``I'm not an intuitive guy generally,'' Randy says, ``but I've been on a plane for thirteen hours and my brain has been turned inside out and hung up to dry.''

Avi rattles off canned justifications: office space is much cheaper in Intramuros. Government ministries are closer. Makati, the gleaming new business district, is too isolated from the real Philippines. Randy pays no attention to it.

``You want to work out of Intramuros because it was systematically annihilated, and because you're obsessed with the Holocaust,'' Randy finally says, quietly and without rancor.

``Yeah. So?'' Avi says.

Randy stares out the window of the Manila-bound 747, sipping on a fluorescent green Nipponese soft drink made from bee extracts (at least, it has pictures of bees on it) and munching on something that a flight attendant handed him called Japanese Snack. Sky and ocean are the same color, a shade of blue that makes his teeth freeze. The plane is so high that, whether he looks up or down, he sees foreshortened views of boiling cumulonimbus stacks. The clouds erupt from the hot Pacific as if immense warships were exploding all over the place. The speed and power of their growth is alarming, the forms they adopt as bizarre and varied as those of deep-sea organisms, and all of them, he supposes, are as dangerous to an airplane as punji stakes to a barefoot pedestrian. The red-orange meatball painted on the wingtip startles him when he notices it. He feels like he's been thrown into an old war film.

He turns on his laptop. Electronic mail from Avi, encrypted to a fare-thee-well, has been piling up in his in-box. It is a gradual accumulation of tiny files, thrown at him by Avi whenever a thought popped into his head over the last three days; it would be obvious, even if Randy didn't know it, that Avi owns a portable e-mail machine that talks to the Internet by radio. Randy fires up a piece of software that is technically called Novus Ordo Seclorum but that everyone calls Ordo for short. It is a fairly strained pun based on the fact that Ordo's job, as a piece of cryptographic software, is to put a message's bits in a New Order and that it will take Centuries for nosy governments to decrypt it. A scanned image of a Great Pyramid appears in the middle of his screen, and a single eye gradually materializes at its apex.

Ordo can handle this in one of two ways. The obvious way is to decrypt all of the messages and convert them into plaintext files on his hard disk, which he can then read any time he wants. The problem with this (if you are paranoid) is that anyone who gets his hands on Randy's hard disk can then read the files. For all he knows, the customs officials in Manila will decide to ransack his computer for child pornography. Or, fogged by jet lag, he'll leave his laptop in a taxi. So instead he puts Ordo into a streaming mode where it will decrypt the files just long enough for him to read them and then, when he closes the windows, expunge the plaintext from the computer's memory and from its hard drive.

The subject heading of Avi's first message is: ``Guideline 1.''

We look for places where the math is right. Meaning what? Meaning that pop. is about to explode---we can predict that just by looking at age histogram---and per capita income is about to take off the way it did in Nippon, Taiwan, Singapore. Multiply those two things together and you get the kind of exponential growth that should get us all into fuck-you money before we turn forty.

This is an allusion to a Randy/Avi conversation of two years ago wherein Avi actually calculated a specific numerical value for ``fuck-you money.'' It was not a fixed constant, however, but rather a cell in a spreadsheet linked to any number of continually fluctuating economic indicators. Sometimes when Avi is working at his computer he will leave the spreadsheet running in a tiny window in the corner so that he can see the current value of ``fuck-you money'' at a glance.

The second message, sent a couple of hours later, is called ``Guideline 2.''

Two: pick a tech where no one can compete with us. Right now, that=networking. We're kicking the crap out of everyone else in the world when it comes to networking. It's not even funny.

The next day, Avi sent a message called, simply, ``More.'' Perhaps he had lost track of the number of guidelines he'd issued so far.

Another principle: this time we retain control of the corporation. That means that we keep at least fifty percent of the shares---which means little to no outside investment until we've built up some value.

``You don't have to convince me,'' Randy mumbles to himself, as he reads this.

This shapes the kinds of businesses we can get into. Forget anything that requires a big initial investment.

Luzon is green-black jungle mountains gouged with rivers that would appear to be avalanches of silt. As the navy-blue ocean verges on its khaki beaches, the water takes on the shocking iridescent hue of a suburban swimming pool. Farther south, the mountains are swidden-scarred--the soil beneath is bright red and so these parts look like fresh lacerations. But most is covered with foliage that looks like the nubby green stuff that model railroaders put over their papier-mache hills, and in vast stretches of the mountains there are no signs whatsoever that human beings have ever existed. Closer to Manila, some of the slopes are deforested, sprinkled with structures, ribboned with power-line cuts. Rice paddies line the basins. The towns are accretions of shanties, nucleated around large cross-shaped churches with good roofs.

The view gets blurry as they belly down into the pall of sweaty smog above the city. The plane begins to sweat like a giant glass of iced tea. The water streams off in sheets, collects in crevices, whips off the flaps' trailing edges.

Suddenly they are banking over Manila Bay, which is marked with endless streaks of brilliant red--some kind of algal bloom. Oil tankers trail long time-delayed rainbows that flourish in their wakes. Every cove is jammed with long skinny boats with dual outriggers, looking like brightly painted water skaters.

And then they are down on the runway at NAIA, Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Guards and cops of various stripes are ambling around with M-16s or pistol-handled pump shotguns, wearing burnooses fashioned from handkerchiefs clamped to the head with American baseball caps. A man dressed in a radiant white uniform stands below the ragged maw of the jetway holding his hands downwards with fluorescent orange sticks in them, like Christ dispensing mercy on a world of sinners. Sulfurous, fulminating tropical air begins to leak in through the jumbo's air vents. Everything moistens and wilts.

He is in Manila. He takes his passport out of his shirt pocket. It says, RANDALL LAWRENCE WATERHOUSE.



This is how Epiphyte Corporation came into existence:

``I am channeling the bad shit!'' Avi said.

The number came through on Randy's pager while he was sitting around a table in a grubhouse along the coast with his girlfriend's crowd. A place where, every day, they laser-printed fresh menus on 100% recycled imitation parchment, where oscilloscope tracings of neon-colored sauces scribbled across the plates, and the entrees were towering, architectonic stacks of rare ingredients carved into gemlike prisms. Randy had spent the entire meal trying to resist the temptation to invite one of Charlene's friends (any one of them, it didn't matter) out on the sidewalk for a fistfight.

He glanced at his pager expecting to see the number of the Three Siblings Computer Center, which was where he worked (technically, still does). The fell digits of Avi's phone number penetrated the core of his being in the same way that 666 would a fundamentalist's.

Fifteen seconds later, Randy was out on the sidewalk, swiping his card through a pay phone like an assassin drawing a single-edged razor blade across the throat of a tubby politician.

``The power is coming down from On High,'' Avi continued. ``Tonight, it happens to be coming through me--you poor bastard.''

``What do you want me to do?'' Randy asked, adopting a cold, almost hostile tone to mask sick excitement.

``Buy a ticket to Manila,'' Avi said.

``I have to talk it over with Charlene first,'' Randy said.

``You don't even believe that yourself,'' Avi said.

``Charlene and I have a long-standing relationsh--''

``It's been ten years. You haven't married her. Fill in the fucking blanks.''

(Seventy-two hours later, he would be in Manila, looking at the One-Note Flute.)

``Everyone in Asia is wondering when the Philippines is finally going to get its shit together,'' Avi said, ``it's the question of the nineties.''

(The One-Note Flute is the first thing you see when you make it through passport control.)

``I flashed on this when I was standing in line at Passport Control at Ninoy Aquino International Airport,'' Avi said, compressing that entire name into a single, sharply articulated burst. ``You know how they have different lanes?''

``I guess so,'' Randy said. A parallelpiped of seared tuna did a barrel roll in his gullet. He felt a perverse craving for a double ice-cream cone. He did not travel as much as Avi, and had only a vague idea of what he meant by lanes.

``You know. One lane for citizens. One for foreigners. Maybe one for diplomats.''

(Now, standing there waiting to have his passport stamped, Randy can see it clearly. For once he doesn't mind the wait. He gets in a lane next to the OCW lane and studies them. They are Epiphyte Corp.'s market. Mostly young women, many of them fashionably dressed, but still with a kind of Catholic boarding-school demureness. Exhausted from long flights, tired of the wait, they slump, then suddenly straighten up and elevate their fine chins, as if an invisible nun were making her way up the line whacking their manicured knuckles with a ruler.)

But seventy-two hours ago he hadn't really understood what Avi meant by lanes, so he just said, ``Yeah, I've seen the lane thing.''

``At Manila, they have a whole lane just for returning OCWs!''

``OCWs?''

``Overseas Contract Workers. Filipinos working abroad--because the economy of the Philippines is so lame. As maids and nannies in Saudi. Nurses and anesthesiologists in the States. Singers in Hong Kong, whores in Bangkok.''

``Whores in Bangkok?'' Randy had been there, at least, and his mind reeled at the concept of importing prostitutes to Thailand.

``The Filipino women are more beautiful,'' Avi said quietly, ``and have a ferocity that makes them more interesting, to the innately masochistic business traveler, than all those grinning Thai bimbos.'' Both of them knew that this was complete bullshit; Avi was a family man and had no firsthand experience whereof he spoke. Randy didn't call him on it, though. As long as Avi retained this extemporaneous bullshitting ability there was a better than even chance of all of them making fuck-you money.

(Now that he's here, it is tempting to speculate as to which of the girls in the OCW lane are hustlers. But he can't see that going anywhere but wrong, so he squares his shoulders and marches toward the yellow line.

The government has set up glass display cases in the concourse leading from passport control to the security barrier. The cases contain artifacts demonstrating the glories of pre-Magellan Filipino culture. The first one of these contains the piece de resistance: a rustic hand-carved musical instrument labeled with a long and unreadable name in Tagalog. Underneath that, in smaller letters, is the English translation: ONE-NOTE FLUTE.)

``See? The Philippines is innately hedged,'' Avi said. ``You know how rare that is? When you find an innately hedged environment, Randy, you lunge into it like a rabid ferret going into a pipe full of raw meat.''

A word about Avi: his father's people had just barely gotten out of Prague. As Central European Jews went, they were fairly typical. The only thing about them that was really anomalous was that they were still alive. But his mother's people were unbelievably peculiar New Mexican crypto-Jews who had been living on mesas, dodging Jesuits, shooting rattlesnakes and eating jimson weed for three hundred years; they looked like Indians and talked like cowboys. In his relations with other people, therefore, Avi dithered. Most of the time he was courtly and correct in a way that was deeply impressive to businesspeople--Nipponese ones expecially--but there were these eruptions, from time to time, as if he'd been dipping into the loco weed. Randy had learned to deal with it, which is why Avi called him at times like this.

``Oh, calm down!'' Randy said. He watched a tanned girl rollerblade past him, on her way up from the beach. ``Innately hedged?''

``As long as the Philippines don't have their shit together, there'll be plenty of OCWs. They will want to communicate with their families--the Filipinos are incredibly family-oriented. They make Jews look like a bunch of alienated loners.''

``Okay. You know more about both groups than I do.''

``They are sentimental and affectionate in a way that's very easy for us to sneer at.''

``You don't have to be defensive,'' Randy said, ``I'm not sneering at them.''

``When you hear their song dedications on the radio, you'll sneer,'' Avi said. ``But frankly, we could take some pointers from the Pinoys on this front.''

``You are so close to being sanctimonious right now--''

``I apologize,'' Avi said, with absolute sincerity. Avi's wife had been pregnant almost continuously for the four years they'd been married. He was getting more religiously observant daily and couldn't make it through a conversation without mentioning the Holocaust. Randy was a bachelor who was just about to break up with the chick he'd been living with.

``I believe you, Avi,'' Randy said. ``Is it a problem with you if I buy a business-class ticket?''

Avi didn't hear him, so Randy assumed that meant yes. ``As long as that's the case, there will be a big market for Pinoy-grams.''

``Pinoy-grams?''

``For god's sake, don't say it out loud! I'm filling out the trademark application as we speak,'' Avi said. Randy could hear a rattling sound in the background, computer keys impacting so rapidly it sounded like Avi was simply holding the keyboard between his pale, spindly hands and shaking it violently up and down. ``But if the Filipinos do get their shit together, then we see explosive growth in telecoms, as in any other Arday.''

``Arday?''

``R-D-A-E. Rapidly Developing Asian Economy. Either way, we win.''

``I gather you want to do something with telecoms?''

``Bingo.'' In the background, a baby began to cough and cry. ``Gotta go,'' Avi said, ``Shlomo's asthma is spiking again. Take down this fingerprint.''

``Fingerprint?''

``For my encryption key. For e-mail.''

``Ordo?''

``Yeah.''

Randy took out a ballpoint pen and, finding no paper in his pocket, poised it over the palm of his hand. ``Shoot.''

``67 81 A4 AE FF 40 25 9B 43 0E 29 8D 56 60 E3 2F.'' Then Avi hung up the phone.

Randy went back into the restaurant. On his way back, he asked the waiter to bring him a half-bottle of good red wine. Charlene heard him, and glowered. Randy was still thinking about innate ferocity, and did not see it in her face; only a schoolmarmishness common among all of her friends. My god! I have to get out of California, he realized.


SEAWEED

Woman holds baby

Eyes pale as a muzzle flash

Band chimes frozen tears

The fourth marines is marching downhill to the strains of John Philip Sousa, which ought to be second nature to a Marine. But the Fourth Marines have been in Shanghai (which ain't no halls of Montezuma nor shores of Tripoli) for too long, longer than Marines should ever stay in one place, and Bobby's already seen his sergeant, one Frick, throw up from opium withdrawal.

A Marine band is several Shanghai blocks ahead. Bobby's platoon can hear the thumpity-thump of the big drums and the piercing noises from piccolos and glockenspiels but he can't follow the tune. Corporal Shaftoe is effectively their leader, because Sergeant Frick is useless.

Shaftoe marches alongside the formation, supposedly to keep an eye on his men, but mostly he's just staring at Shanghai.

Shanghai stares back, and mostly gives them a standing ovation. Of course there is a type of young street rowdy who makes it a point of honor to let the Marines know he isn't scared of them, and they are jeering the Marines from a safe distance, and setting off strings of firecrackers, which does nothing to steady anyone's nerves. The Europeans are applauding--a whole chorus line of Russian dancing girls from Delmonte's is showing thigh and blowing kisses. But most of the Chinese look pretty stonefaced, which--Bobby suspects--means they're scared shitless.

The worst thing is the women carrying half-white babies. A few of these women are rabid, hysterical, throwing themselves into formations of massed Marines, undeterred by rifle butts. But most of them are stoic: they stand with their light-eyed babies and glare, searching the ranks and files for the guilty party. They've all heard about what happened upriver in Nanjing when the Nips came there, and they know that when it's all over, the only trace that they and their babies ever existed may be a really bad memory in the mind of some American Marine.

It works for Shaftoe: he has hunted deer in Wisconsin and seen them limping across the snow, bleeding to death. He saw a man die in basic training at Parris Island. He has seen whole tangles of bodies in the Yangtze, downstream of where the Nipponese were prosecuting the China Incident, and he has seen refugees from places like Nanjing starve to death in the gutters of Shanghai. He has himself killed people who were trying to storm the riverboats it was his duty to protect. He thinks that he has never seen, and will never see, anything as terrible as those stone-faced Chinese women holding their white babies, not even blinking as the firecrackers explode all around them.

Until, that is, he looks into the faces of certain Marines who stare into that crowd and see their own faces looking back at them, pudgy with baby fat and streaked with tears. Some of them seem to think it's all a joke. But many of the Marines who march out of their empty barracks that morning sane and solid men, have, by the time they reach the gunboats waiting for them at the Bund, gone mad. They don't show it. But Shaftoe can see in their eyes that something has given way inside.

The very best men in the regiment are in a foul mood. The ones like Shaftoe, who didn't get involved with the Chinese women, are still leaving plenty behind: houses with maids and shoeshine boys and coolies, with women and opium for almost nothing. They don't know where they are being shipped off to, but it's safe to say that their twenty-one dollars a month won't go as far. They'll be in barracks and they'll have to learn to polish their own boots again. When the gangplanks are drawn in from the stone edge of the Bund, they are cut off from a whole world that they'll never see again, a world where they were kings. Now they are Marines again. It's okay with Shaftoe, who wants to be a Marine. But many of the men have become middle-aged here, and don't.

The guilty men duck belowdecks. Shaftoe remains on the deck of the gunboat, which casts off from the Bund, headed for the cruiser Augusta, which awaits in mid-channel.

The Bund is jammed with onlookers in a riot of differently colored clothing, so one patch of uniform drab catches his eye: a group of Nip soldiers who've come down to bid their Yank counterparts a sarcastic farewell. Shaftoe scans the group looking for someone tall and bulky, and picks him out easily. Goto Dengo's waving to him.

Shaftoe takes his helmet off and waves back. Then, on impulse, just for the hell of it, he winds up and flings the helmet directly at Goto Dengo's head. The throw goes awry and Goto Dengo has to knock down about a dozen of his comrades in order to catch it. All of them seem to think that it is a high honor, as well as tremendously amusing, to be knocked down by Goto Dengo.

Twenty seconds later, a comet sails up out of the flesh cosmos of the Bund and bounces on the wooden deck of the gunboat--a hell of a throw. Goto Dengo is showing off his follow-through. The projectile is a rock with a white streamer wrapped around it. Shaftoe runs over and snatches it. The streamer is one of those thousand-stitch headbands (supposedly; he's taken a few off of unconscious Nips, but he's never bothered to count the stitches) that they tie around their heads as a good-luck charm; it has a meatball in the center and some Nip writing to either side. He unties it from around the rock. In so doing he realizes, suddenly, that it's not a rock after all; it is a hand grenade! But good old Goto Dengo was just joking--he didn't pull the pin. A nice souvenir for Bobby Shaftoe.

Shaftoe's first haiku (December 1940) was a quick and dirty adaptation of the Marine Creed:

This is my rifle

There are many like it but

This rifle is mine.

He wrote it under the following circumstances: Shaftoe and the rest of Fourth Marines were stationed in Shanghai so that they could guard the International Settlement and work as muscle on the gunboats of the Yangtze River Patrol. His platoon had just come back from the Last Patrol: a thousand-mile reconnaissance-in-force all the way up past what was left of Nanjing, to Hankow, and back. Marines had been doing this ever since the Boxer Rebellion, through civil wars and everything else. But towards the end of 1940, what with the Nips basically running all of northeast China now, the politicians back in D.C. had finally thrown in the towel and told the China Marines not to steam up the Yangtze any more.

Now, the Old Breed Marines like Frick claimed they could tell the difference between organized brigands; armed mobs of starving peasants; rogue Nationalists; Communist guerrillas; and the irregular forces in the pay of warlords. But to Bobby Shaftoe they were all just crazy, armed slopes who wanted a piece of the Yangtze River Patrol. The Last Patrol had been a wild trip. But it was over and they were back in Shanghai now, the safest place you could be in China, and about a hundred times more dangerous than the most dangerous place you could be in America. They had climbed off the gunboat six hours ago, gone to a bar, and not come out until just now, when they had decided it was high time they went to a whorehouse. On their way, they happened to pass this Nip restaurant.

Bobby Shaftoe had looked in the windows of the place before, and watched the man with the knife, trying to figure out what the hell he was doing. It looked a hell of a lot like he was cutting up uncooked fish and putting the raw meat on bullets of rice and handing it over to the Nips on the other side of the counter, who were wolfing it down.

It had to be some kind of optical illusion. The fish must have been precooked in the back room.

This had been nagging at Shaftoe for about a year. As he and the other horny drunk Marines went by the place, he slowed down to peer through the window, trying to gather more evidence. He could swear that some of that fish looked ruby red, which it wouldn't have been if it were cooked.

One of his buddies, Rhodes from Shreveport, noticed him looking. He dared Shaftoe to go in there and sit down at that bar. Then another private, Gowicki from Pittsburgh, double-dared him!

Shaftoe sucked his teeth and considered the matter. He had already made up his mind that he was going to do it. He was a sniper scout, and it was in his nature to do crazy shit like this; but it was also part of his training to scan the terrain carefully before venturing in.

The restaurant was three-quarters full, and everyone in the place was a uniformed member of the Nipponese military. At the bar where the man was cutting up the apparently raw fish, there was a marked concentration of officers; if you only had one grenade, that's where you'd throw it. Most of the place was filled with long tables where enlisted men sat, drinking noodle soup from steaming urns. Shaftoe paid particular attention to these, because they were the ones who were going to be beating the shit out of him in about sixty seconds. Some were there alone, with reading material. A cluster of them, back in one corner, were paying attention to one fellow who was apparently telling a joke or story.

The longer Shaftoe spent reconnoitering the place, the more convinced Rhodes and Gowicki became that he was actually going to do it. They became excited and called for the other Marines, who had gone ahead of them down the block, headed for that whorehouse.

Shaftoe saw the others coming back--his tactical reserve. ``What the fuck,'' he said, and went into the restaurant. Behind him, he could hear the others shouting excitedly; they couldn't believe he was doing it. When Shaftoe stepped over the threshold of that Nip restaurant, he passed into the realm of legend.

All the Nips looked up at him when he came in the door. If they were surprised, they didn't show it. The chef behind the counter began to holler out some kind of ritual greeting, which faltered and trailed off as he got a look at what had just come in. The fellow in the back of the room--a husky, pink-cheeked Nip--continued telling his joke or story or whatever it was.

Shaftoe nodded to no one in particular, then stepped to the nearest empty chair at the bar and sat down.

Other Marines would have waited until the whole squad had assembled. Then they would have invaded the restaurant en masse, knocked over a few chairs, spilled some soup. But Shaftoe had seized the initiative before the others could do any such thing and gone in by himself, as a sniper scout was supposed to do. It was not just because he was a sniper scout, though. It was also because he was Bobby Shaftoe, and he was sincerely curious about this place, and if he could, he wanted to spend a few calm minutes in here and learn a few things about it before the fun started.

It helped, of course, that Shaftoe was a quiet and contemplative drunk, not a dangerous explosive drunk. He must have reeked of beer (those Krauts in Tsingtao cranked out a brew whose taste took him right back to Wisconsin, and he was homesick). But he wasn't hollering or knocking things over.

The chef was busy crafting one of his little morsels and pretended to ignore Shaftoe. The other men at the counter stared coldly at Shaftoe for a while, then turned their attentions back to their food. Shaftoe looked at the array of raw fish laid out on shaved ice behind the bar, then looked around the room. The guy back in the corner was talking in short bursts, reading from a notebook. He would speak maybe ten or twenty words, and then his little audience would turn to one another and grin, or grimace, or sometimes even make a patter of applause. He wasn't delivering his material like a dirty joke. He spoke precisely and expressively.

Fuck! He was reading poetry! Shaftoe had no idea what he was saying, but he could tell, by the sound of it, that it must be poetry. Didn't rhyme though. But the Nips did everything queerly.

He noticed that the chef was glaring at him. He cleared his throat, which was useless since he couldn't speak Nip. He looked at some of that ruby red fish behind the bar, pointed to it, held up two fingers.

Everyone was startled that the American had actually placed an order. The tension was broken, only a little. The chef went to work and produced two morsels, which he served up on a wooden pedestal.

Shaftoe had been trained to eat insects, and to bite the heads off chickens, so he figured he could handle this. He picked the morsels up in his fingers, just like the Nips were doing, and ate them. They were good. He ordered two more, of another variety. The guy in the corner kept reading poetry. Shaftoe ate his morsels and then ordered some more. For perhaps ten seconds, between the taste of the fish and the sound of the poetry, he actually felt comfortable here, and forgot that he was merely instigating a vicious racial brawl.

The third order looked different: laid over the top of the raw fish were thin translucent sheets of some kind of moist, glistening material. It looked sort of like butcher paper soaked in oil. Shaftoe gawked at it for a while, trying to identify it, but it looked like no foodstuff he knew of. He glanced left and right, hoping that one of the Nips had ordered the same stuff, so that he could watch and learn the right way to eat it. No luck.

Hell, they were officers. Maybe one of them spoke a little English. `` 'Scuse me. What's this?'' Shaftoe said, peeling up one corner of the eerie membrane.

The chef looked up at him nervously, then scanned the bar, polling the customers. Discussion ensued. Finally, a Nip officer at the end of the bar, a naval lieutenant, stood up and spoke to Bobby Shaftoe.

``Seaweed.''

Shaftoe did not particularly like the lieutenant's tone of voice--hostile and sullen. This, combined with the look on his face, seemed to say, You'll never understand it, you farmer, so why don't you just think of it as seaweed.

Shaftoe folded his hands primly in his lap, regarded the seaweed for a few moments, and then looked up at the lieutenant, who was still gazing at him expressionlessly. ``What kind of seaweed, sir?'' he said.

Significant glances began flying around the restaurant, like semaphores before a naval engagement. The poetry reading seemed to have stopped, and a migration of enlisted men had begun from the back of the room. Meanwhile the lieutenant translated Shaftoe's inquiry to the others, who discussed it in some detail, as if it were a major policy initiative from Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

The lieutenant and the chef exchanged words. Then the lieutenant looked at Shaftoe again. ``He say, you pay now.'' The chef held up one hand and rubbed his fingers and thumb together.

A year of working the Yangtze River Patrol had given Bobby Shaftoe nerves of titanium, and unlimited faith in his comrades, and so he resisted the impulse to turn his head and look out the window. He already knew exactly what he would see: Marines, shoulder to shoulder, ready to die for him. He scratched the new tattoo on his forearm: a dragon. His dirty fingernails, passing over the fresh scabs, made a rasping sound in the utterly silent restaurant.

``You didn't answer my question,'' Shaftoe said, pronouncing the words with a drunk's precision.

The lieutenant translated this into Nipponese. More discussion. But this time it was curt and decisive. Shaftoe could tell that they were about to bounce him. He squared his shoulders.

The Nips were good; they mounted an organized charge out the door, onto the sidewalk, and engaged the Marines, before anyone actually laid a hand on Shaftoe. This spoiling attack prevented the Marines from invading the restaurant proper, which would have disturbed the officers' meal and, with any luck, led to untold property damage. Shaftoe then felt himself being grabbed from behind by at least three people and hoisted into the air. He made eye contact with the lieutenant while this was happening, and shouted: ``Are you bullshitting me about the seaweed?''

As brawls went, the only remarkable part of this one was the way he was carried out to the street before he could actually get started. Then it was like all the other street fights he'd been in with Nip soldiers in Shanghai. These all came down to American brawn (you didn't get picked for the Fourth Regiment unless you were an impressive-looking six-footer) versus that Nipponese chop-socky.

Shaftoe wasn't a boxer. He was a wrestler. This was to his advantage. The other Marines would put up their dukes and try to fight it out--Marquis of Queensberry style--no match for chop-socky. Shaftoe had no illusions about his boxing, so he would just put his head down and charge like a bull, take a few blows to the face on his way in, but usually get a solid hold on his opponent and slam him into the cobblestones. Usually that shook the Nip up enough that Shaftoe could get him in a full-nelson or a hammerlock and get him to cry uncle.

The guys who were carrying him out of the restaurant got jumped by Marines as soon as they were in the open. Shaftoe found himself going up against an opponent who was at least as tall as he was, which was unusual. This one had a solid build, too. Not like a sumo wrestler. More like a football player--a lineman, with a bit of a gut. He was a strong S.O.B. and Shaftoe knew right away that he was in for a real scrape. The guy had a different style of wrestling from the American, which (as Shaftoe learned the hard way) included some illegal maneuvers: partial strangulation and powerful, short punches to major nerve centers. The gulf between Shaftoe's mind and body, already wedged open by alcohol, was yanked open to a chasm by these techniques. He ended up lying on the sidewalk, helpless and paralyzed, staring up into the chubby face of his opponent. This was (he realized) the same guy who'd been sitting in the corner of the restaurant reading poetry. He was a good wrestler for a poet. Or maybe vice versa.

``It is not seaweed,'' said the big Nip. He had a look on his face like a naughty schoolkid getting away with something. ``The English word is maybe calabash?'' Then he turned and walked back into the restaurant.

So much for legend. What none of the other Marines knows is that this was not the last encounter between Bobby Shaftoe and Goto Dengo. The incident left Shaftoe with any number of nagging questions about subjects as diverse as seaweed, poetry, and chop-socky. He sought out Goto Dengo after that, which was not that hard--he just paid some Chinese boys to follow the conspicuous Nip around town and file daily reports. From this he learned that Goto Dengo and some of his comrades gathered every morning in a certain park to practice their chop-socky. After making sure that his will was in order and writing a last letter to his parents and siblings in Oconomowoc, Shaftoe went to that park one morning, reintroduced himself to the surprised Goto Dengo, and made arrangements to serve as human punching bag. They found his self-defense skills hilariously primitive but admired his resilience, and so, for the small cost of a few broken ribs and digits, Bobby Shaftoe got a preliminary course in the particular type of chop-socky favored by Goto Dengo, which is called judo. Over time, this even led to a few social engagements in bars, and restaurants, where Shaftoe learned to recognize four types of seaweed, three types of fish eggs, and several flavors of Nip poetry. Of course he had no idea what the fuck they were saying, but he could count syllables, which, as far as he could tell, is about all there is to Nip poetry appreciation.

Not that this--or any other knowledge of their culture--is going to do him any good now that it will soon be his job to kill them.

In return, Shaftoe taught Goto Dengo how not to throw like a girl. A lot of the Nips are good at baseball and so it was hilarious, even to them, to see their burly friend pushing ineffectually at a baseball. But it was Shaftoe who taught Goto Dengo to stand sideways, to rotate his shoulders, and to follow through. He's paid a lot of attention to the big Nip's throwing form during the last year, and maybe that's why the image of Goto Dengo planting his feet on the ashlars of the Bund, winding up, throwing the streamer-wrapped grenade, and following through almost daintily on one combat-booted foot stays in Shaftoe's mind all the way to Manila and beyond.



A couple of days into the voyage it becomes apparent that Sergeant Frick has forgotten how to shine his boots. Every night he puts them on the deck beside his bunk, like he's expecting a coolie to come around and shine them up during the night. Every morning he wakes up and finds them in a sorrier state than before. After a few days he starts to draw reprimands from On High, starts to get a lot of potato-peeling duty.

Now in and of itself this is forgivable. Frick started out his career chasing bandolier-draped desperadoes away from mail trains on the High Chaparral, for God's sake. In '27 he got shipped off to Shanghai on very short notice, and no doubt had to display some adaptability. Fine. And now he's on this miserable pre-Great War cruiser and it's a little hard on him. Fine. But he does not take all of this with the dignity that is demanded of Marines by Marines. He whines about it. He lets himself get humiliated. He gets angry. A lot of the other old China Marines see things his way.

One day Bobby Shaftoe is up on the deck of the destroyer tossing the old horsehide around with a couple of the other young Marines when he sees a few of these older guys accumulating into a sort of human booger on the afterdeck. He can tell by the looks on their faces and by their gestures that they are bellyaching.

Shaftoe hears a couple of the ship's crew talking to each other nearby. ``What the hell is wrong with those Marines?'' one of them says. The other one shakes his head sadly, like a doctor who has just seen a patient's eyeballs roll up into their sockets. ``Those poor bastards have gone Asiatic,'' he says.

And then they turn and look at Shaftoe.

That evening, at mess, Bobby Shaftoe gulps his food down double-time, then stands up and approaches the table where those Old Breed Marines are sullenly gathered. ``Begging your pardon, Sergeant!'' he hollers. ``Request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''

Frick's mouth drops open, revealing a half-chewed plug of boiled beef. ``Whud you say, Corporal?''

The mess has gone silent. ``Respectfully request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''

Frick is not the quickest guy in the world even when he's sober, and it's pretty obvious, just from looking at his pupils, that he and his comrades have brought some opium aboard. ``Wull, uh, I guess so,'' he says. He looks around at his crew of gripers, who are a little confused and a little amused. He unlaces his boots. Bobby Shaftoe takes those disgraceful things away and returns a bit later with them resplendently shined. By this time, Frick has gotten high and mighty. ``Wull, those boots look real good, Corporal Shaftoe,'' he says in a brassy voice. ``Darned if you ain't as good a shoe-shiner as my coolie boy was.''

At lights out, Frick and crew are short-sheeted. Various other, ruder practical jokes ensue during the nighttime. One of them gets jumped in his bunk and beaten by unspecified attackers. The brass call a surprise inspection the next morning and cuss them out. The ``gone Asiatic'' crew spend most of the next day gathered in a cluster, watching each other's backs.

Around midday, Frick finally gets it through his head that all of this was triggered by Shaftoe's gesture, and that Shaftoe knew, all along, what was going to happen. So he rushes Bobby Shaftoe up on the deck and tries to throw him over the rail.

Shaftoe's warned at the last minute by one of his compadres, and spins around just enough to throw off Frick's attack. Frick caroms off the rail, turns around, and tries to grab Shaftoe's nuts. Shaftoe pokes him in the eye, which straightens him right up. They back away from each other. The opening formalities having been finished; they put up their dukes.

Frick and Shaftoe box for a couple of rounds. A large crowd of Marines gathers. On most of their cards, Frick is winning the fight. Frick was always dim-witted, and is now crazy to boot, but he knows his way around a boxing ring, and he has forty pounds on Shaftoe.

Shaftoe puts up with it until Frick socks him pretty hard in the mouth and gives him a bloody lip.

``How far are we from Manila?'' Shaftoe hollers. This question, as usual, leaves Sergeant Frick confused and bewildered, and straightens him up for a moment.

``Two days,'' answers one of the ship's officers.

``Well, goddamn,'' Bobby Shaftoe says. ``How'm I gonna kiss my girl with this fat lip?''

Frick answers, ``Just go out and find a cheaper one.''

That's all he needs. Shaftoe puts his head down and charges in on Frick, hollering like a Nip. Before Frick can get his brain in gear, Bobby Shaftoe has him wrapped up in one of those chop-socky holds that Goto Dengo taught him in Shanghai. He works his way up Frick's body to a choke-hold and then clamps down until Sergeant Frick's lips turn the color of the inside of an oyster shell. Then he hangs Frick over the rail, holding him upside-down by the ankles, until Frick recovers enough to shout, ``Uncle!''

A disciplinary proceeding is hastily called. Shaftoe is found guilty of being courteous (by shining Frick's boots) and defending the life of a Marine (himself) from a crazed attacker. The crazed attacker goes straight to the brig. Within a few hours, the noises Frick makes lets all of the Marines know what opium withdrawal feels like.

So Sergeant Frick does not get to see their entrance into Manila Bay. Shaftoe almost feels sorry for the poor bastard.

The island of Luzon lies to port all day long, a black hulk barely visible through the haze, with glimpses of palm trees and beaches down below. All of the Marines have been this way before and so they can pick out the Cordillera Central up north, and later the Zambales Mountains, which eventually plunge down to meet the sea near Subic Bay. Subic triggers a barrage of salty anecdotes. The ship does not put in there, but continues to swing southward around Bata'an, turning inland toward the entrance of Manila Bay. The ship reeks of shoe polish, talcum powder, and after-shave lotion; the Fourth Marines may have specialized in whoring and opium abuse, but they've always been known as the best-looking Marines in the Corps.

They pass by Corregidor. An island shaped like a bead of water on a waxed boot, it is gently rounded in the middle but steeply sloping into the water. It has a long, bony, dry tail that trails off at one end. The Marines know that the island is riddled with tunnels and bristling with terrible guns, but the only sign of these fortifications is the clusters of concrete barracks up in the hills, housing the men who serve the weapons. A tangle of antennas rises up above Topside. Their shapes are familiar to Shaftoe, because many of the same antennas rose above Station Alpha in Shanghai, and he had to take them apart and load them into the truck.

There is a giant limestone cliff descending nearly into the sea, and at the base of it is the entrance to the tunnel where all the spooks and radio men have their hideaway. Nearby is a dock, quite busy at the moment, with supplies being offloaded from civilian transports and stacked right there on the beach. This detail is noticed by all of the Marines as a positive sign of approaching war. Augusta drops anchor in the cove, and all of that tarp-wrapped radio stuff is unloaded into launches and taken to that dock, along with all of the odd pencil-necked Navy men who tended that gear in Shanghai.

The swell dies as they pass Corregidor and enter the bay. Greenish-brown algae floats in swirls and curlicues near the surface. Navy ships lay brown ropes of smoke across the still sea. Undisturbed by wind, these unfold into rugged shapes like translucent mountain ranges. They pass the big military base at Cavite--a sheet of land so low and flat that its boundary with the water would be invisible except for the picket line of palm trees. A few hangars and water towers rise from it, and low dark clusters of barracks farther inland. Manila is dead ahead of them, still veiled in haze. It is getting on toward evening.

Then the haze dissolves, the atmosphere suddenly becomes as limpid as a child's eyes, and for about an hour they can see to infinity. They are steaming into an arena of immense thunderheads with lightning corkscrewing down through them all around. Flat grey clouds like shards of broken slate peek out between anvils. Behind them are higher clouds vaulting halfway to the moon, glowing pink and salmon in the light of the setting sun. Behind that, more clouds nestled within banks of humidity like Christmas ornaments wrapped in tissue paper, expanses of blue sky, more thunderheads exchanging bolts of lightning twenty miles long. Skies nested within skies nested within skies.

It was cold up there in Shanghai, and it's gotten warmer every day since. Some days it's even been hot and muggy. But around the time Manila heaves into view, a warm breeze springs up over the deck and all of the Marines sigh, as if they have all ejaculated in unison.

Manila's perfume

Fanned by the coconut palms

The thighs of Glory

Manila's spreading tile roofs have a mestizo shape about them, half-Spanish and half-Chinese. The city has a concave seawall with a flat promenade on the top. Strollers turn and wave to the Marines; some of them blow kisses. A wedding party is gushing down the steps of a church and across the boulevard to the seawall, where they are getting their pictures taken in the flattering peach-colored light of the sunset. The men are in their fancy, gauzy Filipino shirts, or in U.S. military uniforms. The women are in spectacular gowns and dresses. The Marines holler and whistle at them and the women turn towards them, hitching up their skirts slightly so that they won't trip, and wave enthusiastically. The Marines get woozy and practically fall overboard.

As their ship is easing into its dock, a crescent-shaped formation of flying fish erupts from the water. It moves away like a dune being blown across the desert. The fish are silver and leaf-shaped. Each one strikes the water with a metallic click, and the clicks merge into a crisp ripping noise. The crescent glides beneath a pier, flowing around its pilings, and disappears in the shadows underneath.

Manila, the Pearl of the Orient, early on a Sunday evening, the 7th of December, 1941. In Hawaii, on the other side of the Date Line, it is only just past midnight. Bobby Shaftoe and his comrades have a few hours of freedom. The city is modern, prosperous, English-speaking, and Christian, by far the wealthiest and most advanced city in Asia, practically like being back home in the States. For all its Catholicity, it has areas that seem to have been designed, from the foundation-stones upwards, to the specifications of horny sailors. You get to those parts of town by turning right once your feet are on dry land.

Bobby Shaftoe turns left, politely excuses himself past a legion of excited prostitutes, and sets his course on the looming walls of Intramuros. He stops only to buy a sheaf of roses from a vendor in the park, who is doing land-office business. The park and the walls above it are crowded with strolling lovers, the men mostly in uniforms and the women in demure but stunning dresses, twirling parasols on their shoulders.

A couple of fellows driving horse-drawn taxis want to do business with Bobby Shaftoe but he turns them down. A taxi will only get him there faster, and he is too nervous to get there fast. He walks through a gate in the wall and into the old Spanish city.

Intramuros is a maze of buff-colored stone walls rising abruptly from narrow streets. The first-floor windows along the sidewalks are guarded by black ironwork cages. The bars swell, swirl, and sprout finedly hammered leaves. The second stories hang out overhead, sporting gas lights that are just now being lit by servants with long, smoking poles. The sound of laughter and music drifts out of the windows above, and when he passes by the archways that open into the inner courtyards, he can smell flowers back in the gardens.

Damned if he can tell these places apart. He remembers the street name of Magallanes, because Glory told him once it was the same thing as ``Magellan.'' And he remembers the view of the cathedral from the Pascuals' window. He wanders around a block a couple of times, certain that he is close. Then he hears an exaltation of girlish laughter coming from a second-story window, and moves toward it like a jellyfish sucked into an intake pipe. It all comes together. This is the place. The girls are all gossiping, in English, about one of their instructors. He does not hear Glory's voice but he thinks he hears her laughter.

``Glory!'' he says. Then he says it louder. If they hear him, they pay him no mind. Finally he winds up and flings the bouquet of roses like a potato-masher grenade over the wooden railing, through a narrow gap between the mother-of-pearl shutters, and into the room.

Miraculous silence from within the room, and then gales of laughter. The nacre shutters part with slow, agonizing coyness. A girl of nineteen steps out onto the balcony. She is dressed in the uniform of a nursing student. It is as white as starlight shining on the North Pole. She has let her long black hair down to brush it, and it stirs languidly in the evening breeze. The last ruddy light of the sunset makes her face glow like a coal. She hides behind the bouquet for a moment, buries her nose in it, inhales deeply, peeking out at him over the blossoms with her black eyes. Then she lowers the bouquet gradually to reveal her high cheeks, her perfect little nose, the fantastic sculpture of her lips, and teeth, white but fetchingly crooked, barely visible. She is smiling.

``Jesus H. Christ,'' Bobby Shaftoe says, ``your cheekbones are like a fucking snowplow.''

She puts her finger to her lips. The gesture of anything touching Glory's lips puts an invisible spear through Shaftoe's chest. She eyes him for a while, establishing, in her own mind, that she has the boy's attention and that he is not going anywhere. Then she turns her back on him. The light grazes her buttocks, showing nothing but suggesting cleavage. She goes back inside and the shutter glides shut behind her.

Suddenly the room full of girls becomes quiet, except for occasional ripples of suppressed laughter. Shaftoe bites his tongue. They are screwing it all up. Mr. or Mrs. Pascual will notice their silence and become suspicious.

Ironwork clangs and a big gate swings open. The porter beckons him inside. Shaftoe follows the old fellow down the black, arched tunnel of the porte-cochere. The hard soles of his shiny black shoes skid on the cobblestones. A horse back in the stable whinnies at the smell of his aftershave. Sleepy American music, slow-dance stuff from the Armed Forces station, spills tinnily from a radio in the porter's nook.

Flowering vines grow up the stone walls of the courtyard. It is a tidy, quiet, enclosed world, almost like being indoors. The porter waves him in the direction of one of the stairways that lead up to the second floor. Glory calls it the entresuelo and says that it's really a floor between the floors, but it looks like a full-fledged, regular floor to Bobby Shaftoe. He mounts the steps and looks up to see Mr. Pascual standing there, a tiny bald man with glasses and a trim little mustache. He is wearing a short-sleeved shirt, American style, and khaki trousers, and slippers, and is holding a glass of San Miguel in one hand and a cigarette in the other. ``Private Shaftoe! Welcome back,'' he says.

So. Glory has decided to play this one by the book. The Pascuals have been alerted. A few hours of socializing now stand between Bobby Shaftoe and his girl. But a Marine is never fazed by such setbacks.

``Begging your pardon, Mr. Pascual, but I am a corporal now.''

Mr. Pascual puts his cigarette in his mouth and shakes Corporal Shaftoe's hand. ``Well, congratulations! I just saw your uncle Jack last week. I don't think he had any idea you were on your way back.''

``It was a surprise to everyone, sir,'' Bobby Shaftoe says.

Now they are on a raised walkway that runs around the courtyard. Only livestock and servants live at ground level. Mr. Pascual leads them around to a door that takes them into the entresuelo. The walls here are rough stone, the ceilings are simple painted planks. They pass through a dark, somber office where Mr. Pascual's father and grandfather used to receive the managers of the family's haciendas and plantations. For a moment, Bobby Shaftoe gets his hopes up. This level has a few rooms that back in the old days were apartments for high-ranking servants, bachelor uncles, and spinster aunts. Now that the hacienda business ain't what it used to be, the Pascuals are renting them out to female students. Perhaps Mr. Pascual is leading him directly to Glory.

But this goes the way of all foolish, horny illusions as Shaftoe finds himself at the foot of a vast staircase of polished nara wood. He can see pressed-tin ceiling up there, chandeliers, and the imposing superstructure of Mrs. Pascual, contained within a mighty bodice that looks like something dreamed up by naval engineers. They ascend the stairs into the antesala, which according to Glory is strictly for casual, drop-in visitors but is fancier than any room Bobby Shaftoe has ever seen. There are big vases and pots all over the place, supposedly old, and supposedly from Japan and China. A fresh breeze runs through; he looks out a window and sees, neatly framed in it, the green dome of the cathedral with its Celtic cross on top, just as he remembered it. Mrs. Pascual holds out her hand and Shaftoe clasps it. ``Mrs. Pascual,'' he says, ``thank you for welcoming me into your home.''

``Please sit down,'' she says, ``we want to hear everything.''

Shaftoe sits in a fancy chair next to the piano, adjust his trousers a bit so that they will not cramp his erect penis, checks his shave. It probably has a few good hours left. A wing of airplanes drones overhead. Mrs. Pascual is giving instructions to the maid in Tagalog. Shaftoe examines the crusted lacerations on his knuckles and wonders whether Mrs. Pascual has the slightest idea of what she would be in for if he really told her everything. Perhaps a little anecdote about hand-to-hand combat with Chinese river pirates on the banks of the Yangtze would break the ice. Through a door and down the hall, he can see a corner of the family chapel, all Gothic arches, a gilded altar, and in front of it an embroidered kneeler worn threadbare by the patellas of Mrs. Pascual.

Cigarettes are brought round, stacked in a large lacquer box like artillery shells in a crate. They drink tea and exchange small talk for what seems like about thirty-six hours. Mrs. Pascual wants to be reassured, over and over again, that everything is fine and that there will not be a war. Mr. Pascual obviously believes that war is just around the corner, and mostly broods. Business has been good lately. He and Jack Shaftoe, Bobby's uncle, have been shipping a lot of stuff between here and Singapore. But business will get a lot worse soon, he thinks.

Glory appears. She has changed out of her student's uniform and into a dress. Bobby Shaftoe nearly topples backward out of the window. Mrs. Pascual formally reintroduces them. Bobby Shaftoe kisses Glory's hand in what he thinks is more than likely a very gallant gesture. He's glad he did, because Glory is palming a tiny wadded-up note which ends up in his hand.

Glory takes a seat and is duly issued her own teacup. Another eternity of small talk. Mr. Pascual asks him for the eighty-seventh time whether he has touched base with Uncle Jack yet, and Shaftoe reiterates that he literally just stepped off the boat and will certainly see Uncle Jack tomorrow morning. He excuses himself to the bathroom, which is an old-fashioned two-holer mounted above deep shafts that must descend all the way to hell. He unwads and reads Glory's note, memorizes the instructions, tears it up and sprinkles it down the hole.

Mrs. Pascual allows the two young lovers a full half hour of ``private'' time together, meaning that the Pascuals leave the room and only come back every five minutes or so to check up on them. There is a painfully elaborate and lengthy good-bye ceremony which ends in Shaftoe returning to the street and Glory waving to him from her balcony.

Half an hour later, they are doing tongue judo in the back of a horse-drawn taxi galloping over the cobblestones toward the nightclubs of Malate. The extraction of Glory from the Pascual residence was a simple matter for a highly motivated China Marine and a squadron of saucy nursing students.

But Glory must be kissing him with her eyes open because all of a sudden she wriggles loose and says to the taxi driver, ``Stop! Please stop, sir!''

``What is it?'' Shaftoe says blurrily. He looks around and sees nothing but a great big old stone church looming up above them. This brings a preliminary stab of fear. But the church is dark, there's no Filipinas in long dresses, no Marines in dress uniforms, it can't be his wedding.

``I want to show you something,'' Glory says, and clambers down out of the taxi. Shaftoe has to pursue her into the place--the Church of San Augustin. He's gone by this pile many times but he never reckoned he would come inside--on a date.

She stands at the bottom of a huge staircase and says, ``See?''

Shaftoe looks up into darkness, thinks there might be a stained-glass window or two up there, maybe a Laceration of Christ or an Impalement of the Blessed Thorax, but--

``Look down,'' Glory says, and taps one miniature foot against the first tread of the staircase. It is a single great big huge slab of granite.

``Looks like ten or twenty tons of rock there I'd estimate,'' he says authoritatively.

``It came from Mexico.''

``Ah, go on!''

Glory smiles at him. ``Carry me up the stairs.'' And in case Shaftoe's thinking of refusing, she sort of falls into him, and he has no choice but to catch her up in his arms. She traps his nape in the crook of her arm, the better to pull her face close to his, but what he remembers is how the silk of her sleeve feels against the freshly shaved skin of his neck. He begins the ascent. Glory doesn't weigh much, but after four steps he has broken a fine sweat. She is watching him, from four inches away, for signs of fatigue, and he feels himself blushing. Good thing that the whole staircase is lit up by about two candles. There's a lovely bust of a thorn-crowned Jesus with long parallel blood-drops running down his face, and on the right--

``These giant stones you are walking on were quarried in Mexico, centuries and centuries ago, before America was even a country. They were brought over in the bottoms of the Manila Galleons, as ballast.'' She pronounces it bayast.

``I'll be damned.''

``When those galleons arrived, the stones were brought out of their bellies, one by one, and taken here to the Church of San Agustin, and piled up. Each stone on top of the last year's stone. Until finally after many, many years this staircase was finished.''

After a while it seems to Shaftoe as though it's going to take at least that many years to reach the top of the damn thing. The summit is adorned with a life-sized Jesus carrying a cross that appears to be at least as heavy as one of those stair-treads. So who's he to complain? Then Glory says, ``Now carry me down, so you will remember the story.''

``You think I'm some horny jarhead who won't remember a story unless it's got a pretty girl in it?''

``Yes,'' Glory says, and laughs in his face. He carries her down to the bottom again. Then, before she goes off on some other tangent, he carries her straight out the door and into the taxi.

Bobby Shaftoe is not one to lose his cool in the heat of action, but the rest of the evening is a blurry fever dream to him. Only a few impressions penetrate the haze: alighting from the taxi in front of a waterfront hotel; all of the other boys gaping at Glory; Bobby Shaftoe glaring at them, threatening to teach them some manners. Slow dancing with Glory in the ballroom, Glory's silk-clad thigh gradually slipping between his legs, her firm body pressing harder and harder against his. Strolling along the seawall, hand in hand beneath the starlight. Noticing that the tide is out. Exchanging a look. Carrying her down from the seawall to the thin strip of rocky beach beneath it.

By the time he is actually fucking her, he has more or less lost consciousness, he is off in some fantastic, libidinal dream. He and Glory fuck without the slightest hesitation, without any doubts, without any troublesome thinking whatsoever. Their bodies have spontaneously merged, like a pair of drops running together on a windowpane. If he is thinking anything at all, it is that his entire life has culminated in this moment. His upbringing in Oconomowoc, high school prom night, deer hunting in the Upper Peninsula, Parris Island boot camp, all of the brawls and struggles in China, his duel with Sergeant Frick, they are wood behind the point of a spear.

Sirens are blowing somewhere. He startles back to awareness. Has he been here all night long, holding Glory up against the seawall, her thighs wrapped around his waist? That would not be possible. The tide hasn't come in at all.

``What is it?'' she says. Her hands are clasped around the back of his neck. She lets go and runs them down his chest.

Still holding her up, his hands making a sling under her warm and flawless ass, Shaftoe backs away from the seawall and turns around on the beach, looking at the sky. He sees searchlights beginning to come on. And it ain't no Hollywood premiere.

``It's war, baby,'' he says.



FORAYS

The lobby of the manila hotel is about the size of a football field. It smells like last year's perfume, rare tropical orchids, and bug spray. There is a metal detector set up at the front door, because the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe happens to be staying here for a couple of days. Big Africans in good suits stand around the place in clusters of two and three. Mini-throngs of Nipponese tourists, in their Bermuda shorts, sandals and white socks, have lodged themselves in the deep, thick, wide sofas and sit quietly, waiting for a prearranged signal. Upper-class Filipino children brandish cylindrical potato chip canisters like tribal chieftains carrying ceremonial maces. A dignified old bellman carrying a hand-pumped tank circulates around the defensive perimeter and silently sprays insecticide against the baseboard. Enter Randall Lawrence Waterhouse, in a turquoise polo shirt embroidered with the logo of one of the bankrupt high-tech companies that he and Avi have founded, and relaxed-fit blue jeans held up with suspenders, and bulky athletic shoes that once were white.

As soon as he got through the formalities at the airport, he perceived that the Philippines are, like Mexico, one of those countries where Shoes Matter. He approaches the registration counter quickly so that the ravishing young woman in the navy-blue uniform will not see his feet. A couple of bellhops are engaged in a pathetic, Sisyphean contest with his bag, which has roughly the dimensions and mass of a two-drawer filing cabinet. ``You will not be able to find technical books there,'' Avi told him, ``bring anything you might conceivably need.''

Randy's suite is a bedroom and living room, both with fourteen-foot ceilings, and a corridor along one side containing several closets and various plumbing-related technologies. The entire thing is lined in some kind of tropical hardwood stained to a lovely glowing auburn, which would be dismal in the northern latitudes but, here, gives it a cozy and cool feeling. The two main rooms each have huge windows with tiny signs by the latch handles warning of tropical insects. Each room is defended from its windows by a multilayered system of interlocking barriers: incredibly massive wooden shutters that rumble back and forth on tracks, like freight trains maneuvering in a switching yard; a second layer of shutters consisting of two-inch squares of nacre held in a polished wooden grid, sliding on its own set of tracks; window sheers, and finally, heavy-gauge blackout curtains, each suspended from its own set of clanging industrial rails.

He orders up a large pot of coffee, which barely keeps him awake long enough to unpack. It is late afternoon. Purple clouds tumble out of the surrounding mountains with the palpable momentum of volcanic mudflows and turn half of the sky into a blank wall striped with vertical bolts of lightning; the walls of the hotel room flash with it as though paparazzi are working outside the window. Below, food vendors in Rizal Park run up and down the sidewalks to get out of the rain, which falls, as it has been doing for about half a millennium, on the sloping black walls of Intramuros. If those walls did not run in straight lines they could be mistaken for a natural freak of geology: ridges of bare, dark volcanic rock erupting from the grass like teeth from gums. The walls have dovetail-shaped notches that converge to old gun emplacements, providing interlocking fields of fire across a dry moat.

Living in the States, you never see anything older than about two and a half centuries, and you have to visit the eastern fringe of the country to see that. The business traveler's world of airports and taxicabs looks the same everywhere. Randy never really believes he's in a different country until he sees something like Intramuros, and then he has to stand there like an idiot for a long time, ruminating.

Right now, across the Pacific Ocean, in a small, tasteful Victorian town located a third of the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles, computers are seizing up, crucial files are disappearing, and e-mail is careening into intergalactic space, because Randy Waterhouse is not there to keep an eye on things. The town in question sports three small colleges: one founded by the State of California and two founded by Protestant denominations that are now actively reviled by the majority of their faculty. Taken together these colleges--the Three Siblings--comprise an academic center of middling importance. Their computer systems are linked into one. They exchange teachers and students. From time to time they host academic conferences. This part of California has beaches, mountains, redwood forests, vineyards, golf courses, and sprawling penal facilities all over the place. There are plenty of three- and four-star hotel rooms, and the Three Siblings, taken together, have enough auditoria and meeting rooms to host a conference of several thousand.

Avi's telephone call, some eighty hours ago, arrived in the middle of a major interdisciplinary conference called ``The Intermediate Phase (1939›45) of the Global Hegemony Struggle of the Twentieth Century (Common Era).'' This is a bit of a mouthful and so it has been given a pithy nickname: ``War as Text.''

People are coming from places like Amsterdam and Milan. The conference's organizing committee--which includes Randy's girlfriend, Charlene, who actually gives every indication of being his ex-girlfriend now--hired an artist in San Francisco to come up with a poster. He started with a black-and-white halftone photo of a haggard World War Two infantryman with a cigarette dangling from his lower lip. He worked this image over using a photocopier, blowing the halftone dots up into rough lumps, like rubber balls chewed by a dog, and wreaking any number of other distortions on it until it had an amazingly stark, striking, jagged appearance; the soldier's pale eyes turned an eerie white. Then he added a few elements in color: red lipstick, blue eyeshadow, and a trace of a red brassiere strap peeking out from the soldier's unbuttoned uniform shirt.

The poster won some kind of an award almost the moment it came out. This led to a press release, which in turn led to the poster's being enshrined by the news media as an Official Object of Controversy. An enterprising journalist managed to track down the soldier depicted in the original photograph--a decorated combat veteran and retired tool-and-die maker who, as it happened, was not merely alive but in excellent health, and, since the death of his wife from breast cancer, had spent his retirement roaming around the Deep South in his pickup truck, helping to rebuild black churches that had been torched by drunken yahoos.

The artist who had designed the poster then confessed that he had simply copied it from a book and had made no effort whatsoever to obtain permission--the entire concept of getting permission to use other people's work was faulty, since all art was derivative of other art. High-powered trial lawyers converged, like dive bombers, on the small town in Kentucky where the aggrieved veteran was up on the roof of a black church with a mouthful of nails, hammering down slabs of A/D exterior plywood and mumbling ``no comment'' to a horde of reporters down on the lawn. After a series of conferences in a room at the town's Holiday Inn, the veteran emerged, accompanied by one of the five most famous lawyers on the face of the planet, and announced that he was filing a civil suit against the Three Siblings that would, if it succeeded, turn them and their entire community into a flat, smoking abrasion in the earth's crust. He promised to split the proceeds between the black churches and various disabled veterans' and breast cancer research groups.

The organizing committee pulled the poster from circulation, which caused thousands of bootleg copies to go up on the World Wide Web and, in general, brought it to the attention of millions who never would have seen it otherwise. They also filed suit against the artist, whose net worth could be tallied up on the back of a ticket stub: he had assets of about a thousand dollars and debts (mostly student loans) amounting to sixty-five thousand.

All of this happened before the conference even began. Randy was aware of it only because Charlene had roped him into providing computer support for the conference, which meant setting up a Web site and e-mail access for the attendees. When all of this hit the news, e-mail began to flood in, and quickly jammed up all of the lines and filled up all of the disk capacity that Randy had spent the last month setting up.

Conferees began to arrive. A lot of them seemed to be sleeping in the house where Randy and Charlene had been living together for seven years. It was a big old Victorian house and there was plenty of room. They stumbled in from Heidelberg and Paris and Berkeley and Boston, then sat around Randy and Charlene's kitchen table drinking coffee and talking at great length about the Spectacle. Randy inferred that the Spectacle meant the poster furor, but as they went on and on about it, he sensed that they were using the word not in a conventional sense but as part of some academic jargon; that it carried a heavy load of shadings and connotations to them, none of which Randy would ever understand unless he became one of them.

To Charlene, and to all of the people attending War as Text, it was self-evident that the veteran who filed the lawsuit was the very worst kind of human being--just the sort they had gathered together to debunk, burn in effigy, and sweep into the ash-bin of posthistorical discourse. Randy had spent a lot of time around these people, and thought he'd gotten used to them, but during those days he had a headache all the time, from clenching his teeth, and he kept jumping to his feet in the middle of meals or conversations and going out for solitary walks. This was partly to keep himself from saying something undiplomatic, and partly as a childish but fruitless tactic to get the attention he craved from Charlene.

He knew the whole poster saga was going to be a disaster from early on. He kept warning Charlene and the others. They listened coolly, clinically, as if Randy were a test subject on the wrong side of a one-way mirror.



Randy forces himself to stay awake long enough for it to get dark. Then he lies in bed for a few hours trying to sleep. The container port is just north of the hotel, and all night long, Rizal Boulevard, along the base of the old Spanish wall, is jammed from one end to the other with container-carrying semis. The whole city is a cauldron of internal combustion. Manila seems to have more pistons and exhaust pipes than the rest of the world combined. Even at two in the morning the hotel's seemingly unshakable mass hums and rattles from the seismic energy pouring from all of those motors. The noise detonates car alarms down in the hotel's lot. The noise of one alarm triggers others, and so on. It is not the noise that keeps Randy awake so much as the insane stupidity of this chain reaction. It is an object lesson: the kind of nightmarish, snowballing technological fuck-up that keeps hackers awake at night even when they can't hear the results.

He paws open a Heineken from his minibar and stands in front of the window, looking. Many of the trucks are adorned with brilliant displays of multicolored lights--not quite as flashy as those of the few jeepneys that scurry and jostle among them. Seeing so many people awake and working puts sleep out of the question.

He is too jet-lagged to accomplish anything that requires actual thought--but there is one important job he can do, which requires no thinking whatsoever. He starts up his laptop again. Seeming to levitate in the center of his dark room, the screen is a perfect rectangle of light the color of diluted milk, of a Nordic dawn. This light originates in small fluorescent tubes imprisoned in the polycarbonate coffin of his computer's display. It can only escape through a pane of glass, facing Randy, which is entirely covered by small transistors arranged in a grid, which let photons through, or don't, or let through only those of a particular wavelength, cracking the pale light into colors. By turning those transistors on and off according to some systematic plan, meaning is conveyed to Randy Waterhouse. A good filmmaker could convey a whole story to Randy by seizing control of those transistors for a couple of hours.

Unfortunately, there are a lot more laptop computers floating around than there are filmmakers worth paying attention to. The transistors are almost never put into the hands of human beings. They are controlled, instead, by software. Randy used to be fascinated by software, but now he isn't. It's hard enough to find human beings who are interesting.

The pyramid and the eyeball appear. Randy spends so much time using Ordo now that he has his machine boot it up automatically.

Nowadays the laptop has only one function for Randy: he uses it to communicate with other people, through e-mail. When he communicates with Avi, he has to use Ordo, which is a tool for taking his ideas and converting them into streams of bits that are almost indistinguishable from white noise, so that they can be sent to Avi in privacy. In exchange, it receives noise from Avi and converts it into Avi's thoughts. At the moment, Epiphyte has no assets other than information--it is an idea, with some facts and data to back it up. This makes it eminently stealable. So encryption is definitely a good idea. The question is: how much paranoia is really appropriate?

Avi sent him encrypted e-mail:

When you get to Manila I would like you to generate a 4096-bit key pair and keep it on a floppy disk that you carry on your person at all times. Do not keep it on your hard disk. Anyone could break into your hotel room while you're out and steal that key.

Now, Randy pulls down a menu and picks an item labeled: ``New key. . . . ''

A box pops up giving him several KEY LENGTH options: 768 bits, 1024, 1536, 2048, 3072, or Custom. Randy picks the latter option and then, wearily, types in 4096.

Even a 768-bit key requires vast resources to break. Add one bit, to make it 769 bits long, and it becomes twice as difficult. A 770-bit key is twice as difficult yet, and so on. By using 768-bit keys, Randy and Avi could keep their communications secret from nearly every entity in the world for at least the next several years. A 1024-bit key would be vastly, astronomically more difficult to break.

Some people go so far as to use keys 2048 or even 3072 bits in length. These will stop the very best codebreakers on the face of the earth for astronomical periods of time, barring the invention of otherworldly technologies such as quantum computers. Most encryption software--even stuff written by extremely security-conscious cryptography experts--can't even handle keys larger than that. But Avi insists on using Ordo, generally considered the best encryption software in the world, because it can handle keys of unlimited length--as long as you don't mind waiting for it to crunch all the numbers.

Randy begins typing. He is not bothering to look at the screen; he is staring out the window at the lights on the trucks and the jeepneys. He is only using one hand, just flailing away loosely at the keyboard.

Inside Randy's computer is a precise clock. Whenever he strikes a key, Ordo uses that clock to record the current time, down to microseconds. He hits a key at 03:05:56.935788 and he hits another one at 03:05:57.290664, or about .354876 seconds later. Another .372307 seconds later, he hits another one. Ordo keeps track of all of these intervals and discards the more significant digits (in this example the .35 and the .37) because these parts will tend to be similar from one event to the next.

Ordo wants randomness. It only wants the least significant digits--say, the 76 and the 07 at the very ends of these numbers. It wants a whole lot of random numbers, and it wants them to be very, very random. It is taking somewhat random numbers and feeding them through hash functions that make them even more random. It is running statistical routines on the results to make sure that they contain no hidden patterns. It has breathtakingly high standards for randomness, and it will not stop asking Randy to whack on the keyboard until those standards are met.

The longer the key you are trying to generate, the longer this takes. Randy is trying to generate one that is ridiculously long. He has pointed out to Avi, in an encrypted e-mail message, that if every particle of matter in the universe could be used to construct one single cosmic supercomputer, and this computer was put to work trying to break a 4096-bit encryption key, it would take longer than the lifespan of the universe.

``Using today's technology,'' Avi shot back, ``that is true. But what about quantum computers? And what if new mathematical techniques are developed that can simplify the factoring of large prime numbers?''

``How long do you want these messages to remain secret?'' Randy asked, in his last message before leaving San Francisco. ``Five years? Ten years? Twenty-five years?''

After he got to the hotel this afternoon, Randy decrypted and read Avi's answer. It is still hanging in front of his eyes, like the afterimage of a strobe:

I want them to remain secret for as long as men are capable of evil.

The computer finally beeps. Randy rests his tired hand. Ordo politely warns him that it may be busy for a while, and then goes to work. It is searching the cosmos of pure numbers, looking for two big primes that can be multiplied by each other to produce a number 4096 bits long.

If you want your secrets to remain secret past the end of your life expectancy, then, in order to choose a key length, you have to be a futurist. You have to anticipate how much faster computers will get during this time. You must also be a student of politics. Because if the entire world were to become a police state obsessed with recovering old secrets, then vast resources might be thrown at the problem of factoring large prime numbers.

So the length of the key that you use is, in and of itself, a code of sorts. A knowledgeable government eavesdropper, noting Randy's and Avi's use of a 4096-bit key, will conclude one of the following:

--Avi doesn't know what he's talking about. This can be ruled out with a bit of research into his past accomplishments. Or,

--Avi is clinically paranoid. This can also be ruled out with some research. Or,

--Avi is extremely optimistic about the future development of computer technology, or pessimistic about the political climate, or both. Or,

--Avi has a planning horizon that extends over a period of at least a century.

Randy paces around his room while his computer soars through number space. The shipping containers on the backs of those trucks bear exactly the same logos as the ones that used to fill the streets of South Seattle when a ship was unloading. To Randy this is oddly satisfying, as if, by making this crazy lunge across the Pacific, he has brought some kind of antipodal symmetry to his life. He has gone from the place where things are consumed to where they are produced, from a land where onanism has been enshrined at the highest levels of the society to one where cars have ``NO to contraception!'' stickers in their windows. It feels bizarrely right. He has not felt this way since Avi and he founded their first doomed business venture twelve years ago.



Randy grew up in a college town in eastern Washington State, graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle, and landed a Clerk Typist II job at the library there--specifically the Interlibrary Loan Department--where his job was to process incoming loan requests mailed in from smaller libraries all over the region and, conversely, to mail out requests to other libraries. If nine-year-old Randy Waterhouse had been able to look into the future and see himself in this career, he would have been delighted beyond measure: the primary tool of the Interlibrary Loan Department was the Staple Remover. Young Randy had seen one of these devices in the hands of his fourth-grade teacher and been enthralled by its cunning and deadly appearance, so like the jaws of some futuristic robot dragon. He had, in fact, gone out of his way to staple things incorrectly just so he could prevail on his teacher to unstaple them, giving him another glimpse of the blood-chilling mandibles in action. He had gone so far as to steal a staple remover from an untended desk at church and then incorporate it into an Erector-set robot hunter-killer device with which he terrorized much of the neighborhood; its pit-viper yawn separated many a cheap plastic toy from its parts and accessories before the theft was discovered and Randy made an example of before God and man. Now, in the Interlibrary Loan office, Randy had not just one but several staple removers in his desk drawer and was actually obligated to use them for an hour or two a day.

Since the UW library was well-endowed, its patrons didn't request books from other libraries unless they had been stolen from their own or were, in some way, peculiar. The ILL office (as Randy and his coworkers affectionately called it) had its regulars--people who had a whole lot of peculiar books on their wish lists. These people tended to be either tedious or scary or both. Randy always ended up dealing with the ``both'' subgroup, because Randy was the only Clerk Typist in the office who was not a lifer. It seemed clear that Randy, with his astronomy degree and his extensive knowledge of computers, would one day move on, whereas his coworkers did not harbor further ambitions. His larger sphere of interests, his somewhat broader concept of normalcy, was useful when certain patrons came into the office.

By the standards of many, Randy was himself a tedious, scary, obsessed character. He was not merely obsessed with science but also with fantasy role-playing games. The only way he could tolerate working at such a stupid job for a couple of years was that his off time was completely occupied with enacting fantasy scenarios of a depth and complexity that exercised all of the cranial circuitry that was so conspicuously going to waste in the ILL office. He was part of a group that would meet every Friday night and play until sometime on Sunday. The other stalwarts in the group were a computer science/music double major named Chester, and a history grad student named Avi.

When a new master's degree candidate named Andrew Loeb walked into the ILL office one day, with a certain glint in his eye, and produced a three-inch-thick stack of precisely typed request forms from his shitty old knapsack, he was recognized immediately as being of a particular type, and shunted in the direction of Randy Waterhouse. It was an instant meeting of minds, though Randy did not fully realize this until the books that Loeb had requested began to arrive on the trolley from the mail room.

Andy Loeb's project was to figure out the energy budgets of the local Indian tribes. A human body has to expend a certain amount of energy just to keep breathing and to maintain its body temperature. This figure goes up when it gets cold or when the body in question is doing work. The only way to obtain that energy is by eating food. Some foods have a higher energy content than others. For example, trout is highly nutritious but so low in fat and carbohydrates that you can starve to death eating it three times a day. Other foods might have lots of energy, but might require so much work to obtain and prepare that eating them would be a losing proposition, BTU-wise. Andy Loeb was trying to figure out what foods had historically been eaten by certain Northwest Indian tribes, how much energy they expended to get these foods and how much they obtained by eating them. He wanted to do this calculation for coastal Indians like the Salish (who had easy access to seafood) and for inland ones like the Cayuse (who didn't) as part of an extremely convoluted plan to prove some sort of point about the relative standards of living of these tribes and how this affected their cultural development (coastal tribes made lots of fantastically detailed art and inland ones occasionally scratched stick figures on rocks).

To Andrew Loeb it was an exercise in meta-historical scholarship. To Randy Waterhouse, it sounded like the beginnings of a pretty cool game. Strangle a muskrat and you get 136 Energy Points. Lose the muskrat and your core temp drops another degree.

Andy was nothing if not methodical and so he had simply looked up every book that had ever been written on such topics, and every book mentioned in those books' bibliographies, yea, even unto four or five generations; checked out all of them that were available locally; and ordered the rest from ILL. All of the latter passed across Randy's desk. Randy read some and skimmed all. He got to learn about how much blubber the Arctic explorers had to eat in order to keep from starving to death. He perused detailed specifications for Army C-rations. After a while, he actually began sneaking into the photocopy room and making copies of key data.

In order to run a realistic fantasy role-playing game, you had to keep track of how much food the imaginary characters were getting and how much trouble was involved in getting it. Characters passing across the Gobi desert in November of the year 5000 B.C. would have to spend more time worrying about food than, say, ones who were traveling across central Illinois in 1950.

Randy was hardly the first game designer to notice this. There were a few incredibly stupid games in which you didn't have to think about food, but Randy and his friends disdained them. In all of the games that he participated in, or that he himself designed, you had to devote a realistic amount of effort to getting food for your character. But it was not easy to determine what was realistic. Like most designers, Randy got over the problem by slapping together a few rudimentary equations that he basically just pulled out of thin air. But in the books, articles, and dissertations that Andrew Loeb was borrowing through ILL, he found exactly the raw data that a mathematically inclined person would need to come up with a sophisticated rules system based on scientific fact.

Stimulating all of the physical processes going on in each character's body was out of the question, especially in a game where you might be dealing with armies of a hundred thousand men. Even a crude simulation, tracking only a few variables and using simple equations, would involve a nightmarish amount of paperwork if you did it all by hand. But all of this was happening in the mid-1980s, when personal computers had become cheap and ubiquitous. A computer could automatically track a large database and tell you whether each character was well-fed or starving. There was no reason not to do it on a computer.

Unless, like Randy Waterhouse, you had such a shitty job that you couldn't afford a computer.

Of course, there's a way to dodge any problem. The university had lots of computers. If Randy could get an account on one of them, he could write his program there and run it for free.

Unfortunately, accounts were only available to students or faculty members, and Randy was neither.

Fortunately, he started dating a grad student named Charlene at just about this time.

How the hell did a generally keg-shaped guy, a hard scientist, working a dead-end Clerk Typist job, and spending all his spare time in the consummately nerdy pastime of fantasy role-playing games, end up in a relationship with a slender and not unattractive young liberal arts student who spent her spare time sea kayaking and going to foreign films? It must have been one of those opposites-attract kind of deals, a complementary relationship. They met, naturally, in the ILL office, where the highly intelligent but steady and soothing Randy helped the highly intelligent but scattered and flighty Charlene organize a messy heap of loan requests. He should have asked her out then and there, but he was shy. Second and third opportunities came along when the books she'd requested began to filter up from the mailroom, and finally he asked her out and they went to see a film together. Both of them turned out to be not just willing but eager, and possibly even desperate. Before they knew it, Randy had given Charlene a key to his apartment, and Charlene had given Randy the password to her free university computer account, and everything was just delightful.

The university computer system was better than no computer at all. But Randy was humiliated. Like every other high-powered academic computing network, this one was based on an industrial-strength operating system called UNIX, which had a learning curve like the Matterhorn, and lacked the cuddly and stylish features of the personal computers then coming into vogue. Randy had used it quite a bit as an undergraduate and knew his way around. Even so, learning how to write good code on the thing required a lot of time. His life had changed when Charlene had come along, and now it changed more: he dropped out of the fantasy role-playing game circuit altogether, stopped going to meetings of the Society for Creative Anachronism, and began to spend all of his free time either with Charlene or in front of a computer terminal. All in all, this was probably a change for the better. With Charlene, he did things he wouldn't have done otherwise, like getting exercise, or going to see live music. And at the computer, he was learning new skills, and he was creating something. It might be something completely useless, but at least he was creating.

He spent a lot of time talking to Andrew Loeb, who actually went out and did the stuff he was writing programs for; he'd disappear for a few days and come back all wobbly and haggard, with fish scales caught in his whiskers or dried animal blood under his fingernails. He'd ram down a couple of Big Macs, sleep for twenty-four hours, then meet Randy in a bar (Charlene wasn't comfortable with having him in the house) and talk learnedly of the difficulties of day-to-day life, aboriginal style. They argued about whether aborigines would eat the more disgusting parts of certain animals or throw them away. Andrew voted for yes. Randy disagreed--just because they were primitive didn't mean they couldn't have taste. Andrew accused him of being a romantic. Finally, to settle it, they went up into the mountains together, armed with nothing but knives and Andrew's collection of exquisitely crafted vermin snares. By the third night, Randy found himself seriously thinking about eating some insects. ``Q.E.D.,'' Andrew said.

Anyway, Randy finished his software after a year and a half. It was a success; Chester and Avi liked it. Randy was moderately pleased at having built something so complicated that actually worked, but he had no illusions about its being good for anything. He was sort of embarrassed at having wasted so much time and mental energy on the project. But he knew that if he hadn't been writing code, he'd have spent the same amount of time playing games or going to Society for Creative Anachronism meetings in medieval drag, so it all zeroed out in the end. Spending the time in front of the computer was arguably better, because it had honed his programming skills, which had been pretty sharp to begin with. On the other hand, he'd done it all on the UNIX system, which was for scientists and engineers--not a savvy move in an age when all the money was in personal computers.

Chester and Randy had nicknamed Avi ``Avid,'' because he really, really liked fantasy games. Avi had always claimed that he played them as a way of understanding what it was really like to live in ancient times, and he was a maniac about historical authenticity. That was okay; they all had half-assed excuses, and Avi's historical acumen frequently came in handy.

Not long after this, Avi graduated and disappeared, and popped up a few months later in Minneapolis, where he had gotten a job with a major publisher of fantasy role-playing games. He offered to buy Randy's game software for the astonishingly large sum of $1000 plus a small cut of future profits. Randy accepted the offer in its general outlines, asked Avi to send him a contract, then went out and found Andrew boiling some fish guts in a birchbark kettle atop a Weber grill on the roof of the apartment building where he lived. He wanted to give Andrew the good news, and to cut him in on the proceeds. What ensued was a really unpleasant conversation, standing up there in a pelting, spitting, wind-blown rain.

To begin with, Andrew took this deal far more seriously than Randy did. Randy saw it as a windfall, a lark. Andrew, who was the son of a lawyer, treated it as if it were a major corporate merger, and asked many tedious and niggling questions about the contract, which did not exist yet and which would probably cover a single piece of paper when it did. Randy didn't realize it at the time, but by asking so many questions for which Randy had no answers, Andrew was, in effect, arrogating to himself the role of Business Manager. He was implicitly forming a business partnership with Randy that did not, in fact, exist.

Furthermore, Andrew didn't have the first notion of how much time and effort Randy had put into writing the code. Or (as Randy was to realize later) maybe he did. In any case, Andrew assumed from the get-go that he would share a fifty-fifty split with Randy, which was wildly out of proportion to the work he'd actually done on the project. Basically, Andrew acted as if all of the work he'd ever done on the subject of aboriginal dining habits was a part of this undertaking, and that it entitled him to an equal split.

By the time Randy extricated himself from this conversation, his mind was reeling. He had gone in with one view of reality and been radically challenged by another one that was clearly preposterous; but after an hour of Andrew's browbeating he was beginning to doubt himself. After two or three sleepless nights, he decided to call the whole thing off. A paltry few hundred dollars wasn't worth all of this agony.

But Andrew (who was, by now, represented by an associate of his father's Santa Barbara law firm) vehemently objected. He and Randy had, according to his lawyer, jointly created something that had economic value, and a failure on Randy's part to sell it at market value amounted to taking money out of Andrew's pocket. It had become an unbelievable Kafkaesque nightmare, and Randy could only withdraw to a corner table at his favorite pub, drink pints of stout (frequently in the company of Chester) and watch this fantastic psychodrama unfold. He had, he now realized, blundered into some serious domestic weirdness involving Andrew's family. It turned out that Andrew's parents were divorced and, long ago, had fought savagely over custody of him, their only child. Mom had turned into a hippie and joined a religious cult in Oregon and taken Andrew with her. It was rumored that this cult engaged in sexual abuse of children. Dad had hired private dicks to kidnap Andrew back and then showered him with material possessions to demonstrate his superior love. There had followed an interminable legal battle in which Dad had hired some rather fringey psychotherapists to hypnotize Andrew and get him to dredge up repressed memories of unspeakable and improbable horrors.

This was just the executive summary of a weird life that Randy only learned about in bits and pieces as the years went on. Later, he was to decide that Andrew's life had been fractally weird. That is, you could take any small piece of it and examine it in detail and it, in and of itself, would turn out to be just as complicated and weird as the whole thing in its entirety.

Anyway Randy had blundered into this life and become enveloped in the weirdness. One of the young eager beavers in Andrew's dad's law firm decided, as a preemptive move, to obtain copies of all of Randy's computer files, which were still stored on the UW computer system. Needless to say, he went about it in a heavy-handed way, and when the university's legal department began to receive his sullen letters, it responded by informing both Andrew's lawyer, and Randy, that anyone who used the university's computer system to create a commercial product had to split the proceeds with the university. So now Randy was getting ominous letters from not one but two groups of deadly lawyers. Andrew then threatened to sue him for having made this blunder, which had halved the value of Andrew's share!

In the end, just to cut his losses and get out of it clean, Randy had to hire a lawyer of his own. The final cost to him was a hair more than five thousand dollars. The software was never sold to anyone, and indeed could not have been; it was so legally encumbered by that point that it would have been like trying to sell someone a rusty Volkswagen that had been dismantled and its parts hidden in attack dog kennels all over the world.

It was the only time in his life when he had ever thought about suicide. He did not think about it very hard, or very seriously, but he did think about it.

When it was all over, Avi sent him a handwritten letter saying, ``I enjoyed doing business with you and look forward to continuing our relationship both as friends and, should opportunities arise, as creative partners.''


INDIGO



Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the band are up on the deck of the Nevada one morning, playing the national anthem and watching the Stars and Stripes ratchet up the mast, when they are startled to find themselves in the midst of one hundred and ninety airplanes of unfamiliar design. Some of them are down low, traveling horizontally, and others are up high, plunging nearly straight down. The latter are going so fast that they appear to be falling apart; little bits are dropping off of them. It is terrible to see--some training exercise gone miserably awry. But they pull out of their suicidal trajectories in plenty of time. The bits that have fallen off of them plunge smoothly and purposefully, not tumbling and fluttering as chunks of debris would. They are coming down all over the place. Perversely, they all seem to be headed for the berthed ships. It is incredibly dangerous--they might hit someone! Lawrence is outraged.

There is a short-lived phenomenon taking place in one of the ships down the line. Lawrence turns to look at it. This is the first real explosion he's ever seen and so it takes him a long time to recognize it as such. He can play the very hardest glockenspiel parts with his eyes closed, and The Star Spangled Banner is much easier to ding than to sing.

His scanning eyes fasten, not on the source of the explosion, but on a couple of airplanes that are headed right toward them, skimming just above the water. Each drops a long skinny egg and then their tailplanes visibly move and they angle upwards and pass overhead. The rising sun shines directly through the glass of their canopies. Lawrence is able to look into the eyes of the pilot of one of the planes. He notes that it appears to be some sort of Asian gentleman.

This is an incredibly realistic training exercise--even down to the point of using ethnically correct pilots, and detonating fake explosives on the ships. Lawrence heartily approves. Things have just been too lax around this place.

A tremendous shock comes up through the deck of the ship, making his feet and legs feel as if he had just jumped off a ten-foot precipice onto solid concrete. But he's just standing there flatfooted. It makes no sense at all.

The band have finished playing the national anthem and are looking about at the spectacle. Sirens and horns are speaking up all over the place, from the Nevada, from the Arizona in the next berth, from buildings onshore. Lawrence doesn't see any antiaircraft fire going up, doesn't see any familiar planes in the air. The explosions just keep coming. Lawrence wanders over to the rail and stares across a few yards of open water towards the Arizona.

Another one of those plunging airplanes drops a projectile that shoots straight down onto Arizona's deck but then, strangely, vanishes. Lawrence blinks and sees that it has left a neat bomb-shaped hole in the deck, just like a panicky Warner Brothers cartoon character passing at high speed through a planar structure such as a wall or ceiling. Fire jets from that hole for about a microsecond before the whole deck bulges up, disintegrating, and turns into a burgeoning globe of fire and blackness. Waterhouse is vaguely aware of a lot of stuff coming at him really fast. It is so big that he feels more like he is falling into it. He freezes up. It goes by him, over him, and through him. A terrible noise pierces his skull, a chord randomly struck, discordant but not without some kind of deranged harmony. Musical qualities aside, it is so goddamned loud that it almost kills him. He claps his hands over his ears.

Still the noise is there, like red-hot knitting needles through the eardrums. Hell's Bells. He spins away from it, but it follows him. He has this big thick strap around his neck, sewn together at groin level where it supports a cup. Thrust into the cup is the central support of his glockenspiel, which stands in front of him like a lyre-shaped breastplate, huge fluffy tassels dangling gaily from the upper corners. Oddly, one of the tassels is burning. That isn't the only thing now wrong with the glockenspiel, but he can't quite make it out because his vision keeps getting obscured by something that must be wiped away every few moments. All he knows is that the glockenspiel has eaten a huge quantum of pure energy and been kicked up to some incredibly high state never before achieved by such an instrument; it is a burning, glowing, shrieking, ringing, radiating monster, a comet, an archangel, a tree of flaming magnesium, strapped to his body, standing on his groin. The energy is transmitted down its humming, buzzing central axis, through the cup, and into his genitals, which would be tumescing in other circumstances.

Lawrence spends some time wandering aimlessly around the deck. Eventually he has to help open a hatch for some men, and then he realizes that his hands are still clapped over his ears, and have been for a long time except for when he was wiping stuff out of his eyes. When he takes them off, the ringing has stopped, and he no longer hears airplanes. He was thinking that he wanted to go belowdecks, because the bad things are coming from the sky and he would like to get some big heavy permanent-seeming stuff between him and it, but a lot of sailors are taking the opposite view. He hears that they have been hit by one and maybe two of something that rhymes with ``torpedoes,'' and that they are trying to raise steam. Officers and noncoms, black and red with smoke and blood, keep deputizing him for different, extremely urgent tasks that he doesn't quite understand, not least because he keeps putting his hands over his ears.

Probably half an hour goes by before he hits upon the idea of discarding his glockenspiel, which is, after all, just getting in the way. It was issued to him by the Navy with any number of stern warnings about the consequences of misusing it. Lawrence is conscientious about this kind of thing, dating back to when he was first given organ-playing privileges in West Point, Virginia. But at this point, for the first time in his life, as he stands there watching the Arizona burn and sink, he just says to himself: Well, to heck with it! He takes that glockenspiel out of its socket and has one last look at it, it is the last time in his life he will ever touch a glockenspiel. There is no point in saving it now anyway, he realizes; several of the bars have been bent. He flips it around and discovers that chunks of blackened, distorted metal have been impact-welded onto several of the bars. Really throwing caution to the winds now, he flings it overboard in the general direction of the Arizona, a military lyre of burnished steel that sings a thousand men to their resting places on the bottom of the harbor.

As it vanishes into a patch of burning oil, the second wave of attacking airplanes arrives. The Navy's antiaircraft guns finally open up and begin to rain shells down into the surrounding community and blow up occupied buildings. He can see human-shaped flames running around in the streets, pursued by people with blankets.

The rest of the day is spent, by Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the Navy, grappling with the fact that many two-dimensional structures on this and other ships, which were put into place to prevent various fluids from commingling (e.g. fuel and air) have holes in them, and not only that but a lot of shit is on fire too and things are more than a little smoky. Certain objects that are supposed to (a) remain horizontal and (b) support heavy things have ceased to do either.

Nevada's engineering section manages to raise steam in a couple of boilers and the captain tries to get the ship out of the harbor. As soon as she gets underway, she comes under concerted attack, mostly by dive bombers who are eager to sink her in the channel and block the harbor altogether. Eventually, the captain runs her aground rather than see this happen. Unfortunately, what Nevada has in common with most other naval vessels is that she is not really engineered to work from a stationary position, and consequently she is hit three more times by dive bombers. So it is a pretty exciting morning overall. As a member of the band who does not even have his instrument any more, Lawrence's duties are quite poorly defined, and he spends more time than he should watching the airplanes and the explosions. He has gone back to his earlier train of thought regarding societies and their efforts to outdo each other. It is very clear to him, as wave after wave of Nipponese dive bombers hurl themselves, with calligraphic precision, at the ship he is standing on, and as the cream of his society's navy burns and explodes and sinks, putting up virtually no resistance, that his society is going to have to rethink a thing or two.



At some point he burns his hand on something. It is his right hand, which is preferable--he is left-handed. Also, he becomes more clearly aware that a portion of Arizona has tried to take his scalp off. These are minor injuries by Pearl Harbor standards and he does not stay long in the hospital. The doctor warns him that the skin on his hand might contract and limit his fingers' range of motion. As soon as he can withstand the pain, Lawrence begins to play Bach's Art of Fugue in his lap whenever he is not otherwise occupied. Most of those tunes start out simple; you can easily picture old Johann Sebastian sitting there on the bench on a cold morning in Leipzig, one or two blockflote stops yanked out, left hand in his lap, a fat choirboy or two over in the corner heaving away on the bellows, faint gasping noises coming from all the leaks in the works, and Johann's right hand wandering aimlessly across the forbidding simplicity of the Great manual, stroking those cracked and yellowed elephant tusks, searching for some melody he hadn't already invented. That is good stuff for Lawrence right now, and so he makes his right hand go through the same motions as Johann's, even though it is a gauze-wrapped hand and he is using an upside-down dinner tray as a substitute for the keyboard, and he has to hum the music under his breath. When he really gets into it, his feet skid around and piston under the sheets, playing imaginary pedals, and his neighbors complain.

He is out of the hospital in a few days, just in time for him and the rest of Nevada's band to begin their new, wartime assignment. This was evidently something of a poser for the Navy's manpower experts. These musicians were (from a killing-Nips point of view) completely useless to begin with. As of 7 December, they no longer have even a functioning ship and most of them have lost their clarinets.

Still, it isn't all about loading shells and pulling triggers. No large organization can kill Nips in any kind of systematic way without doing a nearly unbelievable amount of typing and filing. It is logical to suppose that men who can play the clarinet will not botch that kind of work any worse than anyone else. And so Waterhouse and his bandmates receive orders assigning them to what would appear to be one of the typing-and-filing branches of the Navy.

This is located in a building, not a ship. There are quite a few Navy people who sneer at the whole idea of working in a building, and Lawrence and some of the other recent recruits, eager to fit in, have gotten into the habit of copping the same attitude. But now that they have seen what happens to a ship when you detonate hundreds of pounds of high explosive on, in, and around it, Waterhouse and many others are reassessing their feelings about working in buildings. They report to their new post with high morale.

Their new commanding officer is not so cheerful, and his feelings appear to be shared by everyone in the entire section. The musicians are greeted without being welcomed and saluted without being honored. The people who have been working in this building--far from being overawed by their status as guys who not only worked on an actual ship until recently but furthermore have been very close to things that were exploding, burning, etc., and not as the result of routine lapses in judgment but because bad men deliberately made it happen--do not seem to feel that Lawrence and his bandmates deserve to be entrusted with this new work, whatever the hell it is.

Glumly, almost despairingly, the commanding officer and his subordinates get the musicians squared away. Even if they don't have enough desks to go around, each man can at least have a chair at a table or counter. Some ingenuity is displayed in finding places for all the new arrivals. It is clear that these people are trying their best at what they considered to be a hopeless task.

Then there is some talk about secrecy. A great deal of talk about it. They run through drills intended to test their ability to throw things away properly. This goes on for a long time and the longer it continues, without an explanation as to why, the more mysterious it becomes. The musicians, who were at first a little put out by their chilly reception, start to speculate amongst themselves as to what kind of an operation they have gotten themselves into now.

Finally, one morning, the musicians are assembled in a classroom in front of the cleanest chalkboard Waterhouse has ever seen. The last few days have imbued him with just enough paranoia that he suspects it is that clean for a reason--erasing chalkboards is not to be taken lightly during wartime.

They are seated in little chairs with desks attached to them, desks designed for right-handers. Lawrence puts his notepad in his lap, then rests his bandaged right hand on the desk and begins to play a ditty from Art of Fugue, grimacing and even grunting with pain as his burned skin stretches and slides over his knuckles.

Someone chucks him on the shoulder. He opens his eyes to see that he is the only person in the room sitting down; an officer is on the deck. He stands up and his weak leg nearly buckles. When he finally gets himself fully to his feet, he sees that the officer (if he even is an officer) is out of uniform. Way out of uniform. He's wearing a bathrobe and smoking a pipe. The bathrobe is extraordinarily worn, and not in the sense of, say, a hospital or hotel bathrobe that gets laundered frequently. This thing hasn't been laundered in a long time, but boy has it seen some use. The elbows are worn out and the bottom of the right sleeve is ashy grey and slippery with graphite from being dragged back and forth, tens of thousands of times, across sheets of paper dense with number-two pencil work. The terrycloth has a dandruffy appearance, but it has nothing to do with exfoliation of the scalp; these flakes are way too big, and too geometric: rectangles and circular dots of oaktag, punched out of cards and tape respectively. The pipe went out a long time ago and the officer (or whatever he is) is not even pretending to worry about getting it relit. It is there just to give him something to bite down on, which he does as vigorously as a civil war infantryman having a leg sawed off.

Some other fellow--one who actually bothered to shave, shower, and put on a uniform--introduces bathrobe man as Commander Shane-spelled-s-c-h-o-e-n, but Schoen is having none of it; he turns his back on them, exposing the back side of his bathrobe, which around the buttocks is worn transparent as a negligee. Reading from a notebook, he writes out the following in block letters:

19 17 17 19 14 20 23 18 19 8 12 16 19 8 3

21 8 25 18 14 18 6 3 18 8 15 18 22 18 11

Around the time that the fourth or fifth number is going up on the chalkboard, Waterhouse feels the hairs standing up on the back of his neck. By the time the third group of five numbers is written out, he has not failed to notice that none of them is larger than 26--that being the number of letters in the alphabet. His heart is pounding more wildly than it did when Nipponese bombs were tracing parabolic trajectories toward the deck of the grounded Nevada. He pulls a pencil out of his pocket. Finding no paper handy, he writes down the numbers from 1 to 26 on the surface of his little writing desk.

By the time the man in the bathrobe is done writing out the last group of numbers, Waterhouse is already well into his frequency count. He wraps it up as Bathrobe Man is saying something along the lines of ``this might look like a meaningless sequence of numbers to you, but to a Nip naval officer it might look like something entirely different.'' Then the man laughs nervously, shakes his head sadly, squares his jaw resolutely, and runs through a litany of other emotion-laden expressions not a single one of which is appropriate here.

Waterhouse's frequency count is simply a tally of how frequently each number appears on the blackboard. It looks like this:

1  14 ||
2  15 |
3 ||  16 |
4  17 ||
5  18 ||||||
6 |  19 ||||
7  20 |
8 ||||  21 |
9  22 |
10  23 |
11 |  24
12 |  25 |
13  26

The most interesting thing about this is that ten of the possible symbols (viz. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 24, and 26) are not even used. Only sixteen different numbers appear in the message. Assuming each of those sixteen represents one and only one letter of the alphabet, this message has (Lawrence reckons in his head) 111136315345735680000 possible meanings. This is a funny number because it begins with four ones and ends with four zeroes; Lawrence snickers, wipes his nose, and gets on with it.

The most common number is 18. It probably represents the letter E. If he substitutes E into the message everywhere he sees an 18, then--

Well, to be honest, then he'll have to write out the whole message again, substituting Es for 18s, and it will take a long time, and it might be time wasted because he might have guessed wrong. On the other hand, if he just restrains his mind to construe 18s as Es--an operation that he thinks of as being loosely analogous to changing the presets on a pipe organ's console--then what he sees in his mind's eye when he looks at the blackboard is

19 17 17 19 14 20 23 E 19 8 12 16 19 8 3

21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11

which only has 10103301395066880000 possible meanings. This is a funny number too because of all those ones and zeroes--but it is an absolutely meaningless coincidence.

``The science of making secret codes is called cryptography,'' Commander Schoen says, ``and the science of breaking them is cryptanalysis.'' Then he sighs, grapples visibly with some more widely divergent emotional states, and resignedly plods into the mandatory exercise of breaking these words down into their roots, which are either Latin or Greek (Lawrence isn't paying attention, doesn't care, only glimpses the stark word CRYPTO written in handsized capitals).

The opening sequence ``19 17 17 19'' is peculiar. 19, along with 8, is the second most common number in the list. 17 is only half as common. You can't have four vowels or four consonants in a row (unless the words are German) so either 17 is a vowel and 19 a consonant or the other way round. Since 19 appears more frequently (four times) in the message, it is more likely to be the vowel than 17 (which only appears twice). A is the most common vowel after E, so if he assumes that 19 is A, he gets

A 17 17 A 14 20 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3

21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11


This narrows it down quite a bit, to a mere 841941782922240000 possible answers. He's already reduced the solution space by a couple of orders of magnitude!

Schoen has talked himself up into a disturbingly heavy sweat, now, and is almost bodily flinging himself into a historical overview of the science of CRYPTOLOGY, as the union of cryptography and cryptanalysis is called. There's some talk about an English fellow name of Wilkins, and book called Cryptonomicon that he wrote hundreds of years ago, but (perhaps because he doesn't rate the intelligence of his audience too highly) he goes very easy on the historical background, and jumps directly from Wilkins to Paul Revere's ``one if by land, two if by sea'' code. He even makes a mathematics in-joke about this being one of the earliest practical applications of binary notation. Lawrence dutifully brays and snorts, drawing an appalled look from the saxophonist seated in front of him.

Earlier in his talk, the Schoen mentioned that this message was (in what's obviously a fictional scenario ginned up to make this mathematical exercise more interesting to a bunch of musicians who are assumed not to give a shit about math) addressed to a Nip naval officer. Given that context, Lawrence cannot but guess that the first word of the message is ATTACK. This would mean that 17 represented T, 14 C, and 20 K. When he fills these in, he gets

A T T A C K 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3

21 T 25 E C E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11


and then the rest is so obvious he doesn't bother to write it out. He cannot restrain himself from jumping to his feet. He's so excited he forgets about the weak legs and topples over across a couple of his neighbors' desks, which makes a lot of noise.

``Do you have a problem, sailor?'' says one of the officers in the corner, one who actually bothered to wear a uniform.

``Sir! The message is, `Attack Pearl Harbor December Seven!' Sir!'' Lawrence shouts, and then sits down. His whole body is quivering with excitement. Adrenalin has taken over his body and mind. He could strangle twenty sumo wrestlers on the spot.

Commander Schoen is completely impassive except that he blinks once, very slowly. He turns to one of his subordinates, who is standing against the wall with his hands clasped behind his back, and says, ``Get this one a copy of the Cryptonomicon. And a desk--as close to the coffee machine as possible. And why don't you promote the son of a bitch as long as you're at it.''

The part about the promotion turns out to be either military humor or further evidence of Commander Schoen's mental instability. Other than that small bit of drollery, the story of Waterhouse past this point, for the next ten months, is not much more complicated than the story of a bomb that has just been released from the belly of a plunging airplane. The barriers placed in his path (working his way through the Cryptonomicon, breaking the Nipponese Air Force Meteorological Code, breaking the Coral naval attache machine cipher, breaking Unnamed Nipponese Army Water Transport Code 3A, breaking the Greater East Asia Ministry Code) present about as much resistance as successive decks of a worm-eaten wooden frigate. Within a couple of months he is actually writing new chapters of the Cryptonomicon. People speak of it as though it were a book, but it's not. It is basically a compilation of all of the papers and notes that have drifted up in a particular corner of Commander Schoen's office over the roughly two-year period that he's been situated at Station Hypo, as this place is called.* It is everything that Commander Schoen knows about breaking codes, which amounts to everything that the United States of America knows. At any moment it could have been annihilated if a janitor had stepped into the room for a few minutes and tidied the place up. Understanding this, Commander Schoen's colleagues in the officers' ranks of Station Hypo have devised strenuous measures to prevent any type of tidying or hygienic operations, of any description, in the entire wing of the building that contains Commander Schoen's office. They know enough, in other words, to understand that the Cryptonomicon is terribly important, and they have the wit to take the measures necessary to keep it safe. Some of them actually consult it from time to time, and use its wisdom to break Nipponese messages, or even solve whole cryptosystems. But Waterhouse is the first guy to come along who is good enough to (at first) point out errors in what Schoen has written, and (soon) assemble the contents of the pile into something like an orderly work, and (eventually) add original material onto it.

*``Hypo'' is a military way of saying the letter H. Bright boy Waterhouse infers that there must be at least seven others: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.

At some point Schoen takes him downstairs and leads him to the end of a long windowless corridor to a slab of a door guarded by hulking Myrmidons and lets him see the second coolest thing they've got at Pearl Harbor, a roomful of machinery from the Electrical Till Corporation that they use mainly for doing frequency counts on Nip intercepts.

The most remarkable machine* at Station Hypo, however--and the first coolest thing in Pearl Harbor--is even deeper in the cloaca of the building. It is contained in something that might be likened to a bank vault if it weren't all wired up with explosives so that its contents can be vaporized in the event of a total Nip invasion.

*Assuming, provisionally, that Alan is wrong and that human brains are not machines.

This is the machine that Commander Schoen made, more than a year ago, for breaking the Nipponese cipher called Indigo. Apparently, as of the beginning of 1940, Schoen was a well-adjusted and mentally healthy young man into whose lap was dumped some great big long lists of numbers compiled from intercept stations around the Pacific (perhaps, Waterhouse thinks, Alpha, Bravo, etc.). These numbers were Nipponese messages that had been encrypted somehow--circumstantial evidence suggested that it had been done by some kind of machine. But absolutely nothing was known about the machine: whether it used gears or rotary switches or plugboards, or some combination thereof, or some other kind of mechanism that hadn't even been thought of by white people yet; how many such mechanisms it did or didn't use; specific details of how it used them. All that could be said was that these numbers, which seemed completely random, had been transmitted, perhaps even incorrectly. Other than that, Schoen had nothing--nothing--to work on.

As of the middle of 1941, then, this machine existed in this vault, here at Station Hypo. It existed because Schoen had built it. The machine perfectly decrypted every Indigo message that the intercept stations picked up, and was, therefore, necessarily an exact functional duplication of the Nipponese Indigo code machine, though neither Schoen nor any other American had ever laid eyes on one. Schoen had built the thing simply by looking at those great big long lists of essentially random numbers, and using some process of induction to figure it out. Somewhere along the line he had become totally debilitated psychologically, and begun to suffer nervous breakdowns at the rate of about one every week or two.

As of the actual outbreak of war with Nippon, Schoen is on disability, and taking lots of drugs. Waterhouse spends as much time with Schoen as he is allowed to, because he's pretty sure that whatever happened inside of Schoen's head, between when the lists of apparently random numbers were dumped into his lap and when he finished building his machine, is an example of a noncomputable process.

Waterhouse's security clearance is upgraded about once a month, until it reaches the highest conceivable level (or so he thinks) which is Ultra/Magic. Ultra is what the Brits call the intelligence they get from having broken the German Enigma machine. Magic is what the Yanks call the intelligence they get from Indigo. In any case, Lawrence now gets to see the Ultra/Magic summaries, which are bound documents with dramatic, alternating red and black paragraphs printed on the front cover. Paragraph number three states:

NO ACTION IS TO BE TAKEN ON INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED, REGARDLESS OF TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE, IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY.

Seems clear enough, right? But Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse is not so damn sure.

. . . IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING . . .

At about the same time, Waterhouse has made a realization about himself. He has found that he works best when he is not horny, which is to say in the day or so following ejaculation. So as a part of his duty to the United States he has begun to spend a lot of time in whorehouses. But he can't have that much actual sex on what is still a glockenspiel player's pay and so he limits himself to what are euphemistically called massages.

. . . ACTION. . . EFFECT . . .REVEALING . . .

The words stay with him like the clap. He lies on his back during these massages, arms crossed over his eyes, mumbling the words to himself. Something bothers him. He has learned that when something bothers him in this particular way it usually leads to his writing a new paper. But first he has to do a lot of hard mental pick-and-shovel work.

It all comes to him, explosively, during the Battle of Midway, while he and his comrades are spending twenty-four hours a day down among those ETC machines, decrypting Yamamoto's messages, telling Nimitz exactly where to find the Nip fleet.

What are the chances of Nimitz finding that fleet by accident? That's what Yamamoto must be asking himself.

It is all a question (oddly enough!) of information theory.

. . .ACTION . . .

What is an action? It might be anything. It might be something obvious like bombing a Nipponese military installation. Everyone would agree that this would constitute an action. But it might also be something like changing the course of an aircraft carrier by five degrees--or not doing so. Or having exactly the right package of forces off Midway to hammer the Nipponese invasion fleet. It could mean something much less dramatic, like canceling plans for an action. An action, in a certain sense, might even be the total absence of activity. Any of these might be rational responses, on the part of some commander, to INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED. But any of them might be observable by the Nipponese--and hence any of them would impart information to the Nipponese. How good might those Nips be at abstracting information from a noisy channel? Do they have any Schoens?

. . . EFFECT . . .

So what if the Nips did observe it? What would the effect be exactly? And under what circumstances might the effect be REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY?

If the action is one that could never have happened unless the Americans were breaking Indigo, then it will constitute proof, to the Nipponese, that the Americans have broken it. The existence of the source--the machine that Commander Schoen built--will be revealed.

Waterhouse trusts that no Americans will be that stupid. But what if it isn't that clear-cut? What if the action is one that would merely be really improbable unless the Americans were breaking the code? What if the Americans, in the long run, are just too damn lucky?

And how closely can you play that game? A pair of loaded dice that comes up sevens every time is detected in a few throws. A pair that comes up sevens only one percent more frequently than a straight pair is harder to detect--you have to throw the dice many more times in order for your opponent to prove anything.

If the Nips keep getting ambushed--if they keep finding their own ambushes spoiled--if their merchant ships happen to cross paths with American subs more often than pure probability would suggest--how long until they figure it out?

Waterhouse writes papers on the subject, keeps pestering people with them. Then, one day, Waterhouse receives a new set of orders.

The orders arrive encrypted into groups of five random-looking letters, printed out on the blue tissue paper that is used for top-secret cablegrams. The message has been encrypted in Washington using a one-time pad, which is a slow and awkward but, in theory, perfectly unbreakable cipher used for the most important messages. Waterhouse knows this because he is one of the only two persons in Pearl Harbor who has clearance to decrypt it. The other one is Commander Schoen, and he is under sedation today. The duty officer opens up the appropriate safe and gives him the one-time pad for the day, which is basically a piece of graph paper covered with numbers printed in groups of five. The numbers have been chosen by secretaries in a basement in Washington by shuffling cards or drawing chits out of a hat. They are pure noise. One copy of the pure noise is in Waterhouse's hands, and the other copy is used by the person who encrypted this message in Washington.

Waterhouse sits down and gets to work, subtracting noise from ciphertext to produce plaintext.

The first thing he sees is that this message's classification is not merely Top Secret, or even Ultra, but something entirely new: ULTRA MEGA.

The messages states that after thoroughly destroying this message, he--Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse--is to proceed to London, England, by the fastest available means. All ships, trains, and airplanes, even submarines, will be made available to him. Though a member of the U.S. Navy, he is even to be provided with an extra uniform--an Army uniform--in case it simplifies matters for him.

The one thing he must never, ever do is place himself in a situation where he could be captured by the enemy.

191,"I'll Take You There (From ""Threesome"")","Silently I step up with a subversive subtext
Trying to feed the need for more than just remedial subjects
Place my faith in the belief that the general public
Will open up their minds to more than just an industry puppet

I ain't a preacher preaching doom and gloom, well not just yet
But if there's something I feel strongly about, then I'll discuss it
And if I only make one album before I kick the bucket?
I'll hold that album to my heart in my grave and say ""FUCK IT""...

Waiting for the beat to kick in
But it never does
Waiting for my feet to grow wings
That lift me above
All of these tiresome things
That we know and love
Waiting for the beat to kick in

Waiting for the beat to kick in
But it never does
Waiting for my feet to grow wings
That lift me above
All of these tiresome things

Waiting for the beat to kick in
But it never does

A lot of my poems and writings seem to start with me waking up, or being in a dream, or dream like state. Now, this implies a certain level of abstraction in my work. You might say I'm keeping it surreal but I'd rather you didn't. Fact is, I sleep a lot. It's as simple as that. I like sleeping, man. It's a nice place to be

...Right

I was walking along through unfamiliar streets
And it felt strange because there didn't seem to be anyone else around
I don't know where I was but it had a feeling of New York
But not New York in real life, the New York you see in old films
I can't really explain why it just had that vibe
Every step I took felt somehow more dramatic
So I kept walking and down an alley behind a bar sitting on some metal steps I saw a man
From the look and smell of him it was clear that he enjoyed the drink
But he wasn't in such a state I felt him to be any kind of irrational threat so I approached him
With due care

""Ah Mr Pip"" he said out loud
""We've been awaiting you, my name is Elwood P. Dowd"",
Now just what he meant by 'we' I didn't really get
But all the same I took a seat next to him on the step
He said ""You'll meet a few people before this day is through
Who will administer advice and guidelines to you
Now what each of them says I'll tell you now is true
But whether or not you take their advice is for you to choose""
At that point he acted as if someone had whispered in his ear
Which, since no one else was there, was pretty damn weird
Awkwardly I looked away and kinda played with my beard
And he cleared his throat for a second and said ""Listen here
In this life you can be oh so smart or oh so pleasant
For years I was smart, I recommend pleasant
Being smart can make you rich and bring respect and reverence
But the rewards of being pleasant are far more incandescent""

With this information I was encouraged to walk on
I continued alone through these empty streets
Thinking over what Elwood had said but at the same time thinking about how fucking strange the day had been so far
I was in my own little world when a hand was placed on my chest
And a guy said ""Look out, there's some broken glass on the floor there""

I looked up
He said ""Hi, pleased to meet you, my name is Lloyd Dobler,
I'll get straight to the point, won't take too much time from ya
I'm probably the youngest person you'll get advice from today
And you may think that a guy my age wouldn't have anything to say
But it's said that observation, not old age, brings wisdom
And I observe every single life lesson I'm given
I won't attempt tell you how to love or be loved
Because you get a different genie each time that lantern is rubbed
But I will offer you advice on dealing with life
Its ups and its downs
Its troubles and its strife
Now I'm sure you've had times when you've felt down or angry
Wanted to lash out, punch a wall and be manly
But the question I pose now will offer you a plan B
And maybe some peace and quiet for your friends and family
How hard is it to decide to be in a good mood
And then just be in a good mood?
That's all I have to say because it's a straight up fact
You control your emotions it's as simple as that""
He walked off then, leaving me to contemplate this brief encounter
I barely had time to realize I was being taught something before he was gone
And I was back on my way

On I walked and almost immediately I spotted the next guide
And it couldn't be clearer
This guy was standing on the street corner and pacing back and forth
Skinny looking guy leather jacket tight jeans, retro look
I'd rarely seen someone look quite so uncomfortable in their own skin
Twitching, smoothing his hair back, kicking the floor and looking up and down the street
He clearly didn't enjoy waiting around so I approached him quickly
To put him out of his misery
And to let him start his spiel

""Hi my name is Billy Brown,
I ain't gonna give you some quote
Instead I'm gonna use some stuff that YOU wrote:
'Always had the feeling I could never be the villain
Cause the villain in the films is always backlit
Always had the feeling I could never be the villain
Cause the villain in the films is always backlit
Now I find it pleasing to defend myself with reason
But this clock is always sitting on my back
Tick, tick tick
Then, no explosion but persistence brings erosion
Like a picture over overly exposed and
Like a fox that's been run over in the road and..'
Basically what I'm trying to say to you is
You don't achieve anything by letting the past dwell within you
Getting all pent up and angry about stuff just eats away inside you
What's that other line of yours..
'If you can't forgive and forget
How's this
Forget forgiving and just accept that that's it
See that's how it's got to be
Then you can fall in love, get on with your life and be free""
Almost before he could finished this sentence he was off down the street
Hands in his pockets, hurrying away..

Now quite accepting of the totally surreal time I was having I rounded the corner
And continued on to my next encounter
Resigned to the fact this was some dream or hallucination
I made my way through the now dark street
To the one window that had a light on
I walked through the unlocked door which incidentally had blinds down
And a silhouetted figure like a film noir scene
But sadly no sign saying Private Eye.
As I entered a voice promptly said:

""This journey's almost over, I'm the only one left
Allow me to introduce myself; my name is Walter Neff,
The other guys have taught you things of great positive worth
But I'm afraid I'm here to bring you back down to Earth
See you can live your life in control and be nice
But even that will not promise you a happy life
You may think yourself in general to be a nice guy
But I'm telling you now - that right there is a lie
Even the nicest of guys has some nasty within them
You don't have to be backlit to be the villain
Whether it be greed, lust, or just plain vindictiveness
There's a level of malevolence inside all of us
You can paint yourself an image and live in your own little dream
But this ain't a dream, it's one big silver screen
So when you think you've got your happy ending don't ever forget it
It ain't over til you hear the sound of your end credits
You'll be waiting for the beat to kick in
But it never does
Waiting for you feet to grow wings
That lift you above
All of these tiresome things
That you know and love
Waiting for the beat to kick in
But it never does
Waiting for the beat to kick in
But it never does
Waiting for you feet to grow wings
That lift you above

That you know and love

193,Diary Of A Madman,"[Intro: Judge, Lawyer, Woman​​, (Shabazz the Disciple)]
​​​They killed my baby, oh God they killed my baby
Order in the court, order in the court
​​I will make you pay for this you murderers
I said order in the court now
Now, before this court passes judgement
Will the four defendants please rise and approach the bench
Trust me guys, it's all under control
The judge is my uncle, he'll take the insanity plea
Oh yeah, don't forget my retainer balance
Okay, I understand you guys are pleading insanity claiming
Demonic spirits possessed you to do these hideous murders
(Yeah, word)
Can you please explain to the court how these so called spirits made you into these raving madmen

[Verse 1: Shabazz the Disciple]
Bear witness as I exercise my exorcism
The evil that lurks within the sin, the terrorism
Possessed by evil spirits, voices from the dead
I come forth with Gravediggaz in a head full of dread
I've been examined ever since I was semen
They took a sonogram and seen the image of a demon
At birth nurses surrounded me with needles
And drugged me all up with the diseases of evil
Grew up in Hell, now I dwell in an Islamic temple
I’m fighting a holy war in the mental
Look deep into my eyes you'll see visions of death
Possessed by homicide is what I am obsessed
Giving niggas brain dimples
Dragging their asses on my hook by their temples
The cause of death is unknown to the cops
Cause when I kill 'em, I’m not leaving one element to autops'
First I'll assassinate him, and them I'll cremate him
Then take all of his fucking ashes and evaporate him
I'll creep through the graveyard and hunt down your tombstone
Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fucking bones
You try to haunt me nigga, I ain't tryna hear it
Buck buck buck, I'll give your ass a holy spirit

[Break: Judge (Poetic)]
(Stressful, try to avoid all my impure thoughts, I am losing my mind
And it seems I don’t know what’s true or dream)
[Can you please explain to the court
When these problems first began?]

[Verse 2: RZArector]
The year '84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil djinn
I realize my ideas have spawned for 400 years
Of blood sweat and tears
I saw the torture, brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
I'm having reoccurring nightmares
Of being soaking wet, strapped down to the electric chair
I got tackled with handcuffs and shackled in restraint
At the bottom of a holy tabernacle
They gave me nothing to eat for two weeks
And sewed my eye lids open so I couldn't sleep
About to die from thirst, that's when the minister
Quenched my jaws with a cold glass of vinegar
Upon my wounds they seasoned me with salt
And nailed my hands feet to the form of a cross
Ahh!! I cry
As the blood drips inside of my eye refusing to die
Visions of Hell tormented my faith
So I chewed my fucking arm off and made an escape

[Break: Judge (jury)]
(Your arm?! No way God dammit)
(Oh no, me mataron mi amigo, hijo de la gran puta
Esos cogines me mataron mi amigo que voy a cerca carajo, cono)
[Calm down people, please calm down
Let us please proceed with the defendants' explanation]

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Enter the realms of understanding
And take good heed or you could bleed while I’m scanning
Three stages of pure Hell, 16 pages of red cells
*Shh* rain drops hits the pails
Path is dull and narrow, you're stalked by a shadow
I'll pierce your skull with the fucking arrow
So narrow, only one could enter at a time
Stuck in the center, read the signs
A thousand doors to choose, you better hurry
Don’t stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry
On your right side there’s fire, your left, deep waters
Watch your step, it's deep waters
What's that coming through the floor? It's a claw
*pssh* took his fucking ass to the fucking core
(ahhh!!)

[Verse 4: Frukwan]
Stroll through the dark conditions
I stone you till I see sparks of friction
I chop ya like a coal miner
Then combine the drug and mix it with your blood
Some more, I give you some more and watch you crawl
Guts hit the floor, worms exit your pores
I trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe
Deep into my thoughts and bust out your skin
You scream, portraits of inflictable pain, you can't stand
You're up to your hands in quicksand
You're sinking and sinking deep into the earth
Thoughts was possessed since the first day of birth
My mental says it's my turn to possess the matter
Stab you with a dagger up Jacob's ladder
Thoughts become shattered, confused and tragic
Fiery thoughts of Gravediggaz

201,I Need Your Love,"[Verse 1]
Can't help this feeling
Can't help this feeling
I can't believe it's open for discussion
We've said our goodbyes
I've been a fool not to see the repercussions
You've had in my life
I'm at the point of no return
I've finally crossed the line
Don't want to stop and watch the bridges burn
Cause I can't stand to see you stay behind

[Chorus]
I need your love
I want you every way
I need your love
Can't help this feeling coming back everyday

[Verse 2]
I stayed around hoping you'd discover
How much there was to lose
I spelled it out, I led you to the water
But you're too blind to choose
I gave it everything and more to make it
I've waited for so long
I saw the chance to run and had to take it
But something's missing and I know it's wrong

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've passed the point of no return
And all the tears have dried
Don't want to stop and watch the bridges burn
Because I keep wishing I was on your side

Yo, first no one knew that my skill were tight
That I could rock a mic all long and stay right
Man listen, when it come to rhymes I smell them
I got lyrics locked in my cerebellum
In other words brainstem
Like my man Rakim said, I'm better than the rest of them
I'm a tid bit smoother
I bust a rap like a Luger
I'm dreamy like Krueger
Smooth B, real in the flesh
Greg Nice my counterpart keepin the vibe fresh
And we can go on
From night to morn
Rippin the mic and leave the stage torn
Never in a scuffle
Cause i can chill in the Bronx
And still do the Hollywood Shuffle
Take it back to the essence
To the jams in the park, ahh everesence
Felt like yesterday
When I was a shorty b-boy around the way
Cango, nylon, Nike suits and Pumas
I had girls from here to Montezuma
Now things are pretty much the same
But I don't have to rhyme for free and that's the price of fame
I had to learn alot to protect myself
From those that want what I got
Now, I can be the same like a ?pamphlet?
And before they bight, I throw a damn fit
I gotta keep makin papers
I got no time for no corn ball capers
So here's a word from the wise
If you tryin ask me, your in for a big surprise

Yeee-hey, yeah
Alright
Come on now
Yeah
Talk to me
Yeah

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yeah

[Verse 1: Salt]
I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect, I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future cuz we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
You gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Heeh

[Verse 2: Pepa]
My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

[Verse 3: Spinderella]
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac (shit)
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Ohh, uuuh
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
You know what I'm sayin', he's a mighty mighty good man
Y'all hear me, now check it out

[Verse 4: Salt]
My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker cuz that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful cuz his mama taught him that
I've got a good man

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
What a mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a mighty mighty good man

I break it down one time

But I can't keep waiting on you, ohh
Look at me and tell me now if I can be the last one that that
You think about thinking you, can keep running out my life
My life my life why is it's so hard for you to pick up the phone
And call me put a little time in for me to show that you really care for
Me remember how you used to say
That nothing comes before me

Boys before me promises, promises

Where he has to do everything his girl
Likes because if he don't choose to

Get to no me do me hold me treat me

Never been a coward (cause it's a eastside thing)

Tell her what's up you got the pumps and a bump

Before I started working at a strip club, I naively assumed that all strippers danced to Motley Crue, Guns N’ Roses, ACDC, or some other type of hair metal or butt rock. All of those bands had strippers in their videos, so it made perfect sense to me. Within my first week at the Doll House, I realized that I was sorely mistaken. Strippers might have danced to Motley Crue in the late eighties or early nineties, and occasionally you may walk into a strip club and see a girl dancing to a Poison song because her middle-aged regular requested it, but these days, the vast majority prefer to dance to hip-hop, rap, and in my opinion, one of the worst music genres of all, contemporary R&B.

Now, I consider myself to have a relatively diverse taste in music. As a vinyl enthusiast with several thousand records in my collection, my taste runs the gamut from The Misfits to 2Pac. But I have a difficult time accepting contemporary R&B as a listenable music genre. It’s almost worse than modern country music, which is, inarguably, the Special Olympics of music. For me, both are a slow and painful listening experience. I’d prefer to listen to A Night at the Roxbury soundtrack in its entirety followed by Nickelback’s Greatest Hits than be subjected to a half hour of consecutive contemporary R&B songs. I make use of the term “contemporary R&B” in an effort to distinguish it from the R&B of the fifties, sixties, and seventies. James Brown, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, and The Isley Brothers are all classified within the R&B/Soul genre and are amazing artists deserving of utmost respect. I’m sure they were dismayed to see their musical creation evolve into a base, lurid form of adolescent sexual expression. It has become the mating soundtrack for the dim-witted and linguistically challenged. James Brown and Al Green would never have used these song titles: “Feelin’ On Your Booty,” “U Remind Me of My Jeep,” “Knockin’ Da Boots,” “Freakin’ You,” “Shorty (Got Her Eyes on Me),” “I Can Tell U Wanna Fuck,” or my personal favorite, “T-Shirt and Panties.” I had never encountered the contemporary R&B genre prior to working at the Doll House. The names Jodeci, R. Kelly, and H-Town were foreign concepts to me. But within that first week of employment, I realized that contemporary R&B is the preferred music of the modern-day stripper. They like it—believe me, I’ve inquired—because it makes them feel “sexy” or the more common explanation, “I’m feeling tired and R&B is easy music to dance to.” The latter is the primary reason they prefer R&B because they can roll about on their backs onstage and earn the same amount in tips as the dancer frenetically wrapping her body around the pole to Aerosmith’s “Rag Doll.”

The first several months at the Doll House was a veritable culture shock for me. I had several books of CDs at my disposal, but not one contained an R. Kelly song. I not only had to pay close attention to the music selection of the night shift DJs, I had to assiduously write down the music that the girls requested, or I would not have been a successful DJ at that club. It took about a month of studying this wretched genre and several weeks of downloading songs from the Internet before I had a decent collection of contemporary R&B music. On a daily basis, I’d pore through the Top 20 lists of all the urban radio stations and download the most popular tracks. Soon enough, I was able to play almost any song that a dancer requested, and they tipped me well for it.

That being said, if the dancer was a poor tipper, I couldn’t care less what type of music she requested. I’d select music for the crowd and for myself. And more often than not, it would be some type of rock or metal because that’s what I wanted to hear: ACDC, Aerosmith, Nine Inch Nails, Iron Maiden, Guns N’ Roses, Motley Crue, Danzig, Alice in Chains, Metallica, The Stooges, or even Slayer or Motorhead if I really didn’t like the girl. Experience has taught me that Slayer is a very effective tool in teaching a dancer the benefits of tipping the DJ. It’s difficult to describe the sweeping feeling of satisfaction I derived from watching a dancer who refused to tip stand helplessly onstage, with a look of pure and intense hatred on her face while Slayer’s “Angel of Death” blasted through the club’s speakers. All strip club DJs live for these “fucking with the dancer moments,” and we all have our anecdotes about how we played some outlandish song for a dancer we didn’t like and she flipped out. I worked with a DJ who told me how he once played “Turning Japanese” followed by “Kung Fu Fighting” for an Asian dancer who never tipped him. She flashed him a nasty look during the first song and furiously exited the stage during the second. With her exposed mammoth fake breasts bouncing from left to right, she headed directly to the DJ booth and spat in his face while cursing at him in Cantonese. We all have a cache of novelty songs reserved for the non-tippers. Donnie, who I worked with at the Ruby Club, always employed MC Hammer’s “U Can’t Touch This” for non-tipping dancers. Now I’ve played “Baby Got Back” and “Ice Ice Baby” a few times, but I’ve never played MC Hammer for a dancer. Not once. I’m not that much of a sadist. But like any experienced strip club DJ, I had my special cache of songs that I reserved for the non-tippers.

At the end of my shift, I’d head downstairs while the girls cashed out with the managers and wait by the front door to make it as awkward as possible for them to leave without tipping me. Most of the seasoned dancers would tip or explain that they didn’t make enough money that night and would take care of me the next time we worked together. I was satisfied with that explanation. Though it would have been better to receive some amount of compensation, it was also advantageous to remain on a dancer’s good side. And when they did earn a lot of money, they’d usually tip me double that night. But there were always a few strippers who were either new and did not know that it was customary to tip the DJ and security staff, or ones that steadfastly refused to tip anything at all. I typically worked with a dancer for at least two or three shifts before I classified her as a non-tipper and played Weird Al for her sets. After the second shift when I didn’t receive a tip, I’d confront her in a tactful manner and inquire as to why she chose not to tip. I’d like to emphasize being “tactful” in these interactions because, though it’s customary, a dancer is not required to tip any employee at a strip club. And if she feels like she’s being extorted or threatened in any manner, she could complain to management, and the DJ or bouncer would be immediately fired. It was much easier to replace a security guard or DJ than find an attractive dancer who was reliable and a good earner. When I was promoted to night shifts at the Doll House, I replaced an egotistical, violence-prone DJ named Terrence who would confront non-tipping girls in the most untactful manner possible. Terrence, or ‘Tito’ as everyone called him, was in his late twenties and became friends with my manager Joe when they were both in prison. Tito also waited by the front door to be tipped, but if a girl tried to leave without tipping, he’d grab her by the arm and corner her outside, demanding to know why she wasn’t “breaking him off.” He’d refer to this as his “gorilla pimp technique,” and he informed me several times that “fear is the only way these bitches learn.” Understandably, he frightened a lot of dancers and was eventually let go because one of them complained about his technique. Conversely, I chose to use a much softer, more diplomatic approach. Standing by the door, I’d watch the non-tipper cash out with the manager, and as she was walking by me to exit the club, I’d say in a very non-confrontational tone:

“Hey, Nadine, do you have a minute?”

“Umm, yeah.”

“I was just wondering if I screwed up your set. Did I play the wrong song or something?”

“Umm, no. I don’t think so.”

“Yeah, I thought I played the two songs that you requested. Usually, if I play a decent set, most girls take care of me at the end of the night. I’m just concerned I did something to upset you because I haven’t received a tip tonight or the last time we worked together.”

“Oh, I’m sorry. I’m new and didn’t realize that we had to tip.” Slightly embarrassed, she’d rummage through her purse and pull out a twenty-dollar bill. “Will this work?”

“Totally. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it, and let me know if there’s any new music that you’d like to dance to.”

This self-deprecating approach was very effective for the majority of cases but not all. I’ve worked with several dancers who simply refused to tip regardless of how many times I’d passive-aggressively inquire about the reason they chose not to take care of me at the end of the night. These were the dancers who I had reserved a cache of special songs for. Compared to my colleagues, I was rather patient and more than willing to give a dancer several chances to make amends. But after three shifts without receiving a tip, I had no choice but to ridicule her onstage with music, my only weapon. My go-to song for this situation was “What Is Love,” the first track from A Night at the Roxbury soundtrack. In fact, most of the songs from that soundtrack would work perfectly. I’d follow that with Tom Jones’s “Sex Bomb” or sometimes “Maneater” by Hall & Oates. All three of those songs are fast-paced and easily meet the 120-beats-per-minute requirement set by the management. For her second set of the night, I’d make the switch to metal and play Iron Maiden’s “Run to the Hills” as loud as I could followed by Danzig’s “Mother,” which was applicable because a good portion of the dancers were single mothers. At most clubs, the dancer is never allowed to leave the stage unless it’s an extreme circumstance, like her water broke or she’s in the throes of an epileptic fit. If she has a temper tantrum and storms off the stage because of the DJ’s music selection, she will incur a sizable fine. Therefore, she has no choice but to dance to the music the DJ has selected for her. I could play the hapless dancer a seven minute Iron Maiden song, and she had to dance to it. And depending on how many occasions she “forgot” to tip me and which manager was working that night, I’d play that Iron Maiden song in its entirety. The dancer would feign enjoyment for the duration of the song, and as soon as it finished, she’d angrily storm off the stage and march directly to the DJ booth.

“What the fuck was that?”

“That’s my way of saying thanks for not tipping me.”

This comment would silence her momentarily, affording me an opportunity to continue by bluntly explaining: “Like you, I earn my living primarily from tips. If you take care of me at the end of the night, I will play you any song that you desire. But if you choose to stiff me, well then, you’ll have to dance to the music that I want to hear. And I love Iron Maiden. I really do. They’re one of my favorite bands.”

She stands there mouth agape, her maroon-shadowed oval eyes in their characteristic vacuous stare, and offers a feeble explanation: “Oh my god. I’m so sorry. I totally forgot to tip you last night.”

“Well, actually, you forgot to tip me the last three nights that we worked together.”

“Oh, shit. My bad. My money sucked the last few nights and I just forgot to tip you.” Reaching into her purse, she’d pull out two twenty-dollar bills. “Is this okay?”

“That works. What do you want me to play for your next set? And I promise I won’t play any Maiden.”

“Umm, I’m feeling like in a rock mood. Do you have any Nickelback?”

Trying not to audibly sigh, “Yes, I do. I’ll play some Nickelback for your next set.” Say what you will about their wretched music, at least it’s better than contemporary R&B.

After this brief conversation and a few sets of “non-tipper” music, most dancers would understand the benefits of tipping the DJ. However, there were invariably some who simply did not care and still refused to tip. The most resilient non-tipper that I ever encountered was a dancer named Barbie who worked at the Doll House for a brief period. She was a reasonably attractive blonde with some of the worst tattoos that I had ever seen. I shuddered every time I caught a glance of her My Little Pony tramp stamp. There were rumors that she was a Bulgarian model who had moved to America, fell on hard times, and consequently ended up at the Doll House. But none of these stories were ever substantiated. On more than one occasion, I had tried my self-deprecating inquisition but to no success. She’d glance apathetically in my direction and hastily walk out the front door with nary a thought of tipping me.

But since she was new and easy on the eyes, I gave her five chances before I started fucking with her music. The other DJs at the club utterly despised her and had their worst music cued up as soon as she took the stage. After several weeks of not receiving a tip, I completely echoed their sentiment and played her some of the worst sets that I could muster. Barbie once worked one of my Friday day shifts, and only two other girls had shown up for work that day. This meant that she would have to go on the stage at least a dozen times. Casey was the manager for that shift, and he couldn’t care less what I played for her. In fact, he stood in the DJ booth and offered suggestions:

“Have you played ‘Mongoloid’ yet?”

“No, I haven’t played any Devo. This set is going to be all Journey.”

I hit the play button and Journey’s “Separate Ways” blasted from the club’s speakers. Barbie didn’t seem to pay any attention to the music. She took off her top and held onto the pole and circled it repeatedly, lacking any sort of rhythm to her movements.

Without exaggeration, she was one of the most uncoordinated dancers that I had ever seen.

“Damn, Sanchez. I’d wager that you’d have more rhythm up there than she does.”

“I’ve seen quadriplegics with more rhythm.”

“Whatever. I couldn’t care less about her. I’m just paying attention to the plight of Steve Perry. He’s a man who loved and lost and may never have truly loved again,” lamented Casey.

“What do you mean?”

“Listen to the song, man. Separate fucking ways. He had to go his separate way because he was bound by the chains of love. Stop talking and just fucking listen. He couldn’t take those distant eyes anymore and he had to go his separate way. And I don’t fucking blame him. We’ve all been there.”

“Well, you’ve certainly been there. Steve might have been a tortured soul, but it sounds to me that he dated a lot of psychotic women. And didn’t the keyboardist Jonathan Cain write this song?” I asked, knowing full well that the question would irritate Casey.

“What the fuck are you talking about? Steve wrote all the major hits for Journey. Sure, he might have collaborated with Cain and Schon on a few songs, but it was all Perry. These songs came from his soul. He was a lover. He gave so much and took so little. And these cunts threw it in his face. Fuck them. I’m with Steve on this.”

I almost forgot that I was DJing, and without bothering to announce Barbie’s second song, I faded into Journey’s “Send Her My Love.” She paid no attention and continued her uncoordinated, spastic dance routine around the pole. I looked over at Casey and noticed that he was pensively staring at the ceiling, his right hand gripping the bottom of his chin.

“You know, I’ve always found this song to be profoundly agonizing. It really affects the listener at his core,” I said.

Casey ceased his rumination. “I know what you mean. Steve feels deep remorse for his actions. But his actions were inevitable. It’s not like he never loved her. I mean, what’d you expect him to do? He’s on the road so many nights a year. How could he adequately love a woman and raise a family with her? He tried, but ultimately, he had to let her go.”

“You’re right, man. He gave what he could, but he knew in his heart that it would never be enough. But he still cared.”

“Yes, that he did.” Casey sighed deeply, and we listened to the rest of the song in silence.

I would’ve continued to deconstruct Journey songs with Casey had I not looked at the soundboard and realized that Barbie had been dancing for almost ten minutes. I don’t think she even noticed. In fact, I had to announce twice that it was time for her to leave the stage before she finally stepped down. Her next set consisted of Poison’s “Unskinny Bop” followed by Night Ranger’s “Sister Christian.” Casey looked insulted by my choice for her second song.

“I’m shocked that you played this. I’m no prude, but a song about rape has no place in a strip club,” he said accusingly.

“You’re insane. ‘Sister Christian’ is about a young girl’s coming of age.”

“Pay attention to the lyrics for a second and you’ll see that this song is about raping nuns.”

We both watched Barbie clutch the pole tightly and move her hips in stark opposition to the tempo of the song. “That girl really has no sense of rhythm. I think she dances like that on purpose.”

Casey ignored me and pointed his index finger in the air. “Listen to this part of the song.” He looked over at me assuredly. “Her time has come? See, the nun clearly has no choice. Her time has come to be gang-raped by the sex-addicted members of Night Ranger. They’re probably intoxicated or high on coke and think it’s a good idea to rape a nun. It’s hard for me to listen to this. Disgusting. Make it stop.”

Though I thought he was reaching on this one, I faded the song out and put on the next dancer. For Barbie’s next few sets, I emptied my cache of stripper torture music: Aerosmith’s “Dude (Looks Like a Lady)” followed by The Butthole Surfers’ “Lady Sniff”; WASP’s “Animal (Fuck Like a Beast)” and Neil Diamond’s “Forever in Blue Jeans”; Slayer’s “Kill Again” paired with Gwar’s “Sick of You”; Cannibal Corpse’s “Meat Hook Sodomy” and Warren Zevon’s “Werewolves of London”; Willie D’s “Bald Headed Hoes” followed by 2 Live Crew’s “Face Down Ass Up.”

But it didn’t bother her whatsoever. She paid no attention to the music I was playing and would walk off the stage without even glancing in the direction of the DJ booth. I was at wit’s end. I had to unleash the nuclear bomb. The next set that I had chosen for Barbie would infuriate even the most tolerant of strippers. When she walked onstage for the final time that shift, I played my ultimate non-tipper set: Digital Underground’s “The Humpty Dance” followed by Color Me Badd’s “I Wanna Sex You Up.” I have never met a stripper who didn’t tip after being forced to dance to “The Humpty Dance” two or three times in a night. But, alas, my efforts fell flat. These songs didn’t seem to faze her in the least bit. I was about to relent and accept the fact that I was never going to receive a tip from her, when a young Mexican dancer named Heaven approached the booth and asked:

“Why you playing all this wack shit for her? It won’t do no good.”

“What do you mean? These songs aren’t wack.”

“You trippin’ if you think ‘Humpty Dance’ ain’t wack. But it don’ matter what you play cuz she can’t hear it.”

“She can’t hear it? Should I turn it up?”

“Still won’t do no good. She’s deaf. She can’t hear shit.”

“She’s deaf?” The realization hit me like a punch in the groin. “How do you know she’s deaf?”

“I seen her talking to her man using sign language and shit.” Heaven moved her fingers in the air pretending that she was signing a message to me. “I was telling you to eat a dick in sign language.”

“Nice. Thanks for that.” All of a sudden, I felt truly remorseful for playing all those songs for her. Though it made perfect sense, I had no idea that she was deaf. “Well, I’ve worked with her five or six times, and she still hasn’t tipped me or any other DJ at the club.”

“She hasn’t tipped you?” Heaven asked with more than a hint of incredulity. “She don’ make no money. The bitch is deaf. She can’t hustle cuz the customers don’t know sign language. Damn.”

“I suppose you’re right. Now I feel like a dick.”

“You should.” She shook her head and sauntered back to the dressing room, moving her index finger back and forth in a “tick-tick” motion while mouthing the chorus of the song.

When the shift ended, I didn’t bother waiting at the door to be tipped out by Barbie. I felt that I should apologize for mocking her, but since I didn’t know sign language, it wouldn’t have made much of a difference. I attempted to rationalize my behavior by acknowledging the fact that she didn’t actually hear the music that I was playing for her, but that didn’t lighten my conscience. On her way out, she walked by the booth, but I avoided her and pretended to be busy packing up my CD cases. I never saw her again after that shift. I’d like to think that she found a job at a strip club for the disabled where she’d have an equal opportunity to make as much money as the other dancers, but, sadly, a club like that doesn’t exist.

Yo Shaolin sling, come on raise the sword

I got fudge in my mouth, they say that'll let your own wrist
M.C.'s fall and they can't get up
I do the rap, why, yes that's a cut
Huh, right back at you, niggas better run
Or feel the force of the Hell Razah's gun
Gupao, gupao, my style is wild chopped in the Shao'
Zoo, aow, aow, I can flip it acapello
I'll make you jelly like Jell-O, figaro, figaro
Who would think that the Just would go opera
You could ask Hammer, he know my shit is popper
Stopper, stopper, like Cuddy Ranks

223,Objects In The Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than...,"[Verse 1]
The skies were pure and the fields were green
And the sun was brighter than it's ever been
When I grew up with my best friend, Kenny
We were close as any brothers that you ever knew

It was always summer and the future called
We were ready for adventures and we wanted them all
And there was so much left to dream
And so much time to make it real

But I can still recall the sting of all the tears when he was gone
They say he crashed and burned, I know I'll never learn
Why any boy should die so young

We were racing; we were soldiers of fortune
We got in trouble but we sure got around
There are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark
I think he's right behind me now, and he's gaining ground

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

[Hook (X2)]
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are

[Verse 2]
And when the sun descended and the night arose
I heard my father cursing everyone he knows
He was dangerous and drunk and defeated
And corroded by failure and envy and hate

There were endless winters and the dreams would freeze
Nowhere to hide and no leaves on the trees
And my father's eyes were blank
As he hit me again and again and again

I know I still believe he'd never let me leave
I had to run away alone
So many threats and fears, so many wasted years
Before my life became my own

And though the nightmares should be over
Some of the terrors are still intact
I'll hear that ugly, coarse, and violent voice
And then he grabs me from behind, and then he pulls me back

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

[Hook]
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are

[Instrumental solo]

[Verse 3]
There was a beauty living on the edge of town
She always put the top up and the hammer down
And she taught me everything I'll ever know
About the mystery and the muscle of love

The stars would glimmer and the moon would glow
I'm in the back seat with my Julie like Romeo
And the signs along the highway all said
""Caution! Kids at play!""

Those were the rites of spring and we did everything;
There was salvation every night
We got our dreams reborn and our upholstery torn
But everything we tried was right

She used her body just like a bandage
She use my body just like a wound
I'll probably never know where she disappeared
But I can see rising up out of the back seat now
Just like an angel rising out of a tomb

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

[X9]
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are

What is it about you that makes me keep my feelings hid
I wish I could tell you, but the words can't be found
Whenever you come around

Oh I try to speak but the words won't come

227,Regular Thang,"Persecutions in England During the Reign of Queen MaryThe premature death of that celebrated young monarch, Edward VI, occasioned the most extraordinary and wonderful occurrences, which had ever existed from the times of our blessed Lord and Savior's incarnation in human shape. This melancholy event became speedily a subject of general regret. The succession to the British throne was soon made a matter of contention; and the scenes which ensued were a demonstration of the serious affliction in which the kingdom was involved. As his loss to the nation was more and more unfolded, the remembrance of his government was more and more the basis of grateful recollection. The very awful prospect, which was soon presented to the friends of Edward's administration, under the direction of his counsellors and servants, was a contemplation which the reflecting mind was compelled to regard with most alarming apprehensions. The rapid approaches which were made towards a total reversion of the proceedings of the young king's reign, denoted the advances which were thereby represented to an entire resolution in the management of public affairs both in Church and state.

Alarmed for the condition in which the kingdom was likely to be involved by the king's death, an endeavor to prevent the consequences, which were but too plainly foreseen, was productive of the most serious and fatal effects. The king, in his long and lingering affliction, was induced to make a will, by which he bequeathed the English crown to Lady Jane, the daughter of the duke of Suffolk, who had been married to Lord Guilford, the son of the duke of Northumberland, and was the granddaughter of the second sister of King Henry, by Charles, duke of Suffolk. By this will, the succession of Mary and Elizabeth, his two sisters, was entirely superseded, from an apprehension of the returning system of popery; and the king's council, with the chief of the nobility, the lord-mayor of the city of London, and almost all the judges and the principal lawyers of the realm, subscribed their names to this regulation, as a sanction to the measure. Lord Chief Justice Hale, though a true Protestant and an upright judge, alone declined to unite his name in favor of the Lady Jane, because he had already signified his opinion that Mary was entitled to assume the reins of government. Others objected to Mary's being placed on the throne, on account of their fears that she might marry a foreigner, and thereby bring the crown into considerable danger. Her partiality to popery also left little doubt on the minds of any, that she would be induced to revive the dormant interests of the pope, and change the religion which had been used both in the days of her father, King Henry, and in those of her brother Edward: for in all his time she had manifested the greatest stubbornness and inflexibility of temper, as must be obvious from her letter to the lords of the council, whereby she put in her claim to the crown, on her brother's decease.

When this happened, the nobles, who had associated to prevent Mary's succession, and had been instrumental in promoting, and, perhaps, advising the measures of Edward, speedily proceeded to proclaim Lady Jane Gray, to be queen of England, in the city of London and various other populous cities of the realm. Though young, she possessed talents of a very superior nature, and her improvements under a most excellent tutor had given her many very great advantages.

Her reign was of only five days' continuance, for Mary, having succeeded by false promises in obtaining the crown, speedily commenced the execution of her avowed intention of extirpating and burning every Protestant. She was crowned at Westminster in the usual form, and her elevation was the signal for the commencement of the bloody persecution which followed.

Having obtained the sword of authority, she was not sparing in its exercise. The supporters of Lady Jane Gray were destined to feel its force. The duke of Northumberland was the first who experienced her savage resentment. Within a month after his confinement in the Tower, he was condemned, and brought to the scaffold, to suffer as a traitor. From his varied crimes, resulting out of a sordid and inordinate ambition, he died unpitied and unlamented.

The changes, which followed with rapidity, unequivocally declared that the queen was disaffected to the present state of religion. Dr. Poynet was displaced to make room for Gardiner to be bishop of Winchester, to whom she also gave the important office of lord-chancellor. Dr. Ridley was dismissed from the see of London, and Bonne introduced. J. Story was put out of the bishopric of Chichester, to admit Dr. Day. J. Hooper was sent prisoner to the Fleet, and Dr. Heath put into the see of Worcestor. Miles Coverdale was also excluded from Exeter, and Dr. Vesie placed in that diocese. Dr. Tonstall was also promoted to the see of Durham. These things being marked and perceived, great heaviness and discomfort grew more and more to all good men's hearts; but to the wicked great rejoicing. They that could dissemble took no great care how the matter went; but such, whose consciences were joined with the truth, perceived already coals to be kindled, which after should be the destruction of many a true Christian.
The Words and Behavior of the Lady Jane upon the Scaffold The next victim was the amiable Lady Jane Gray, who, by her acceptance of the crown at the earnest solicitations of her friends, incurred the implacable resentment of the bloody Mary. When she first mounted the scaffold, she spoke to the specators in this manner: ""Good people, I am come hither to die, and by a law I am condemned to the same. The fact against the queen's highness was unlawful, and the consenting thereunto by me: but, touching the procurement and desire thereof by me, or on my behalf, I do wash my hands thereof in innocency before God, and the face of you, good Christian people, this day:"" and therewith she wrung her hands, wherein she had her book. Then said she, ""I pray you all, good Christian people, to bear me witness, that I die a good Christian woman, and that I do look to be saved by no other mean, but only by the mercy of God in the blood of His only Son Jesus Christ: and I confess that when I did know the Word of God, I neglected the same, loved myself and the world, and therefore this plague and punishment is happily and worthily happened unto me for my sins; and yet I thank God, that of His goodness He hath thus given me a time and a respite to repent. And now, good people, while I am alive, I pray you assist me with your prayers."" And then, kneeling down, she turned to Feckenham, saying, ""Shall I say this Psalm?"" and he said, ""Yea."" Then she said the Psalm of Miserere mei Deus, in English, in a most devout manner throughout to the end; and then she stood up, and gave her maid, Mrs. Ellen, her gloves and handkerchief, and her book to Mr. Bruges; and then she untied he gown, and the executioner pressed upon her to help her off with it: but she, desiring him to let her alone, turned towards her two gentlewomen, who helped her off therewith, and also with her frowes, paaft, and neckerchief, giving to her a fair handkerchief to put about her eyes.

Then the executioner kneeled down, and asked her forgiveness, whom she forgave most willingly. Then he desired her to stand upon the straw, which doing, she saw the block. Then she said, ""I pray you, despatch me quickly."" Then she kneeled down, saying, ""Will you take it off before I lay me down?"" And the executioner said, ""No, madam."" Then she tied a handkerchief about her eyes, and feeling for the block, she said, ""What shall I do? Where is it? Where is it?"" One of the standers-by guiding her therunto, she laid her head upon the block, and then stretched forth her body, and said, ""Lord, into Thy hands I commend my spirit;"" and so finished her life, in the year of our Lord 1554, the twelfth day of February, about the seventeenth year of her age.

Thus died Lady Jane; and on the same day Lord Guilford, her husband, one of the duke of Northumberland's sons, was likewise beheaded, two innocents in comparison with them that sat upon them. For they were both very young, and ignorantly accepted that which others had contrived, and by open proclamation consented to take from others, and give to them.

Touching the condemnation of this pious lady, it is to be noted that Judge Morgan, who gave sentence against her, soon after he had condemned her, fell mad, and in his raving cried out continually to have the Lady Jane taken away from him, and so he ended his life.

On the twenty-first day of the same month, Henry, duke of Suffolk, was beheaded on Tower-hill, the fourth day after his condemnation: about which time many gentlemen and yeomen were condemned, whereof some were executed at London, and some in the country. In the number of whom was Lord Thomas Gray, brother to the said duke, being apprehended not long after in North Wales, and executed for the same. Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, also, very narrowly escaped.
John Rogers, Vicar of St. Sepulchre's, and Reader of St. Paul's, LondonJohn Rogers was educated at Cambridge, and was afterward many years chaplain to the merchant adventurers at Antwerp in Brabant. Here he met with the celebrated martyr William Tyndale, and Miles Coverdale, both voluntary exiles from their country for their aversion to popish superstition and idolatry. They were the instruments of his conversion; and he united with them in that translation of the Bible into English, entitled ""The Translation of Thomas Matthew."" From the Scriptures he knew that unlawful vows may be lawfully broken; hence he married, and removed to Wittenberg in Saxony, for the improvement of learning; and he there learned the Dutch language, and received the charge of a congregation, which he faithfully executed for many years. On King Edward's accession, he left Saxony to promote the work of reformation in England; and, after some time, Nicholas Ridley, then bishop of London, gave him a prebend in St. Paul's Cathedral, and the dean and chapter appointed him reader of the divinity lesson there. Here he continued until Queen Mary's succession to the throne, when the Gospel and true religion were banished, and the Antichrist of Rome, with his superstition and idolatry, introduced.

The circumstance of Mr. Rogers having preached at Paul's cross, after Queen Mary arrived at the Tower, has been already stated. He confirmed in his sermon the true doctrine taught in King Edward's time, and exhorted the people to beware of the pestilence of popery, idolatry, and superstition. For this he was called to account, but so ably defended himself that, for that time, he was dismissed. The proclamation of the queen, however, to prohibit true preaching, gave his enemies a new handle against him. Hence he was again summoned before the council, and commanded to keep his house. He did so, though he might have escaped; and though he perceived the state of the true religion to be desperate. Heknew he could not want a living in Germany; and he could not forget a wife and ten children, and to seek means to succor them. But all these things were insufficient to induce him to depart, and, when once called to answer in Christ's cause, he stoutly defended it, and hazarded his life for that purpose.

After long imprisonment in his own house, the restless Bonner, bishop of London, caused him to be committed to Newgate, there to be lodged among thieves and murderers.

After Mr. Rogers had been long and straitly imprisoned, and lodged in Newgate among thieves, often examined, and very uncharitably entreated, and at length unjustly and most cruelly condemned by Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, the fourth day of February, in the year of our Lord 1555, being Monday in the morning, he was suddenly warned by the keeper of Newgate's wife, to prepare himself for the fire; who, being then sound asleep, could scarce be awaked. At length being raised and awaked, and bid to make haste, then said he, ""IKf it be so, I need not tie my points."" And so was had down, first to bishop Bonner to be degraded: which being done, he craved of Bonner but one petition; and Bonner asked what that should be. Mr. Rogers replied that he might speak a few words with his wife before his burning, but that could not be obtained of him.

When the time came that he should be brought out of Newgate to Smithfield, the place of his execution, Mr. Woodroofe, one of the sheriffs, first came to Mr. Rogers, and asked him if he would revoke his abominable doctrine, and the evil opinion of the Sacrament of the altar. Mr. Rogers answered, ""That which I have preached I will seal with my blood."" Then Mr. Woodroofe said, ""Thou art an heretic."" ""That shall be known,"" quoth Mr. Rogers, ""at the Day of Judgment."" ""Well,"" said Mr. Woodroofe, ""I will never pray for thee."" ""But I will pray for you,"" said Mr. Rogers; and so was brought the same day, the fourth of February, by the sheriffs, towards Smithfield, saying the Psalm Miserere by the way, all the people wonderfully rejoicing at his constancy; with great praises and thanks to God for the same. And there in the presence of Mr. Rochester, comptroller of the queen's household, Sir Richard Southwell, both the sheriffs, and a great number of people, he was burnt to ashes, washing his hands in the flame as he was burning. A little before his burning, his pardon was brought, if he would have recanted; but he utterly refused it. He was the first martyr of all the blessed company that suffered in Queen Mary's time that gave the first adventure upon the fire. His wife and children, being eleven in number, ten able to go, and one sucking at her breast, met him by the way, as he went towards Smithfield. TGhis sorrowful sight of his own flesh and blood could nothing move him, but that he constantly and cheerfully took his death with wonderful patience, in the defence and quarrel of the Gospel of Christ.""
The Rev. Lawrence SaundersMr. Saunders, after passing some time in the school of Eaton, was chosen to go to King's College in Cambridge, where he continued three years, and profited in knowledge and learning very much for that time. Shortly after he quitted the university, and went to his parents, but soon returned to Cambridge again to his study, where he began to add to the knowledge of the Latin, the study of the Greek and Hebrew tongues, and gave himself up to the study of the Holy Scriptures, the better to qualify himself for the office of preacher.

In the beginning of King Edward's reign, when God's true religion was introduced, after license obtained, he began to preach, and was so well liked of them who then had authority that they appointed him to read a divinity lecture in the College of Forthringham. The College of Fothringham being dissolved he was placed to be a reader in the minster at Litchfield. After a certain space, he departed from Litchfield to a benefice in Leicestershire, called Church-langton, where he held a residence, taught diligently, and kept a liberal house. Thence he was orderly called to take a benefice in the city of London, namely, All-hallows in Bread-street. After this he preached at Northhampton, nothing meddling with the state, but boldly uttering his conscience against the popish doctrines which were likely to spring up again in England, as a just plague for the little love which the English nation then bore to the blessed Word of God, which had been so plentifully offered unto them.

The queen's party who were there, and heard him, were highly displeased with him for his sermon, and for it kept him among them as a prisoner. But partly for love of his brethren and friends, who were chief actors for the queen among them, and partly because there was no law broken by hbis preaching, they dismissed him.

Some of his friends, perceiving such fearful menacing, counselled him to fly out of the realm, which he refused to do. But seeing he was with violence kept from doing good in that place, he returned towards London, to visit his flock.

In the afternoon of Sunday, October 15, 1554, as he was reading in his church to exhort his people, the bishop of London interrupted him, by sending an officer for him.

His treason and sedition the bishop's charity was content to let slip until another time, but a heretic he meant to prove him, and all those, he said, who taught and believed that the administration of the Sacraments, and all orders of the Church, are the most pure, which come the nearest to the order of the primitive Church.

After much talk concerning this matter, the bishop desired him to write what he believed of transubstantiation. Lawrence Saunders did so, saying, ""My Lord, you seek my blood, and you shall have it: I pray God that you may be so baptized in it that you may ever after loathe blood-sucking, and become a better man."" Upon being closely charged with contumacy, the severe replies of Mr. Saunders to the bishop, (who had before, to get the favor of Henry VIII written and set forth in print, a book of true obedience, wherein he had openly declared Queen Mary to be a bastard) so irritated him that he exclaimed, ""Carry away this frenzied fool to prison.""

After this good and faithful martyr had been kept in prison one year and a quarter, the bishops at length called him, as they did his fellow-prisoners, openly to be examined before the queen's council.

His examination being ended, the officers led him out of the place, and stayed until the rest of his fellow-prisoners were likewise examined, that they might lead them all together to prison.

After his excommunication and delivery over to the secular power, he was brought by the sheriff of London to the Compter, a prison in his own parish of Bread-street, at which he rejoiced greatly, both because he found there a fellow-prisoner, Mr. Cardmaker, with whom he had much Christian and comfortable discourse; and because out of prison, as before in his pulpit, he might have an opportunity of preaching to his parishioners. On the fourth of February, Bonner, bishop of London, came to the prison to degrade him; the day following, in the morning the sheriff of London delivered him to certain of the queen's guard, who were appointed to carry him to the city of Coventry, there to be burnt.

When they had arrived at Coventry, a poor shoemaker, who used to serve him with shoes, came to him, and said, ""O my good master, God strengthen and comfort you."" ""Good shoemaker,"" Mr. Saunders replied, ""I desire thee to pray for me, for I am the most unfit man for this high office, that ever was appointed to it; but my gracious God and dear Father is able to make me strong enough."" The next day, being the eighth of February, 1555, he was led to the place of execution, in the park, without the city. He went in an old gown and a shirt, barefooted, and oftentimes fell flat on the ground, and prayed. When he was come to nigh the place, the officer, appointed to see the execution done, said to Mr. Saunders that he was one of them who marred the queen's realm, but if he would recant, there was pardon for him. ""Not I,"" replied the holy martyr, ""but such as you have injured the realm. The blessed Gospel of Christ is what I hold; that do I believe, that have I taught, and that will I never revoke!"" Mr. Saunders then slowly moved towards the fire, sank to the earth and prayed; he then rose up, embraced the stake, and frequently said, ""Welcome, thou cross of Christ! welcome everlasting life!"" Fire was then put to the fagots, and, he was overwhelmed by the dreadful flames, and sweetly slept in the Lord Jesus.
The History, Imprisonment, and Examination of Mr. John Hooper, Bishop of Worcester and GloucesterJohn Hooper, student and graduate in the University of Oxford, was stirred with such fervent desire to the love and knowledge of the Scriptures that he was compelled to move from thence, and was retained in the house of Sir Thomas Arundel, as his steward, until Sir Thomas had intelligence of his opinions and religion, which he in no case did favor, though he exceedingly favored his person and condition and wished to be his friend. Mr. Hooper now prudently left Sir Thomas' house and arrived at Paris, but in a short time returned to England, and was retained by Mr. Sentlow, until the time that he was again molested and sought for, when he passed through France to the higher parts of Germany; where, commencing acquaintance with learned men, he was by them free and lovingly entertained, both at Basel, and especially at Zurich, by Mr. Bullinger, who was his singular friend; here also he married his wife, who was a Burgonian, and applied very studiously to the Hebrew tongue.

At length, when God saw it good to stay the bloody time of the six articles, and to give us King Edward to reign over this realm, with some peace and rest unto the Church, amongst many other English exiles, who then repaired homeward, Mr. Hooper also, moved in conscience, thought not to absent himself, but seeing such a time and occasion, offered to help forward the Lord's work, to the uttermost of his ability.

When Mr. Hooper had taken his farewell of Mr. Bullinger, and his friends in Zurich, he repaired again to England in the reign of King Edward VI, and coming to London, used continually to preach, most times twice, or at least once a day.

In his sermons, according to his accustomed manner, he corrected sin, and sharply inveighed against the iniquity of the world and the corrupt abuses of the Church. The people in great flocks and companies daily came to hear his voice, as the most melodious sound and tune of Orpheus' harp, insomuch, that oftentimes when he was preaching, the church would be so full that none could enter farther than the doors thereof. In his doctrine he was earnest, in tongue eloquent, in the Scriptures perfect, in pains indefatigable, in his life exemplary.

Having preached before the king's majesty, he was soon after made bishop of Gloucester. In that office he continued two years, and behaved himself so well that his very enemies could find no fault with him, and after that he was made bishop of Worcester.

Dr. Hooper executed the office of a most careful and vigilant pastor, for the space of two years and more, as long as the state of religion in King Edward's time was sound and flourishing.

After he had been cited to appear before Bonner and Dr. Heath, he was led to the Council, accused falsely of owing the queen money, and in the next year, 1554, he wrote an account of his severe treatment during near eighteen months' confinement in the Fleet, and after his third examination, January 28, 1555, at St. Mary Overy's, he, with the Rev. Mr. Rogers, was conducted to the Compter in Southwark, there to remain until the next day at nine o'clock, to see whether they would recant. ""Come, Brother Rogers,"" said Dr. Hooper, ""must we two take this matter first in hand, and begin to fry in these fagots?"" ""Yes, Doctor,"" said Mr. Rogers, ""by God's grace."" ""Doubt not,"" said Dr. Hooper, ""but God will give us strength;"" and the people so applauded their constancy that they had much ado to pass.

January 29, Bishop Hooper was degraded and condemned, and the Rev. Mr. Rogers was treated in like manner. At dark, Dr. Hooper was led through the city to Newgate; notwithstanding this secrecy, many people came forth to their doors with lights, and saluted him, praising God for his constancy.

During the few days he was in Newgate, he was frequently visited by Bonner and others, but without avail. As Christ was tempted, so they tempted him, and then maliciously reported that he had recanted. The place of his martyrdom being fixed at Gloucester, he rejoiced very much, lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, and praising God that he saw it good to send him among the people over whom he was pastor, there to confirm with his death the truth which he had before taught them.

On February 7, he came to Gloucester, about five o'clock, and lodged at one Ingram's house. After his first sleep, he continued in prayer ujntil morning; and all the day, except a little time at his meals, and when conversing such as the guard kindly permitted to speak to him, he spent in prayer.

Sir Anthony Kingston, at one time Dr. Hooper's good friend, was appointed by the queen's letters to attend at his execution. As soon as he saw the bishop he burst into tears. WIth tender entreaties he exhorted him to live. ""True it is,"" said the bishop, ""that death is bitter, and life is sweet; but alas! consider that the death to come is more bitter, and the life to come is more sweet.""

The same day a blind boy obtained leave to be brought into Dr. Hooper's presence. The same boy, not long before, had suffered imprisonment at Gloucester for confessing the truth. ""Ah! poor boy,"" said the bishop, ""though God hath taken from thee thy outward sight, for what reason He best knoweth, yet He hath endued thy soul with the eye of knowledge and of faith. God give thee grace continually to pray unto Him, that thou lose not that sight, for then wouldst thou indeed be blind both in body and soul.""

When the mayor waited upon him preparatory to his execution, he expressed his perfect obedience, and only requested that a quick fire might terminate his torments. After he had got up in the morning, he desired that no man should be suffered to come into the chamber, that he might be solitary until the hour of execution.

About eight o'clock, on February 9, 1555, he was led forth, and many thousand persons were collected, as it was market-day. All the way, being straitly charged not to speak, and beholding the people, who mourned bitterly for him, he would sometimes lift up his eyes towards heaven, and look very cheerfully upon such as he knew: and he was never known, during the time of his being among them, to look with so cheerful and ruddy a countenance as he did at that time. When he came to the place appointed where he should die, he smilingly beheld the stake and preparation made for him, which was near unto the great elm tree over against the college of priests, where he used to preach.

Now, after he had entered into prayer, a box was brought and laid before him upon a stool, with his pardon from the queen, if he would turn. At the sight whereof he cried, ""If you love my soul, away with it!"" The box being taken away, Lord Chandois said, ""Seeing there is no remedy; despatch him quickly.""

Command was now given that the fire should be kindled. But because there were not more green fagots than two horses could carry, it kindled not speedily, and was a pretty while also before it took the reeds upon the fagots. At length it burned about him, but the wind having full strength at that place, and being a lowering cold morning, it blew the flame from him, so that he was in a manner little more than touched by the fire.

Within a space after, a few dry fagots were brought, and a new fire kindled with fagots, (for there were no more reeds) and those burned at the nether parts, but had small power above, because of the wind, saving that it burnt his hair and scorched his skin a little. In the time of which fire, even as at the first flame, he prayed, saying mildly, and not very loud, but as one without pain, ""O Jesus, Son of David, have mercy upon me, and receive my soul!"" After the second fire was spent, he wiped both his eyes with his hands, and beholding the people, he said with an indifferent, loud voice, ""For God's love, good people, let me have more fire!"" and all this while his nether parts did burn; but the fagots were so few that the flame only singed his upper parts.

The third fire was kindled within a while after, which was more extreme than the other two. In this fire he prayed with a loud voice, ""Lord Jesus, have mercy upon me! Lord Jesus receive my spirit!"" And these were the last words he was heard to utter. But when he was black in the mouth, and his tongue so swollen that he could not speak, yet his lips went until they were shrunk to the gums: and he knocked his breast with his hands until one of his arms fell off, and then knocked still with the other, while the fat, water, and blood dropped out at his fingers' ends, until by renewing the fire, his strength was gone, and his hand clave fast in knocking to the iron upon his breast. Then immediately bowing forwards, he yielded up his spirit.

Thus was he three quarters of an hour or more in the fire.

Even as a lamb, patiently he abode the extremity thereof, neither moving forwards, backwards, nor to any side; but he died as quietly as a child in his bed. And he now reigneth, I doubt not, as a blessed martyr in the joys of heaven, prepared for the faithful in Christ before the foundations of the world; for whose constancy all Christians are bound to praise God.
The Life and Conduct of Dr. Rowland Taylor of HadleyDr. Rowland Taylor, vicar of Hadley, in Suffolk, was a man of eminent learning, and had been admitted to the degree of doctor of the civil and canon law.

His attachment to the pure and uncorrupted principles of Christianity recommended him to the favor and friendship of Dr. Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he lived a considerable time, until through his interest he obtained the living at Hadley.

Not only was his word a preaching unto them, but all his life and conversation was an example of unfeigned Christian life and true holiness. He was void of all pride, humble and meek as any child; so that none were so poor but they might boldly, as unto their father, resort unto him; neither was his lowliness childish or fearful, but, as occasion, time, and place required, he would be stout in rebuking the sinful and evildoers; so that none was so rich but he would tell them plainly his fault, with such earnest and grave rebukes as became a good curate and pastor. He was a man very mild, void of all rancor, grudge or evil will; ready to do good to all men; readily forgiving his enemies; and never sought to do evil to any.

To the poor that were blind, lame, sick, bedrid, or that had many children, he was a very father, a careful patron, and diligent provider, insomuch that he caused the parishioners to make a general provision for them; and he himself (beside the continual relief that they always found at his house) gave an honest portion yearly to the common almsbox. His wife also was an honest, discreet, and sober matron, and his children well nurtured, brought up in the fear of God and good learning.

He was a good salt of the earth, savorly biting the corrupt manners of evil men; a light in God's house, set upon a candlestick for all good men to imitate and follow.

Thus continued this good shepherd among his flock, governing and leadning them through the wilderness of this wicked world, all the days of the most innocent and holy king of blessed memory, Edward VI. But on his demise, and the succession of Queen Mary to the throne, he escaped not the cloud that burst on so many besdie; for two of his parishioners, Foster, an attorney, and Clark, a tradesman, out of blind zeal, resolved that Mass should be celebrated, in all its superstitious forms, in the parish church of Hadley, on Monday before Easter. This Dr. Taylor, entering the church, strictly forbade; but Clark forced the Doctor out of the church, celebrated Mass, and immediately informed the lord-chancellor, bishop of Winchester of his behavior, who summoned him to appear, and answer the complaints that were alleged against him.

The doctor upon the receipt of the summons, cheerfully prepared to obey the same; and rejected the advice of his friends to fly beyond sea. When Gardiner saw Dr. Taylor, he, according to his common custom, reviled him. Dr. Taylor heard his abuse patiently, and when the bishop said, ""How darest thou look me in the face! knowest thou not who I am?"" Dr. Taylor replied, ""You are Dr. Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, and lord-chancellor, and yet but a mortal man. But if I should be afraid of your lordly looks, why fear ye not God, the Lord of us all? With what countenance will you appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and answer to your oath made first unto King Henry VIII, and afterward unto King Edward VI, his son?""

A long conversation ensued, in which Dr. Taylor was so piously collected and severe upon his antagonist, that he exclaimed:

""Thou art a blasphemous heretic! Thou indeed blasphemist the blessed Sacrament, (here he put off his cap) and speakest against the holy Mass, which is made a sacrifice for the quick and the dead."" The bishop afterward committed him into the king's bench.

When Dr. Taylor came there, he found the virtuous and vigilant preacher of God's Word, Mr. Bradford; who equally thanked God that He had provided him with such a comfortable fellow-prisoner; and they both together praised God, and continued in prayer, reading and exhorting one another.

After Dr. Taylor had lain some time in prison, he was cited to appear in the arches of Bow-church.

Dr. Taylor being condemned, was committed to the Clink, and the keepers were charged to treat him roughly; at night he was removed to the Poultry Compter.

When Dr. Taylor had lain in the Compter about a week on the fourth of February, Bonner came to degrade him, bringing with him such ornaments as appertained to the massing mummery; but the Doctor refused these trappings until they were forced upon him.

The night after he was degraded his wife came with John Hull, his servant, and his son Thomas, and were by the gentleness of the keepers permitted to sup with him.

After supper, walking up and down, he gave God thanks for His grace, that had given him strength to abide by His holy Word. With tears they prayed together, and kissed one another. Unto his son Thomas he gave a Latin book, containing the notable sayings of the old martyrs, and in the end of that he wrote his testament:

""I say to my wife, and to my children, The Lord gave you unto me, and the Lord hath taken me from you, and you from me: blessed be the name of the Lord! I believe that they are blessed which die in the Lord. God careth for sparrows, and for the hairs of our heads. I have ever found Him more faithful and favorable, than is any father or husband. Trust ye therefore in Him by the means of our dear Savior Christ's merits: believe, love, fear, and obey Him: pray to Him, for He hath promised to help. Count me not dead, for I shall certainly live, and never die. I go before, and you shall follow after, to our long home.""

On the morrow the sheriff of London with his officers came to the Compter by two o'clock in the morning, and brought forth Dr. Taylor; and without any light led him to the Woolsack, an inn without Aldgate. Dr. Taylor's wife, suspecting that her husband should that night be carried away, watched all night in St. Botolph's church-porch beside Aldgate, having her two children, the one named Elizabeth, of thirteen years of age (whom, being left without father or mother, Dr. Taylor had brought up of alms from three years old), the other named Mary, Dr. Taylor's own daughter.

Now, when the sheriff and his company came against St.

Botolph's church, Elizabeth cried, saying, ""O my dear father! mother, mother, here is my father led away."" Then his wife cried, ""Rowland, Rowland, where art thou?""-for it was a very dark morning, that the one could not well see the other. Dr. Taylor answered, ""Dear wife, I am here""; and stayed. The sheriff's men would have led him forth, but the sheriff said, ""Stay a little, masters, I pray you; and let him speak to his wife""; and so they stayed.

Then came she to him, and he took his daughter Mary in his arms; and he, his wife, and Elizabeth kneeled down and said the Lord's Prayer, at which sight the sheriff wept apace, and so did divers others of the company. After they had prayed, he rose up and kissed his wife, and shook her by the hand, and said, ""Farewell, my dear wife; be of good comfort, for I am quiet in my conscience. God shall stir up a father for my children.""

All the way Dr. Taylor was joyful and merry, as one that ccounted himself going to a most pleasant banquet or bridal. He spake many notable things to the sheriff and yeomen of the guard that conducted him, and often moved them to weep, through his much earnest calling upon them to repent, and to amend their evil and wicked living. Oftentimes also he caused them to wonder and rejoice, to see him so constant and steadfast, void of all fear, joyful in heart, and glad to die.

When Dr. Taylor had arrived at Aldham Common, the place where he should suffer, seeing a great multitude of people, he asked, ""What place is this, and what meaneth it that so much people are gathered hither?"" It was answered, ""It is Aldham Common, the place where you must suffer; and the people have come to look upon you."" Then he said, ""Thanked be God, I am even at home""; and he alighted from his horse and with both hands rent the hood from his head.

His head had been notched and clipped like as a man would clip a fool's; which cost the good bishop Bonner had bestowed upon him. But when the people saw his reverend and ancient face, with a long white beard, they burst out with weeping tears, and cried, saying: ""God save thee, good Dr. Taylor! Jesus Christ strengthen thee, and help thee! the Holy Ghost comfort thee!"" with such other like good wishes.

When he had prayed, he went to the stake and kissed it, and set himself into a pitch barrel, which they had put for him to stand in, and stood with his back upright against the stake, with his hands folded together, and his eyes towards heaven, and continually prayed.

They then bound him with the chains, and having set up the fagots, one Warwick cruelly cast a fagot at him, which struck him on his head, and cut his face, sot hat the blood ran down. Then said Dr. Taylor, ""O friend, I have harm enough; what needed that?""

Sir John Shelton standing by, as Dr. Taylor was speaking, and saying the Psalm Miserere in English, struck him on the lips:

""You knave,"" he said, ""speak Latin: I will make thee."" At last they kindled the fire; and Dr. Taylor holding up both his hands, calling upon God, and said, ""Merciful Father of heaven! for Jesus Christ, my Savior's sake, receive my soul into Thy hands!"" So he stood still without either crying or moving, with his hands folded together, until Soyce, with a halberd struck him on the head until his brains fell out, and the corpse fell down into the fire.

Thus rendered up this man of God his blessed soul into the hands of his merciful Father, and to his most dear Savior Jesus Christ, whom he most entirely loved, faithfully and earnestly preached, obediently followed in living, and constantly glorified in death.
Martyrdom of William HunterWilliam Hunter had been trained to the doctrines of the Reformation from his earliest youth, being descended from religious parents, who carefully instructed him in the principles of true religion.

Hunter, then nineteen years of age, refusing to receive the communion at Mass, was threatened to be brought before the bishop; to whom this valiant young martyr was conducted by a constable.

Bonner caused William to be brought into a chamber, where he began to reason with him, proimising him security and pardon if he would recant. Nay, he would have been content if he would have gone only to receive and to confession, but William would not do so for all the world.

Upon this the bishop commanded his men to put William in the stocks in his gate house, where he sat two days and nights, with a crust of brown bread and a cup of water only, which he did not touch.

At the two days' end, the bishop came to him, and finding him steadfast in the faith, sent him to the convict prison, and commanded the keeper to lay irons upon him as many as he could bear. He continued in prison three quarters of a year, during which time he had been before the bishop five times, besides the time when he was condemned in the consistory in St. Paul's, February 9, at which time his brother, Robert Hunter, was present.

Then the bishop, calling William, asked him if he would recant, and finding he was unchangeable, pronounced sentence upon him, that he should go from that place to Newgate for a time, and thence to Brentwood, there to be burned.

About a month afterward, William was sent down to Brentwood, where he was to be executed. On coming to the stake, he knelt down and read the Fifty-first Psalm, until he came to these words, ""The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise."" Steadfast in refusing the queen's pardon, if he would become an apostate, at length one Richard Ponde, a bailiff, came, and made the chain fast about him.

William now cast his psalter into his brother's hand, who said, ""William, think on the holy passion of Christ, and be not afraid of death."" ""Behold,"" answered William, ""I am not afraid."" Then he lifted up his hands to heaven, and said, ""Lord, Lord, Lord, receive my spirit;"" and casting down he head again into the smothering smoke, he yielded up his life for the truth, sealing it with his blood to the praise of God.
Dr. Robert FarrarThis worthy and learned prelate, the bishop of St. David's in Wales, having in the former reign, as well as since the accession of Mary, been remarkably zealous in promoting the reformed doctrines, and exploding the rrors of popish idolatry, was summoned, among others, before the persecuting bishop of Winchester, and other commissioners set apart for the abominable work of devastation and massacre.

His principal accusers and persecutors, on a charge of praemunire in the reign of Edward VI were George Constantine Walter, his servant; Thomas Young, chanter of the cathedral, afterward bishop of Bangor, etc. Dr. Farrar ably replied to the copies of information laid against him, consisting of fifty-six articles. The whole process of this trial was long and tedious. Delay succeeded delay, and after that Dr. Farrar had been long unjustly detained in custody under sureties, in the reign of King Edward, because he had been promoted by the duke of Somerset, whence after his fall he found fewer friends to support him against such as wanted his bishopric by the coming in of Queen Mary, he was accused and examined not for any matter of praemunire, but for his faith and doctrine; for which he was called before the bishop of Winchester with Bishop Hooper, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Bradford, Mr. Saunders, and others, February 4, 1555; on which day he would also with them have been condemned, but his condemnation was deferred, and he sent to prison again, where he continued until February 14, and then was sent into Wales to receive sentence. He was six times brought up before Henry Morgan, bishop of St. David's, who demanded if he would abjure; from which he zealously dissented, and appealed to Cardinal Pole; notwithstanding which, the bishop, proceeding in his rage, pronounced him a heretic excommunicate, and surrendered him to the secular power.

Dr. Farrar, being condemned and degraded, was not long after brought to the place of execution in the town of Carmathen, in the market-place of which, on the south side of the market-cross, March 30, 1555, being Saturday next before Passion Sunday, he most constantly sustained the torments of the fire.

Concerning his constancy, it is said that one Richard Jones, a knight's son, coming to Dr. Farrar a little before his death, seemed to lament the painfulness of the death he had to suffer; to whom the bishop answered that if he saw him once stir in the pains of his burning, he might then give no credit to his doctrine; and as he said, so did he maintain his promise, patiently standing without emotion, until one Richard Gravell with a staff struck him down.
Martyrdom of Rawlins WhiteRawlins White was by his calling and occupation a fisherman, living and continuing in the said trade for the space of twenty years at least, in the town of Cardiff, where he bore a very good name amongst his neighbors.

Though the good man was altogether unlearned, and withal very simple, yet it pleased God to remove him from error and idolatry to a knowledge of the truth, through the blessed Reformation in Edward's reign. He had his son taught to read English, and after the little boy could read pretty well, his father every night after supper, summer and winter, made the boy read a portion of the Holy Scriptures, and now and then a part of some other good book.

When he had continued in his profession the space of five years, King Edward died, upon whose decease Queen Mary succeeded and with her all kinds of superstition crept in. White was taken by the officers of the town, as a man suspected of heresy, brought before the Bishop Llandaff, and committed to prison in Chepstow, and at last removed to the castle of Cardiff, where he continued for the space of one whole year. Being brought before the bishop in his chapel, he counselled him by threats and promises. But as Rawlins would in no wise recant his opinions, the bishop told him plainly that he must proceed against him by law, and condemn him as a heretic.

Before they proceeded to this extremity, the bishop proposed that prayer should be said for his conversion. ""This,"" said White, ""is like a godly bishop, and if your request be godly and right, and you pray as you ought, no doubt God will hear you; pray you, therefore, to your God, and I will pray to my God."" After the bishop and his party had done praying, he asked Rawlins if he would now revoke. ""You find,"" said the latter, ""your prayer is not granted, for I remain the same; and God will strengthen me in support of this truth."" After this, the bishop tried what saying Mass would do; but Rawlins called all the people to witness that he did not bow down to the host. Mass being ended, Rawlins was called for again; to whom the bishop used many persuasions; but the blessed man continued so steadfast in his former profession that the bishop's discourse was to no purpose. The bishop now caused the definitive sentence to be read, which being ended, Rawlins was carried again to Cardiff, to a loathsome prison in the town, called Cockmarel, where he passed his time in prayer, and in the singing of Psalms. In about three weeks the order came from town for his execution.

When he came to the place, where his poor wife and children stood weeping, the sudden sight of them so pierced his heart, that the tears trickled down his face. Being come to the altar of his sacrifice, in going toward the stake, he fell down upon his knees, and kissed the ground; and in rising again, a little earth sticking on his face, he said these words. ""Earth unto earth, and dust unto dust; thou art my mother, and unto thee I shall return.""

When all things were ready, directly over against the stake, in the face of Rawlins White, there was a stand erected, whereon stepped up a priest, addressing himself to the people, but, as he spoke of the Romish doctrines of the Sacraments, Rawlins cried out, ""Ah! thou wicked hypocrite, dost thou presume to prove thy false doctrine by Scripture? Look in the text that followeth; did not Christ say, 'Do this in remembrance of me?'""

Then some that stood by cried out, ""Put fire! set on fire!"" which being done, the straw and reeds cast up a great and sudden flame. In which flame this good man bathed his hands so long, until such time as the sinews shrank, and the fat dropped away, saving that once he did, as it were, wipe his face with one of them. All this while, which was somewhat long, he cried with a loud voice, ""O Lord, receive my spirit!"" until he could not open his mouth. At last the extremity of the fire was so vehement against his legs that they were consumed almost before the rest of his body was hurt, which made the whole body fall over the chains into the fire sooner than it would have done. Thus died this good old man for his testimony of God's truth, and is now rewarded, no doubt, with the crown of eternal life.
The Rev. George MarshGeorge Marsh, born in the parish of Deane, in the county of Lancaster, received a good education and trade from his parents; about his twenty-fifth year he married, and lived, blessed with several children, on his farm until his wife died. He then went to study at Cambridge, and became the curate of Rev. Lawrence Saunders, in which duty he constantly and zealously set forth the truth of God's Word, and the false doctrines of the modern Antichrist.

Being confined by Dr. Coles, the bishop of Chester, within the precincts of his own house, he was dept from any intercourse with his friends during four months; his friends and mother, earnestly wished him to have flown from ""the wrath to come;"" but Mr. Marsh thought that such a step would ill agree with that profession he had during nine years openly made. He, however, secreted himself, but he had much struggling, and in secret prayer begged that God would direct him, through the advice of his best friends, for his own glory and to what was best. At length, determined by a letter he received, boldly to confess the faith of Christ, he took leave of his mother-in-law and other friends, recommending his children to their care and departed for Smethehills, whence he was, with others, conducted to Lathum, to undergo examination before the earl of Derby, Sir William Nores, Mr. Sherburn, the parson of Garpnal, and others. The various questions put to him he answered with a good conscience, but when Mr. Sherburn interrogated him upon his belief of the Sacrament of the altar, Mr. Marsh answered like a true Protestant that the essence of the bread and wine was not at all changed, hence, after receiving dreadful threats from some, and fair words from others, for his opinions, he was remanded to ward, where he lay two nights without any bed.

On Palm Sunday he underwent a second examination, and Mr.

Marsh much lamented that his fear should at all have induced him to prevaricate, and to seek his safety, as long as he did not openly deny Christ; and he again cried more earnestly to God for strength that he might not be overcome by the subtleties of those who strove to overrule the purity of his faith. He underwent three examinations before Dr. Coles, who, finding him steadfast in the Protestant faith, began to read his sentence; but he was interrupted by the chancellor, who prayed the bishop to stay before it was too late. The priest then prayed for Mr. Marsh, but the latter, upon being again solicited to recant, said he durst not deny his Savior Christ, lest he lose His everlasting mercy, and so obtain eternal death. The bishop then proceeded in the sentence. He was committed to a dark dungeon, and lay deprived of the consolation of any one (for all were afraid to relieve or communicate with him) until the day appointed came that he should suffer. The sheriffs of the city, Amry and Couper, with their officers, went to the north gate, and took out Mr. George Marsh, who walked all the way with the Book in his hand, looking upon the same, whence the people said, ""This man does not go to his death as a thief, nor as one that deserveth to die.""

When he came to the place of execution without the city, near Spittal=Boughton, Mr. Cawdry, deputy chamberlain of Chester, showed Mr. Marsh a writing under a great seal, saying that it was a pardon for him if he would recant. He answered that he would gladly accept the same did it not tend to pluck him from God.

After that, he began to speak to the people showing the cause of his death, and would have exhorted them to stick unto Christ, but one of the sheriffs prevented him. Kneeling down, he then said his prayers, put off his clothes unto his shirt, and was chained to the post, having a number of fagots under him, and a thing made like a firkin, with pitch and tar in it, over his head. The fire being unskilfully made, and the wind driving it in eddies, he suffered great extremity, which notwithstanding he bore with Christian fortitude.

When he had been a long time tormented in the fire without moving, having his flesh so broiled and puffed up that they who stood before him could not see the chain wherewith he was fastened, and therefore supposed that he had been dead, suddenly he spread abroad his arms, saying, ""Father of heaven have mercy upon me!"" and so yielded his spirit into the hands of the Lord. Upon this, many of the people said he was a martyr, and died gloriously patient. This caused the bishop shortly after to make a sermon in the cathedral church, and therein he affirmed, that the said 'Marsh was a heretic, burnt as such, and is a firebrand in hell.' Mr. Marsh suffered April 24, 1555.
William FlowerWilliam Flower, otherwise Branch, was born at Snow-hill, in the county of Cambridge, where he went to school some years, and then came to the abby of Ely. After he had remained a while he became a professed monk, was made a priest in the same house, and there celebrated and sang Mass. After that, by reason of a visitation, and certain injunctions by the authority of Henry VIII he took upon him the habit of a secular priest, and returned to Snow-hill, where he was born, and taught children about half a year.

He then went to Ludgate, in Suffolk, and served as a secular priest about a quarter of a year; from thence to Stoniland; at length to Tewksbury, where he married a wife, with whom he ever after faithfully and honestly continued. After marriage he resided at Tewksbury about two years, and thence went to Brosley, where he practiced physic and surgery; but departing from those parts he came to London, and finally settled at Lambeth, where he and his wife dwelt together. However, he was generally abroad, excepting once or twice in a month, to visit and see his wife. Being at home upon Easter Sunday morning, he came over the water from lambeth into St. Margaret's Church at Westminster; when seeing a priest, named John Celtham, administering and giving the Sacrament of the alter to the people, and being greatly offended in his conscience with the priest for the same, he struck and wounded him upon the head, and also upon the arm and hand, with his wood knife, the priest having at the same time in his hand a chalice with the consecrated host therein, which became sprinkled with blood.

Mr. Flower, for this injudicious zeal, was heavily ironed, and put into the gatehouse at Westminster; and afterward summoned before bishop Bonner and his ordinary, where the bishop, after he had sworn him upon a Book, ministered articles and interrogatories to him.

After examination, the bishop began to exhort him again to return to the unity of his mother the Catholic Church, with many fair promises. These Mr. Flower steadfastly rejecting, the bishop ordered him to appear in the same place in the afternoon, and in the meantime to consider well his former answer; but he, neither apologizing for having struck the priest, nor swerving from his faith, the bishop assigned him the next day, April 20, to receive sentence if he would not recant. The next morning, the bishop accordingly proceeded to the sentence, condemning and excommunicating him for a heretic, and after pronouncing him to be degraded, committed him to the secular power.

On April 24, St. Mark's eve, he was brought to the place of martyrdom, in St. Margaret's churchyard, Westminster, where the fact was committed: and there coming to the stake, he prayed to Almighty God, made a confession of his faith, and forgave all the world.

This done, his hand was held up against the stake, and struck off, his left hand being fastened behind him. Fire was then set to him, and he burning therein, cried with a loud voice, ""O Thou Son of God receive my soul!"" three times. His speech being now taken from him, he spoke no more, but notwithstanding he lifted up the stump with his other arm as long as he could.

Thus he endured the extremity of the fire, and was cruelly tortured, for the few fagots that were brought being insufficient to burn him they were compelled to strike him down into the fire, where lying along upon the ground, his lower part was consumed in the fire, whilst his upper part was little injured, his tongue moving in his mouth for a considerable time.
The Rev. John Cardmaker and John WarneMay 30, 1555, the Rev. John Cardmaker, otherwise called Taylor, prebendary of the Church of Wells, and John Warne, upholsterer, of St. John's, Walbrook, suffered together in Smithfield. Mr. Cardmaker, who first was an observant friar before the dissolution of the abbeys, afterward was a married minister, and in King Edward's time appointed to be a reader in St. Paul's; being apprehended in the beginning of Queen Mary's reign, with Dr. Barlow, bishop of Bath, he was brought to London, and put in the Fleet prison, King Edward's laws being yet in force. In Mary's reign, when brought before the bishop of Winchester, the latter offered them the queen's mercy, if they would recant.

Articles having been preferred against Mr. John Warne, he was examined upon them by Bonner, who earnestly exhorted him to recant his opinions, to whom he answered, ""I am persuaded that I am in the right opinion, and I see no cause to recant; for all the filthiness and idolatry lies in the Church of Rome.""

The bishop then, seeing that all his fair promises and terrible threatenings could not prevail, pronounced the definitive sentence of condemnation, and ordered May 30, 1555, for the execution of John Cardmaker and John Warne, who were brought by the sheriffs to Smithfield. Being come to the stake, the sheriffs called Mr. Cardmaker aside, and talked with him secretly, during which Mr. Warne prayed, was chained to the stake, and had wood and reeds set about him.

The people were greatly afflicted, thinking that Mr. Cardmaker would recant at the burning of Mr. Warne. At length Mr. Cardmaker departed from the sheriffs, and came towards the stake, knelt down, and made a long prayer in silence to himself. He then rose up, put off his clothes to his shirt, and went with a bold courage unto the stake and kissed it; and taking Mr. Warne by the hand, he heartily comforted him, and was bound to the stake, rejoicing. The people seeing this so suddenly done, contrary to their previous expectation, cried out, ""God be praised! the Lord strengthen thee, Cardmaker! the Lord Jesus receive thy spirit!"" And this continued while the executioner put fire to them, and both had passed through the fire to the blessed rest and peace among God's holy saints and martyrs, to enjoy the crown of triumph and victory prepared for the elect soldiers and warriors of Christ Jesus in His blessed Kingdom, to whom be glory and majesty forever. Amen.
John Simpson and John ArdeleyJohn Simpson and John Ardeley were condemned on the same day with Mr. Carmaker and John Warne, which was the twenty-fifth of May. They were shortly after sent down from London to Essex, where they were burnt in one day, John Simpson at Rochford, and John Ardeley at Railey, glorifying God in His beloved Son, and rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer.
Thomas Haukes, Thomas Watts, and Anne AskewThomas Haukes, with six others, was condemned on the ninth of February, 1555. In education he was erudite; in person, comely, and of good stature; in manners, a gentleman, and a sincere Christian. A little before death, several of Mr. Hauke's friends, terrified by the sharpness of the punishment he was going to suffer, privately desired that in the midst of the flames he should show them some token, whether the pains of burning were so great that a man might not collectedly endure it. This he promised to do; and it was agreed that if the rage of the pain might be suffered, then he should lift up his hands above his head towards heaven, before he gave up the ghost.

Not long after, Mr. Haukes was led away to the place appointed for slaughter by Lord Rich, and being come to the stake, mildly and patiently prepared himself for the fire, having a strong chain cast about his middle, with a multitude of people on every side compassing him about, unto whom after he had spoken many things, and poured out his soul unto God, the fire was kindled.

When he had continued long in it, and his speech was taken away by violence of the flame, his skin drawn together, and his fingers consumed with the fire, so that it was thought that he was gone, suddenly and contrary to all expectation, this good man being mindful of his promise, reached up his hands burning in flames over his head to the living God, and with great rejoicings as it seemed, struck or clapped them three times together. A great shout followed this wonderful circumstance, and then this blessed martyr of Christ, sinking down in the fire, gave up his spirit, June 10, 1555.

Thomas Watts, of Billerica, in Essex, of the diocese of London, was a linen draper. He had daily expected to be taken by God's adversaries, and this came to pass on the fifth of April, 1555, when he was brought before Lord Rich, and other commissioners at Chelmsford, and accused for not coming to the church.

Being consigned over to the bloody bishop, who gave him several hearings, and, as usual, many arguments, with much entreaty, that he would be a disciple of Antichrist, but his preaching availed not, and he resorted to his last revenge-that of condemnation.

At the stake, after he had kissed it, he spake to Lord Rich, charging him to repent, for the Lord would revenge his death. Thus did this good martyr offer his body to the fire, in defence of the true Gospel of the Savior.

Thomas Osmond, William Bamford, and Nicholas Chamberlain, all of the town of Coxhall, being sent up to be examined, Bonner, after several hearings, pronounced them obstinate heretics, and delivered them to the sheriffs, in whose custody they remained until they were delivered to the sheriff of Essex county, and by him were executed, Chamberlain at Colchester, the fourteenth of June; Thomas Osmond at Maningtree, and William Bamford, alias Butler, at Harwich, the fifteenth of June, 1555; all dying full of the glorious hope of immortality.

Then Wriotheseley, lord chancellor, offered Anne Askew the king's pardon if she would recant; who made this answer, that she came not thither to deny her Lord and Master. And thus the good Anne Askew, being compassed in with flames of fire, as a blessed sacrifice unto God, slept in the Lord, A.D. 1546, leaving behind her a singular example of Christian constancy for all men to follow.
Rev. John Bradford, and John Leaf, an ApprenticeRev. John Bradford was born at Manchester, in Lancashire; he was a good Latin scholar, and afterward became a servant of Sir John Harrington, knight.

He continued several years in an honest and thriving way; but the Lord had elected him to a better function. Hence he departed from his master, quitting the Temple, at London, for the University of Cambridge, to learn, by God's law, how to further the building of the Lord's temple. In a few years after, the university gave him the degree of master of arts, and he became a fellow of Pembroke Hall.

Martin Bucer first urged him to preach, and when he modestly doubted his ability, Bucer was wont to reply, ""If thou hast not fine wheat bread, yet give the poor people barley bread, or whatsoever else the Lord hath committed unto thee."" Dr. Ridley, that worthy bishop of London, and glorious martyr of Christ, first called him to take the degree of a deacon and gave him a prebend in his cathedral Church of St. Paul.

In this preaching office Mr. Bradford diligently labored for the space of three years. Sharply he reproved sin, sweetly he preached Christ crucified, ably he disproved heresies and errors, earnestly he persuaded to godly life. After the death of blessed King Edward VI Mr. Bradford still continued diligent in preaching, until he was suppressed by Queen Mary.

An act now followed of the blackest ingratitude, and at which a pagan would blush. It has been recited, that a tumult was occasioned by Mr. Bourne's (then bishop of Bath) preaching at St. Paul's Cross; the indignation of the people placed his life in imminent danger; indeed a dagger was thrown at him. In this situation he entreated Mr. Bradford, who stood behind him. to speak in his place, and assuage the tumult. The people welcomed Mr. Bradford, and the latter afterward kept close to him, that his presence might prevent the populace from renewing their assaults.

The same Sunday in the afternoon, Mr. Bradford preached at Bow Church in Cheapside, and reproved the people sharply for their seditious misdemeanor. Notwithstanding this conduct, within three days after, he was sent for to the Tower of London, where the queen then was, to appear before the Council. There he was charged with this act of saving Mr. Bourne, which was called seditious, and they also objected against him for preaching. Thus he was committed, first to the Tower, then to other prisons, and, after his condemnation, to the Poultry Compter, where he preached twice a day continually, unless sickness hindered him. Such as his credit with the keeper of the king's Bench, that he permitted him in an evening to visit a poor, sick person near the steel-yard, upon his promise to return in time, and in this he never failed.

The night before he was sent to Newgate, he was troubled in his sleep by foreboding dreams, that on Monday after he should be burned in Smithfield. In the afternoon the keeper's wife came up and announced this dreadful news to him, but in him it excited only thankfulness to God. At night half a dozen friends came, with whom he spent all the evening in prayer and godly exercises.

When he was removed to Newgate, a weeping crowd accompanied him, and a rumor having been spread that he was to suffer at four the next morning, an immense multitude attended. At nine o'clock Mr. Bradford was brought into Smithfield. The cruelty of the sheriff deserves notice; for his brother-in-law, Roger Beswick, having taken him by the hand as he passed, Mr. Woodroffe, with his staff, cut his head open.

Mr. Bradford, being come to the place, fell flat on the ground, and putting off his clothes unto the shirt, he went to the stake, and there suffered with a young man of twenty years of age, whose name was John Leaf, an apprentice to Mr. Humphrey Gaudy, tallow-chandler, of Christ-church, London. Upon Friday before Palm Sunday, he was committed to the Compter in Bread-street, and afterward examined and condemned by the bloody bishop.

It is reported of him, that, when the bill of his confession was read unto him, instead of pen, he took a pin, and pricking his hand, sprinkled the blood upon the said bill, desiring the reader thereof to show the bishop that he had sealed the same bill with his blood already.

They both ended this mortal life, July 12, 1555, like two lambs, without any alteration of their countenances, hoping to obtain that prize they had long run for; to which may Almighty God conduct us all, through the merits of Christ our Savior!

We shall conclude this article with mentioning that Mr.

Sheriff Woodroffe, it is said, within half a year after, was struck on the right side with a palsy, and for the space of eight years after, (until his dying day,) he was unable to turn himself in his bed; thus he became at last a fearful object to behold.

The day after Mr. Bradford and John Leaf suffered in Smithfield William Minge, priest, died in prison at Maidstone. With as great constancy and boldness he yielded up his life in prison, as if it had pleased God to have called him to suffer by fire, as other godly men had done before at the stake, and as he himself was ready to do, had it pleased God to have called him to this trial.
Rev. John Bland, Rev. John Frankesh, Nicholas Shetterden, and Humphrey MiddletonThese Christian persons were all burnt at Canterbury for the same cause. Frankesh and Bland were ministers and preachers of the Word of God, the one being parson of Adesham, and the other vicar of Rolvenden. Mr. Bland was cited to answer for his opposition to antichristianism, and underwent several examinations before Dr. Harpsfield, archdeacon of Canterbury, and finally on the twenty-fifth of June, 1555, again withstanding the power of the pope, he was condemned, and delivered to the secular arm. On the same day were condemned John Frankesh, Nicholas Shetterden, Humphrey Middleton, Thacker, and Crocker, of whom Thacker only recanted.

Being delivered to the secular power, Mr. Bland, with the three former, were all burnt together at Canterbury, July 12, 1555, at two several stakes, but in one fire, when they, in the sight of God and His angels, and before men, like true soldiers of Jesus Christ, gave a constant testimony to the truth of His holy Gospel.
Dirick Carver and John LaunderThe twenty-second of July, 1555, Dirick Carver, brewer, of Brighthelmstone, aged forty, was burnt at Lewes. And the day following John Launder, husbandman, aged twenty-five, of Godstone, Surrey, was burnt at Stening.

Dirick Carver was a man whom the Lord had blessed as well with temporal riches as with his spiritual treasures. At his coming into the town of Lewes to be burnt, the people called to him, beseeching God to strengthen him in the faith of Jesus Christ; and, as he came to the stake, he knelt down, and prayed earnestly. Then his Book was thrown into the barrel, and when he had stripped himself, he too, went into a barrel. As soon as he was in, he took the Book, and threw it among the people, upon which the sheriff commanded, in the name of the king and queen, on pain of death , to throw in the Book again. And immediately the holy martyr began to address the people. After he had prayed a while, he said, ""O Lord my God, Thou hast written, he that will not forsake wife, children, house, and every thing that he hath, and take up Thy cross and follow Thee, is not worthy of Thee! but Thou, Lord, knowest that I have forsaken all to come unto Thee. Lord, have mercy upon me, for unto Thee I commend my spirit! and my soul doth rejoice in Thee!"" These were the last words of this faithful servant of Christ before enduring the fire. And when the fire came to him, he cried, ""O Lord, have mercy upon me!"" and sprang up in the fire, calling upon the name of Jesus, until he gave up the ghost.

James Abbes. This young man wandered about to escape apprehension, but was at last informed against, and brought before the bishop of Norwich, who influenced him to recant; to secure him further in apostasy, the bishop afterward gave him a piece of money; but the interference of Providence is here remarkable. This bribe lay so heavily upon his conscience, that he returned, threw back the money, and repented of his conduct. Like Peter, he was contrite, steadfast in the faith, and sealed it with his blood at Bury, August 2, 1555, praising and glorifying God.
John Denley, John Newman, and Patrick PackinghamMr. Denley and Newman were returning one day to Maidstone, the place of their abode, when they were met by E. Tyrrel, Esq., a bigoted justice of the peace in Essex, and a cruel persecutor of the Protestants. He apprehended them merely on suspicion. On the fifth of July, 1555, they were condemned, and consigned to the sheriffs, who sent Mr. Denley to Uxbridge, where he perished, August eighth, 1555. While suffering in agony, and singing a Psalm, Dr. Story inhumanly ordered one of the tormentors to throw a fagot at him, which cut his face severely, caused him to cease singing, and to raise his hands to his face. Just as Dr. Story was remarking in jest that he had spoiled a good song, the pious martyr again changed, spread his hands abroad in the flames, and through Christ Jesus resigned his soul into the hands of his Maker.

Mr. Packingham suffered at the same town on the twenty-eigth of the same month.

Mr. Newman, pewterer, was burnt at Saffron Waldon, in Essex, August 31, for the same cause, and Richard Hook about the same time perished at Chichester.
W. Coker, W. Hooper, H. Laurence, R. Colliar, R. Wright and W. StereThese persons all of Kent, were examined at the same time with Mr. Bland and Shetterden, by Thornton, bishop of Dover, Dr. Harpsfield, and others. These six martyrs and witnesses of the truth were consigned to the flames in Canterbury, at the end of August, 1555.

Elizabeth Warne, widow of John Warne, upholsterer, martyr, was burnt at Stratford-le-bow, near London, at the end of August, 1555.

George Tankerfield, of London, cook, born at York, aged twenty-seven, in the reign of Edward VI had been a papist; but the cruelty of bloody Mary made him suspect the truth of those doctrines which were enforced by fire and torture. Tankerfield was imprisoned in Newgate about the end of February, 1555, and on August 26, at St. Alban's, he braved the excruciating fire, and joyfully died for the glory of his Redeemer.

Rev. Robert Smith was first in the service of Sir T. Smith, provost of Eton; and was afterward removed to Windsor, where he had a clerkship of ten pounds a year.

He was condemned, July 12, 1555, and suffered August 8, at Uxbridge. He doubted not but that God would give the spectators some token in support of his own cause; this actually happened; for, when he was nearly half burnt, and supposed to be dead, he suddenly rose up, moved the remaining parts of his arms and praised God, then, hanging over the fire, he sweetly slept in the Lord Jesus.

Mr. Stephen Harwood and Mr. Thomas Fust suffered about the same time with Smith and Tankerfield, with whom they were condemned. Mr. William Hale also, of Thorp, in Essex, was sent to Barnet, where about the same time he joined the ever-blessed company of martyrs.

George King, Thomas Leyes, and John Wade, falling sick in Lollard's Tower, were removed to different houses, and died. Their bodies were thrown out in the common fields as unworthy of burial, and lay until the faithful conveyed them away at night.

Mr. William Andrew of Horseley, Essex, was imprisoned in Newgate for heresy; but God chose to call him to himself by the severe treatment he endured in Newgate, and thus to mock the snaguinary expectations of his Catholic persecutors. His body was thrown into the open air, but his soul was received into the everlasting mansions of his heavenly Creator.
The Rev. Robert SamuelThis gentleman was minister ofr Bradford, Suffolk, where he industriously taught the flock committed to his charge, while he was openly permitted to discharge his duty. He was first persecuted by Mr. Foster, of Copdock, near Ipswich, a severe and bigoted persecutor of the followers of Christ, according to the truth in the Gospel. Notwithstanding Mr. Samuel was ejected from his living, he continued to exhort and instruct privately; nor would he obey the order for putting away his wife, whom he had married in King Edward's reign; but kept her at Ipswich, where Foster, by warrant, surprised him by night with her. After being imprisoned in Ipswich jail, he was taken before Dr. Hopton, bishop of Norwich, and Dr. Dunnings, his chancellor, two of the most sanguinary among the bigots of those days. To intimidate the worthy pastor, he was in prison chained to a post in such a manner that the weight of his body was supported by the points of his toes: added to this his allowance of provision was reduced to a quantity so insufficient to sustain nature that he was almost ready to devour his own flesh. From this dreadful extremity there was even a degree of mercy in ordering him to the fire. Mr. Samuel suffered August 31, 1555.
Bishop Ridley and Bishop LatimerThese reverend prelates suffered October 17, 1555, at Oxford, on the same day Wolsey and Pygot perished at Ely. Pillars of the Church and accomplished ornaments of human nature, they were the admiration of the realm, amiably conspicuous in their lives, and glorious in their deaths.

Dr. Ridley was born in Northumberland, was first tauht grammar at Newcastle, and afterward removed to Cambridge, where his aptitude in education raised him gradually until he came to be the head of Pembroke College, where he received the title of Doctor of Divinity. Having returned from a trip to Paris, he was appointed chaplain by Henry VIII and bishop of Rochester, and was afterwards translated to the see of London in the time of Edward VI.

To his sermons the people resorted, swarming about him like bees, coveting the sweet flowers and wholesome juice of the fruitful doctrine, which he did not only preach, but showed the same by his life, as a glittering lanthorn to the eyes and senses of the blind, in such pure order that his very enemies could not reprove him in any one jot.

His tender treatment of Dr. Heath, who was a prisoner with him during one year, in Edward's reign, evidently proves that he had no Catholic cruelty in his disposition. In person he was erect and well proportioned; in temper forgiving; in self-mortification severe. His first duty in the morning was private prayer: he remained in his study until ten o'clock, and then attended the daily prayer used in his house. Dinner being done, he sat about an hour, conversing pleasantly, or playing at chess. His study next engaged his attention, unless business or visits occurred; about five o'clock prayers followed; and after he would recreate himself at chess for about an hour, then retire to his study until eleven o'clock, and pray on his knees as in the morning. In brief, he was a pattern of godliness and virtue, and such he endeavored to make men wherever he came.

His attentive kindness was displayed particularly to old Mrs. Bonner, mother of Dr. Bonner, the cruel bishop of London. Dr. Ridley, when at his manor at Fulham, always invited her to his house, placed her at the head of his table, and treated her like his own mother; he did the same by Bonner's sister and other relatives; but when Dr. Ridley was under persecution, Bonner pursued a conduct diametrically opposite, and would have sacrificed Dr. Ridley's sister and her husband, Mr. George Shipside, had not Providence delivered him by the means of Dr. Heath, bishop of Worcester.

Dr. Ridley was first in part converted by reading Bertram's book on the Sacrament, and by his conferences with archbishop Cranmer and Peter Martyr.

When Edward VI was removed from the throne, and the bloody Mary succeeded, Bishop Ridley was immediately marked as an object of slaughter. He was first sent to the Tower, and afterward, at Oxford, was consigned to the common prison of Bocardo, with archbishop Cranmer and Mr. Latimer. Being separated from them, he was placed in the house of one Irish, where he remained until the day of his martyrdom, from 1554, until October 16, 1555.

It will easily be supposed that the conversations of these chiefs of the martyrs were elaborate, learned, and instructive. Such indeed they were, and equally beneficial to all their spiritual comforts. Bishop Ridley's letters to various Christian brethren in bonds in all parts, and his disputations with the mitred enemies of Christ, alike proved the clearness of his head and the integrity of his heart. In a letter to Mr. Grindal, (afterward archbishop of Canterbury,) he mentions with affection those who had preceded him in dying for the faith, and those who were expected to suffer; he regrets that popery is re-established in its full abomination, which he attributes to the wrath of God, made manifest in return for the lukewarmness of the clergy and the people in justly appreciating the blessed light of the Reformation.

This old practiced soldier of Christ, Master Hugh Latimer, was the son of one Hugh Latimer, of Thurkesson in the county of Leicester, a husbandman, of a good and wealthy estimation; where also he was born and brought up until he was four years of age, or thereabout: at which time his parents, having him as then left for their only son, with six daughters, seeing his ready, prompt, and sharp wit, purposed to train him up in erudition, and knowledge of good literature; wherein he so profited in his youth at the common schools of his own country, that at the age of fourteen years, he was sent to the University of Cambridge; where he entered into the study of the school divinity of that day, and was from principle a zealous observer of the Romish superstitions of the time. In his oration when he commenced bachelor of divinity, he inveighed against the reformer Melancthon, and openly declaimed against good Mr. Stafford, divinity lecturer in Cambridge.

Mr. Thomas Bilney, moved by a brotherly pity towards Mr. Latimer, begged to wait upon him in his study, and to explain to him the groundwork of his (Mr. Bilney's) faith. This blessed interview effected his conversion: the persecutor of Christ became his zealous advocate, and before Dr. Stafford died he became reconciled to him.

Once converted, he became eager for the conversion of others, and commenced to be public preacher, and private instructor in the university. His sermons were so pointed against the absurdity of praying in the Latin tongue, and withholding the oracles of salvation from the people who were to be saved by belief in them, that he drew upon himself the pulpit animadversions of several of the resident friars and heads of houses, whom he subsequently silenced by his severe criticisms and eloquent arguments. This was at Christmas, 1529. At length Dr. West preached against Mr. Latimer at Barwell Abbey, and prohibited him from preaching again in the churches of the university, notwithstanding which, he continued during three years to advocate openly the cause of Christ, and even his enemies confessed the power of those talents he possessed. Mr. Bilney remained here some time with Mr. Latimer, and thus the place where they frequently walked together obtained the name of Heretics' Hill.

Mr. Latimer at this time traced out the innocence of a poor woman, accused by her husband of the murder of her child. Having preached before King Henry VIII at Windsor, he obtained the unfortunate mother's pardon. This, with many other benevolent acts, served only to excite the spleen of his adversaries. He was summoned before Cardinal Wolsey for heresy, but being a strenuous supporter of the king's supremacy, in opposition to the pope's, by favor of Lord Cromwell and Dr. Buts, (the king's physician,) he obtained the living of West Kingston, in Wiltshire. For his sermons here against purgatory, the immaculacy of the Virgin, and the worship of images, he was cited to appear before Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, and John, bishop of London. He was required to subscribe certain articles, expressive of his conformity to the accustamed usages; and there is reason to think, after repeated weekly examinations, that he did subscribe, as they did not seem to involve any important article of belief.

Guided by Providence, he escaped the subtle nets of his persecutors, and at length, through the powerful friends before mentioned, became bishop of Worcester, in which function he qualified or explained away most of the papal ceremonies he was for form's sake under the necessity of complying with. He continued in this active and dignified employment some years.

Beginning afresh to set forth his plow he labored in the Lord's harvest most fruitfully, discharging his talent as well in divers places of this realm, as before the king at the court. In the same place of the inward garden, which was before applied to lascivious and courtly pastimes, there he dispensed the fruitful Word of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ, preaching there before the king and his whole court, to the edification of many.

He remained a prisoner in the Tower until the coronation of Edward VI, when he was again called to the Lord's harvest in Stamford, and many other places: he also preached at London in the convocation house, and before the young king; indeed he lectured twice every Sunday, regardless of his great age (then above sixty-seven years,) and his weakness through a bruise received from the fall of a tree. Indefatigable in his private studies, he rose to them in winter and in summer at two o'clock in the morning.

By the strength of his own mind, or of some inward light from above, he had a prophetic view of what was to happen to the Church in Mary's reign, asserting that he was doomed to suffer for the truth, and that Winchester, then in the Tower, was preserved for that purpose. Soon after Queen Mary was proclaimed, a messenger was sent to summon Mr. Latimer to town, and there is reason to believe it was wished that he should make his escape.

Thus Master Latimer coming up to London, through Smithfield (where merrily he said that Smithfield had long groaned for him), was brought before the Council, where he patiently bore all the mocks and taunts given him by the scornful papists. He was cast into the Tower, where he, being assisted with the heavenly grace of Christ, sustained imprisonment a long time, notwithstanding the cruel and unmerciful handling of the lordly papists, which thought then their kingdom would never fall; he showed himself not only patient, but also cheerful in and above all that which they could or would work against him. Yea, such a valiant spirit the Lord gave him, that he was able not only to despise the terribleness of prisons and torments, but also to laugh to scorn the doings of his enemies.

Mr. Latimer, after remaining a long time in the Tower, was transported to Oxford, with Cranmer and Ridley, the disputations at which place have been already mentioned in a former part of this work. He remained imprisoned until October, and the principal objects of all his prayers were three-that he might stand faithful to the doctrine he had professed, that God would restore his Gospel to England once again, and preserve the Lady Elizabeth to be queen; all of which happened. When he stood at the stake without the Bocardo gate, Oxford, with Dr. Ridley, and fire was putting to the pile of fagots, he raised his eyes benignantly towards heaven, and said, ""God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able."" His body was forcibly penetrated by the fire, and the blood flowed abundantly from the heart; as if to verify his constant desire that his heart's blood might be shed in defence of the Gospel. His polemical and friendly letters are lasting monuments of his integrity and talents. It has been before said, that public disputation took place in April, 1554, new examinations took place in October, 1555, previous to the degradation and condemnation of Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer. We now draw to the conclusion of the lives of the two last.

Dr. Ridley, the night before execution, was very facetious, had himself shaved, and called his supper a marriage feast; he remarked upon seeing Mrs. Irish (the keeper's wife) weep, ""Though my breakfast will be somewhat sharp, my supper will be more pleasant and sweet.""

The place of death was on the northside of the town, opposite Baliol College. Dr. Ridley was dressed in a black gown furred, and Mr. Latimer had a long shroud on, hanging down to his feet. Dr. Ridley, as he passed Bocardo, looked up to see Dr. Cranmer, but the latter was then engaged in disputation with a friar. When they came to the stake, Mr. Ridley embraced Latimer fervently, and bid him: ""Be of good heart, brother, for God will either assuage the fury of the flame, or else strengthen us to abide it."" He then knelt by the stake, and after earnestly praying together, they had a short private conversation. Dr. Smith then preached a short sermon against the martyrs, who would have answered him, but were prevented by Dr. Marshal, the vice-chancellor. Dr. Ridley then took off his gown and tippet, and gave them to his brother-in-law, Mr. Shipside. He gave away also many trifles to his weeping friends, and the populace were anxious to get even a fragment of his garments. Mr. Latimer gave nothing, and from the poverty of his garb, was soon stripped to his shroud, and stood venerable and erect, fearless of death.

Dr. Ridley being unclothed to his shirt, the smith placed an iron chain about their waists, and Dr. Ridley bid him fasten it securely; his brother having tied a bag of gunpowder about his neck, gave some also to Mr. Latimer.

Dr. Ridley then requested of Lord Williams, of Fame, to advocate with the queen the cause of some poor men to whom he had, when bishop, granted leases, but which the present bishop refused to confirm. A lighted fagot was now laid at Dr. Ridley's feet, which caused Mr. Latimer to say: ""Be of good cheer, Ridley; and play the man. We shall this day, by God's grace, light up such a candle in England, as I trust, will never be put out.""

When Dr. Ridley saw the fire flaming up towards him, he cried with a wonderful loud voice, ""Lord, Lord, receive my spirit."" Master Latimer, crying as vehemently on the other side, ""O Father of heaven, receive my soul!"" received the flame as it were embracing of it. After that he had stroked his face with his hands, and as it were, bathed them a little in the fire, he soon died (as it appeareth) with very little pain or none.

Well! dead they are, and the reward of this world they have already. What reward remaineth for them in heaven, the day of the Lord's glory, when he cometh with His saints, shall declare.

In the following month died Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester and lord chancellor of England. This papistical monster was born at Bury, in Suffolk, and partly educated at Cambridge. Ambitious, cruel, and bigoted, he served any cause; he first espoused the king's part in the affair of Anne Boleyn: upon the establishment of the Reformation he declared the supremacy of the pope an execrable tenet; and when Queen Mary came to the crown, he entered into all her papistical bigoted views, and became a second time bishop of Winchester. It is conjectured it was his intention to have moved the sacrifice of Lady Elizabeth, but when he arrived at this point, it pleased God to remove him.

It was on the afternoon of the day when those faithful soldiers of Christ, Ridley and Latimer, perished, that Gardiner sat down with a joyful heart to dinner. Scarcely had he taken a few mouthfuls, when he was seized with illness, and carried to his bed, where he lingered fifteen days in great torment, unable in any wise to evacuate, and burnt with a devouring fever, that terminated in death. Execrated by all good Christians, we pray the Father of mercies, that he may receive that mercy above he never imparted below.
Mr. John PhilpotThis martyr was the son of a knight, born in Hampshire, and brought up at New College, Oxford, where for several years he studied the civil law, and became eminent in the Hebrew tongue. He was a scholar and a gentleman, zealous in religion, fearless in disposition, and a detester of flattery. After visiting Italy, he returned to England, affairs in King Edward's days wearing a more promising aspect. During this reign he continued to be archdeacon of Winchester under Dr. Poinet, who succeeded Gardiner. Upon the accession of Mary, a convocation was summoned, in which Mr. Philpot defended the Reformation against his ordinary, Gardiner, again made bishop of Winchester, and soon was conducted to Bonner and other commissioners for examination, October 2, 1555, after being eighteen months' imprisoned. Upon his demanding to see the commission, Dr. Story cruelly observed, ""I will spend both my gown and my coat, but I will burn thee! Let him be in Lollard's tower, (a wretched prison,) for I will sweep the king's Bench and all other prisons of these heretics!""

Upon Mr. Philpot's second examination, it was intimated to him that Dr. Story had said that the lord chancellor had commanded that he should be made away with. It is easy to foretell the result of this inquiry. He was committed to Bonner's coal house, where he joined company with a zealous minister of Essex, who had been induced to sign a bill of recantation; but afterward, stung by his conscience, he asked the bishop to let him see the instrument again, when he tore it to pieces; which induced Bonner in a fury to strike him repeatedly, and tear away part of his beard. Mr. Philpot had a private interview with Bonner the same night, and was then remanded to his bed of straw like other prisoners, in the coal house. After seven examinations, Bonner ordered him to be set in the stocks, and on the following Sunday separated him from his fellow-prisoners as a sower of heresy, and ordered him up to a room near the battlements of St. Paul's, eight feet by thirteen, on the other side of Lollard's tower, and which could be overlooked by any one in the bishop's outer gallery. Here Mr. Philpot was searched, but happily he was successful in secreting some letters containing his examinations.

In the eleventh investigation before various bishops, and Mr. Morgan, of Oxford, the latter was so driven into a corner by the close pressure of Mr. Philpot's arguments, that he said to him, ""Instead of the spirit of the Gospel which you boast to possess, I think it is the spirit of the buttery, which your fellows have had, who were drunk before their death, and went, I believe, drunken to it."" To this unfounded and brutish remark, Mr. Philpot indignantly replied, ""It appeareth by your communication that you are better acquainted with that spirit than the Spirit of God; wherefore I tell thee, thou painted wall and hypocrite, in the name of the living God, whose truth I have told thee, that God shall rain fire and brimstone upon such blasphemers as thou art!"" He was then remanded by Bonner, with an order not to allow him his Bible nor candlelight.

On December 4, Mr. Philpot had his next hearing, and this was followed by two more, making in all, fourteen conferences, previous to the final examination in which he was condemned; such were the perseverance and anxiety of the Catholics, aided by rthe argumentative abilities of the most distinguished of the papal bishops, to bring him into the pale of their Church. Those examinations, which were very long and learned, were all written down by Mr. Philpot, and a stronger proof of the imbecility of the Catholic doctors, cannot, to an unbiased mind, be exhibited.

On December 16, in the consistory of St. Paul's Bishop Bonner, after laying some trifling accusations to his charge, such as secreting powder to make ink, writing some private letters, etc., proceeded to pass the awful sentence upon him, after he and the other bishops had urged him by every inducement to recant. He was afterward conducted to Newgate, where the avaricious Catholic keeper loaded him with heavy irons, which by the humanity of Mr. Macham were ordered to be taken off. On December 17, Mr. Philpot received intimation that he was to die next day, and the next morning about eight o'clock, he joyfully met the sheriffs, who were to attend him to the place of execution.

Upon entering Smithfield, the ground was so muddy that two officers offered to carry him to the stake, but he replied:

""Would you make me a pope? I am content to finish my journey on foot."" Arriving at the stake, he said, ""Shall I disdain to suffer at the stake, when my Redeemer did not refuse to suffer the most vile death upon the cross for me?"" He then meekly recited the One hundred and seventh and One hundred and eighth Psalms, and when he had finished his prayers, was bound to the post, and fire applied to the pile. On December 18, 1555, perished this illustrious martyr, reverenced by man, and glorified in heaven!
John Lomas, Agnes Snoth, Anne Wright, Joan Sole, and Joan CatmerThese five martyrs suffered together, January 31, 1556. John Lomas was a young man of Tenterden. He was cited to appear at Catnerbury, and was examined January 17. His answers being adverse to the idolatrous doctrine of the papacy, he was condemned on the following day, and suffered January 31.

Agnes Snoth, widow, of Smarden Parish, was several times summoned before the Catholic Pharisees, and rejecting absolution, indulgences, transubstantiation, and auricular confession, she was adjudged worthy to suffer death, and endured martyrdom, January 31, with Anne Wright and Joan Sole, who were placed in similar circumstances, and perished at the same time, with equal resignation. Joan Catmer, the last of this heavenly company, of the parish Hithe, was the wife of the martyr George Catmer.

Seldom in any country, for political controversy, have four women been led to execution, whose lives were irreproachable, and whom the pity of savages would have spared. We cannot but remark here that, when the Protestant power first gained the ascendency over the Catholic superstition, and some degree of force in the laws was necessary to enforce uniformity, whence some bigoted people suffered privation in their person or goods, we read of few burnings, savage cruelties, or poor women brought to the stake, but it is the nature of error to resort to force instead of argument, and to silence truth by taking away existence, of which the Redeemer himself is an instance.

The above five persons were burnt at two stakes in one fire, singing hosannahs to the glorified Savior, until the breath of life was extinct. Sir John Norton, who was present, wept bitterly at their unmerited sufferings.
Archbishop CranmerDr. Thomas Cranmer was descended from an ancient family, and was born at the village of Arselacton, in the county of Northampton. After the usual school education he was sent to Cambridge, and was chosen fellow Jesus College. Here he married a gentleman's daughter, by which he forfeited his fellowship, and became a reader in Buckingham College, placing his wife at the Dolphin Inn, the landlady of which was a relation of hers, whence arose the idle report that he was an ostler. His lady shortly after dying in childbed; to his credit he was re-chosen a fellow of the college before mentioned. In a few years after, he was promoted to be Divinity Lecturer, and appointed one of the examiners over those who were ripe to become Bachelors or Doctors in Divinity. It was his principle to judge of their qualifications by the knowledge they possessed of the Scriptures, rather than of the ancient fathers, and hence many popish priests were rejected, and others rendered much improved.

He was strongly solicited by Dr. Capon to be one of the fellows on the foundation of Cardinal Wolsey's college, Oxford, of which he hazarded the refusal. While he continued in Cambridge, the question of Henry VIII's divorce with Catharine was agitated. At that time, on account of the plague, Dr. Cranmer removed to the house of a Mr. Cressy, at Waltham Abbey, whose two sons were then educating under him. The affair of divorce, contrary to the king's approbation, had remained undecided above two or three years, from the intrigues of the canonists and civilians, and though the cardinals Campeius and Wolsey were commissioned from Rome to decide the question, they purposely protracted the sentence.

It happened that Dr. Gardiner (secretary) and Dr. Fox, defenders of the king in the above suit, came to the house of Mr. Cressy to lodge, while the king removed to Greenwich. At supper, a conversation ensued with Dr. Cranmer, who suggested that the question whether a man may marry his brother's wife or not, could be easily and speedily decided by the Word of God, and this as well in the English courts as in those of any foreign nation. The king, uneasy at the delay, sent for Dr. Gardiner and Dr. Fox to consult them, regretting that a new commission must be sent to Rome, and the suit be endlessly protracted. Upon relating to the king the conversation which had passed on the previous evening with Dr. Cranmer, his majesty sent for him, and opened the tenderness of conscience upon the near affinity of the queen. Dr. Cranmer advised that the matter should be referred to the most learned divines of Cambridge and Oxford, as he was unwilling to meddle in an affair of such weight; but the king enjoined him to deliver his sentiments in writing, and to repair for that purpose to the earl of Wiltshire's, who would accommodate him with books,a nd everything requisite for the occasion.

This Dr. Cranmer immediately did, and in his declaration not only quoted the authority of the Scriptures, of general councils, and the ancient writers, but maintained that the bishop of Rome had no authority whatever to dispense with the Word of God. The king asked him if he would stand by this bold declaration, to which replying in the affirmative, he was deputed ambassador to Rome, in conjunction with the earl of Wiltshire, Dr. Stokesley, Dr. Carne, Dr. Bennet, and others, previous to which, the marriage was discussed in most of the universities of Christendom and at home.

When the pope presented his toe to be kissed, as customary, the earl of Wiltshire and his party refused. Indeed, it is affirmed that a spaniel of the earl's attracted by the littler of the pope's toe, made a snap at it, whence his holiness drew in his sacred foot, and kicked at the offender with the other.

Upon the pope demanding the cause of their embassy, the earl presented Dr. Cranmer's book, declaring that his learned friends had come to defend it. The pope treated the embassy honorably, and appointed a day for the discussion, which he delayed, as if afraid of the issue of the investigation. The earl returned, and Dr. Cranmer, by the king's desire, visited the emperor, and was successful in bringing him over to his opinion. Upon the doctor's return to England, Dr. Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, having quitted this transitory life, Dr. Cranmer was deservedly, and by Dr. Warham's desire, elevated to that eminent station.

In this function, it may be said that he followed closely the charge of St. Paul. Diligent in duty, he rose at five in the morning, and continued in study and prayer until nine: between then and dinner, he devoted to temporal affairs. After dinner, if any suitors wanted hearing, he would determine their business with such an affability that even the defaulters were scarcely displeased. Then he would play at chess for an hour, or see others play, and at five o'clock he heard the Common Prayer read, and from this until supper he took the recreation of walking. At supper his conversation was lively and entertaining; again he walked or amused himself until nine o'clock, and then entered his study.

He ranked high in favor with King Henry, and even had the purity and the interest of the English Church deeply at heart. His mild and forgiving disposition is recorded in the following instance. An ignorant priest, in the country, had called Cranmer an ostler, and spoken very derogatory of his learning. Lord Cromwell receiving information of it, the man was sent to the Fleet, and his case was told to the archbishop by a Mr. Chertsey, a grocer, and a relation of the priest's. His grace, having sent for the offender, reasoned with him, and solicited the priest to question him on any learned subject. This the man, overcome by the bishop's good nature, and knowing his own glaring incapacity, declined, and entreated his forgiveness, which was immediately granted, with a charge to employ his time better when he returned to his parish. Cromwell was much vexed at the lenity displayed, but the bishop was ever more ready to receive injury than to retaliate in any other manner than by good advice and good offices.

At the time that Cranmer was raised to be archbishop, he was king's chaplain, and archdeacon of Taunton; he was also constituted by the pope the penitentiary general of England. It was considered by the king that Cranmer would be obsequious; hence the latter married the king to Anne Boleyn, performed her coronation, stood godfather to Elizabeth, the first child, and divorced the king from Catharine. Though Cranmer received a confirmation of his dignity from the pope, he always protested against acknowledging any other authority than the king's, and he persisted in the same independent sentiments when before Mary's commissioners in 1555.

One of the first steps after the divorce was to prevent preaching throughout his diocese, but this narrow measure had rather a political view than a religious one, as there were many who inveighed against the king's conduct. In his new dignity Cranmer agitated the question of supremacy, and by his powerful and just arguments induced the parliament to ""render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's."" During Cranmer's residence in Germany, 1531, he became acquainted with Ossiander, at Nuremberg, and married his niece, but left her with him while on his return to England. After a season he sent for her privately, and she remained with him until the year 1539, when the Six Articles compelled him to return her to her friends for a time.

It should be remembered that Ossiander, having obtained the approbation of his friend Cranmer, published the laborious work of the Harmony of the Gospels in 1537. In 1534 the archbishop completed the dearest wish of his heart, the removal of every obstacle to the perfection of the Reformation, by the subscription of the nobles and bishops to the king's sole supremacy. Only Bishop Fisher and Sir Thomas More made objection; and their agreement not to oppose the succession Cranmer was willing to consider at sufficient, but the monarch would have no other than an entire concession.

Not long after, Gardiner, in a privat einterview with the king, spoke inimically of Cranmer, (whom he maliciously hated) for assumiong the title of primate of all England, as derogatory to the supremacy of the king. This created much jealousy against Cranmer, and his translation of the Bible was strongly opposed by Stokesley, bishop of London. It is said, upon the demise of Queen Catharine, that her successor Anne Boleyn rejoiced-a lesson this to show how shallow is the human judgment! since her own execution took place in the spring of the following year, and the king, on the day following the beheading of this sacrificed lady, married the beautiful Jane Seymour, a maid of honor to the late queen. Cranmer was ever the friend of Anne Boleyn, but it was dangerous to oppose the will of the carnal tyrannical monarch.

In 1538, the Holy Scriptures were openly exposed to sale; and the places of worship overflowed everywhere to hear its holy doctrines expounded. Upon the king's passing into a law the famous Six Articles, which went nearly again to establish the essential tenets of the Romish creed, Cranmer shone forth with all the luster of a Christian patiot, in resisting the doctrines they contained, and in which he was supported by the bishops of Sarum, Worcester, Ely, and Rochester, the two former of whom resigned their bishoprics. The king, though now in opposition to Cranmer, still revered the sincerity that marked his conduct. The death of Lord Cromwell in the Tower, in 1540, the good friend of Cranmer, was a severe blow to the wavering Protestant cause, but even now Cranmer, when he saw the tide directly adverse to the truth, boldly waited on the king in person, and by his manly and heartfelt pleading, caused the Book of Articles to be passed on his side, to the great confusion of his enemies, who had contemplated his fall as inevitable.

Cranmer now lived in as secluded a manner as possible, until the rancor of Winchester preferred some articles against him, relative to the dangerous opinion he taught in his family, joined to other treasonable charges. These the king himself delivered to Cranmer, and believing firmly the fidelity and assertions of innocence of the accused prelate, he caused the matter to be deeply investigated, and Winchester and Dr. Lenden, with Thornton and Barber, of the bishop's household, were found by the papers to be the real conspirators. The mild, forgiving Cranmer would have interceded for all remission of publishment, had not Henry, pleased with the subsidy voted by parliament, let them be discharged. These nefarious men, however, again renewing their plots against Cranmer, fell victims to Henry's resentment, and Gardiner forever lost his confidence. Sir G. Gostwick soon after laid charges against the archbishop, which Henry quashed, and the primate was willing to forgive.

In 1544, the archbishop's palace at Canterbury was burnt, and his brother-in-law with others perished in it. These various afflictions may serve to reconcile us to a humble state; for of what happiness could this great and good man boast, since his life was constantly harassed either by political, religious, or natural crosses? Again the inveterate Gardfiner laid high charges against the meek archbishop and would have sent him to the Tower; but the king was his friend, gave him his signet that he might defend him, and in the Council not only declared the bishop one of the best affected men in his realm, but sharpoly rebuked his accusers for their calumny.

A peace having been made, Henry, and the French king, Henry the Great, were unanimous to have the Mass abolished in their kingdom, and Cranmer set about this great work; but the death of the English monarch, in 1546, suspended the precedure, and King Edwarrd his successor continued Cranmer in the same functions, upon whose coronation he delivered a charge that will ever honor his memory, for its purity, freedom, and truth. During this reign he prosecuted the glorious Reformation with unabated zeal, even in the year 1552, when he was seized with a severe ague, from which it pleased God to restore him that he might testify by his death the truth of that seed he had diligently sown.

The death of Edward, in 1553, exposed Cranmer to all the rage of his enemies. Though the archbishop was among those who supported Mary's accession, he was attainted at the meeting of parliament, and in November adjudged guilty of high treason at Guildhall, and degraded from his dignities. He sent a humble letter to Mary, explaining the cause of his signing the will in favor of Edward, and in 1554 he wrote to the Council, whom he pressed to obtain a pardon from the queen, by a letter delivered to Dr. Weston, but which the letter opened, and on seeing its contents, basely returned.

Treason was a charge quite inapplicable to Cranmer, who supported the queen's right; while others, who had favored Lady Jane were dismissed upon paying a small fine. A calumny was now spread against Cranmer that he complied with some of the popish ceremonies to ingratiate himself with the queen, which he dared publicly to disavow, and justified his articles of faith. The active part which the prelate had taken in the divorce of Mary's mother had ever rankled deeply in the heart of the queen, and revenge formed a prominent feature in the death of Cranmer.

We have in this work noticed the public disputations at Oxford, in which the talents of Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer shone so conspicuously, and tended to their condemnation. The first sentence was illegal, inasmuch as the usurped power of the pope had not yet been re-established by law.

Being kept in prison until this was effected, a commission was despatched from Rome, appointing Dr. Brooks to sit as the representative of his holiness, and Drs. Story and Martin as those of the queen. Cranmer was willing to bow to the authority of Drs. Story and Martin, but against that of Dr. Brooks he protested. Such were the remarks and replies of Cranmer, after a long examination, that Dr. Broks observed, ""We come to examine you, and methinks you examine us.""

Being sent back to confinement, he received a citation to appear at Rome within eighteen days, but this was impracticable, as he was imprisoned in England; and as he stated, even had he been at liberty, he was too poor to employ an advocate. Absurd as it must appear, Cranmer was condemned at Rome, and on February 14, 1556, a new commission was appointed, by which, Thirlby, bishop of Ely, and Bonner, of London, were deputed to sit in judgment at Christ-church, Oxford. By virtue of this instrument, Cranmer was gradually degraded, by putting mere rags on him to represent the dress of an archbishop; then stripping him of his attire, they took off his own gown, and put an old worn one upon him instead. This he bore unmoved, and his enemies, finding that severity only rendered him more determined, tried the opposite course, and placed him in the house of the dean of Christ-church, where he was treated with every indulgence.

This presented such a contrast to the three years' hard imprisonment he had received, that it threw him off his guard. His open, generous nature was more easily to be seduced by a liberal conduct than by threats and fetters. When Satan finds the Christian proof against one mode of attack, he tries another; and what form is so seductive as smiles, rewards, and power, after a long, painful imprisonment? Thus it was with Cranmer: his enemies promised him his former greatness if he would but recant, as well as the queen's favor, and this at the very time they knew that his death was determined in council. To soften the path to apostasy, the first paper brought for his signature was conceived in general terms; this once signed, five others were obtained as explanatory of the first, until finally he put his hand to the following detestable instrument:

""I, Thomas Cranmer, late archbishop of Canterbury, do renounce, abhor, and detest all manner of heresies and errors of Luther and Zuinglius, and all other teachings which are contrary to sound and true doctrine. And I believe most constantly in my heart, and with my mouth I confess one holy and Catholic Church visible, without which there is no salvation; and therefore I acknowledge the Bishop of Rome to be supreme head on earth, whom I acknowledge to be the highest bishop and pope, and Christ's vicar, unto whom all Christian people ought to be subject.

""And as concerning the sacraments, I believe and worship int he sacrament of the altar the body and blood of Christ, being contained most truly under the forms of bread and wine; the bread, through the mighty power of God being turned into the body of our Savior Jesus Christ, and the wine into his blood.

""And in the other six sacraments, also, (alike as in this) I believe and hold as the universal Church holdeth, and the Church of Rome judgeth and determineth.

""Furthermore, I believe that there is a place of purgatory, where souls departed be punished for a time, for whom the Church doth godily and wholesomely pray, like as it doth honor saints and make prayers to them.

""Finally, in all things I profess, that I do not otherwise believe than the Catholic Church and the Church of Rome holdeth and teacheth. I am sorry that I ever held or thought otherwise. And I beseech Almighty God, that of His mercy He will vouchsafe to forgive me whatsoever I have offended against God or His Church, and also I desire and beseech all Christian people to pray for me.

""And all such as have been deceived either by mine example or doctrine, I require them by the blood of Jesus Christ that they will return to the unity of the Church, that we may be all of one mind, without schism or division.

""And to conclude, as I submit myself to the Catholic Church of Christ, and to the supreme head thereof, so I submit myself unto the most excellent majesties of Philip and Mary, king and queen of this realm of England, etc., and to all other their laws and ordinances, being ready always as a faithful subject ever to obey them. And God is my witness, that I have not done this for favor or fear of any person, but willingly and of mine own conscience, as to the instruction of others.""

""Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall!"" said the apostle, and here was a falling off indeed! The papists now triumphed in their turn: they had acquired all they wanted short of his life. His recantation was immediately printed and dispersed, that it might have its due effect upon the astonished Protestants. But God counter worked all the designs of the Catholics by the extent to which they carried the implacable persecution of their prey. Doubtless, the love of life induced Cranmer to sign the above declaration: yet death may be said to have been preferable to life to him who lay under the stings of a goaded conscience and the contempt of every Gospel Christian; this principle he strongly felt in all its force and anguish.

The queen's revenge was only to be satiated by Cranmer's blood, and therefore she wrote an order to Dr. Pole, to prepare a sermon to be preached March 21, directly before his martyrdom, at St. Mary's, Oxford. Dr. Pole visited him the day previous, and was induced to believe that he would publicly deliver his sentiments in confirmation of the articles to which he had subscribed. About nine in the morning of the day of sacrifice, the queen's commissioners, attended by the magistrates, conducted the amiable unfortunate to St. Mary's Church. His torn, dirty garb, the same in which they habited him upon his degradation, excited the commiseration of the people. In the church he found a low mean stage, erected opposite to the pulpit, on which being placed, he turned his face, and fervently prayed to God.

The church was crowded with persons of both persuasions, expecting to hear the justification of the late apostasy: the Catholics rejoicing, and the Protestants deeply wounded in spirit at the deceit of the human heart. Dr. Pole, in his sermon, represented Cranmer as having been guilty of the most atrocious crimes; encouraged the deluded sufferer not to fear death, not to doubt the support of God in his torments, nor that Masses would be said in all the churches of Oxford for the repose of his soul. The doctor then noticed his conversion, and which he ascribed to the evident working of Almighty power and in order that the people might be convinced of its reality, asked the prisoner to give them a sign. This Cranmer did, and begged the congregation to pray for him, for he had committed many and grievous sins; but, of all, there was one which awfully lay upon his mind, of which he would speak shortly.

During the sermon Cranmer wept bitter tears: lifting up his hands and eyes to heaven, and letting them fall, as if unworthy to live: his grief now found vent in words: before his confession he fell upon his knees, and, in the following words unveiled the deep contrition and agitation which harrowed up his soul.

""O Father of heaven! O Son of God, Redeemer of the world! O Holy Ghost, three persons all one God! have mercy on me, most wretched caitiff and miserable sinner. I have offended both against heaven and earth, more than my tongue can express. Whither then may I go, or whither may I flee? To heaven I may be ashamed to lift up mine eyes and in earth I find no place of refuge or succor. To Thee, therefore, O Lord, do I run; to Thee do I humble myself, saying, O Lord, my God, my sins be great, but yet have mercy upon me for Thy great mercy. The great mystery that God became man, was not wrought for little or few offences. Thou didst not give Thy Son, O Heavenly Father, unto death for small sins only, but for all the greatest sins of the world, so that the sinner return to Thee with his whole heart, as I do at present. Wherefore, have mercy on me, O God, whose property is always to have mercy, have mercy upon me, O Lord, for Thy great mercy. I crave nothing for my own merits, but for Thy name's sake, that it may be hallowed thereby, and for Thy dear Son, Jesus Christ's sake. And now therefore, O Father of Heaven, hallowed be Thy name,"" etc.

Then rising, he said he was desirous before his death to give them some pious exhortations by which God might be glorified and themselves edified. He then descanted upon the danger of a love for the world, the duty of obedience to their majesties, of love to one another and the necessity of the rich administering to the wants of the poor. He quoted the three verses of the fifth chapter of James, and then proceeded, ""Let them that be rich ponder well these three sentences: for if they ever had occasion to show their charity, they have it now at this present, the poor people being so many, and victual so dear.

""And now forasmuch as I am come to the last end of my life, whereupon hangeth all my life past, and all my life to come, either to live with my master Christ for ever in joy, or else to be in pain for ever with the wicked in hell, and I see before mine eyes presently, either heaven ready to receive me, or else hell ready to swallow me up; I shall therefore declare unto you my very faith how I believe, without any color of dissimulation: for now is no time to dissemble, whatsoever I have said or written in times past.

""First, I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, etc. And I believe every article of the Catholic faith, every word and sentence taught by our Savior Jesus Christ, His apostles and prophets, in the New and Old Testament.

""And now I come to the great thing which so much troubleth my conscience, more than any thing that ever I did or said in my whole life, and that is the setting abroad of a writing contrary to the truth, which now here I renounce and refuse, as things written with my hand contrary to the truth which I thought in my heart, and written for fear of death, and to save my life, if it might be; and that is, all such bills or papers which I have written or signed with my hand since my degradation, wherein I have written many things untrue. And forasmuch as my hand hath offended, writing contrary to my heart, therefore my hand shall first be punished; for when I come to the fire it shall first be burned.

""And as for the pope, I refuse him as Christ's enemy, and Antichrist, with all his false doctrine.""

Upon the conclusion of this unexpected declaration, amazement and indignation were conspicuous in every part of the church. The Catholics were completely foiled, their object being frustrated, Cranmer, like Samson, having completed a greater ruin upon his enemies in the hour of death, than he did in his life.

Cranmer would have proceeded in the exposure of the popish doctrines, but the murmurs of the idolaters drowned his voice, and the preacher gave an order to ""lead the heretic away!"" The savage command was directly obeyed, and the lamb about to suffer was torn from his stand to the place of slaughter, insulted all the way by the revilings and taunts of the pestilent monks and friars.

With thoughts intent upon a far higher object than the empty threats of man, he reached the spot dyed with the blood of Ridley and Latimer. There he knelt for a short time in earnest devotion, and then arose, that he might undress and prepare for the fire. Two friars who had been parties in prevailing upon him to abjure, now endeavored to draw him off again from the truth, but he was steadfast and immovable in what he had just professed, and publicly taught. A chain was provided to bind him to the stake, and after it had tightly encircled him, fire was put to the fuel, and the flames began soon to ascend.

Then were the glorious sentiments of the martyr made manifest; then it was, that stretching out his right hand, he held it unshrinkingly in the fire until it was burnt to a cinder, even before his body wa sinjured, frequently exclaiming, ""This unworthy right hand.""

His body did abide the burning with such steadfastness that he seemed to have no more than the stake to which he was bound; his eyes were lifted up to heaven, and he repeated ""this unworthy right hand,"" as long as his voice would suffer him; and using often the words of Stephen, ""Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,"" in the greatness of the flame, he gave up the ghost.
The Vision of Three LaddersWhen Robert Samuel was brought forth to be burned, certain there were that heard him declare what strange things had happened unto him during the time of his imprisonment; to wit, that after he had famished or pined with hunger two or three days together, he then fell into a sleep, as it were one half in a slumber, at which time one clad all in white seemed to stand before him, who ministered comfort unto him by these words:

""Samuel, Samuel, be of good cheer, and take a good heart unto thee: for after this day shalt thou never be either hungry or thirsty.""

No less memorable it is, and worthy to be noted, concerning the three ladders which he told to divers he saw in his sleep, set up toward heaven; of the which there was one somewhat longer than the rest, but yet at length they became one, joining (as it were) all three together.

As this godly martyr was going to the fire, there came a certain maid to him, which took him about the neck, and kissed him, who, being marked by them that were present, was sought for the next day after, to be had to prison and burned, as the very party herself informed me: howbeit, as God of His goodness would have it, she escaped their fiery hands, keeping herself secret in the town a good while after.

But as this maid, called Rose Nottingham, was marvellously preserved by the providence of God, so there were other two honest women who did fall into the rage and fury of that time. The one was a brewer's wife, the other was a shoemaker's wife, but both together now espoused to a new husband, Christ.

With these two was this maid aforesaid very familiar and well acquainted, who, on a time giving counsel to the one of them, that she should convey herself away while she had time and space, had this answer at her hand again: ""I know well,"" saith she, ""that it is lawful enough to fly away; which remedy you may use, if you list. But my case standeth otherwise. I am tied to a husband, and have besides young children at home; therefore I am minded, for the love of Christ and His truth, to stand to the extremity of the matter.""

And so the next day after Samuel suffered, these two godly wives, the one called Anne Potten, the other called Joan Trunchfield, the wife of Michael Trunchfield, shoemaker, of Ipswich, were apprehended, and had both into one prison together. As they were both by sex and nature somewhat tender, so were they at first less able to endure the straitness of the prison; and especially the brewer's wife was cast into marvellous great agonies and troubles of mind thereby. But Christ, beholding the weak infirmity of His servant, did not fail to help her when she was in this necessity; so at the length they both suffered after Samuel, in 1556, February 19. And these, no dobut, were those two ladders, which, being joined with the third, Samuel saw stretched up into heaven. This blessed Samuel, the servant of Christ, suffered the thirty-first of August, 1555.

The report goeth among some that were there present, and saw him burn, that his body in burning did shine in the eyes of them that stood by, as bright and white as new-tried silver.

When Agnes Bongeor saw herself separated from her prison-fellows, what piteous moan that good woman made, how bitterly she wept, what strange thoughts came into her mind, how naked and desolate she esteemed herself, and into what plunge of despair and care her poor soul was brought, it was piteous and wonderful to see; which all came because she went not with them to give her life in the defence of her Christ; for of all things in the world, life was least looked for at her hands.

For that morning in which she was kept back from burning, had she put on a smock, that she had prepared only for that purpose. And also having a child, a little young infant sucking on her, whom she kept with her tenderly all the time that she was in prison, against that day likewise did she send away to another nurse, and prepared herself presently to give herself for the testimony of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ. So little did she look for life, and so greatly did God's gifts work in her above nature, that death seemed a great deal better welcome than life. After which, she began a little to stay herself, and gave her whole exercise to reading and prayer, wherein she found no little comfort.

In a short time came a writ from London for the burning, which according to the effect thereof, was executed.
Hugh Laverick and John ApriceHere we perceive that neither the impotence of age nor the affliction of blindness, could turn aside the murdering fangs of these Babylonish monsters. The first of these unfortunates was of the parish of Barking, aged sixty-eight, a painter and a cripple. The other was blind, dark indeed in his visual faculties, but intellectually illuminated with the radiance of the everlasting Gospel of truth. Inoffensive objects like these were informed against by some of the sons of bigotry, and dragged before the prelatical shark of London, where they underwent examination, and replied to the articles propounded to them, as other Christian martyrs had done before. On the ninth day of May, in the consistory of St. Paul's, they were entreated to recant, and upon refusal, were sent to Fulham, where Bonner, by way of a dessert after dinner, condemned them to the agonies of the fire. Being consigned to the secular officers, May 15, 1556, they were taken in a cart from Newgate to Stratford-le-Bow, where they were fastened to the stake. When Hugh Laverick was secured by the chain, having no further occasion for his crutch, he threw it away saying to his fellow-martyr, while consoling him, ""Be of good cheer my brother; for my lord of London is our good physician; he will heal us both shortly-thee of thy blindness, and me of my lameness."" They sank down in the fire, to rise to immortality!

The day after the above martyrdoms, Catharine Hut, of Bocking, widow; Joan Horns, spinster, of Billerica; Elizabeth Thackwel, spinster, of Great Burstead, suffered death in Smithfield.

Thomas Dowry. We have again to record an act of unpitying cruelty, exercised on this lad, whom Bishop Hooper, had confirmed in the Lord and the knowledge of his Word.

How long this poor sufferer remained in prison is uncertain.

By the testimony of one John Paylor, register of Gloucester, we learn that when Dowry was brought before Dr. Williams, then chancellor of Gloucester, the usual articles were presented him for subscription. From these he dissented; and, upon the doctor's demanding of whom and where he had learned his heresies, the youth replied, ""Indeed, Mr. Chancellor, I learned from you in that very pulpit. On such a day (naming the day) you said, in preaching upon the Sacrament, that it was to be exercised spiritually by faith, and not carnally and really, as taught by the papists."" Dr. Williams then bid him recant, as he had done; but Dowry had not so learned his duty. ""Though you,"" said he, ""can so easily mock God, the world, and your own conscience, yet will I not do so.""
Preservation of George Crow and His TestamentThis poor man, of Malden, May 26, 1556, put to sea, to lade in Lent with fuller's earth, but the boat, being driven on land, filled with water, and everything was washed out of her; Crow, however, saved his Testament, and coveted nothing else. With Crow was a man and a boy, whose awful situation became every minute more alarming, as the boat was useless, and they were ten miles from land, expecting the tide should in a few hours set in upon them. After prayer to God, they got upon the mast, and hung there for the space of ten hours, when the poor boy, overcome by cold and exhaustion, fell off, and was drowned. The tide having abated, Crow proposed to take down the masts, and float upon them, which they did; and at ten o'clock at night they were borne away at the mercy of the waves. On Wednesday, in the night, Crow's companion died through the fatigue and hunger, and he was left alone, calling upon God for succor. At length he was picked up by a Captain Morse, bound to Antwerp, who had nearly steered away, taking him for some fisherman's buoy floating in the sea. As soon as Crow was got on board, he put his hand in his bosom, and drew out his Testament, which indeed was wet, but not otherwise injured. At Antwerp he was well received, and the money he had lost was more than made good to him.
Executions at Stratford-le-BowAt this sacrifice, which we are about to detail no less than thirteen were doomed to the fire.

Each one refusing to subscribe contrary to conscience, they were condemned, and the twenty-seventh of June, 1556, was appointed for their execution at Stratford-le-Bow. Their constancy and faith glorified their Redeemer, equally in life and in death.
Rev. Julius PalmerThis gentleman's life presents a singular instance of error and conversion. In the time of Edward, he was a rigid and obstinate papist, so adverse to godly and sincere preaching, that he was even despised by his own party; that this frame of mind should be changed, and he suffer persecution and death in Queen Mary's reign, are among those events of omnipotence at which we wonder and admire.

Mr. Palmer was born at Coventry, where his father had been mayor. Being afterward removed to Oxford, he became, under Mr. Harley, of Magdalen College, an elegant Latin and Greek scholar. He was fond of useful disputation, possessed of a lively wit, and a strong memory. Indefatigable in private study, he rose at four in the morning, and by this practice qualified himself to become reader in logic in Magralen College. The times of Edward, however, favoring the Reformation, Mr. Palmer became frequently punished for his contempt of prayer and orderly behavior, and was at length expelled the house.

He afterwards embraced the doctrines of the Reformation, which occasioned his arrest and final condemnation.

A certain nobleman offered him his life if he would recant.

""If so,"" said he, ""thou wilt dwell with me. And if thou wilt set thy mind to marriage, I will procure thee a wife and a farm, and help to stuff and fit thy farm for thee. How sayst thou?""

Palmer thanked him very courteously, but very modestly and reverently concluded that as he had already in two places renounced his living for Christ's sake, so he would with God's grace be ready to surrender and yield up his life also for the same, when God should send time.

When Sir Richard perceived that he would by no means relent:

""Well, Palmer,"" saith he, ""then I perceive one of us twain shall be damned: for we be of two faiths, and certain I am there is but one faith that leadeth to life and salvation.""

Palmer: ""O sir, I hope that we both shall be saved.""
Sir Richard: ""How may that be?""Palmer: ""Right well, sir. For as it hath pleased our merciful Savior, according to the Gospel's parable, to call me at the third hour of the day, even in my flowers, at the age of four and twenty years, even so I trust He hath called, and will call you, at the eleventh hour of this your old age, and give you everlasting life for your portion.""

Sir Richard: ""Sayest thou so? Well, Palmer, well, I would I might have thee but one month in my house: I doubt not but I would convert thee, or thou shouldst convert me.""

Then said Master Winchcomb, ""Take pity on thy golden years, and pleasant flowers of lusty youth, before it be too late.""

Palmer: ""Sir, I long for those springing flowers that shall never fade away.""

He was tried on the fifteenth of July, 1556, together with one Thomas Askin, fellow prisoner. Askin and one John Guin had been sentenced the day before, and Mr. Palmer, on the fifteenth, was brought up for final judgment. Execution was ordered to follow the sentence, and at five o'clock in the same afternoon, at a place called the Sand-pits, these three martyrs were fastened to a stake. After devoutly praying together, they sung the Thirty-first Psalm.

When the fire was kindled, and it had seized their bodies, without an appearance of enduring pain, they continued to cry, ""Lord Jesus, strengthen us! Lord Jesus receive our souls!"" until animation was suspended and human suffering was past. It is remarkable, that, when their heads had fallen together in a mass as it were by the force of the flames, and the spectators thought Palmer as lifeless, his tongue and lips again moved, and were heard to pronounce the name of Jesus, to whom be glory and honor forever!
Joan Waste and OthersThis poor, honest woman, blind from her birth, and unmarried, aged twenty-two, was of the parish of Allhallows, Derby. Her father was a barber, and also made ropes for a living: in which she assisted him, and also learned to knit several articles of apparel. Refusing to communicate with those who maintained doctrines contrary to those she had learned in the days of the pious Edward, she was called before Dr. Draicot, the chancellor of Bishop Blaine, and Peter Finch, official of Derby.

With sophisitcal arguments and threats they endeavored to confound the poor girl; but she proffered to yield to the bishop's doctrine, if he would answer for her at the Day of Judgment, (as pious Dr. Taylor had done in his sermons) that his belief of the real presence of the Sacrament was true. The bishop at first answered that he would; but Dr. Draicot reminding him that he might not in any way answer for a heretic, he withdrew his confirmation of his own tenets; and she replied that if their consciences would not permit them to answer at God's bar for that truth they wished her to subscribe to, she would answer no more questions. Sentence was then adjudged, and Dr. Draicot appointed to preach her condemned sermon, which took place August 1, 1556, the day of her martyrdom. His fulminating discourse being finished, the poor, sightless object was taken to a place called Windmill Pit, near the town, where she for a time held her brother by the hand, and then prepared herself for the fire, calling upon the pitying multitude to pray with her, and upon Christ to have mercy upon her, until the glorious light of the everlasting Sun of righteousness beamed upon her departed spirit.

In November, fifteen martyrs were imprisoned in Canterbury castle, of whom all were either burnt or famished. Among the latter were J. Clark, D. Chittenden, W. Foster of Stonc, Alice Potkins, and J. Archer, of Cranbrooke, weaver. The two first of these had not received condemnation, but the others were sentenced to the fire. Foster, at his examination, observed upon the utility of carrying lighted candles about on Candlemas-day, that he might as well carry a pitchfork; and that a gibbet would have as good an effect as the cross.

We have now brought to a close the sanguinary proscriptions of the merciless Mary, in the year 1556, the number of which amounted to above EIGHTY-FOUR!

The beginning of the year 1557, was remarkable for the visit of Cardinal Pole to the University of Cambridge, which seemed to stand in need of much cleansing from heretical preachers and reformed doctrines. One object was also to play the popish farce of trying Martin Bucer and Paulus Phagius, who had been buried about three or four years; for which purpose the churches of St. Mary and St. Michael, where they lay, were interdicted as vile and unholy places, unfit to worship God in, until they were perfumed and washed with the pope's holy water, etc., etc. The trumpery act of citing these dead reformers to appear, not having had the least effect upon them, on January 26, sentence of condemnation was passed, part of which ran in this manner, and may serve as a specimen of proceedings of this nature: ""We therefore pronounce the said Martin Bucer and Paulus Phagius excommunicated and anathematized, as well by the common law, as by letters of process; and that their memory be condemned, we also condemn their bodies and bones (which in that wicked time of schism, and other heresies flourishing in this kingdom, were rashly buried in holy ground) to be dug up, and cast far from the bodies and bones of the faithful, according to the holy canons, and we command that they and their writings, if any be there found, be publicly burnt; and we interdict all persons whatsoever of this university, town, or places adjacent, who shall read or conceal their heretical book, as well by the common law, as by our letters of process!""

After the sentence thus read, the bishop commanded their bodies to be dug out of their graves, and being degraded from holy orders, delivered them into the hands of the secular power; for it was not lawful for such innocent persons as they were, abhorring all bloodshed, and detesting all desire of murder, to put any man to death.

February 6, the bodies, enclosed as they were in chests, were carried into the midst of the market place at Cambrdige, accompanied by a vast concourse of people. A great post was set fast in the ground, to which the chests were affixed with a large iron chain, and bound round their centers, in the same manner as if the dead bodies had been alive. When the fire began to ascend, and caught the coffins, a number of condemned books were also launched into the flames, and burnt. Justice, however, was done to the memories of these pious and learned men in Queen Elizabeth's reign, when Mr. Ackworth, orator of the university, and Mr. J. Pilkington, pronounced orations in honor of their memory, and in reprobation of their Catholic persecutors.

Cardinal Pole also inflicted his harmless rage upon the dead body of Peter Martyr's wife, who, by his command, was dug out of her grave, and buried on a distant dunghill, partly because her bones lay near St. Fridewide's relics, held once in great esteem in that college, and partly because he wished to purify Oxford of heretical remains as well as Cambridge. In the succeeding reign, however, her remains were restored to their former cemetery, and even intermingled with those of the Catholic saint, to the utter astonishment and mortification of the disciples of his holiness the pope.

Cardinal Pole published a list of fifty-four articles, containing instructions to the clergy of his diocese of Canterbury, some of which are too ludicrous and puerile to excite any other sentiment than laughter in these days.
Persecutions in the Diocese of CanterburyIn the month of February, the following persons were committed to prison: R. Coleman, of Waldon, laborer; Joan Winseley, of Horsley Magna, spinster; S. Glover, of Rayley; R. Clerk, of Much Holland, mariner; W. Munt, of Much Bentley, sawyer; Marg. Field, of Ramsey, spinster; R. Bongeor, currier; R. Jolley, mariner;

Allen Simpson, Helen Ewire, C. Pepper, widow; Alice Walley (who recanted), W. Bongeor, glazier, all of Colchester; R. Atkin, of Halstead, weaver; R. Barcock, of Wilton, carpenter; R. George, of Westbarhonlt, laborer; R. Debnam of Debenham, weaver; C. Warren, of Cocksall, spinster; Agnes Whitlock, of Dover-court, spinster;

Rose Allen, spinster; and T. Feresannes, minor; both of Colchester.

These persons were brought before Bonner, who would have immediately sent them to execution, but Cardinal Pole was for more merciful measures, and Bonner, in a letter of his to the cardinal, seems to be sensible that he had displeased him, for he has this expression: ""I thought to have them all hither to Fulham, and to have given sentence against them; nevertheless, perceiving by my last doing that your grace was offended, I thought it my duty, before I proceeded further, to inform your grace."" This circumstance verifies the account that the cardinal was a humane man; and though a zealous Catholic, we, as Protestants, are willing to render him that honor which his merciful character deserves. Some of the bitter persecutors denounced him to the pope as a favorer of heretics, and he was summoned to Rome, but Queen Mary, by particular entreaty, procured his stay. However, before his latter end, and a little before his last journey from Rome to England, he was strongly suspected of favoring the doctrine of Luther.

As in the last sacrifice four women did honor to the truth, so in the following auto da fe we have the like number of females and males, who suffered June 30, 1557, at Canterbury, and were J. Fishcock, F. White, N. Pardue, Barbary Final, widow, Bardbridge's widow, Wilson's wife, and Benden's wife.

Of this group we shall more particularly notice Alice Benden, wife of Edward Bender, of Staplehurst, Kent. She had been taken up in October, 1556, for non-attendance, and released upon a strong injunction to mind her conduct. Her husband was a bigoted Catholic, and publicly speaking of his wife's contumacy, she was conveyed to Canterbury Castle, where knowing, when she should be removed to the bishop's prison, she should be almost starved upon three farthings a day, she endeavored to prepare herself for this suffering by living upon twopence halfpenny per day.

On January 22, 1557, her husband wrote to the bishop that if his wife's brother, Roger Hall, were to be kept from consoling and relieving her, she might turn; on this account, she was moved to a prison called Monday's Hole. Her brother sought diligently for her, and at the end of five weeks providentially heard her voice in the dungeon, but could not otherwise relieve her, than by putting soe money in a loaf, and sticking it on a long pole. Dreadful must have been the situation of this poor victim, lying on straw, between stone walls, without a change of apparel, or the meanest requisites of cleanliness, during a period of nine weeks!

On March 25 she was summoned before the bishop, who, with rewards, offered her liberty if she would go home and be comfortable; but Mrs. Benden had been inured to suffering, and, showing him her contracted limbs and emaciated appearance, refused to swerve from the truth. She was however removed from this black hole to the West Gate, whence, about the end of April, she was taken out to be condemned, and then committed to the castle prison until the nineteenth of June, the day of her burning. At the stake, she gave her handkerchief to one John Banks, as a memorial; and from her waist she drew a white lace, desiring him to give it to her brother, and tell him that it was the last band that had bound her, except the chain; and to her father she returned a shilling he had sent her.

The whole of these seven martyrs undressed themselves with alacrity, and, being prepared, knelt down, and prayed with an earnestness and Christian spirit that even the enemies of the cross were affected. After invocation made together, they were secured to the stake, and, being encompassed with the unsparing flames, they yielded their souls into the hands of the living Lord.

Matthew Plaise, weaver, a sincere and shrewd Christian, of Stone, Kent, was brought before Thomas, bishop of Dover, and other inquisitors, whom he ingeniously teased by his indirect answers, of which the following is a specimen.

Dr. Harpsfield. Christ called the bread His body; what dost thou say it is?
Plaise. I do believe it was that which He gave them.
Dr. H. What as that?
P. That which He brake.
Dr. H. What did He brake?
P. That which He took.
Dr. H. What did He take?
P. I say, what He gave them, that did they eat indeed.
Dr. H. Well, then, thou sayest it was but bread which the disciples did eat.
P. I say, what He gave them, that did they eat indeed.

A very long disputation followed, in which Plaise was desired to humble himself to the bishop; but this he refused. Whether this zealous person died in prison, was executed, or delivered, history does not mention.
Rev. John HullierRev. John Hullier was brought up at Eton College, and in process of time became curate of Babram, three miles from Cambridge, and went afterward to Lynn; where, opposing the superstition of the papists, he was carried before Dr. Thirlby, bishop of Ely, and sent to Cambridge castle: here he lay for a time, and was then sent to Tolbooth prison, where, after three months, he was brought to St. Mary's Church, and condemned by Dr. Fuller. On Maunday Thursday he was brought to the stake: while undressing, he told the people to bear witness that he was about to suffer in a just cause, and exhorted them to believe that there was no other rock than Jesus Christ to build upon. A priest named Boyes, then desired the mayor to silence him. After praying, he went meekly to the stake, and being bound with a chain, and placed in a pitch barrel, fire was applied to the reeds and wood; but the wind drove the fire directly to his back, which caused him under the severe agony to pray the more fervently. His friends directed the executioner to fire the pile to windward of his face, which was immediately done.

A quantity of books were now thrown into the fire, one of which (the Communion Service) he caught, opened it, and joyfully continued to read it, until the fire and smoke deprived him of sight; then even, in earnest prayer, he pressed the book to his heart, thanking God for bestowing on him in his last moments this precious gift.

The day being hot, the fire burnt fiercely; and at a time when the spectators supposed he was no more, he suddenly exclaimed, ""Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,"" and meekly resigned his life. He was burnt on Jesus Green, not far from Jesus College. He had gunpowder given him, but he was dead before it became ignited. This pious sufferer afforded a singular spectacle; for his flesh was so burnt from the bones, which continued erect, that he presented the idea of a skeleton figure chained to the stake. His remains were eagerly seized by the multitude, and venerated by all who admired his piety or detested inhuman bigotry.
Simon Miller and Elizabeth CooperIn the following month of July, received the crown of martyrdom. Miller dwelt at Lynn, and came to Norwich, where, planting himself at the door of one of the churches, as the people came out, he requested to know of them where he could go to receive the Communion. For this a priest brought him before Dr. Dunning, who committed him to ward; but he was suffered to go home, and arrange his affairs; after which he returned to the bishop's house, and to his prison, where he remained until the thirteenth of July, the day of his burning.

Elizabeth Coope, wife of a pewterer, of St. Andrews, Norwich, had recanted; but tortured for what she had done by the worm which dieth not, she shortly after voluntarily entered her parish church during the time of the popish service, and standing up, audibly proclaimed that she revoked her former recantation, and cautioned the people to avoid her unworthy example. She was taken from her own house by Mr. Sutton the sheriff, who very reluctantly complied with the letter of the law, as they had been servants and in friendship together. At the stake, the poor sufferer, feeling the fire, uttered the cry of ""Oh!"" upon which Mr. Miller, putting his hand behind him towards her, desired her to be of a good courage, ""for (said he) good sister, we shall have a joyful and a sweet supper."" Encouraged by this example and exhortation, she stood the fiery ordeal without flinching, and, with him, proved the power of faith over the flesh.
Executions at ColchesterIt was before mentioned that twenty-two persons had been sent up from Colchester, who upon a slight submission, were afterward released. Of these, William Munt, of Much Bentley, husbandman, with Alice, his wife, and Rose Allin, her daughter, upon their return home, abstained from church, which induced the bigoted priest secretly to write to Bonner. For a short time they absconded, but returniong again, March 7, one Edmund Tyrrel, (a relation of the Tyrrel who murdered King Edward V and his brother) with the officers, entered the house while Munt and his wife were in bed, and informed them that they must go to Colchester Castle. Mrs. Munt at that time being very ill, requested her daughter to get her some drink; leave being permitted, Rose took a candle and a mug; and in returning through the house was met by Tyrrel, who cautioned her to advise her parents to become good Catholics. Rose briefly informed him that they had the Holy Ghost for their adviser; and that she was ready to lay down her own life for the same cause. Turning to his company, he remarked that she was willing to burn; and one of them told him to prove her, and see what she would do by and by. The unfeeling wretch immediately executed this project; and, seizing the young woman by the wrist, he held the lighted candle under her hand, burning it crosswise on the back, until the tendons divided from the flesh, during which he loaded her with many opprobrious epithets. She endured his rage unmoved, and then, when he had ceased the torture, she asked him to begin at her feet or head, for he need not fear that his employer would one day repay him. After this she took the drink to her mother.

This cruel act of torture does not stand alone on record.

Bonner had served a poor blind harper in nearly the same manner, who had steadily maintained a hope that if every joint of him were to be burnt, he should not fly from the faith. Bonner, upon this, privately made a signal to his men, to bring a burning coal, which they placed in the poor man's hand, and then by force held it closed, until it burnt into the flesh deeply.

George Eagles, tailor, was indicted for having prayed that 'God would turn Queen Mary's heart, or take her away'; the ostensible cause of his death was his religion, for treason could hardly be imagined in praying for the reformation of such an execrable soul as that of Mary. Being condemned for this crime, he was drawn to the place of execution upon a sledge, with two robbers, who were executed with him. After Eagles had mounted the ladder, and been turned off a short time, he was cut down before he was at all insensible; a bailiff, named William Swallow, then dragged him to the sledge, and with a common blunt cleaver, hacked off the head; in a manner equally clumsy and cruel, he opened his body and tore out the heart.

In all this suffering the poor martyr repined not, but to the last called upon his Savior. The fury of these bigots did not end here; the intestines were burnt, and the body was quartered, the four parts being sent to Colchester, Harwich, Chelmsford, and St. Rouse's. Chelmsford had the honor of retaining his head, which was affixed to a long pole in the market place. In time it was blown down, and lay several days in the street, until it was buried at night in the churchyard. God's judgment not long after fell upon Swallow, who in his old age became a beggar, and who was affected with a leprosy that made him obnoxious even to the animal creation; nor did Richard Potts, who troubled Eagles in his dying moments, escape the visiting hand of God.
Mrs. Joyce LewesThis lady was the wife of Mr. T. Lewes, of Manchester. She had received the Romish religion as true, until the burning of that pious martyr, Mr. Saunders, at Coventry. Understanding that his death arose from a refusal to receive the Mass, she began to inquire into the ground of his refusal, and her conscience, as it began to be enlightened, became restless and alarmed. In this inquietude, she resorted to Mr. John Glover, who lived near, and requested that he would unfold those rich sources of Gospel knowledge he possessed, particularly upon the subject of transubstantiation. He easily succeeded in convincing her that the mummery of popery and the Mass were at variance with God's most holy Word, and honestly reproved her for following too much the vanities of a wicked world. It was to her indeed a word in season, for she soon became weary of her former sinful life and resolved to abandon the Mass and dilatrous worship. Though compelled by her husband's violence to go to church, her contempt of the holy water and other ceremonies was so manifest, that she was accused before the bishop for despising the sacramentals.

A citation, addressed to her, immediately followed, which was given to Mr. Lewes, who, in a fit of passion, held a dagger to the throat of the officer, and made him eat it, after which he caused him to drink it down, and then sent him away. But for this the bishop summoned Mr. Lewest before him as well as his wife; the former readily submitted, but the latter resolutely affirmed, that, in refusing holy water, she neither offended God, nor any part of his laws. She was sent home for a month, her husband being bound for her appearance, during which time Mr. Glover impressed upon her the necessity of doing what she did, not from self-vanity, but for the honor and glory of God.

Mr. Glover and others earnestly exhorted Lewest to forfeit the money he was bound in, rather than subject his wife to certain death; but he was deaf to the voice of humanity, and delivered her over to the bishop, who soon found sufficient cause to consign her to a loathsome prison, whence she was several times brought for examination. At the last time the bishop reasoned with her upon the fitness of her coming to Mass, and receiving as sacred the Sacrament and sacramentals of the Holy Ghost. ""If these things were in the Word of God,"" said Mrs. Lewes, ""I would with all my heart receive, believe, and esteem them."" The bishop, with the most ignorant and impious effrontery, replied, ""If thou wilt believe no more than what is warranted by Scriptures, thou art in a state of damnation!"" Astonished at such a declaration, this worthy sufferer ably rejoined that his words were as impure as they were profane.

After condemnation, she lay a twelvemonth in prison, the sheriff not being willing to put her to death in his time, though he had been but just chosen. When her death warrant came from London, she sent for some friends, whom she consulted in what manner her death might be more glorious to the name of God, and injurious to the cause of God's enemies. Smilingly, she said: ""As for death, I think but lightly of. When I know that I shall behold the amiable countenance of Christ my dear Savior, the ugly face of death does not much trouble me."" The evening before she suffered, two priests were anxious to visit her, but she refused both their confession and absolution, when she could hold a better communication with the High Priest of souls. About three o'clock in the morning, Satan began to shoot his fiery darts, by putting into her mind to doubt whether she was chosen to eternal life, and Christ died for her. Her friends readily pointed out to her those consolatory passages of Scripture which comfort the fainting heart, and treat of the Redeemer who taketh away the sins of the world.

About eight o'clock the sheriff announced to her that she had but an hour to live; she was at first cast down, but this soon passed away, and she thanked God that her life was about to be devoted to His service. The sheriff granted permission for two friends to accompany her to the stake-an indulgence for which he was afterward severely handled. Mr. Reniger and Mr. Bernher led her to the place of execution; in going to which, from its distance, her great weakness, and the press of the people, she had nearly fainted. Three times she prayed fervently that God would deliver the land from popery and the idolatrous Mass; and the people for the most part, as well as the sheriff, said Amen.

When she had prayed, she took the cup, (which had been filled with water to refresh her,) and said, ""I drink to all them that unfeignedly love the Gospel of Christ, and wish for the abolition of popery."" Her friends, and a great many women of the place, drank with her, for which most of them afterward were enjoined penance.

When chained to the stake, her countenance was cheerful, and the roses of her cheeks were not abated. Her hands were extended towards heaven until the fire rendered them powerless, when her soul was received int o the arms of the Creator. The duration of her agony was but short, as the under-sheriff, at the request of her friends, had prepared such excellent fuel that she was in a few minutes overwhelmed with smoke and flame. The case of this lady drew a tear of pity from everyone who had a heart not callous to humanity.
Executions at IslingtonAbout the seventeenth of September, suffered at Islington the following four professors of Christ: Ralph Allerton, James Austoo, Margery Austoo, and Richard Roth.

James Austoo and his wife, of St. Allhallows, Barking, London, were sentenced for not believing in the presence. Richard Roth rejected the seven Sacraments, and was accused of comforting the heretics by the following letter written in his own blood, and intended to have been sent to his friends at Colchester:

""O dear Brethren and Sisters,

""How much reason have you to rejoice in God, that He hath given you such faith to overcome this bloodthirsty tyrant thus far! And no doubt He that hath begun that good work in you, will fulfill it unto the end. O dear hearts in Christ, what a crown of glory shall ye receive with Christ in the kingdom of God! O that it had been the good will of God that I had been ready to have gone with you; for I lie in my lord's Little-ease by day, and in the night I lie in the Coalhouse, apart from Ralph Allerton, or any other; and we look every day when we shall be condemned; for he said that I should be burned within ten days before Easter; but I lie still at the pool's brink, and every man goeth in before me; but we abide patiently the Lord's leisure, with many bonds, in fetters and stocks, by which we have received great joy of God. And now fare you well, dear brethren and sisters, in this world, but I trust to see you in the heavens face to face.

""O brother Munt, with your wife and my sister Rose, how blessed are you in the Lord, that God hath found you worthy to suffer for His sake! with all the rest of my dear brethren and sisters known and unknown. O be joyful even unto death. Fear it not, saith Christ, for I have overcome death. O dear heart, seeing that Jesus Christ will be our help, O tarry you the Lord's leisure. Be strong, let your hearts be of good comfort, and wait you still for the Lord. He is at hand. Yea, the angel of the Lord pitcheth his tent round about them that fear him, and delivereth them which way he seeth best. For our lives are in the Lord's hands; and they can do nothing unto us before God suffer them. Therefore give all thanks to God.

""O dear hearts, you shall be clothed in long white garments upon the mount of Sion, with the multitude of saints, and with Jesus Christ our Savior, who will never forsake us. O blessed virgins, ye have played the wise virgins' part, in that ye have taken oil in your lamps that ye may go in with the Bridegroom, when he cometh, into the everlasting joy with Him. But as for the foolish, they shall be shut out, because they made not themselves ready to suffer with Christ, neither go about to take up His cross. O dear hearts, how precious shall your death be in the sight of the Lord! for dear is the death of His saints. O fare you well, and pray. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen, Amen. Pray, pray, pray!

""Written by me, with my own blood,
""RICHARD ROTH.""This letter, so justly denominating Bonner the ""bloodthirsty tyrant,"" was not likely to excite his compassion. Roth accused him of bringing them to secret examination by night, because he was afraid of the people by day. Resisting every temptation to recant, he was condemned, and on September 17, 1557, these four martyrs perished at Islington, for the testimony of the Lamb, who was slain that they might be of the redeemed of God.

John Noyes, a shoemaker, of Laxfield, Suffolk, was taken to Eye, and at midnight, September 21, 1557, he was brought from Eye to Laxfield to be burned. On the following morning he was led to the stake, prepared for the horrid sacrifice. Mr. Noyes, on coming to the fatal spot, knelt down, prayed, and rehearsed the Fiftieth Psalm. When the chain enveloped him, he said, ""Fear not them that kill the body, but fear him that can kill both body and soul, and cast it into everlasting fire!"" As one Cadman placed a fagot against him, he blessed the hour in which he was born to die for the truth; and while trusting only upon the all-sufficient merits of the Redeemer, fire was set to the pile, and the blazing fagots in a short time stifled his last words, ""Lord, have mercy on me! Christ, have mercy upon me!"" The ashes of the body were buried in a pit, and with them one of his feet, whole to the ankle, with the stocking on.
Mrs. Cicely OrmesThis young martyr, aged twenty-two, was the wife of Mr. Edmund Ormes, worsted weaver of St. Lawrence, Norwich. At the death of Miller and Elizabeth Cooper, before mentioned, she had said that she would pledge them of the same cup they drank of. For these words she was brought to the chanellor, who would have discharged her upon promising to go to church, and to keep her belief to herself. As she would not consent to this, the chancellor urged that he had shown more lenity to her than any other person, and was unwilling to condemn her, because she was an ignorant foolish woman; to this she replied, (perhaps with more shrewdness than he expected,) that however great his desire might be to spare her sinful flesh, it could not equal her inclination to surrender it up in so great a quarrel. The chancellor then pronounced the fiery sentence, and September 23, 1557, she was brought to the stake, at eight o'clock in the morning.

After declaring her faith to the people, she laid her hand on the stake, and said, ""Welcome, thou cross of Christ."" Her hand was sooted in doing this, (for it was the same stake at which Miller and Cooper were burnt,) and she at first wiped it; but directly after again welcomed and embraced it as the ""sweet cross of Christ."" After the tormentors had kindled the fire, she said, ""My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit doth rejoice in God my Savior."" Then crossing her hands upon her breast, and looking upwards with the utmost serenity, she stood the fiery furnace. Her hands continued gradually to rise until the sinews were dried, and then they fell. She uttered no sigh of pain, but yielded her life, an emblem of that celestial paradise in which is the presence of God, blessed forever.

It might be contended that this martyr voluntarily sought her own death, as the chancellor scarcely exacted any other penance of her than to keep her belief to herself; yet it should seem in this instance as if God had chosen her to be a shining light, for a twelve-month before she was taken, she had recanted; but she was wretched until the chancellor was informed, by letter, that she repented of her recantation from the bottom of her heart. As if to compensate for her former apostasy, and to convince the Catholics that she meant to more to compromise for her personal security, she boldly refused his friendly offer of permitting her to temporize. Her courage in such a cause deserves commendation-the cause of Him who has said, ""Whoever is ashamed of me on earth, of such will I be ashamed in heaven.""
Rev. John RoughThis pious martyr was a Scotchman. At the age of seventeen, he entered himself as one of the order of Black Friars, at Stirling, in Scotland. He had been kept out of an inheritance by his friends, and he took this step in revenge for their conduct to him. After being there sixteen years, Lord Hamilton, earl of Arran, taking a liking to him, the archbishop of St. Andrew's induced the provincial of the house to dispense with his habit and order; and he thus became the earl's chaplain. He remained in this spiritual employment a year, and in that time God wrought in him a saving knowledge of the truth; for which reason the earl sent him to preach in the freedom of Ayr, where he remained four years; but finding danger there from the religious complexion of the times, and learning that there was much Gospel freedom in England, he travelled up to the duke of Somerset, then Lord Protector of England, who gave him a yearly salary of twenty pounds, and authorized him, to preach at Carlisle, Berwick, and Newcastle, where he married. He was afterward removed to a benefice at Hull, in which he remained until the death of Edward VI.

In consequence of the tide of persecution then setting in, he fled with his wife to Friesland, and at Nordon they followed the occupation of knitting hose, caps, etc., for subsistence. Impeded in his business by the want of yarn, he came over to England to procure a quantity, and on November 10, arrived in London, where he soon heard of a secret society of the faithful, to whom he joined himself, and was in a short time elected their minister, in which occupation he strengthened them in every good resolution.

On December 12, through the information of one Taylor, a member of the society, Mr. Rough, with Cuthbert Symson and others, was taken up in the Saracen's Head, Islington, where, under the pretext of coming to see a play, their religious exercises were holden. The queen's vice-chamberlain conducted Rough and Symson before the Council, in whose presence they were charged with meeting to celebrate the Communion. The Council wrote to Bonner and he lost no time in this affair of blood. In three days he had him up, and on the next (the twentieth) resolved to condemn him. The charges laid against him were, that he, being a priest, was married, and that he had rejected the service in the Latin tongue. Rough wanted not arguments to reply to these flimsy tenets. In short, he was degraded and condemned.



Mr. Rough, it should be noticed, when in the north, in Edward VI's reign, had saved Dr. Watson's life, who afterward sat with Bishop Bonner on the bench. This ungrateful prelate, in return for the kind act he had received, boldly accused Mr. Rough of being the most pernicious heretic in the country. The godly minister reproved him for his malicious spirit; he affirmed that, during the thirty years he had lived, he had never bowed the knee to Baal; and that twice at Rome he had seen the pope born about on men's shoulders with the false-named Sacrament carried before him, presenting a true picture of the very Antichrist; yet was more reverence shown to him than to the wafer, which they accounted to be their God. ""Ah?"" said Bonner, rising, and making towards him, as if he would have torn his garment, ""Hast thou been at Rome, and seen our holy father the pope, and dost thou blaspheme him after this sort?"" This said, he fell upon him, tore off a piece of his beard, and that the day might begin to his own satisfaction, he ordered the object of his rage to be burnt by half-past five the following morning.
Cuthbert SymsonFew professors of Christ possessed more activity and zeal than this excellent person. He not only labored to preserve his friends from the contagion of popery, but he labored to guard them against the terrors of persecution. He was deacon of the little congregation over which Mr. Rough presided as minister.

Mr. Symson has written an account of his own sufferings, which he cannot detail better than in his own words:

""On the thirteenth of December, 1557, I was committed by the Council to the Tower of London. On the following Thursday, I was called into the ward-room, before the constable of the Tower, and the recorder of London, Mr. Cholmly, who commanded me to inform them of the names of those who came to the English service. I answered that I would declare nothing; in consequence of my refusal, I was set upon a rack of iron, as I judge for the space of three hours!

""They then asked me if I would confess: I answered as before.

After being unbound, I was carried back to my lodging. The Sunday after I was brought to the same place again, before the lieutenant and recorder of London, and they examined me. As I had answered before, so I answered now. Then the lieutenant swore by God I should tell; after which my two forefingers were bound together, and a small arrow placed between them, they drew it through so fast that the blood followed, and the arrow brake.

""After enduring the rack twice again, I was retaken to my lodging, and ten days after the lieutenant asked me if I would not now confess that which they had before asked of me. I answered, that I had already said as much as I would. Three weeks after I was sent to the priest, where I was greatly assaulted, and at whose hand I received the pope's curse, for bearing witness of the resurrection of Christ. And thus I commend you to God, and to the Word of His grace, with all those who unfeignedly call upon the name of Jesus; desiring God of His endless mercy, through the merits of His dear Son Jesus Christ, to bring us all to His everlasting Kingdom, Amen. I praise God for His great mercy shown upon us. Sing Hosanna to the Highest with me, Cuthbert Symson. God forgive my sins! I ask forgiveness of all the world, and I forgive all the world, and thus I leave the world, in the hope of a joyful resurrection!""

If this account be duly considered, what a picture of repeated tortures does it present! But even the cruelty of the narration is exceeded by the patient meekness with which it was endured. Here are no expressions of malice, no invocations even of God's retributive justice, not a complaint of suffering wrongfully! On the contrary, praise to God, forgiveness of sin, and a forgiving all the world, concludes this unaffected interesting narrative.

Bonner's admiration was excited by the steadfast coolness of this martyr. Speaking of Mr. Symson in the consistory, he said, ""You see what a personable man he is, and then of his patience, I affirm, that, if he were not a heretic, he is a man of the greatest patience that ever came before me. Thrice in one day has he been racked in the Tower; in my house also he has felt sorrow, and yet never have I seen his patience broken.""

The day before this pious deacon was to be condemned, while in the stocks in the bishop's coal-house, he had the vision of a glorified form, which much encouraged him. This he certainly attested to his wife, to Mr. Austen, and others, before his death.

With this ornament of the Christian Reformation were apprehended Mr. Hugh Foxe and John Devinish; the three were brought before Bonner, March 19, 1558, and the papistical articles tendered. They rejected them, and were all condemned. As they worshipped together in the same society, at Islington, so they suffered together in Smithfield, March 28; in whose death the God of Grace was glorified, and true believers confirmed!
Thomas Hudson, Thomas Carman, and William SeamenWere condemned by a bigoted vicar of Aylesbury, named Berry.

The spot of execution was called Lollard's Pit, without Bishipsgate, at Norwich. After joining together in humble petition to the throne of grace, they rose, went to the stake, and were encircled with their chains. To the great surprise of the spectators, Hudson slipped from under his chains, and came forward. A great opinion prevailed that he was about to recant; others thought that he wanted further time. In the meantime, his companions at the stake urged every promise and exhortation to support him. The hopes of the enemies of the cross, however, were disappointed: the good man, far from fearing the smallest personal terror at the approaching pangs of death, was only alarmed thathis Savior's face seemed to be hidden from him. Falling upon his knees, his spirit wrestled with God, and God verified the words of His Son, ""Ask, and it shall be given."" The martyr rose in an ecstasy of joy, and exclaimed, ""Now, I thank God, I am strong! and care not what man can do to me!"" With an unruffled countenance he replaced himself under the chain, joined his fellow-sufferers, and with them suffered death, to the comfort of the godly, and the confusion of Antichrist.

Berry, unsatiated with this demoniacal act, summoned up two hundred persons in the town of Aylesham, whom he compelled to kneel to the cross at Pentecost, and inflicted other punishments. He struck a poor man for a trifling word, with a flail, which proved fatal to the unoffending object. He also gave a woman named Alice Oxes, so heavy a blow with his fist, as she met him entering the hall when he was in an ill-humor, that she died with the violence. This priest was rich, and possessed great authority; he was a reprobate, and, like the priesthood, he abstained from marriage, to enjoy the more a debauched and licentious life. The Sunday after the death of Queen Mary, he was revelling with one of his concubines, before vespers; he then went to church, administered baptism, and in his return to his lascivious pastime, he was smitten by the hand of God. Without a moment given for repentance, he fell to the ground, and a groan was the only articulation permitted him. In him we may behold the difference between the end of a martyr and a persecutor.
The Story of Roger HollandIn a retired close near a field, in Islington, a company of decent persons had assembled, to the number of forty. While they were religiously engaged in praying and expounding the Scripture, twenty-seven of them were carried before Sir Roger Cholmly. Some of the women made their escape, twenty-two were committed to Newgate, who continued in prison seven weeks. Previous to their examination, they were informed by the keeper, Alexander, that nothing more was requisite to procure their discharge, than to hear Mass. Easy as this condition may seem, these martyrs valued their purity of conscience more than loss of life or property; hence, thirteen were burnt, seven in Smithfield, and six at Brentford; two died in prison, and the other seven were providentially preserved. The names of the seven who suffered were, H. Pond, R. Estland, R. Southain, M. Ricarby, J. Floyd, J. Holiday, and Roger Holland. They were sent to Newgate, June 16, 1558, and executed on the twenty-seventh.

This Roger Holland, a merchant-tailor of London, was first an apprentice with one Master Kemption, at the Black Boy in Watling Street, giving himself to dancing, fencing, gaming, banqueting, and wanton company. He had received for his master certain money, to the sum of thirty pounds; and lost every groat at dice. Therefore he purposed to convey himself away beyond the seas, either into France or into Flanders.

With this resolution, he called early in the morning on a discreet servant in the house, named Elizabeth, who professed the Gospel, and lived a life that did honor to her profession. To her he revealed the loss his folly had occasioned, regretted that he had not followed her advice, and begged her to give his master a note of hand from him acknowledging the debt, which he would repay if ever it were in his power; he also entreated his disgraceful conduct might be kept secret, lest it would bring the gray hairs to his father with sorrow to a premature grave.

The maid, with a generosity and Christian principle rarely surpassed, conscious that his imprudence might be his ruin, brought him the thirty pounds, which was part of a sum of money recently left her by legacy. ""Here,"" said she, ""is the sum requisite: you shall take the money, and I will keep the note; but expressly on this condition, that you abandon all lewd and vicious company; that you neither swear nor talk immodestly, and game no more; for, should I learn that you do, I will immediately show this note to your master. I also require, that you shall promise me to attend the daily lecture at Allhallows, and the sermon at St. Paul's every Sunday; that you cast away all your books of popery, and in their place substitute the Testament and the Book of Service, and that you read the Scriptures with reverence and fear, calling upon God for his grace to direct you in his truth. Pray also fervently to God, to pardon your former offences, and not to remember the sins of your youth, and would you obtain his favor ever dread to break his laws or offend his majesty. So shall God have you in His keeping, and grant you your heart's desire."" We must honor the memory of this excellent domestic, whose pious endeavors were equally directed to benefit the thoughtless youth in this life and that which is to come. God did not suffer the wish of this excellent domestic to be thrown upon a barren soil; within half a year after the licentious Holland became a zealous professor of the Gospel, and was an instrument of conversion to his father and others whom he visited in Lancashire, to their spiritual comfort and reformation from popery.

His father, pleased with his change of conduct, gave him forty pounds to commence business with in London.

Then Roger repaired to London again, and came to the maid that lent him the money to pay his master withal, and said unto her, ""Elizabeth, here is thy money I borrowed of thee; and for the friendship, good will, and the good counsel I have received at thy hands, to recompense thee I am not able, otherwise than to make thee my wife."" And soon after they were married, which was in the first year of Queen Mary.

After this he remained in the congregations of the faithful, until, the last year of Queen Mary, he, with the six others aforesaid, were taken.

And after Roger Holland there was none suffered in Smithfield for the testimony of the Gospel, God be thanked.
Flagellations by BonnerWhen this Catholic hyena found that neither persuasions, threats, nor imprisonment, could produce any alteration in the mind of a youth named Thomas Hinshaw, he sent him to Fulham, and during the first night set him in the stocks, with no other allowance than bread and water. The following morning he came to see if this punishment had worked any change in his mind, and finding none, he sent Dr. Harpsfield, his archdeacon, to converse with him. The doctor was soon out f humor at his replies, called him peevish boy, and asked him if he thought he went about to damn his soul? ""I am persuaded,"" said Thomas, ""that you labor to promote the dark kingdom of the devil, not for the love of the truth."" These words the doctor conveyed to the bishop, who, in a passion that almost prevented articulation, came to Thomas, and said, ""Dost thou answer my archdeacon thus, thou naughty boy? But I'll soon handle thee well enough for it, be assured!"" Two willow twigs were then brought him, and causing the unresisting youth to kneel against a long bench, in an arbor in his garden, he scourged him until he was compelled to cease for want of breath and fatigue. One of the rods was worn quite away.

Many other conflicts did Hinsaw undergo from the bishop; who, at length, to remove him effectually, procured false witnesses to lay articles against him, all of which the young man denied, and, in short, refused to answer any interrogatories administered to him. A fortnight after this, the young man was attacked by a burning ague, and at the request of his master. Mr. Pugson, of St. Paul's church-yard, he was removed, the bishop not doubting that he had given him his death in the natural way; he however remained ill above a year, and in the mean time Queen Mary died, by which act of providence he escaped Bonner's rage.

John Willes was another faithful person, on whom the scourging hand of Bonner fell. He was the brother of Richard Willes, before mentioned, burnt at Brentford. Hinshaw and Willes were confined in Bonner's coal house together, and afterward removed to Fulham, where he and Hinshaw remained during eight or ten days, in the stocks. Bonner's persecuting spirit betrayed itself in his treatment of Willes during his examinations, often striking him on the head with a stick, seizing him by the ears, and filliping him under the chin, saying he held down his head like a thief. This producing no signs of recantation, he took him into his orchard, and in a small arbor there he flogged him first with a willow rod, and then with birch, until he was exhausted. This cruel ferocity arose from the answer of the poor sufferer, who, upon being asked how long it was since he had crept to the cross, replied, 'Not since he had come to years of discretion, nor would he, though he should be torn to pieces by wild horses.' Bonner then bade him make the sign of the cross on his forehead, which he refused to do, and thus was led to the orchard.

One day, when in the stocks, Bonner asked him how he liked his lodging and fare. ""Well enough,"" said Willes, ""might I have a little straw to sit or lie upon."" Just at this time came in Willes' wife, then largely pregnant, and entreated the bishop for her husband, boldly declaring that she would be delivered in the house, if he were not suffered to go with her. To get rid of the good wife's importunity, and the trouble of a lying-in woman in his palace, he bade Willes make the sign of the cross, and say, In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen. Willes omitted the sign, and repeated the words, ""in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen."" Bonner would have the words repeated in Latin, to which Willes made no objection, knowing the meaning of the words. He was then permitted to go home with his wife, his kinsman Robert Rouze being charged to bring him to St. Paul's the next day, whither he himself went, and subscribing to a Latin instrument of little importance, was liberated. This is the last of the twenty-two taken at Islington.
Rev. Richard YeomanThis devout aged person was curate to Dr. Taylor, at Hadley, and eminently qualified for his sacred function. Dr. Taylor left him the curacy at his departure, but no sooner had Mr. Newall gotten the benefice, than he removed Mr. Yeoman, and substituted a Romish priest. After this he wandered from place to place, exhorting all men to stand faithfully to God's Word, earnestly to give themselves unto prayer, with patience to bear the cross now laid upon them for their trial, with boldness to confess the truth before their adversaries, and with an undoubted hope to wait for the crown and reward of eternal felicity. But when he perceived his adversaries lay wait for him, he went into Kent, and with a little packet of laces, pins, points, etc., he travelled from village to village, selling such things, and in this manner subsisted himself, his wife, and children.

At last Justice Moile, of Kent, took Mr. Yeoman, and set him in the stocks a day and a night; but, having no evident matter to charge him with, he let him go again. Coming secretly again to Hadley, he tarried with his poor wife, who kept him privately, in a chamber of the town house, commonly called the Guildhall, more than a year. During this time the good old father abode in a chamber locked up all the day, spending his time in devout prayer, in reading the Scriptures, and in carding the wool which his wife spun. His wife also begged bread for herself and her children, by which precarious means they supported themselves. Thus the saints of God sustained hunger and misery, while the prophets of Baal lived in festivity, and were costily pampered at Jezebel's table.

Information being at length given to Newall, that Yeoman was secreted by his wife, he came, attended by the constables, and broke into the room where the object of his search lay in bed with his wife. He reproached the poor woman with being a whore, and would have indecently pulled the clothes off, but Yeoman resisted both this act of violence and the attack upon his wife's character, adding that he defied the pope and popery. He was then taken out, and set in stocks until day.

In the cage also with him was an old man, named John Dale, who had sat there three or four days, for exhorting the people during the time service was performing by Newall and his curate. His words were, ""O miserable and blind guides, will ye ever be blind leaders of the blind? Will ye never amend? Will ye never see the truth of God's Word? Will neither God's threats nor promises enter into your hearts? Will the blood of the martyrs nothing mollify your stony stomachs? O obdurate, hard-hearted, perverse, and crooked generation! to whom nothing can do good.""

These words he spake in fervency of spirit agains tthe superstitious religion of Rome; wherefore Newall caused him forthwith to be attached, and set in the stocks in a cage, where he was kept until Sir Henry Doile, a justice, came to Hadley.

When Yeoman was taken, the parson called earnestly upon Sir Henry Doile to send them both to prison. Sir Henry Doile as earnestly entreated the parson to consider the age of the men, and their mean condition; they were neither persons of note nor preachers; wherefore he proposed to let them be punished a day or two and to dismiss them, at least John Dale, who was no priest, and therefore, as he had so long sat in the cage, he thought it punishment enough for this time. When the parson heard this, he was exceedingly mad, and in a great rage called them pestilent heretics, unfit to live in the commonwealth of Christians.

Sir Henry, fearing to appear too merciful, Yeoman and Dale were pinioned, bound like thieves with their legs under the horses' bellies, and carried to Bury jail, where they were laid in irons; and because they continually rebuked popery, they were carried into the lowest dungeon, where John Dale, through the jail-sickness and evil-keeping, died soon after: his body was thrown out, and buried in the fields. He was a man of sixty-six years of age, a weaver by occupation, well learned in the holy Scriptures, steadfast in his confession of the true doctrines of Christ as set forth in King Edward's time; for which he joyfully suffered prison and chains, and from this worldly dungeon he departed in Christ to eternal glory, and the blessed paradise of everlasting felicity.

After Dale's death, Yeoman was removed to Norwich prison, where, after strait and evil keeping, he was examined upon his faith and religion, and required to submit himself to his holy father the pope. ""I defy him, (quoth he), and all his detestable abomination: I will in no wise have to do with him."" The chief articles objected to him, were his marriage and the Mass sacrifice. Finding he continued steadfast in the truth, he was condemned, degraded, and not only burnt, but most cruelly tormented in the fire. Thus he ended this poor and miserable life, and entered into that blessed bosom of Abraham, enjoying with Lazarus that rest which God has prepared for His elect.
Thomas BenbridgeMr. Benbridge was a single gentleman, in the diocese of Winchester. He might have lived a gentleman's life, in the wealthy possessions of this world; but he chose rather to enter through the strait gate of persecution to the heavenly possession of life in the Lord's Kingdom, than to enjoy present pleasure with disquietude of conscience. Manfully standing against the papists for the defence of the sincere doctrine of Christ's Gospel, he was apprehended as an adversary to the Romish religion, and led for examination before the bishop of Winchester, where he underwent several conflicts for the truth against the bishop and his colleague; for which he was condemned, and some time after brought to the place of martyrdom by Sir Richard Pecksal, sheriff.

When standing at the stake he began to untie his points, and to prepare himself; then he gave his gown to the keeper, by way of fee. His jerkin was trimmed with gold lace, which he gave to Sir Richard Pecksal, the high sheriff. His cap of velvet he took from his head, and threw away. Then, lifting his mind to the Lord, he engaged in prayer.

When fastened to the stake, Dr. Seaton begged him to recant, and he should have his pardon; but when he saw that nothing availed, he told the people not to pray for him unless he would recant, no more than they would pray for a dog.

Mr. Benbridge, standing at the stake with his hands together in suchj a manner as the priest holds his hands in his Memento, Dr. Seaton came to him again, and exhorted him to recant, to whom he said, ""Away, Babylon, away!"" One that stood by said, ""Sir, cut his tongue out""; another, a temporal man, railed at him worse than Dr. Seaton had done.

When they saw he would not yield, they bade the tormentors to light the pile, before he was in any way covered with fagots. The fire first took away a piece of his beard, at which he did not shrink. Then it came on the other side and took his legs, and the nether stockings of his hose being leather, they made the fire pierce the sharper, so that the intolerable heat made him exclaim, ""I recant!"" and suddenly he trust the fire from him. Two or three of his friends being by, wished to save him; they stepped to the fire to help remove it, for which kindness they were sent to jail. The sheriff also of his own authority took him from the stake, and remitted him to prison, for which he was sent to the Fleet, and lay there sometime. Before, however, he was taken from the stake, Dr. Seaton wrote articles for him to subscribe to. To these Mr. Benbridge made so many objections that Dr. Seaton ordered them to set fire again to the pile. Then with much pain and grief of heart he subscribed to them upon a man's back.

This done, his gown was given him again, and he was led to prison. While there, he wrote a letter to Dr. Seaton, recanting those words he had spoken at the stake, and the articles which he had subscribed, for he was grieved that he had ever signed them. The same day se'night he was again brought to the stake, where the vile tormentors rather broiled than burnt him. The Lord give his enemies repentance!
Mrs. PrestFrom the number condemned in this fanatical reign, it is almost impossible to obtain the name of every martyr, or to embellish the history of all with anecdotes and exemplifications of Christian conduct. Thanks be to Providence, our cruel task begins to draw towards a conclusion, with the end of the reign of papal terror and bloodshed. Monarchs, who sit upon thrones possessed by hereditary right, should, of all others, consider that the laws of nature are the laws of God, and hence that the first law of nature is the preservation of their subjects. Maxims of persecutions, of torture, and of death, they should leave to those who have effected sovereignty by fraud or by sword; but where, except among a few miscreant emperors of Rome, and the Roman pontiffs, shall we find one whose memory is so ""damned to everlasting fame"" as that of Queen Mary? Nations bewail the hour which separates them forever from a beloved governor, but, with respect to that of Mary, it was the most blessed time of her whole reign. Heaven has ordained three great scourges for national sins-plague, pestilence, and famine. It was the will of God in Mary's reign to bring a fourth upon this kingdom, under the form of papistical persecution. It was sharp, but glorious; the fire which consumed the martyrs has undermined the popedom; and the Catholic states, at present the most bigoted and unenlightened, are those which are sunk lowest in the scale of moral dignity and political consequence. May they remain so, until the pure light of the Gospel shall dissipate the darkness of fanaticism and superstition! But to return.

Mrs. Prest for some time lived about Cornwall, where she had a husband and children, whose bigotry compelled her to frequent the abominations of the Church of Rome. Resolving to act as her conscience dictated, she quitted them, and made a living by spinning. After some time, returning home, she was accused by her neighbors, and brought to Exeter, to be examined before Dr. Troubleville, and his chancellor Blackston. As this martyr was accounted of inferior intellect, we shall put her in competition with the bishop, and let the reader judge which had the most of that knowledge conducive to everlasting life. The bishop bringing the question to issue, respecting the bread and wine being flesh and blood, Mrs. Prest said, ""I will demand of you whether you can deny your creed, which says, that Christ doth perpetually sit at the right hand of His Father, both body and soul, until He come again; or whether He be there in heaven our Advocate, and to make prayer for us unto God His Father? If He be so, He is not here on earth in a piece of bread. If He be not here, and if He do not dwell in temples made with hands, but in heaven, what! shall we seek Him here? If He did not offer His body once for all, why make you a new offering? If with one offering He made all perfect, why do you with a false offering make all imperfect? If He be to be worshipped in spirit and in truth, why do you worship a piece of bread? If He be eaten and drunken in faith and truth, if His flesh be not profitable to be among us, why do you say you make His flesh and blood, and say it is profitable for body and soul? Alas! I am a poor woman, but rather than to do as you do, I would live no longer. I have said, Sir.""

Bishop. I promise you, you are a jolly Protestant. I pray you in what school have you been brought up?
Mrs. Prest. I have upon the Sundays visited the sermons, and there have I learned such things as are so fixed in my breast, that death shall not separate them.
B. O foolish woman, who will waste his breath upon thee, or such as thou art? But how chanceth it that thou wentest away from thy husband? If thou wert an honest woman, thou wouldst not have left thy husband and children, and run about the country like a fugitive.
Mrs. P. Sir, I labored for my livingl; and as my Master Christ counselleth me, when I was persecuted in one city, I fled into another.
B. Who persecuted thee?
Mrs. P. My husband and my children. For when I would have them to leave idolatry, and to worship God in heaven, he would not hear me, but he with his children rebuked me, and troubled me. I fled not for whoredom, nor for theft, but because I would be no partaker with him and his of that foul idol the Mass; and wheresoever I was, as oft as I could, upon Sundays and holydays. I made excuses not to go to the popish Church.
B. Belike then you are a good housewife, to fly from your husband the Church.
Mrs. P. My housewifery is but small; but God gave me grace to go to the true Church.
B. The true Church, what dost thou mean?
Mrs. P. Not your popish Church, full of idols and abominations, but where two or three are gathered together in the name of God, to that Church will I go as long as I live.
B. Belike then you have a church of your own. Well, let this mad woman be put down to prison until we send for her husband.
Mrs. P. No, I have but one husband, who is here already in this city, and in prison with me, from whom I will never depart.

Some persons present endeavoring to convince the bishop she was not in her right senses, she was permitted to depart. The keeper of the bishop's prisons took her into his house, where she either spun worked as a servant, or walked about the city, discoursing upon the Sacrament of the altar. Her husband was sent for to take her home, but this she refused while the cause of religion could be served. She was too active to be idle, and her conversation, simple as they affected to think her, excited the attention of several Catholic priests and friars. They teased her with questions, until she answered them angrily, and this excited a laugh at her warmth.

""Nay,"" said she, ""you have more need to weep than to laugh, and to be sorry that ever you were born, to be the chaplains of that whore of Babylon. I defy him and all his falsehood; and get you away from me, you do but trouble my conscience. You would have me follow your doings; I will first lose my life. I pray you depart.""

""Why, thou foolish woman,"" said they, ""we come to thee for thy profit and soul's health."" To which she replied, ""What profit ariseth by you, that teach nothing but lies for truth? how save you souls, when you preach nothing but lies, and destroy souls?""

""How provest thou that?"" said they.

""Do you not destroy your souls, when you teach the people to worship idols, stocks, and stones, the works of men's hands? and to worship a false God of your own making of a piece of bread, and teach that the pope is God's vicar, and hath power to forgive sins? and that there is a purgatory, when God's Son hath by His passion purged all? and say you make God and sacrifice Him, when Christ's body was a sacrifice once for all? Do you not teach the people to number their sins in your ears, and say they will be damned if they confess not all; when God's Word saith, Who can number his sins? Do you not promise them trentals and dirges and Masses for souls, and sell your prayers for money, and make them buy pardons, and trust to such foolish inventions of your imaginations? Do you not altogether act against God? Do you not teach us to pray upon beads, and to pray unto saints, and say they can pray for us? Do you not make holy water and holy bread to fray devils? Do you not do a thousand more abominations? And yet you say, you come for my profit, and to save my soul. No, no, one hath saved me. Farewell, you with your salvation.""

During the liberty granted her by the bishop, before-mentioned, she went into St. Peter's Church, and there found a skilful Dutchman, who was affixing new noses to certain fine images which had been disfigured in King Edward's time; to whom she said, ""What a madman art thou, to make them new noses, which within a few days shall all lose their heads?"" The Dutchman accused her and laid it hard to her charge. And she said unto him, ""Thou art accursed, and so are thy images."" He called her a whore. ""Nay,"" said she, ""thy images are whores, and thou art a whore-hunter; for doth not God say, 'You go a whoring after strange gods, figures of your own making? and thou art one of them.'"" After this she was ordered to be confined, and had no more liberty.

During the time of her imprisonment, many visited her, some sent by the bishop, and some of their own will, among these was one Daniel, a great preacher of the Gospel, in the days of King Edward, about Cornwall and Devonshire, but who, through the grievous persecution he had sustained, had fallen off. Earnestly did she exhort him to repent with Peter, and to be more constant in his profession.

Mrs. Walter Rauley and Mr. William and John Kede, persons of great respectability, bore ample testimony of her godly conversation, declaring, that unless God were with her, it were impossible she could have so ably defended the cause of Christ. Indeed, to sum up the character of this poor woman, she united the serpent and the dove, abounding in the highest wisdom joined to the greatest simplicity. She endured imprisonment, threatenings, taunts, and the vilest epithets, but nothing could induce her to swerve; her heart was fixed; she had cast anchor; nor could all the wounds of persecution remove her from the rock on which her hopes of felicity were built.

Such was her memory, that, without learning, she could tell in what chapter any text of Scripture was contained: on account of this singular property, one Gregory Basset, a rank papist, said she was deranged, and talked as a parrot, wild without meaning. At length, having tried every manner without effect to make her nominally a Catholic, they condemned her. After this, one exhorted her to leave her opinions, and go home to her family, as she was poor and illiterate. ""True, (said she) though I am not learned, I am content to be a witness of Christ's death, and I pray you make no longer delay with me; for my heart is fixed, and I will never say otherwise, nor turn to your superstitious doing.""

To the disgrace of Mr. Blackston, treasurer of the church, he would often send for this poor martyr from prison, to make sport for him and a woman whom he kept; putting religious questions to her, and turning her answers into ridicule. This done, he sent her back to her wretched dungeon, while he battened upon the good things of this world.

There was perhaps something simply ludicrous in the form of Mrs. Prest, as she was of a very short stature, thick set, and about fifty-four years of age; but her countenance was cheerful and lively, as if prepared for the day of her marriage with the Lamb. To mock at her form was an indirect accusation of her Creator, who framed her after the fashion He liked best, and gave her a mind that far excelled the transient endowments of perishable flesh. When she was offered money, she rejected it, ""because (said she) I am going to a city where money bears no mastery, and while I am here God has promised to feed me.""

When sentence was read, condemning her to the flames, she lifted up her voice and praised God, adding, ""This day have I found that which I have long sought."" When they tempted her to recant, ""That will I not, (said she) God forbid that I should lose the life eternal, for this carnal and short life. I will never turn from my heavenly husband to my earthly husband; from the fellowship of angels to mortal children; and if my husband and children be faithful, then am I theirs. God is my father, God is my mother, God is my sister, my brother, my kinsman; God is my friend, most faithful.""

Being delivered to the sheriff, she was led by the officer to the place of execution, without the walls of Exeter, called Sothenhey, where again the superstitious priests assaulted her. While they were tying her to the stake, she continued earnestly to exclaim ""God be merciful to me, a sinner!"" Patiently enduring the devouring conflagration, she was consumed to ashes, and thus ended a life which in unshaken fidelity to the cause of Christ, was not surpassed by that of any preceding martyr.
Richard Sharpe, Thomas Banion, and Thomas HaleMr. Sharpe, weaver, of Bristol, was brought the ninth day of March, 1556, before Dr. Dalby, chancellor of the city of Bristol, and after examination concerning the Sacrament of the altar, was persuaded to recant; and on the twenty-ninth, he was enjoined to make his recantation in the parish church. But, scarcely had he publicly avowed his backsliding, before he felt in his conscience such a tormenting fiend, that he was unable to work at his occupation; hence, shortly after, one Sunday, he came into the parish church, called Temple, and after high Mass, stood up in the choir door, and said with a loud voice, ""Neighbors, bear me record that yonder idol (pointing to the altar) is the greatest and most abominable that ever was; and I am sorry that ever I denied my Lord God!"" Notwithstanding the constables were ordered to apprehend him, he was suffered to go out of the church; but at night he was apprehended and carried to Newgate. Shortly after, before the chancellor, denying the Sacrament of the altar to be the body and blood of Christ, he was condemned to be burned by Mr. Dalby. He was burnt the seventh of May, 1558, and died godly, patiently, and constantly, confessing the Protestant articles of faith.With him suffered Thomas Hale, shoemaker, of Bristol, who was condemned by Chcnallor Dalby. These martyrs were bound back to back.

Thomas Banion, a weaver, was burnt on August 27, of the same year, and died for the sake of the evangelical cause of his Savior.
J. Corneford, of Wortham; C. Browne, of Maidstone; J. Herst, of Ashford; Alice Snoth, and Catharine Knight, an Aged WomanWith pleasure we have to record that these five martyrs were the last who suffered in the reign of Mary for the sake of the Protestant cause; but the malice of the papists was conspicuous in hastening their martyrdom, which might have been delayed until the event of the queen's illness was decided. It is reported that the archdeacon of Canterbury, judging that the sudden death of the queen would suspend the execution, travelled post from London, to have the satisfaction of adding another page to the black list of papistical sacrifices.

The articles against them were, as usual, the Sacramental elements and the idolatry of bending to images. They quoted St. John's words, ""Beware of images!"" and respecting the real presence, they urged according to St. Paul, ""the things which are seen are temporal."" When sentence was about to be read against them, and excommunication to take place in the regular form, John Corneford, illuminated by the Holy Spirit, awfully turned the latter proceeding against themselves, and in a solemn impressive manner, recriminated their excommunication in the following words: ""In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the most mighty God, and by the power of His Holy Spirit, and the authority of His holy Catholic and apostolic Church, we do here give into the hands of Satan to be destroyed, the bodies of all those blasphemers and heretics that maintain any error against His most holy Word, or do condemn His most holy truth for heresy, to the maintenance of any false church or foreign religion, so that by this Thy just judgment, O most mighty God, against Thy adversaries, Thy true religion may be known to Thy great glory and our comfort and to the edifying of all our nation. Good Lord, so be it. Amen.""

This sentence was openly pronounced and registered, and, as if Providence had awarded that it should not be delivered in vain, within six days after, Queen Mary died, detested by all good men and accursed of God!

Though acquainted with these circumstances, the archdeacon's implacability exceeded that of his great exemplary, Bonner, who, though he had several persons at that time under his fiery grasp, did not urge their deaths hastily, by which delay he certainly afforded them an opportunity of escape. At the queen's decease, many were in bonds: some just taken, some examined, and others condemned. The writs indeed were issued for several burnings, but by the death of the three instigators of Protestant murder-the chancellor, the bishop, and the queen, who fell nearly together, the condemned sheep were liberated, and lived many years to praise God for their happy deliverance.

These five martyrs, when at the stake, earnestly prayed that their blood might be the last shed, nor did they pray in vain. They died gloriously, and perfected the number God had selected to bear witness of the truth in this dreadful reign, whose names are recorded in the Book of Life; though last, not least among the saints made meet for immortality through the redeeming blood of the Lamb!

Catharine Finlay, alias Knight, was first converted by her son's expounding the Scriptures to her, which wrought in her a perfect work that terminated in martyrdom. Alice Snoth at the stake sent for her grandmother and godfather, and rehearsed to them the articles of her faith, and the Commandments of God, thereby convincing the world that she knew her duty. She died calling upon the spectators to bear witness that she was a Christian woman, and suffered joyfully for the testimony of Christ's Gospel.

Among the numberless enormities committed by the merciless and uhnfeeling Bonner, the murder of this innocent and unoffending child may be ranged as the most horrid. His father, John Fetty, of the parish of Clerkenwell, by trade a tailor, and only twenty-four years of age, had made blessed election; he was fixed secure in eternal hope, and depended on Him who so builds His Church that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. But alas! the very wife of his bosom, whose heart was hardened against the truth, and whose mind was influenced by the teachers of false doctrine, became his accuser. Brokenbery, a creature of the pope, and parson of the parish, received the information of this wedded Delilah, in consequence of which the poor man was apprehended. But here the awful judgment of an ever-righteous God, who is ""of purer eyes than to behold evil,"" fell upon this stone-hearted and perfidious woman; for no sooner was the injured husband captured by her wicked contriving, than she also was suddenly seized with madness, and exhibited an awful and awakening instance of God's power to punish the evil-doer. This dreadful circumstance had some effect upon the hearts of the ungodly hunters who had eagerly grasped their prey; but, in a relenting moment, they suffered him to remain with his unworthy wife, to return her good for evil, and to comfort two children, who, on his being sent to prison, would have been left without a protector, or have become a burden to the parish. As bad men act from little motives, we may place the indulgence shown him to the latter account.

We have noticed in the former part of our narratives of the martyrs, some whose affection would have led them even to sacrifice their own lives, to preserve their husbands; but here, agreeable to Scripture language, a mother proves, indeed, a monster in nature! Neither conjugal nor maternal affection could impress the heart of this disgraceful woman.

Although our afflicted Christian had experienced so much cruelty and falsehood from the woman who was bound to him by every tie both human and divine, yet, with a mild and forbearing spirit, he overlooked her misdeeds, during her calamity endeavoring all he could to procure relief for her malady, and soothing her by every possible expression of tenderness: thus she became in a few weeks nearly restored to her senses. But, alas! she returned again to her sin, ""as a dog returneth to his vomit."" Malice against the saints of the Most High was seated in her heart too firmly to be removed; and as her strength returned, her inclination to work wickedness returned with it. Her heart was hardened by the prince of darkness; and to her may be applied these afflicting and soul-harrowing words, ""Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil."" Weighing this text duly with another, ""I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,"" how shall we presume to refine away the sovereignty of God by arrainging Jehovah at the bar of human reason, which, in religious matters, is too often opposed by infinite wisdom? ""Broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat. Narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it."" The ways of heaven are indeed inscrutable, and it is our bounden duty to walk ever dependent on God, looking up to Him with humble confidence, and hope in His goodness, and ever confess His justice; and where we ""cannot unravel, there learn to trust."" This wretched woman, pursuing the horrid dictates of a heart hardened and depraved, was scarcely confirmed in her recovery, when, stifling the dictates of honor, gratitude, and every natural affection, she again accused her husband, who was once more apprehended, and taken before Sir John Mordant, knight, and one of Queen Mary's commissioners.

Upon examination, his judge finding him fixed in opinions which militated against those nursed by superstition and maintained by cruelty, he was sentenced to confinement and torture in Lollard's Tower. Here he was put into the painful stocks, and had a dish of water set by him, with a stone put into it, to what purpose God knoweth,e xcept it were to show that he should look for little other subsistence: which is credible enough, if we consider their like practices upon divers before mentioned in this history; as, among others, upon Richard Smith, who died through their cruel imprisonment touching whom, when a godly woman came to Dr. Story to have leave she might bury him, he asked her if he had any straw or blood in his mouth; but what he means thereby, I leave to the judgment of the wise.

On the first day of the third week of our martyr's sufferings, an object presented itself to his view, which made him indeed feel his tortures with all their force, and to execrate, with bitterness only short of cursing, the author of his misery. To mark and punish the proceedings of his tormentors, remained with the Most High, who noteth even the fall of a sparrow, and in whose sacred Word it is written, ""Vengeance is mine; I will repay."" This object was his own son, a child of the tender age of eight years. For fifteen days, had its hapless father been suspended by his tormentor by the right arm and left leg, and sometimes by both, shifting his positions for the purpose of giving him strength to bear and to lengthen the date of his sufferings. When the unoffending innocent, desirous of seeing and speaking to its parent, applied to Bonner for permission to do so, the poor child being asked by the bishop's chaplain the purport of his errand, he replied he wished to see his father. ""Who is thy father?"" said the chaplain. ""John Fetty,"" returned the boy, at the same time pointing to the place where he was confined. The interrogating miscreant on this said, ""Why, thy father is a heretic!"" The little champion again rejoined, with energy sufficient to raise admiration in any breast, except that of this unprincipled and unfeeling wretch-this miscreant, eager to execute the behests of a remoseless queen-""My father is no heretic: for you have Balaam's mark.""

Irritated by reproach so aptly applied, the indignant and mortified priest concealed his resentment for a moment, and took the undaunted boy into the house, where having him secure, he presented him to others, whose baseness and cruelty being equal to his own, they stripped him to the skin, and applied their scourges to so violent a degree, that, fainting beneath the stripes inflicted on his tender frame, and covered with the blood that flowed from them, the victim of their ungodly wrath was ready to expire under his heavy and unmerited punishment.

In this bleeding and helpless state was the suffering infant, covered only with his shirt, taken to his father by one of the actors in the horrid tragedy, who, while he exhibited the heart-rending spectacle, made use of the vilest taunts, and exulted in what he had done. The dutiful child, as if recovering strength at the sight of his father, on his knees implored his blessing. ""Alas! Will,"" said the afflicted parent, in trembling amazement, ""who hath done this to thee!"" the artless innocent related the circumstances that led to the merciless correction which had been so basely inflicted on him; but when he repeated the reproof bestowed on the chaplain, and which was prompted by an undaunted spirit, he was torn from his weeping parent, and conveyed again to the house, where he remained a close prisoner.

Bonner, somewhat fearful that what had been done could not be justified even among the bloodhounds of his own voracious pack, concluded in his dark and wicked mind, to release John Fetty, for a time at least, from the severities he was enduring in the glorious cause of everlasting truth! whose bright rewards are fixed beyond the boundaries of time, within the confines of eternity; where the arrow of the wicked cannot wound, even ""where there shall be no more sorrowing for the blessed, who, in the mansion of eternal bliss shall glorify the Lamb forever and ever."" He was accordingly by order of Bonner, (how disgraceful to all dignity, to say bishop!) liberated from the painful bonds, and led from Lollard's Tower, to the chamber of that ungodly and infamous butcher, where he found the bishop bathing himself before a great fire; and at his first entering the chamber, Fetty said, ""God be here and peace!"" ""God be here and peace, (said Bonner,) that is neither God speed nor good morrow!"" ""If ye kick against this peace, (said Fetty), then this is not the place that I seek for.""

A chaplain of the bishop, standing by, turned the poor man about, and thinking to abash him, said, in mocking wise, ""What have we here-a player!"" While Fetty was thus standing in the bishop's chamber, he espied, hanging about the bishop's bed, a pair of great black beads, whereupon he said, ""My Lord, I think the hangman is not far off: for the halter (pointing to the beads) is here already!"" At which words the bishop was in a marvellous rage. Then he immediately after espied also, standing in the bishop's chamber, in the window, a little crucifix. Then he asked the bishop what it was, and he answered, that it was Christ. ""Was He handled as cruelly as He is here pictured!"" said Fetty. ""Yea, that He was,"" said the bishop. ""And even so cruelly will you handle such as come before you; for you are unto God's people as Caiaphas was unto Christ!"" The bishop, being in a great fury, said, ""Thou art a vile heretic, and I will burn thee, or else I will spend all I have, unto my gown."" ""Nay, my Lord, (said Fetty) you were better to give it to some poor body, that he may pray for you."" Bonner, notwithstanding his passion, which was raised to the utmost by the calm and pointed remarks of this observing Christian, thought it most prudent to dismiss the father, on account of the nearly murdered child. His coward soul trembled for the consequences which might ensue; fear is inseparable from little minds; and this dastardly pampered priest experienced its effects so far as to induce him to assume the appearance of that he was an utter stranger to, namely, MERCY.

The father, on being dismissed, by the tyrant Bonner, went home with a heavy heart, with his dying child, who did not survive many days the cruelties which had been inflicted on him.

How contrary to the will of our great King and Prophet, who mildly taught His followers, was the conduct of this sanguinary and false teacher, this vile apostate from his God to Satan! But the archfiend had taken entire possession of his heart, and guided every action of the sinner he had hardened; who, given up to terrible destruction, was running the race of the wicked, marking his footsteps with the blood of the saints, as if eager to arrive at the goal of eternal death.
Deliverance of Dr. SandsThis eminent prelate, vice-chancellor of Cambridge, at the request of the duke of Northumberland, when he came down to Cambridge in support of Lady Jane Grey's claim to the throne, undertook at a few hours' notice, to preach before the duke and the university. The text he took was such as presented itself in opening the Bible, and a more appropriate one he could not have chosen, namely, the three last verses of Joshua. As God gave him the text, so He gave him also such order and utterance that it excited the most lively emotions in his numerous auditors. The sermon was about to be sent to London to be printed, when news arrived that the duke had returned and Queen Mary was proclaimed.

The duke was immediately arrested, and Dr. Sands was compelled by the university to give up his office. He was arrested by the queen's order, and when Mr. Mildmay wondered that so learned a man could wilfully incur danger, and speak against so good a princess as Mary, the doctor replied, ""If I would do as Mr. Mildmay has done, I need not fear bonds. He came down armed against Queen Mary; before a trator-now a great friend. I cannot with one mouth blow hot and cold in this manner."" A general plunder of Dr. Sands' property ensued, and he was brought to London upon a wretched horse. Various insults he met on the way from the bigoted Catholics, and as he passed through Bishopsgate-street, a stone struck him to the ground. He was the first prisoner that entered the Tower, in that day, on a religious account; his man was admitted with his Bible, but his shirts and other articles were taken from him.

On Mary's coronation day the doors of the dungeon were so laxly guarded that it was easy to escape. A Mr. Mitchell, like a true friend, came to him, afforded him his own clothes as a disguise, and was willing to abide the consequence of being found in his place. This was a rare friendship: but he refused the offer; saying, ""I know no cause why I should be in prison. To do thus were to make myself guilty. I will expect God's good will, yet do I think myself much obliged to you""; and so Mr. Mitchell departed.

With Doctor Sands was imprisoned Mr. Bradford; they were kept close in prison twenty-nine weeks. John Fowler, their keeper, was a perverse papist, yet, by often persuading him, at length he began to favor the Gospel, and was so persuaded in the true religion, that on a Sunday, when they had Mass in the chapel, Dr. Sands administered the Communion to Bradford and to Fowler. Thus Fowler was their son begotten in bonds. To make room for Wyat and his accomplices, Dr. Sands and nine other preachers were sent to the Marshalsea.

The keeper of the Marshalsea appointed to every preacher a man to lead him in the street; he caused them to go on before, and he and Dr. Sands followed conversing together. By this time popery began to be unsavory. After they had passed the bridge, the keeper said to Dr. Sands: ""I perceive the vain people would set you forward to the fire. You are as vain as they, if you, being a young man, will stand in your own conceit, and prefer your own judgment before that of so many worthy prelates, ancient, learned, and grave men as be in this realm. If you do so, you shall find me a severe keeper, and one that utterly dislikes your religion."" Dr. Sands answered, ""I know my years to be young, and my learning but small; it is enough to know Christ crucified, and he hath learned nothing who seeth not the great blasphemy that is in popery. I will yield unto God, and not unto man; I have read in the Scriptures of many godly and couretous keepers: may God make you one! if not, I trust He will give me strength and patience to bear your hard usage."" Then said the keeper, ""Are you resolved to stand to your religion?"" ""Yes,"" quoth the doctor, ""by God's grace!"" ""Truly,"" said the keeper, ""I love you the better for it; I did but tempt you: what favor I can show you, you shall be assured of; and I shall think myself happy if I might die at the stake with you.""

He was as good as his word, for he trusted the doctor to walk in the fields alone, where he met with Mr. Bradford, who was also a prisoner in the King's Bench, and had found the same favor from his keeper. At his request, he put Mr. Saunders in along with him, to be his bedfellow, and the Communion was administered to a great number of communicants.

When Wyat with his army came to Southwark, he offered to liberate all the imprisoned Protestants, but Dr. Sands and the rest of the preachers refused to accept freedom on such terms.

After Dr. Sands had been nine weeks prisoner in the Marshalsea, by the mediation of Sir Thomas Holcroft, knight marshal, he was set at liberty. Though Mr. Holcroft had the queen's warrant, the bishop commanded him not to set Dr. Sands at liberty, until he had taken sureties of two gentlemen with him, each one bound in œ500, that Dr. Sands should not depart out of the realm without license. Mr. Holcroft immediately after met with two gentlemen of the north, friends and cousins to Dr. Sands, who offered to be bound for him.

After dinner, the same day, Sir Thomas Holcroft sent for Dr.

Sands to his lodgings at Westminster, to communicate to him all he had done. Dr. Sands answered: ""I give God thanks, who hath moved your heart to mind me so well, that I think myself most bound unto you. God shall requite you, nor shall I ever be found unthankful. But as you have dealt friendly with me, I will also deal plainly with you. I came a freeman into prison; I will not go forth a bondman. As I cannot benefit my friends, so will I not hurt them. And if I be set at liberty, I will not tarry six days in this realm, if I may get out. If therefore I may not get free forth, send me to the Marshalsea again, and there you shall be sure of me.""

This answer Mr. Holcroft much disapproved of; but like a true friend he replied: ""Seeing you cannot be altered, I will change my purpose, and yield unto you. Come of it what will, I will set you at liberty; and seeing you have a mind to go over sea, get you gone as quick as you can. One thing I require of you, that, while you are there, you write nothing to me hither, for this may undo me.""

Dr. Sands having taken an affectionate farewell of him and his other friends in bonds, departed. He went by Winchester house, and there took boat, and came to a friend's house in London, called William Banks, and tarried there one night. The next night he went to another friend's house, and there he heard that strict search was making for him, by Gardiner's express order.

Dr. Sands now conveyed himself by night to one Mr. Berty's house, a stranger who was in the Marshalsea prison with him a while; he was a good Protestant and dwelt in Mark-lane. There he was six days, and then removed to one of his acquaintances in Cornhill; he caused his man Quinton to provide two geldings for him, resolved on the morrow to ride into Essex, to Mr. Sands, his father-in-law, where his wife was, which, after a narrow escape, he effected. He had not been theretwo hours, before Mr. Sands was told that two of the guards would that night apprehend Dr. Sands.

That night Dr. Sands was guided to an honest farmer's near the sea, where he tarried two days and two nights in a chamber without company. After that he removed to one James Mower's, a shipmaster, who dwelt at Milton-Shore, where he waited for a wind to Flanders. While he was there, James Mower brought to him forty or fifty mariners, to whom he gave an exhortation; they liked him so well that they promised to die rather than he should be apprehended.

The sixth of May, Sunday, the wind served. In taking leave of his hostess, who had been married eight years without having a child, he gave her a fine handkerchief and an old royal of gold, and said, ""Be of good comfort; before that one whole year be past, God shall give you a child, a boy."" This came to pass, for, that day twelve-month, wanting one day, God gave her a son.

Scarcely had he arrived at Antwerp, when he learned that King Philip had sent to apprehend him. He next flew to Augsburg, in Cleveland, where Dr. Sands tarried fourteen days, and then travelled towards Strassburg, where, after he had lived one year, his wife came to him. He was sick of a flux nine months, and had a child which died of the plague. His amiable wife at length fell into a consumption, and died in his arms. When his wife was dead, he went to Zurich, and there was in Peter Martyr's house for the space of five weeks.

As they sat at dinner one day, word was suddenly brought that Queen Mary was dead, and Dr. Sands was sent for by his friends at Strassburg, where he preached. Mr. Grindal and he came over to England, and arrived in London the same day that Queen Elizabeth was crowned. This faithful servant of Christ, under Queen Elizabeth, rose to the highest distinction in the Church, being successively bishop of Worcester, bishop of London, and archbishop of York.
Queen Mary's Treatment of Her Sister, the Princess ElizabethThe preservation of Princess Elizabeth may be reckoned a remarkable instance of the watchful eye which Christ had over His Church. The bigotry of Mary regarded not the ties of consanguinity, of natural affection, of national succession. Her mind, physically morose, was under the dominion of men who possessed not the milk of human kindness, and whose principles werre sanctioned and enjoined by the idolatrous tenets of the Romish pontiff. Could they have foreseen the short date of Mary's reign, they would have imbrued their hands in the Protestant blood of Elizabeth, and, as a sine qua non of the queen's salvation, have compelled her to bequeath the kingdom to some Catholic prince. The contest might have been attended with the horrors incidental to a religious civil war, and calamities might have been felt in England similar to those under Henry the Great in France, whom Queen Elizabeth assisted in opposing his priest-ridden Catholic subjects. As if Providence had the perpetual establishment of the Protestant faith in view, the difference of the duration of the two reigns is worthy of notice. Mary might have reigned many years in the course of nature, but the course of grace willed it otherwise. Five years and four months was the time of persecution alloted to this weak, disgraceful reign, while that of Elizabeth reckoned a number of years among the highest of those who have sat on the English throne, almost nine times that of her merciless sister!

Before Mary attained the crown, she treated Elizabeth with a sisterly kindness, but from that period her conduct was altered, and the most imperious distance substituted. Though Elizabeth had no concern in the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyat, yet she was apprehended, and treated as a culprit in that commotion. The manner too of her arrest was similar to the mind that dictated it: the three cabinet members, whom she deputed to see the arrest executed, rudely entered the chamber at ten o'clock at night, and, though she was extremely ill, they could scarcely be induced to let her remain until the following morning. Her enfeebled state permitted her to be moved only by short stages in a journey of such length to London; but the princess, though afflicted in person, had a consolation in mind which her sister never could purchase: the people, through whom she passed on her way pitied her, and put up their prayers for her preservation.

Arrived at court, she was made a close prisoner for a fortnight, without knowing who was her accuser, or seeing anyone who could console or advise her. The charge, however, was at length unmasked by Gardiner, who, with nineteen of the Council, accused her of abetting Wyat's conspiracy, which she religiously affirmed to be false. Failing in this, they placed against her the transactions of Sir Peter Carew in the west, in which they were as unsuccessful as in the former. The queen now signified that it was her pleasure she should be committed to the Tower, a step which overwhelmed the princess with the greatest alarm and uneasiness. In vain she hoped the queen's majesty would not commit her to such a place; but there was no lenity to be expected; her attendants were limited, and a hundred northern soldiers appointed to guard her day and night.

On Palm Sunday she was conducted to the Tower. When she came to the palace garden, she cast her eyes towards the windows, eagerly anxious to meet those of the queen, but she was disappointed. A strict order was given in London that every one should go to church, and carry palms, that she might be conveyed without clamor or commiseration to her prison.

At the time of passing under London Bridge the fall of the tide made it very dangerous, and the barge some time stuck fast against the starlings. To mortify her the more, she was landed at Traitors' Stairs. As it rained fast, and she was obliged to step in the water to land, she hesitated; but this excited no complaisance in the lord in waiting. When she set her foot on the steps, she exclaimed, ""Here lands as true a subject, being prisoner, as ever landed at these stairs; and before Thee, O God, I speak it, having no friend but Thee alone!""

A large number of the wardens and servants of the Tower were arranged in order between whom the princess had to pass. Upon inquiring the use of this parade, she was informed it was customary to do so. ""If,"" said she, ""it is on account of me, I beseech you that they may be dismissed."" On this the poor men knelt down, and prayed that God would preserve her grace, for which they were the next day turned out of their employments. The tragic scene must have been deeply interesting, to see an amiable and irreproachable princess sent like a lamb to languish in expectation of cruelty and death; against whom there was no other charge than her superiority in Christian virtues and acquired endowments. Her attendants openly wept as she proceeded with a dignified step to the frowning battlements of her destination. ""Alas!"" said Elizabeth, ""what do you mean? I took you to comfort, not to dismay me; for my truth is such that no one shall have cause to weep for me.""

The next step of her enemies was to procure evidence by means which, in the present day, are accounted detestable. Many poor prisoners were racked, to extract, if possible, any matters of accusation which might affect her life, and thereby gratify Gardiner's sanguinary disposition. He himself came to examine her, respecting her removal from her house at Ashbridge to Dunnington castle a long while before. The princess had quite forgotten this trivial circumstance, and Lord Arundel, after the investigation, kneeling down, apologized for having troubled her in such a frivolous matter. ""You sift me narrowly,"" replied the princess, ""but of this I am assured, that God has appointed a limit to your proceedings; and so God forgive you all.""

Her own gentlemen, who ought to have been her purveyors, and served her provision, were compelled to give place to the common soldiers, at the command of the constable of the Tower, who was in every respect a servile tool of Gardiner; her grace's friends, however, procured an order of Council which regulated this petty tyranny more to her satisfaction.

After having been a whole month in close confinement, she sent for the lord chamberlain and Lord Chandois, to whom she represented the ill state of her health from a want of proper air and exercise. Application being made to the Council, Elizabeth was with some difficulty admitted to walk in the queen's lodgings, and afterwards in the garden, at which time the prisoners on that side were attended by their keepers, and not suffered to look down upon her. Their jealousy was excited by a child of four years, who daily brought flowers to the princess. The child was threatened with a whipping, and the father ordered to keep him from the princess's chambers.

On the fifth of May the constable was discharged from his office, and Sir Henry Benifield appointed in his room, accompanied by a hundred ruffian-looking soldiers in blue. This measure created considerable alarm in the mind of the princess, who imagined it was preparatory to her undergoing the same fate as Lady Jane Grey, upon the same block. Assured that this project was not in agitation, she entertained an idea that the new keeper of the Tower was commissioned to make away with her privately, as his equivocal character was in conformity with the ferocious inclination of those by whom he was appointed.

A report now obtained that her Grace was to be taken away by the new constable and his soldiers, which in the sequel proved to be true. An order of Council was made for her removal to the manor Woodstock, which took place on Trinity Sunday, May 13, under the authority of Sir Henry Benifield and Lord Tame. The ostensible cause of her removal was to make room for other prisoners. Richmond was the first place they stopped at, and here the princess slept, not however without much alarm at first, as her own servants were superseded by the soldiers, who were placed as guards at her chamber door. Upon representation, Lord Tame overruled this indecent stretch of power, and granted her perfect safety while under his custody.

In passing through Windsor, she saw several of her poor dejected servants waiting to see her. ""Go to them,"" said she, to one of her attendants, ""and say these words from me, tanquim ovis, that is, like a sheep to the slaughter.""

The next night her Grace lodged at the house of a Mr. Dormer, in her way to which the people manifested such tokens of loyal affection that Sir Henry was indignant, and bestowed on them very liberally the names of rebels and traitors. In some villages they rang the bells for joy, imagining the princess's arrival among them was from a very different cause; but this harmless demonstration of gladness was sufficient with the persecuting Benifield to order his soldiers to seize and set these humble persons in the stocks.

The day following, her Grace arrived at Lord Tame's house, where she stayed all night, and was most nobly entertained. This excited Sir Henry's indignation, and made him caution Lord Tame to look well to his proceedings; but the humanity of Lord Tame was not to be frightened, and he returned a suitable reply. At another time, this official prodigal, to show his consequence and disregard of good manners, went up into a chamber, where was appointed for her Grace a chair, two cushions, and a foot carpet, wherein he presumptuously sat and called his man to pull off his boots. As soon as it was known to the ladies and gentlemen they laughed him to scorn. When supper was done, he called to his lordship, and directed that all gentlemen and ladies should withdraw home, marvelling much that he would permit such a large company, considering the great charge he had committed to him. ""Sir Henry,"" said his lordship, ""content yourself; all shall be avoided, your men and all."" ""Nay, but my soldiers,"" replied Sir Henry, ""shall watch all night."" Lord Tame answered, ""There is no need."" ""Well,"" said he, ""need or need not, they shall so do.""

The next day her Grace took her journey from thence to Woodstock, where she was enclosed, as before in the Tower of London, the soldiers keeping guard within and without the walls, every day, to the number of sixty; and in the night, without the walls were forty during all the time of her imprisonment.

At length she was permitted to walk in the gardens, but under the most severe restrictions, Sir Henry keeping the keys himself, and placing her always under many bolts and locks, whence she was induced to call him her jailer, at which he felt offended, and begged her to substitute the word officer. After much earnest entreaty to the Council, she obtained permission to write to the queen; but the jailer who brought her pen, ink, and paper stood by her while she wrote, and, when she left off, he carried the things away until they were wanted again. He also insisted upon carrying it himself to the queen, but Elizabeth would not suffer him to be the bearer, and it was presented by one of her gentlemen.

After the letter, Doctors Owen and Wendy went to the princess, as the state of her health rendered medical assistance necessary. They stayed with her five or six days, in which time she grew much better; they then returned to the queen, and spoke flatteringly of the princess' submission and humility, at which the queen seemed moved; but the bishops wanted a concession that she had offended her majesty. Elizabeth spurned this indirect mode of acknowledging herself guilty. ""If I have offended,"" said she, ""and am guilty, I crave no mercy but the law, which I am certain I should have had ere this, if anything could have been proved against me. I wish I were as clear from the peril of my enemies; then should I not be thus bolted and locked up within walls and doors.""

Much question arose at this time respecting the propriety of uniting the princess to some foreigner, that she might quit the realm with a suitable portion. One of the Council had the brutality to urge the necessity of beheading her, if the king (Philip) meant to keep the realm in peace; but the Spaniards, detesting such a base thought, replied, ""God forbid that oiur king and master should consent to such an infamous proceeding!"" Stimulated by a noble principle, the Spaniards from this time repeatedly urged to the king that it would do him the highest honor to liberate the Lady Elizabeth, nor was the king impervious to their solicitation. He took her out of prison, and shortly after she was sent for to Hampton court. It may be remarked in this place, that the fallacy of human reasoning is shown in every moment. The barbarian who suggested the policy of beheading Elizabeth little contemplated the change of condition which his speech would bring about. In her journey from Woodstock, Benifield treated her with the same severity as before; removing her on a stormy day, and not suffering her old servant, who had come to Colnbrook, where she slept, to speak to her.

She remained a fortnight strictly guarded and watched, before anyone dared to speak with her; at length the vile Gardiner with three more of the Council, came with great submission. Elizabeth saluted them, remarked that she had been for a long time kept in solitary confinement, and begged they would intercede with the king and queen to deliver her from prison. Gardiner's visit was to draw from the princess a confession of her guilt; but she was guarded against his subtlety, adding, that, rather than admit she had done wrong, she would lie in prison all the rest of her life. The next day Gardiner came again, and kneeling down, declared that the queen was astonished she would persist in affirming that she was blameless-whence it would be inferred that the queen had unjustly imprisoned her grace. Gardiner further informed her that the queen had declared that she must tell another tale, before she could be set at liberty. ""Then,"" replied the high-minded Elizabeth, ""I had rather be in prison with honesty and truth, than have my liberty, and be suspected by her majesty. What I have said, I will stand to; nor will I ever speak falsehood!"" The bishop and his friends then departed, leaving her locked up as before.

Seven days after the queen sent for Elizabeth at ten o'clock at night; two years had elapsed since they had seen each other. It created terror in the mind of the princess, who, at setting out, desired her gentlemen and ladies to pray for her, as her return to them again was uncertain.

Being conducted to the queen's bedchamber, upon entering it the princess knelt down, and having begged of God to preserve her majesty, she humbly assured her that her majesty had not a more loyal subject in the realm, whatever reports might be circulated to the contrary. With a haughty ungraciousness, the imperious queen replied: ""You will not confess your offence, but stand stoutly to your truth. I pray God it may so fall out.""

""If it do not,"" said Elizabeth, ""I request neither favor nor pardon at your majesty's hands."" ""Well,"" said the queen, ""you stiffly still persevere in your truth. Besides, you will not confess that you have not been wrongfully punished.""

""I must not say so, if it please your majesty, to you.""

""Why, then,"" said the queen, ""belike you will to others.""

""No, if it please your majesty: I have borne the burden, and must bear it. I humbly beseech your majesty to have a good opinion of me and to think me to be your subject, not only from the beginning hitherto, but for ever, as long as life lasteth."" They departed without any heartfelt satisfaction on either side; nor can we think the conduct of Elizabeth displayed that independence and fortitude which accompanies perfect innocence. Elizabeth's admitting that she would not say, neither to the queen nor to others, that she had been unjustly punished, was in direct contradiction to what she had told Gardiner, and must have arisen from some motive at this time inexplicable. King Philip is supposed to have been secretly concealed during the interview, and to have been friendly to the princess.

In seven days from the time of her return to imprisonment, her severe jailer and his men were discharged, and she was set at liberty, under the constraint of being always attended and watched by some of the queen's Council. Four of her gentlemen were sent to the Tower without any other charge against them than being zealous servants of their mistress. This event was soon after followed by the happy news of Gardiner's death, for which all good and merciful men glorified God, inasmuch as it had taken the chief tiger from the den, and rendered the life of the Protestant successor of Mary more secure.

This miscreant, while the princess was in the Tower, sent a secret writ, signed by a few of the Council, for her private execution, and, had Mr. Bridges, lieutenant of the Tower, been as little scrupulous of dark assassination as this pious prelate was, she must have perished. The warrant not having the queen's signature, Mr. Bridges hastened to her majesty to give her information of it, and to know her mind. This was a plot of Winchester's, who, to convict her of treasonable practices, caused several prisoners to be racked; particularly Mr. Edmund Tremaine and Smithwicke were offered considerable bribes to accuse the guiltless princess.

Her life was several times in danger. While at Woodstock, fire was apparently put between the boards and ceiling under which she lay. It was also reported strongly that one Paul Penny, the keeper of Woodstock, a notorious ruffian, was appointed to assassinate her, but, however this might be, God counteracted in this point the nefarious designs of the enemies of the Reformation. James Basset was another appointed to perform the same deed: he was a peculiar favorite of Gardiner, and had come within a mile of Woodstock, intending to speak with Benifield on the subject. The goodness of God however so ordered it that while Basset was travelling to Woodstock, Benifield, by an order of Council, was going to London: in consequence of which, he left a positive order with his brother, that no man should be admitted to the princess during his absence, not even with a note from the queen; his brother met the murderer, but the latter's intention was frustrated, as no admission could be obtained.

When Elizabeth quitted Woodstock, she left the following lines written with her diamond on the window:

Much suspected by me,

Nothing proved can be. Quoth Elizabeth, prisoner.

With the life of Winchester ceased the extreme danger of the princess, as many of her other secret enemies soon after followed him, and, last of all, her cruel sister, who outlived Gardiner but three years.

The death of Mary was ascribed to several causes. The Council endeavored to console her in her last moments, imagining it was the absence of her husband that lay heavy at her heart, but though his treatment had some weight, the loss of Calais, the last fortress possessed by the English in France, was the true source of her sorrow. ""Open my heart,"" said Mary, ""when I am dead, and you shall find Calais written there."" Religion caused her no alarm; the priests had lulled to rest every misgiving of conscience, which might have obtruded, on account of the accusing spirits of the murdered martyrs. Not the blood she had spilled, but the loss of a town excited her emotions in dying, and this last stroke seemed to be awarded, that her fanatical persecution might be paralleled by her political imbecility.

We earnestly pray that the annals of no country, Catholic or pagan, may ever be stained with such a repetition of human sacrifices to papal power, and that the detestation in which the character of Mary is holden, may be a beacon to succeeding monarchs to avoid the rocks of fanaticism!
God's Punishment upon Some of the Persecutors of His People in Mary's ReignAfter that arch-persecutor, Gardiner, was dead, others followed, of whom Dr. Morgan, bishop of St. David's, who succeeded Bishop Farrar, is to be noticed. Not long after he was installed in his bishoipric, he was stricken by the visitation of God; his food passed through the throat, but rose again with great violence. In this manner, almost literally starved to death, he terminated his existence.

Bishop Thornton, suffragan of Dover, was an indefatigable persecutor of the true Church. One day after he had exercised his cruel tyranny upon a number of pious persons at Canterbury, he came from the chapter-house to Borne, where as he stood on a Sunday looking at his men playing at bowls, he fell down in a fit of the palsy, and did not long survive.

After the latter, succeeded another bishop or suffragen, ordained by Gardiner, who not long after he had been raised to the see of Dover, fell down a pair of stairs in the cardinal's chamber at Greenwich, and broke his neck. He had just received the cardinal's blessing-he could receive nothing worse.

John Cooper, of Watsam, Suffolk, suffered by perjury; he was from private pique persecuted by one Fenning, who suborned two others to swear that they heard Cooper say, 'If God did not take away Queen Mary, the devil would.' Cooper denied all such words, but Cooper was a Proestant and a heretic, and therefore he was hung, drawn and quartered, his property confiscated, and his wife and nine children reduced to beggary. The following harvest, however, Grimwood of Hitcham, one of the witnesses before mentioned, was visited for his villainy: while at work, stacking up corn, his bowels suddenly burst out, and before relief could be obtained, her died. Thus was deliberate perjury rewarded by sudden death!

In the case of the martyr Mr. Bradford, the severity of Mr.

Sheriff Woodroffe has been noticed-he rejoiced at the death of the saints, and at Mr. Rogers' execution, he broke the carman's head, because he stopped the cart to let the martyr's children take a last farewell of him. Scarcely had Mr. Woodroffe's sheriffalty expired a week, when he was struck with a paralytic affection, and languished a few days in the most pitable and helpless condition, presenting a striking contrast to his former activity in the cause of blood.

Ralph Lardyn, who betrayed the martyr George Eagles, is believed to have been afterward arraigned and hanged in consequence of accusing himself. At the bar, he denounced himself in these words: ""This has most justly fallen upon me, for betraying the innocent blood of that just and good man George Eagles, who was here condemned in the time of Queen Mary by my procurement, when I sold his blood for a little money.""

As James Abbes was going to execution, and exhorting the pitying bystanders to adhere steadfastly to the truth, and like him to seal the cause of Christ with their blood, a servant of the sheriff's interrupted him, and blasphemously called his religion heresy, and the good man a lunatic. Scarcely however had the flames reached the martyr, before the fearful stroke of God fell upn the hardened wretch, in the presence of him he had so cruelly ridiculed. The man was suddenly seized with lunacy, cast off his clothes and shoes before the people, (as Abbes had done just before, to distribute among some poor persons,) at the same time exclaiming, ""Thus did James Abbes, the true servant of God, who is saved by I am damned."" Repeating this often, the sheriff had him secured, and made him put his clothes on, but no sooner was he alone, than he tore them off, and exclaimed as before. Being tied in a cart, he was conveyed to his master's house, and in about half a year he died; just before which a priest came to attend him, with the crucifix, etc., but the wretched man bade him take away such trumpery, and said that he and other priests had been the cause of his damnation, but that Abbes was saved.

One Clark, an avowed enemy of the Protestants in King Edward's reign, hung himself in the Tower of London.

Froling, a priest of much celebrity, fell down in the street and died on the spot.

Dale, an indefatigable informer, was consumed by vermin, and died a miserable spectacle.

Alexander, the severe keeper of Newgate, died miserably, swelling to a prodigious size, and became so inwardly putrid, that none could come near him. This cruel minister of the law would go to Bonner, Story, and others, requesting them to rid his prison, he was so much pestered with heretics! The son of this keeper, in three years after his father's death, dissipated his great property, and died suddenly in Newgate market. ""The sins of the father,"" says the decalogue, ""shall be visited on the children."" John Peter, son-in-law of Alexander, a horrid blasphemer and persecutor, died wretchedly. When he affirmed anything, he would say, ""If it be not true, I pray I may rot ere I die."" This awful state visited him in all its loathsomeness.

Sir Ralph Ellerker was eagerly desirous to see the heart taken out of Adam Damlip, who was wrongfully put to death. Shortly after Sir Ralph was slain by the French, who mangled him dreadfully, cut off his limbs, and tore his heart out.

When Gardiner heard of the miserable end of Judge Hales, he called the profession of the Gospel a doctrine of desperation; but he forgot that the judge's despondency arose after he had consented to the papistry. But with more reason may this be said of the Catholic tenets, if we consider the miserable end of Dr. Pendleton, Gardiner, and most of the leading persecutors. Gardiner, upon his death bed, was reminded by a bishop of Peter denying his master, ""Ah,"" said Gardiner, ""I have denied with Peter, but never repented with Peter.""

After the accession of Elizabeth, most of the Catholic prelates were imprisoned in the Tower or the Fleet; Bonner was put into the Marshalsea.

Of the revilers of God's Word, we detail, among many others, the following occurrence. One William Maldon, living at Greenwich in servitude, was instructing himself profitably in reading an English primer one winter's evening. A serving man, named John Powell, sat by, and ridiculed all that Maldon said, who cautioned him not to make a jest of the Word of God. Powell nevertheless continued, until Maldon came to certain English Prayers, and read aloud, ""Lord, have mercy upon us, Christ have mercy upon us,"" etc. Suddenly the reviler started, and exclaimed, ""Lord, have mercy upon us!"" He was struck with the utmost terror of mind, said the evil spirit could not abide that Christ should have any mercy upon him, and sunk into madness. He was remitted to Bedlam, and became an awful warning that God will not always be insulted with impunity.

Henry Smith, a student in the law, had a pious Protesant father, of Camben, in Gloucestershire, by whom he was virtuously educated. While studying law in the middle temple, he was induced to profess Catholicism, and, going to Louvain, in France, he returned with pardons, crucifixes, and a great freight of popish toys. Not content with these things, he openly reviled the Gospel religion he had been brought up in; but conscience one night reproached him so dreadfully, that in a fit of despair he hung himself in his garters. He was buried in a lane, without the Christian service being read over him.

Dr. Story, whose name has been so often mtnioned in the preceding pages, was reserved to be cut off by public execution, a practice in which he had taken great delight when in power. He is supposed to have had a hand in most of the conflagrations in Mary's time, and was even ingenious in his invention of new modes of inflicting torture. When Elizabeth came to the throne, he was committed to prison, but unaccountably effected his escape to the continent, to carry fire and sword there among the Protestant brethren. From the duke of Alva, at Antwerp, he received a special commission to search all ships for contraband goods, and particularly for English heretical books.

Dr. Story gloried in a commission that was ordered by Providence to be his ruin, and to preserve the faithful from his sanguinary cruelty. It was contrived that one Parker, a merchant, should sail to Antwerp and information should be given to Dr. Story that he had a quantity of heretical books on board. The latter no sooner heard this, than he hastened to the vessel, sought everywhere above, and then went under the hatches, which were fastened down upon him. A prosperous gale brought the ship to England, and this traitorous, persecuting rebel was committed to prison, where he remained a considerable time, obstinately objecting to recant his Anti-christian spirit, or admit of Queen Elizabeth's supremacy. He alleged, though by birth and education an Englishman, that he was a sworn subject of the king of Spain, in whose service the famous duke of Alva was. The doctor being condemned, was laid upon a hurdle, and drawn from the Tower to Tyburn, where after being suspended about half an hour, he was cut down, stripped, and the executioner displayed the heart of a traitor.

In nothin' but my buffalo briefs
I got them standin' in line

Did you love me only in my head?
There were things you said and did to me

Well nah, he's not a mad man, he's a cat man
He'll end up with the Catwoman like Batman
His screensaver is a cat doing jazz hands
And he gets way to hyped up over cat scans
He likes munching on his chap stick
Cuddling with fat chicks
Huffing on some catnip and suckling on cat nips

But my life has been harder here lately
So I can't promise that my bars will be crazy
But I had five seizures last year
So it's okay if I start a little shaky
His rhythm is weak plus you look a little beat
You got the heart of a baby

Yesterday I ate part of a pastry
From an artisan bakery, it was large and amazing
It wasn't hard it was flaky and every part of it's tasty
You can catch me parking an H3

Hit you with a Force that'll make Yoda lean

Girls crushing my hopes and dreams

And prove I run these streets like an avid jogger
Then use my hands like I'm bad at soccer
Grab the choppers, start blasting monsters

You wear a pair of Pull Ups when you pull up at your grandma's house
Sheets covered in plastic like your grandma's couch
Man you getting bodied by nothing but pee jokes
You probably eat pea soup while wearing a pea coat
Got URL fans saying ""Where the gun bars at?""
Me and Carter got it covered bringing gun bars back
The streets talk, gotta keep watch
Eaves drop from the tree tops
Three shots, bring your Reeboks cause I keep Glocks in my knee socks
Cheap talk in the T Dot gets you outlined in police chalk

Catch you on a Friday see me sitting sideways
Till I pullout out of nowhere like a hidden driveway

After I show you these long Tec's/texts like Rev Run in a bubble bath
Okay, that's not true at all but here are some other facts
You paid for this battle and you can't rebuttal back
Cause I know exactly how much it cost you...and I paid double that!
I didn't even want to do this
But I was bored this weekend, thought I might as well
I don't care about this battle at all
I just wanted to spend $500 on a flight and hotel
You watch The Bachelor, but last week he was busy
Didn't have any time and missed it
You thought I'd be a nice guy, forget it
Cause I'm about to give you so many spoilers you'd think I'd drive a Civic
Like for instance:
Ben took Jen on a date but still saw Liz on his nightly visit
Bought a bottle of wine and sipped it
Which later caused Liz to get into a fight with Bridget
Just to be quite specific
And you can stand there and act like you don't care, but that just ruined your night admit it
I'm terrific
I can bring hard bars and prove that I can spit it
But my style has shifted and I really get too silly I admit it
But even this guy can get it
Cause when I spit that silly heat he'll see that the sky's the limit
Cause that's when I'm in my bag...like I'm sneaking on a plane without buying a ticket
Temple tap, I invented that
I got a tortoise ring on my pinkie toe, believe me bro
I stay fresh to death 'til I'm six feet below
I fought the Double Dragons, went 3-0
That's on a need to know
Yeah, you can rap but do you need to? No
Every time you see me go I spazz out
You can't shake Deemsy's flow
Even though I started having little seizures/Little Caesars and I'm not talking pizza dough
Strobe light...that's what I don't like
It makes my spine ache, my eyes start to dilate
A migraine, mind race to the middle of my mind state
I get wobbly like I'm walking on ice skates
Everything starts to go sideways
Ahh, I think I might be having one right now, I can feel my thighs shake
Oh never mind I just had my phone on vibrate
I'm great
I'll sneak in without tripping the wire
While this dude gets caught like lint in the drier
I'm someone you should really admire
So don't get it twisted like you gripping the pliers
I know we don't carry the heat but I've raised--
I know we don't carry the tool but I raise that heat when I'm spitting the fire
So this dude will see defeat/Duff eat like he's having dinner with Lizzie McGuire
I don't care about this match up so I raise the heat like I'm holding a match up
This doesn't stack up, so confident I'll put a stack up
So we know you try to act tough, say you hit as hard as a Mack truck
Well I know you don't have a fast punch
So I won't fall for your hands, that's a bad bluff
I hit him with a fart so hard he'll back up
You need to call back up
I hit him with a fart so hard it'll make him back up
You should call for back up
Help--last week I helped my cousin move his couch
That's how I messed my back up
So I can barely hold my back up
I hit him with a mean mug that's a bad cup
And I admit it Bishop, I'm the one who keeps putting your mirror back up

[Round 3: Chedda Cheese]
That was really weird
This is my impression of you
""When arms get raised, that's where my B.O. sits
I've got five friends with B.O. who all think that B.O.'s sick
We nicknamed ourselves the 'B.O. Six' and came to B.O. 6ix
How many of us came to T.O. with B.O.? Six.""
Man I feel like I'm watching Pee Wee's Big Adventure in bad 3D
If he was raised by Stewart from Mad TV
Mixed with a bit of Brick and a little bit Mr. Bean
You're not original at all because phony to hit the scene
Cause you stole your whole persona and style from Krispy Kreme
(Some people know who that is, but you know...)
And you literally had an epileptic fit you were so afraid of I.C.E
Had you shaking on the sidewalk like a game of dice
You wanted epilepsy jokes, Another One like DJ Khaled
He's an epileptic vegan, favorite food is Caesar/seizure salad
So quit with the talking, you look like Christopher Robin
Stuck in mid transformation into Christopher Walken
And Chris Robin can get walking
Just stop it and quit blogging
In his town he's a big problem
Big date? He'll be pill popping
Slick talking and lip locking, just nod when the chick's watching
The Bill Cosby of Milwaukee, the Rick Ross of Wisconsin
See they hype you up now cause they're following a trend
But look at Vince with the Raptors and what they thought about it then
You see they put you on a map but you'll fall of in the end
And we can all watch Carter let Toronto down again!

[Round 3: Carter Deems]
I'm finished with a gimmick
Sorry if you want me to rap about cats
Matter of fact, cats are cool but that was a fad that I put on as a mask
Before each battle and match
I mean, I give my pets a pat on the back
My cat was just a substitute I used cause I'm not blasting the gat
It was a passive attack
Cause I don't shoot tec's or use meth or do sex
So I don't rap about that
But don't worry cause I'm battling back
So you can get him a soda and pass me a snack
Cause I already ate through Cheese just to prove that I mastered the craft/Kraft
I'm not grabbing the mac's
On the weekend I'm watching Breaking Bad and relax
Until I'm having a nap, these are actual facts
And on the weekdays I'm in my office reading an actual fax
Still, nobody's flowing with me
I'll break into the championship bout, take 'em both out 'til I'm holding the keys
Beat those phony MC's and let 'Ganik put the chain over my tee like rosary beads
I'll beat Grandma's Favorite Grandson with ease
Then eat a plate of macaroni and cheese
So by the end of the night I've beaten Illmac', uh Roney and Cheese
But in real life this guy is scary
He'll make that big thing sing like Mariah Carey
Then he'll put me in a House Of Payne like Tyler Perry
After this my life is buried and not even playing fire prepared me
Cause when he starts cooking he'll put those flames on my shirt like Guy Fieri
When he steps out the gats are ready
He'll light me up even though the mac is heavy
So gangster I'll prolly pop my collar cause I'm acting preppy
All about the cash and fetti, fast and furious 'til I crash the Chevy
He'll grab the blam and go H.A.M. while I'm at the deli just cause I asked for veggies
When this dude's gripping the biscuit, he's not asking you to pass the jelly
Cause every time he eats he takes it to the Max like Zack and Kelly
Born to be a sharpshooter, it's in his DNA to blast machetes
And a gun fight is Thug Life, he'll rat-a-tat my belly like Makaveli
But I'm not on a crusade against those who rap about guns
It's just there's a million other things to rap about that I've actually done
I rap about microwaves cause when I use the stove I burned the back of my thumb
I spit about mini-vans cause that's what my parents been driving since back in '91
We had a dent on the bumper, had an accident son
Stain on the seat, I had an accident son
And this is real life so I don't care if you're asking ""Who won?""
After it's done cause my life is an average one
I just like to get people laughing with puns
I don't do this to make fun of battling I do this cause battling is fun
So with that being said...
I pull up to a Hobby Lobby in a drop top Maserati
Same color as a pot of coffee
If that pot of coffee was the same color as hot wasabi
I'll take my shirt off
I'll flash for the cash like the paparazzi
Live life like a kamikaze
Carter's so savage, you better keep a chain on this animal like a Tamagotchi

236,Comin' On Strong,"                        THE EARLY MARRIED LIFE OF THE MORELS

        ""THE BOTTOMS"" succeeded to ""Hell Row"". Hell Row was a block of thatched, bulging cottages that stood by the brookside on Greenhill Lane. There lived the colliers who worked in the little gin-pits two fields away. The brook ran under the alder trees, scarcely soiled by these small mines, whose coal was drawn to the surface by donkeys that plodded wearily in a circle round a gin. And all over the countryside were these same pits, some of which had been worked in the time of Charles II, the few colliers and the donkeys burrowing down like ants into the earth, making queer mounds and little black places among the corn-fields and the meadows. And the cottages of these coal-miners, in blocks and pairs here and there, together with odd farms and homes of the stockingers, straying over the parish, formed the village of Bestwood.

        Then, some sixty years ago, a sudden change took place, gin-pits were elbowed aside by the large mines of the financiers. The coal and iron field of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire was discovered. Carston, Waite and Co. appeared. Amid tremendous excitement, Lord Palmerston formally opened the company's first mine at Spinney Park, on the edge of Sherwood Forest.

        About this time the notorious Hell Row, which through growing old had acquired an evil reputation, was burned down, and much dirt was cleansed away.

        Carston, Waite & Co. found they had struck on a good thing, so, down the valleys of the brooks from Selby and Nuttall, new mines were sunk, until soon there were six pits working. From Nuttall, high up on the sandstone among the woods, the railway ran, past the ruined priory of the Carthusians and past Robin Hood's Well, down to Spinney Park, then on to Minton, a large mine among corn-fields; from Minton across the farmlands of the valleyside to Bunker's Hill, branching off there, and running north to Beggarlee and Selby, that looks over at Crich and the hills of Derbyshire: six mines like black studs on the countryside, linked by a loop of fine chain, the railway.

        To accommodate the regiments of miners, Carston, Waite and Co. built the Squares, great quadrangles of dwellings on the hillside of Bestwood, and then, in the brook valley, on the site of Hell Row, they erected the Bottoms.

        The Bottoms consisted of six blocks of miners' dwellings, two rows of three, like the dots on a blank-six domino, and twelve houses in a block. This double row of dwellings sat at the foot of the rather sharp slope from Bestwood, and looked out, from the attic windows at least, on the slow climb of the valley towards Selby.

        The houses themselves were substantial and very decent. One could walk all round, seeing little front gardens with auriculas and saxifrage in the shadow of the bottom block, sweet-williams and pinks in the sunny top block; seeing neat front windows, little porches, little privet hedges, and dormer windows for the attics. But that was outside; that was the view on to the uninhabited parlours of all the colliers' wives. The dwelling-room, the kitchen, was at the back of the house, facing inward between the blocks, looking at a scrubby back garden, and then at the ash-pits. And between the rows, between the long lines of ash-pits, went the alley, where the children played and the women gossiped and the men smoked. So, the actual conditions of living in the Bottoms, that was so well built and that looked so nice, were quite unsavoury because people must live in the kitchen, and the kitchens opened on to that nasty alley of ash-pits.

        Mrs. Morel was not anxious to move into the Bottoms, which was already twelve years old and on the downward path, when she descended to it from Bestwood. But it was the best she could do. Moreover, she had an end house in one of the top blocks, and thus had only one neighbour; on the other side an extra strip of garden. And, having an end house, she enjoyed a kind of aristocracy among the other women of the ""between"" houses, because her rent was five shillings and sixpence instead of five shillings a week. But this superiority in station was not much consolation to Mrs. Morel.

        She was thirty-one years old, and had been married eight years. A rather small woman, of delicate mould but resolute bearing, she shrank a little from the first contact with the Bottoms women. She came down in the July, and in the September expected her third baby.

        Her husband was a miner. They had only been in their new home three weeks when the wakes, or fair, began. Morel, she knew, was sure to make a holiday of it. He went off early on the Monday morning, the day of the fair. The two children were highly excited. William, a boy of seven, fled off immediately after breakfast, to prowl round the wakes ground, leaving Annie, who was only five, to whine all morning to go also. Mrs. Morel did her work. She scarcely knew her neighbours yet, and knew no one with whom to trust the little girl. So she promised to take her to the wakes after dinner.

        William appeared at half-past twelve. He was a very active lad, fair-haired, freckled, with a touch of the Dane or Norwegian about him.

        ""Can I have my dinner, mother?"" he cried, rushing in with his cap on. ""Cause it begins at half-past one, the man says so.""

        ""You can have your dinner as soon as it's done,"" replied the mother.

        ""Isn't it done?"" he cried, his blue eyes staring at her in indignation. ""Then I'm goin' be-out it.""

        ""You'll do nothing of the sort. It will be done in five minutes. It is only half-past twelve.""

        ""They'll be beginnin',"" the boy half cried, half shouted.

        ""You won't die if they do,"" said the mother. ""Besides, it's only half-past twelve, so you've a full hour.""

        The lad began hastily to lay the table, and directly the three sat down. They were eating batter-pudding and jam, when the boy jumped off his chair and stood perfectly stiff. Some distance away could be heard the first small braying of a merry-go-round, and the tooting of a horn. His face quivered as he looked at his mother.

        ""I told you!"" he said, running to the dresser for his cap.

        ""Take your pudding in your hand—and it's only five past one, so you were wrong—you haven't got your twopence,"" cried the mother in a breath.

        The boy came back, bitterly disappointed, for his twopence, then went off without a word.

        ""I want to go, I want to go,"" said Annie, beginning to cry.

        ""Well, and you shall go, whining, wizzening little stick!"" said the mother. And later in the afternoon she trudged up the hill under the tall hedge with her child. The hay was gathered from the fields, and cattle were turned on to the eddish. It was warm, peaceful.

        Mrs. Morel did not like the wakes. There were two sets of horses, one going by steam, one pulled round by a pony; three organs were grinding, and there came odd cracks of pistol-shots, fearful screeching of the cocoanut man's rattle, shouts of the Aunt Sally man, screeches from the peep-show lady. The mother perceived her son gazing enraptured outside the Lion Wallace booth, at the pictures of this famous lion that had killed a negro and maimed for life two white men. She left him alone, and went to get Annie a spin of toffee. Presently the lad stood in front of her, wildly excited.

        ""You never said you was coming—isn't the' a lot of things?—that lion's killed three men—I've spent my tuppence—an' look here.""

        He pulled from his pocket two egg-cups, with pink moss-roses on them.

        ""I got these from that stall where y'ave ter get them marbles in them holes. An' I got these two in two goes-'aepenny a go-they've got moss-roses on, look here. I wanted these.""

        She knew he wanted them for her.

        ""H'm!"" she said, pleased. ""They ARE pretty!""

        ""Shall you carry 'em, cause I'm frightened o' breakin' 'em?""

        He was tipful of excitement now she had come, led her about the ground, showed her everything. Then, at the peep-show, she explained the pictures, in a sort of story, to which he listened as if spellbound. He would not leave her. All the time he stuck close to her, bristling with a small boy's pride of her. For no other woman looked such a lady as she did, in her little black bonnet and her cloak. She smiled when she saw women she knew. When she was tired she said to her son:

        ""Well, are you coming now, or later?""

        ""Are you goin' a'ready?"" he cried, his face full of reproach.

        ""Already? It is past four, I know.""

        ""What are you goin' a'ready for?"" he lamented.

        ""You needn't come if you don't want,"" she said.

        And she went slowly away with her little girl, whilst her son stood watching her, cut to the heart to let her go, and yet unable to leave the wakes. As she crossed the open ground in front of the Moon and Stars she heard men shouting, and smelled the beer, and hurried a little, thinking her husband was probably in the bar.

        At about half-past six her son came home, tired now, rather pale, and somewhat wretched. He was miserable, though he did not know it, because he had let her go alone. Since she had gone, he had not enjoyed his wakes.

        ""Has my dad been?"" he asked.

        ""No,"" said the mother.

        ""He's helping to wait at the Moon and Stars. I seed him through that black tin stuff wi' holes in, on the window, wi' his sleeves rolled up.""

        ""Ha!"" exclaimed the mother shortly. ""He's got no money. An' he'll be satisfied if he gets his 'lowance, whether they give him more or not.""

        When the light was fading, and Mrs. Morel could see no more to sew, she rose and went to the door. Everywhere was the sound of excitement, the restlessness of the holiday, that at last infected her. She went out into the side garden. Women were coming home from the wakes, the children hugging a white lamb with green legs, or a wooden horse. Occasionally a man lurched past, almost as full as he could carry. Sometimes a good husband came along with his family, peacefully. But usually the women and children were alone. The stay-at-home mothers stood gossiping at the corners of the alley, as the twilight sank, folding their arms under their white aprons.

        Mrs. Morel was alone, but she was used to it. Her son and her little girl slept upstairs; so, it seemed, her home was there behind her, fixed and stable. But she felt wretched with the coming child. The world seemed a dreary place, where nothing else would happen for her—at least until William grew up. But for herself, nothing but this dreary endurance—till the children grew up. And the children! She could not afford to have this third. She did not want it. The father was serving beer in a public house, swilling himself drunk. She despised him, and was tied to him. This coming child was too much for her. If it were not for William and Annie, she was sick of it, the struggle with poverty and ugliness and meanness.

        She went into the front garden, feeling too heavy to take herself out, yet unable to stay indoors. The heat suffocated her. And looking ahead, the prospect of her life made her feel as if she were buried alive.

        The front garden was a small square with a privet hedge. There she stood, trying to soothe herself with the scent of flowers and the fading, beautiful evening. Opposite her small gate was the stile that led uphill, under the tall hedge between the burning glow of the cut pastures. The sky overhead throbbed and pulsed with light. The glow sank quickly off the field; the earth and the hedges smoked dusk. As it grew dark, a ruddy glare came out on the hilltop, and out of the glare the diminished commotion of the fair.

        Sometimes, down the trough of darkness formed by the path under the hedges, men came lurching home. One young man lapsed into a run down the steep bit that ended the hill, and went with a crash into the stile. Mrs. Morel shuddered. He picked himself up, swearing viciously, rather pathetically, as if he thought the stile had wanted to hurt him.

        She went indoors, wondering if things were never going to alter. She was beginning by now to realise that they would not. She seemed so far away from her girlhood, she wondered if it were the same person walking heavily up the back garden at the Bottoms as had run so lightly up the breakwater at Sheerness ten years before.

        ""What have I to do with it?"" she said to herself. ""What have I to do with all this? Even the child I am going to have! It doesn't seem as if I were taken into account.""

        Sometimes life takes hold of one, carries the body along, accomplishes one's history, and yet is not real, but leaves oneself as it were slurred over.

        ""I wait,"" Mrs. Morel said to herself—""I wait, and what I wait for can never come.""

        Then she straightened the kitchen, lit the lamp, mended the fire, looked out the washing for the next day, and put it to soak. After which she sat down to her sewing. Through the long hours her needle flashed regularly through the stuff. Occasionally she sighed, moving to relieve herself. And all the time she was thinking how to make the most of what she had, for the children's sakes.

        At half-past eleven her husband came. His cheeks were very red and very shiny above his black moustache. His head nodded slightly. He was pleased with himself.

        ""Oh! Oh! waitin' for me, lass? I've bin 'elpin' Anthony, an' what's think he's gen me? Nowt b'r a lousy hae'f-crown, an' that's ivry penny—""

        ""He thinks you've made the rest up in beer,"" she said shortly.

        ""An' I 'aven't—that I 'aven't. You b'lieve me, I've 'ad very little this day, I have an' all."" His voice went tender. ""Here, an' I browt thee a bit o' brandysnap, an' a cocoanut for th' children."" He laid the gingerbread and the cocoanut, a hairy object, on the table. ""Nay, tha niver said thankyer for nowt i' thy life, did ter?""

        As a compromise, she picked up the cocoanut and shook it, to see if it had any milk.

        ""It's a good 'un, you may back yer life o' that. I got it fra' Bill Hodgkisson. 'Bill,' I says, 'tha non wants them three nuts, does ter? Arena ter for gi'ein' me one for my bit of a lad an' wench?' 'I ham, Walter, my lad,' 'e says; 'ta'e which on 'em ter's a mind.' An' so I took one, an' thanked 'im. I didn't like ter shake it afore 'is eyes, but 'e says, 'Tha'd better ma'e sure it's a good un, Walt.' An' so, yer see, I knowed it was. He's a nice chap, is Bill Hodgkisson, e's a nice chap!""

        ""A man will part with anything so long as he's drunk, and you're drunk along with him,"" said Mrs. Morel.

        ""Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy, who's drunk, I sh'd like ter know?"" said Morel. He was extraordinarily pleased with himself, because of his day's helping to wait in the Moon and Stars. He chattered on.

        Mrs. Morel, very tired, and sick of his babble, went to bed as quickly as possible, while he raked the fire.

        Mrs. Morel came of a good old burgher family, famous independents who had fought with Colonel Hutchinson, and who remained stout Congregationalists. Her grandfather had gone bankrupt in the lace-market at a time when so many lace-manufacturers were ruined in Nottingham. Her father, George Coppard, was an engineer—a large, handsome, haughty man, proud of his fair skin and blue eyes, but more proud still of his integrity. Gertrude resembled her mother in her small build. But her temper, proud and unyielding, she had from the Coppards.

        George Coppard was bitterly galled by his own poverty. He became foreman of the engineers in the dockyard at Sheerness. Mrs. Morel—Gertrude—was the second daughter. She favoured her mother, loved her mother best of all; but she had the Coppards' clear, defiant blue eyes and their broad brow. She remembered to have hated her father's overbearing manner towards her gentle, humorous, kindly-souled mother. She remembered running over the breakwater at Sheerness and finding the boat. She remembered to have been petted and flattered by all the men when she had gone to the dockyard, for she was a delicate, rather proud child. She remembered the funny old mistress, whose assistant she had become, whom she had loved to help in the private school. And she still had the Bible that John Field had given her. She used to walk home from chapel with John Field when she was nineteen. He was the son of a well-to-do tradesman, had been to college in London, and was to devote himself to business.

        She could always recall in detail a September Sunday afternoon, when they had sat under the vine at the back of her father's house. The sun came through the chinks of the vine-leaves and made beautiful patterns, like a lace scarf, falling on her and on him. Some of the leaves were clean yellow, like yellow flat flowers.

        ""Now sit still,"" he had cried. ""Now your hair, I don't know what it IS like! It's as bright as copper and gold, as red as burnt copper, and it has gold threads where the sun shines on it. Fancy their saying it's brown. Your mother calls it mouse-colour.""

        She had met his brilliant eyes, but her clear face scarcely showed the elation which rose within her.

        ""But you say you don't like business,"" she pursued.

        ""I don't. I hate it!"" he cried hotly.

        ""And you would like to go into the ministry,"" she half implored.

        ""I should. I should love it, if I thought I could make a first-rate preacher.""

        ""Then why don't you—why DON'T you?"" Her voice rang with defiance. ""If I were a man, nothing would stop me.""

        She held her head erect. He was rather timid before her.

        ""But my father's so stiff-necked. He means to put me into the business, and I know he'll do it.""

        ""But if you're a MAN?"" she had cried.

        ""Being a man isn't everything,"" he replied, frowning with puzzled helplessness.

        Now, as she moved about her work at the Bottoms, with some experience of what being a man meant, she knew that it was NOT everything.

        At twenty, owing to her health, she had left Sheerness. Her father had retired home to Nottingham. John Field's father had been ruined; the son had gone as a teacher in Norwood. She did not hear of him until, two years later, she made determined inquiry. He had married his landlady, a woman of forty, a widow with property.

        And still Mrs. Morel preserved John Field's Bible. She did not now believe him to be—Well, she understood pretty well what he might or might not have been. So she preserved his Bible, and kept his memory intact in her heart, for her own sake. To her dying day, for thirty-five years, she did not speak of him.

        When she was twenty-three years old, she met, at a Christmas party, a young man from the Erewash Valley. Morel was then twenty-seven years old. He was well set-up, erect, and very smart. He had wavy black hair that shone again, and a vigorous black beard that had never been shaved. His cheeks were ruddy, and his red, moist mouth was noticeable because he laughed so often and so heartily. He had that rare thing, a rich, ringing laugh. Gertrude Coppard had watched him, fascinated. He was so full of colour and animation, his voice ran so easily into comic grotesque, he was so ready and so pleasant with everybody. Her own father had a rich fund of humour, but it was satiric. This man's was different: soft, non-intellectual, warm, a kind of gambolling.

        She herself was opposite. She had a curious, receptive mind which found much pleasure and amusement in listening to other folk. She was clever in leading folk to talk. She loved ideas, and was considered very intellectual. What she liked most of all was an argument on religion or philosophy or politics with some educated man. This she did not often enjoy. So she always had people tell her about themselves, finding her pleasure so.

        In her person she was rather small and delicate, with a large brow, and dropping bunches of brown silk curls. Her blue eyes were very straight, honest, and searching. She had the beautiful hands of the Coppards. Her dress was always subdued. She wore dark blue silk, with a peculiar silver chain of silver scallops. This, and a heavy brooch of twisted gold, was her only ornament. She was still perfectly intact, deeply religious, and full of beautiful candour.

        Walter Morel seemed melted away before her. She was to the miner that thing of mystery and fascination, a lady. When she spoke to him, it was with a southern pronunciation and a purity of English which thrilled him to hear. She watched him. He danced well, as if it were natural and joyous in him to dance. His grandfather was a French refugee who had married an English barmaid—if it had been a marriage. Gertrude Coppard watched the young miner as he danced, a certain subtle exultation like glamour in his movement, and his face the flower of his body, ruddy, with tumbled black hair, and laughing alike whatever partner he bowed above. She thought him rather wonderful, never having met anyone like him. Her father was to her the type of all men. And George Coppard, proud in his bearing, handsome, and rather bitter; who preferred theology in reading, and who drew near in sympathy only to one man, the Apostle Paul; who was harsh in government, and in familiarity ironic; who ignored all sensuous pleasure:—he was very different from the miner. Gertrude herself was rather contemptuous of dancing; she had not the slightest inclination towards that accomplishment, and had never learned even a Roger de Coverley. She was puritan, like her father, high-minded, and really stern. Therefore the dusky, golden softness of this man's sensuous flame of life, that flowed off his flesh like the flame from a candle, not baffled and gripped into incandescence by thought and spirit as her life was, seemed to her something wonderful, beyond her.

        He came and bowed above her. A warmth radiated through her as if she had drunk wine.

        ""Now do come and have this one wi' me,"" he said caressively. ""It's easy, you know. I'm pining to see you dance.""

        She had told him before she could not dance. She glanced at his humility and smiled. Her smile was very beautiful. It moved the man so that he forgot everything.

        ""No, I won't dance,"" she said softly. Her words came clean and ringing.

        Not knowing what he was doing—he often did the right thing by instinct—he sat beside her, inclining reverentially.

        ""But you mustn't miss your dance,"" she reproved.

        ""Nay, I don't want to dance that—it's not one as I care about.""

        ""Yet you invited me to it.""

        He laughed very heartily at this.

        ""I never thought o' that. Tha'rt not long in taking the curl out of me.""

        It was her turn to laugh quickly.

        ""You don't look as if you'd come much uncurled,"" she said.

        ""I'm like a pig's tail, I curl because I canna help it,"" he laughed, rather boisterously.

        ""And you are a miner!"" she exclaimed in surprise.

        ""Yes. I went down when I was ten.""

        She looked at him in wondering dismay.

        ""When you were ten! And wasn't it very hard?"" she asked.

        ""You soon get used to it. You live like th' mice, an' you pop out at night to see what's going on.""

        ""It makes me feel blind,"" she frowned.

        ""Like a moudiwarp!"" he laughed. ""Yi, an' there's some chaps as does go round like moudiwarps."" He thrust his face forward in the blind, snout-like way of a mole, seeming to sniff and peer for direction. ""They dun though!"" he protested naively. ""Tha niver seed such a way they get in. But tha mun let me ta'e thee down some time, an' tha can see for thysen.""

        She looked at him, startled. This was a new tract of life suddenly opened before her. She realised the life of the miners, hundreds of them toiling below earth and coming up at evening. He seemed to her noble. He risked his life daily, and with gaiety. She looked at him, with a touch of appeal in her pure humility.

        ""Shouldn't ter like it?"" he asked tenderly. ""'Appen not, it 'ud dirty thee.""

        She had never been ""thee'd"" and ""thou'd"" before.

        The next Christmas they were married, and for three months she was perfectly happy: for six months she was very happy.

        He had signed the pledge, and wore the blue ribbon of a tee-totaller: he was nothing if not showy. They lived, she thought, in his own house. It was small, but convenient enough, and quite nicely furnished, with solid, worthy stuff that suited her honest soul. The women, her neighbours, were rather foreign to her, and Morel's mother and sisters were apt to sneer at her ladylike ways. But she could perfectly well live by herself, so long as she had her husband close.

        Sometimes, when she herself wearied of love-talk, she tried to open her heart seriously to him. She saw him listen deferentially, but without understanding. This killed her efforts at a finer intimacy, and she had flashes of fear. Sometimes he was restless of an evening: it was not enough for him just to be near her, she realised. She was glad when he set himself to little jobs.

        He was a remarkably handy man—could make or mend anything. So she would say:

        ""I do like that coal-rake of your mother's—it is small and natty.""

        ""Does ter, my wench? Well, I made that, so I can make thee one!""

        ""What! why, it's a steel one!""

        ""An' what if it is! Tha s'lt ha'e one very similar, if not exactly same.""

        She did not mind the mess, nor the hammering and noise. He was busy and happy.

        But in the seventh month, when she was brushing his Sunday coat, she felt papers in the breast pocket, and, seized with a sudden curiosity, took them out to read. He very rarely wore the frock-coat he was married in: and it had not occurred to her before to feel curious concerning the papers. They were the bills of the household furniture, still unpaid.

        ""Look here,"" she said at night, after he was washed and had had his dinner. ""I found these in the pocket of your wedding-coat. Haven't you settled the bills yet?""

        ""No. I haven't had a chance.""

        ""But you told me all was paid. I had better go into Nottingham on Saturday and settle them. I don't like sitting on another man's chairs and eating from an unpaid table.""

        He did not answer.

        ""I can have your bank-book, can't I?""

        ""Tha can ha'e it, for what good it'll be to thee.""

        ""I thought—"" she began. He had told her he had a good bit of money left over. But she realised it was no use asking questions. She sat rigid with bitterness and indignation.

        The next day she went down to see his mother.

        ""Didn't you buy the furniture for Walter?"" she asked.

        ""Yes, I did,"" tartly retorted the elder woman.

        ""And how much did he give you to pay for it?""

        The elder woman was stung with fine indignation.

        ""Eighty pound, if you're so keen on knowin',"" she replied.

        ""Eighty pounds! But there are forty-two pounds still owing!""

        ""I can't help that.""

        ""But where has it all gone?""

        ""You'll find all the papers, I think, if you look—beside ten pound as he owed me, an' six pound as the wedding cost down here.""

        ""Six pounds!"" echoed Gertrude Morel. It seemed to her monstrous that, after her own father had paid so heavily for her wedding, six pounds more should have been squandered in eating and drinking at Walter's parents' house, at his expense.

        ""And how much has he sunk in his houses?"" she asked.

        ""His houses—which houses?""

        Gertrude Morel went white to the lips. He had told her the house he lived in, and the next one, was his own.

        ""I thought the house we live in—"" she began.

        ""They're my houses, those two,"" said the mother-in-law. ""And not clear either. It's as much as I can do to keep the mortgage interest paid.""

        Gertrude sat white and silent. She was her father now.

        ""Then we ought to be paying you rent,"" she said coldly.

        ""Walter is paying me rent,"" replied the mother.

        ""And what rent?"" asked Gertrude.

        ""Six and six a week,"" retorted the mother.

        It was more than the house was worth. Gertrude held her head erect, looked straight before her.

        ""It is lucky to be you,"" said the elder woman, bitingly, ""to have a husband as takes all the worry of the money, and leaves you a free hand.""

        The young wife was silent.

        She said very little to her husband, but her manner had changed towards him. Something in her proud, honourable soul had crystallised out hard as rock.

        When October came in, she thought only of Christmas. Two years ago, at Christmas, she had met him. Last Christmas she had married him. This Christmas she would bear him a child.

        ""You don't dance yourself, do you, missis?"" asked her nearest neighbour, in October, when there was great talk of opening a dancing-class over the Brick and Tile Inn at Bestwood.

        ""No—I never had the least inclination to,"" Mrs. Morel replied.

        ""Fancy! An' how funny as you should ha' married your Mester. You know he's quite a famous one for dancing.""

        ""I didn't know he was famous,"" laughed Mrs. Morel.

        ""Yea, he is though! Why, he ran that dancing-class in the Miners' Arms club-room for over five year.""

        ""Did he?""

        ""Yes, he did."" The other woman was defiant. ""An' it was thronged every Tuesday, and Thursday, an' Sat'day—an' there WAS carryin's-on, accordin' to all accounts.""

        This kind of thing was gall and bitterness to Mrs. Morel, and she had a fair share of it. The women did not spare her, at first; for she was superior, though she could not help it.

        He began to be rather late in coming home.

        ""They're working very late now, aren't they?"" she said to her washer-woman.

        ""No later than they allers do, I don't think. But they stop to have their pint at Ellen's, an' they get talkin', an' there you are! Dinner stone cold—an' it serves 'em right.""

        ""But Mr. Morel does not take any drink.""

        The woman dropped the clothes, looked at Mrs. Morel, then went on with her work, saying nothing.

        Gertrude Morel was very ill when the boy was born. Morel was good to her, as good as gold. But she felt very lonely, miles away from her own people. She felt lonely with him now, and his presence only made it more intense.

        The boy was small and frail at first, but he came on quickly. He was a beautiful child, with dark gold ringlets, and dark-blue eyes which changed gradually to a clear grey. His mother loved him passionately. He came just when her own bitterness of disillusion was hardest to bear; when her faith in life was shaken, and her soul felt dreary and lonely. She made much of the child, and the father was jealous.

        At last Mrs. Morel despised her husband. She turned to the child; she turned from the father. He had begun to neglect her; the novelty of his own home was gone. He had no grit, she said bitterly to herself. What he felt just at the minute, that was all to him. He could not abide by anything. There was nothing at the back of all his show.

        There began a battle between the husband and wife—a fearful, bloody battle that ended only with the death of one. She fought to make him undertake his own responsibilities, to make him fulfill his obligations. But he was too different from her. His nature was purely sensuous, and she strove to make him moral, religious. She tried to force him to face things. He could not endure it—it drove him out of his mind.

        While the baby was still tiny, the father's temper had become so irritable that it was not to be trusted. The child had only to give a little trouble when the man began to bully. A little more, and the hard hands of the collier hit the baby. Then Mrs. Morel loathed her husband, loathed him for days; and he went out and drank; and she cared very little what he did. Only, on his return, she scathed him with her satire.

        The estrangement between them caused him, knowingly or unknowingly, grossly to offend her where he would not have done.

        William was only one year old, and his mother was proud of him, he was so pretty. She was not well off now, but her sisters kept the boy in clothes. Then, with his little white hat curled with an ostrich feather, and his white coat, he was a joy to her, the twining wisps of hair clustering round his head. Mrs. Morel lay listening, one Sunday morning, to the chatter of the father and child downstairs. Then she dozed off. When she came downstairs, a great fire glowed in the grate, the room was hot, the breakfast was roughly laid, and seated in his armchair, against the chimney-piece, sat Morel, rather timid; and standing between his legs, the child—cropped like a sheep, with such an odd round poll—looking wondering at her; and on a newspaper spread out upon the hearthrug, a myriad of crescent-shaped curls, like the petals of a marigold scattered in the reddening firelight.

        Mrs. Morel stood still. It was her first baby. She went very white, and was unable to speak.

        ""What dost think o' 'im?"" Morel laughed uneasily.

        She gripped her two fists, lifted them, and came forward. Morel shrank back.

        ""I could kill you, I could!"" she said. She choked with rage, her two fists uplifted.

        ""Yer non want ter make a wench on 'im,"" Morel said, in a frightened tone, bending his head to shield his eyes from hers. His attempt at laughter had vanished.

        The mother looked down at the jagged, close-clipped head of her child. She put her hands on his hair, and stroked and fondled his head.

        ""Oh—my boy!"" she faltered. Her lip trembled, her face broke, and, snatching up the child, she buried her face in his shoulder and cried painfully. She was one of those women who cannot cry; whom it hurts as it hurts a man. It was like ripping something out of her, her sobbing.

        Morel sat with his elbows on his knees, his hands gripped together till the knuckles were white. He gazed in the fire, feeling almost stunned, as if he could not breathe.

        Presently she came to an end, soothed the child and cleared away the breakfast-table. She left the newspaper, littered with curls, spread upon the hearthrug. At last her husband gathered it up and put it at the back of the fire. She went about her work with closed mouth and very quiet. Morel was subdued. He crept about wretchedly, and his meals were a misery that day. She spoke to him civilly, and never alluded to what he had done. But he felt something final had happened.

        Afterwards she said she had been silly, that the boy's hair would have had to be cut, sooner or later. In the end, she even brought herself to say to her husband it was just as well he had played barber when he did. But she knew, and Morel knew, that that act had caused something momentous to take place in her soul. She remembered the scene all her life, as one in which she had suffered the most intensely.

        This act of masculine clumsiness was the spear through the side of her love for Morel. Before, while she had striven against him bitterly, she had fretted after him, as if he had gone astray from her. Now she ceased to fret for his love: he was an outsider to her. This made life much more bearable.

        Nevertheless, she still continued to strive with him. She still had her high moral sense, inherited from generations of Puritans. It was now a religious instinct, and she was almost a fanatic with him, because she loved him, or had loved him. If he sinned, she tortured him. If he drank, and lied, was often a poltroon, sometimes a knave, she wielded the lash unmercifully.

        The pity was, she was too much his opposite. She could not be content with the little he might be; she would have him the much that he ought to be. So, in seeking to make him nobler than he could be, she destroyed him. She injured and hurt and scarred herself, but she lost none of her worth. She also had the children.

        He drank rather heavily, though not more than many miners, and always beer, so that whilst his health was affected, it was never injured. The week-end was his chief carouse. He sat in the Miners' Arms until turning-out time every Friday, every Saturday, and every Sunday evening. On Monday and Tuesday he had to get up and reluctantly leave towards ten o'clock. Sometimes he stayed at home on Wednesday and Thursday evenings, or was only out for an hour. He practically never had to miss work owing to his drinking.

        But although he was very steady at work, his wages fell off. He was blab-mouthed, a tongue-wagger. Authority was hateful to him, therefore he could only abuse the pit-managers. He would say, in the Palmerston:

        ""Th' gaffer come down to our stall this morning, an' 'e says, 'You know, Walter, this 'ere'll not do. What about these props?' An' I says to him, 'Why, what art talkin' about? What d'st mean about th' props?' 'It'll never do, this 'ere,' 'e says. 'You'll be havin' th' roof in, one o' these days.' An' I says, 'Tha'd better stan' on a bit o' clunch, then, an' hold it up wi' thy 'ead.' So 'e wor that mad, 'e cossed an' 'e swore, an' t'other chaps they did laugh."" Morel was a good mimic. He imitated the manager's fat, squeaky voice, with its attempt at good English.

        ""'I shan't have it, Walter. Who knows more about it, me or you?' So I says, 'I've niver fun out how much tha' knows, Alfred. It'll 'appen carry thee ter bed an' back.""'

        So Morel would go on to the amusement of his boon companions. And some of this would be true. The pit-manager was not an educated man. He had been a boy along with Morel, so that, while the two disliked each other, they more or less took each other for granted. But Alfred Charlesworth did not forgive the butty these public-house sayings. Consequently, although Morel was a good miner, sometimes earning as much as five pounds a week when he married, he came gradually to have worse and worse stalls, where the coal was thin, and hard to get, and unprofitable.

        Also, in summer, the pits are slack. Often, on bright sunny mornings, the men are seen trooping home again at ten, eleven, or twelve o'clock. No empty trucks stand at the pit-mouth. The women on the hillside look across as they shake the hearthrug against the fence, and count the wagons the engine is taking along the line up the valley. And the children, as they come from school at dinner-time, looking down the fields and seeing the wheels on the headstocks standing, say:

        ""Minton's knocked off. My dad'll be at home.""

        And there is a sort of shadow over all, women and children and men, because money will be short at the end of the week.

        Morel was supposed to give his wife thirty shillings a week, to provide everything—rent, food, clothes, clubs, insurance, doctors. Occasionally, if he were flush, he gave her thirty-five. But these occasions by no means balanced those when he gave her twenty-five. In winter, with a decent stall, the miner might earn fifty or fifty-five shillings a week. Then he was happy. On Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday, he spent royally, getting rid of his sovereign or thereabouts. And out of so much, he scarcely spared the children an extra penny or bought them a pound of apples. It all went in drink. In the bad times, matters were more worrying, but he was not so often drunk, so that Mrs. Morel used to say:

        ""I'm not sure I wouldn't rather be short, for when he's flush, there isn't a minute of peace.""

        If he earned forty shillings he kept ten; from thirty-five he kept five; from thirty-two he kept four; from twenty-eight he kept three; from twenty-four he kept two; from twenty he kept one-and-six; from eighteen he kept a shilling; from sixteen he kept sixpence. He never saved a penny, and he gave his wife no opportunity of saving; instead, she had occasionally to pay his debts; not public-house debts, for those never were passed on to the women, but debts when he had bought a canary, or a fancy walking-stick.

        At the wakes time Morel was working badly, and Mrs. Morel was trying to save against her confinement. So it galled her bitterly to think he should be out taking his pleasure and spending money, whilst she remained at home, harassed. There were two days' holiday. On the Tuesday morning Morel rose early. He was in good spirits. Quite early, before six o'clock, she heard him whistling away to himself downstairs. He had a pleasant way of whistling, lively and musical. He nearly always whistled hymns. He had been a choir-boy with a beautiful voice, and had taken solos in Southwell cathedral. His morning whistling alone betrayed it.

        His wife lay listening to him tinkering away in the garden, his whistling ringing out as he sawed and hammered away. It always gave her a sense of warmth and peace to hear him thus as she lay in bed, the children not yet awake, in the bright early morning, happy in his man's fashion.

        At nine o'clock, while the children with bare legs and feet were sitting playing on the sofa, and the mother was washing up, he came in from his carpentry, his sleeves rolled up, his waistcoat hanging open. He was still a good-looking man, with black, wavy hair, and a large black moustache. His face was perhaps too much inflamed, and there was about him a look almost of peevishness. But now he was jolly. He went straight to the sink where his wife was washing up.

        ""What, are thee there!"" he said boisterously. ""Sluthe off an' let me wesh mysen.""

        ""You may wait till I've finished,"" said his wife.

        ""Oh, mun I? An' what if I shonna?""

        This good-humoured threat amused Mrs. Morel.

        ""Then you can go and wash yourself in the soft-water tub.""

        ""Ha! I can' an' a', tha mucky little 'ussy.""

        With which he stood watching her a moment, then went away to wait for her.

        When he chose he could still make himself again a real gallant. Usually he preferred to go out with a scarf round his neck. Now, however, he made a toilet. There seemed so much gusto in the way he puffed and swilled as he washed himself, so much alacrity with which he hurried to the mirror in the kitchen, and, bending because it was too low for him, scrupulously parted his wet black hair, that it irritated Mrs. Morel. He put on a turn-down collar, a black bow, and wore his Sunday tail-coat. As such, he looked spruce, and what his clothes would not do, his instinct for making the most of his good looks would.

        At half-past nine Jerry Purdy came to call for his pal. Jerry was Morel's bosom friend, and Mrs. Morel disliked him. He was a tall, thin man, with a rather foxy face, the kind of face that seems to lack eyelashes. He walked with a stiff, brittle dignity, as if his head were on a wooden spring. His nature was cold and shrewd. Generous where he intended to be generous, he seemed to be very fond of Morel, and more or less to take charge of him.

        Mrs. Morel hated him. She had known his wife, who had died of consumption, and who had, at the end, conceived such a violent dislike of her husband, that if he came into her room it caused her haemorrhage. None of which Jerry had seemed to mind. And now his eldest daughter, a girl of fifteen, kept a poor house for him, and looked after the two younger children.

        ""A mean, wizzen-hearted stick!"" Mrs. Morel said of him.

        ""I've never known Jerry mean in MY life,"" protested Morel. ""A opener-handed and more freer chap you couldn't find anywhere, accordin' to my knowledge.""

        ""Open-handed to you,"" retorted Mrs. Morel. ""But his fist is shut tight enough to his children, poor things.""

        ""Poor things! And what for are they poor things, I should like to know.""

        But Mrs. Morel would not be appeased on Jerry's score.

        The subject of argument was seen, craning his thin neck over the scullery curtain. He caught Mrs. Morel's eye.

        ""Mornin', missis! Mester in?""

        ""Yes—he is.""

        Jerry entered unasked, and stood by the kitchen doorway. He was not invited to sit down, but stood there, coolly asserting the rights of men and husbands.

        ""A nice day,"" he said to Mrs. Morel.

        ""Yes.

        ""Grand out this morning—grand for a walk.""

        ""Do you mean YOU'RE going for a walk?"" she asked.

        ""Yes. We mean walkin' to Nottingham,"" he replied.

        ""H'm!""

        The two men greeted each other, both glad: Jerry, however, full of assurance, Morel rather subdued, afraid to seem too jubilant in presence of his wife. But he laced his boots quickly, with spirit. They were going for a ten-mile walk across the fields to Nottingham. Climbing the hillside from the Bottoms, they mounted gaily into the morning. At the Moon and Stars they had their first drink, then on to the Old Spot. Then a long five miles of drought to carry them into Bulwell to a glorious pint of bitter. But they stayed in a field with some haymakers whose gallon bottle was full, so that, when they came in sight of the city, Morel was sleepy. The town spread upwards before them, smoking vaguely in the midday glare, fridging the crest away to the south with spires and factory bulks and chimneys. In the last field Morel lay down under an oak tree and slept soundly for over an hour. When he rose to go forward he felt queer.

        The two had dinner in the Meadows, with Jerry's sister, then repaired to the Punch Bowl, where they mixed in the excitement of pigeon-racing. Morel never in his life played cards, considering them as having some occult, malevolent power—""the devil's pictures,"" he called them! But he was a master of skittles and of dominoes. He took a challenge from a Newark man, on skittles. All the men in the old, long bar took sides, betting either one way or the other. Morel took off his coat. Jerry held the hat containing the money. The men at the tables watched. Some stood with their mugs in their hands. Morel felt his big wooden ball carefully, then launched it. He played havoc among the nine-pins, and won half a crown, which restored him to solvency.

        By seven o'clock the two were in good condition. They caught the 7.30 train home.

        In the afternoon the Bottoms was intolerable. Every inhabitant remaining was out of doors. The women, in twos and threes, bareheaded and in white aprons, gossiped in the alley between the blocks. Men, having a rest between drinks, sat on their heels and talked. The place smelled stale; the slate roofs glistered in the arid heat.

        Mrs. Morel took the little girl down to the brook in the meadows, which were not more than two hundred yards away. The water ran quickly over stones and broken pots. Mother and child leaned on the rail of the old sheep-bridge, watching. Up at the dipping-hole, at the other end of the meadow, Mrs. Morel could see the naked forms of boys flashing round the deep yellow water, or an occasional bright figure dart glittering over the blackish stagnant meadow. She knew William was at the dipping-hole, and it was the dread of her life lest he should get drowned. Annie played under the tall old hedge, picking up alder cones, that she called currants. The child required much attention, and the flies were teasing.

        The children were put to bed at seven o'clock. Then she worked awhile.

        When Walter Morel and Jerry arrived at Bestwood they felt a load off their minds; a railway journey no longer impended, so they could put the finishing touches to a glorious day. They entered the Nelson with the satisfaction of returned travellers.

        The next day was a work-day, and the thought of it put a damper on the men's spirits. Most of them, moreover, had spent their money. Some were already rolling dismally home, to sleep in preparation for the morrow. Mrs. Morel, listening to their mournful singing, went indoors. Nine o'clock passed, and ten, and still ""the pair"" had not returned. On a doorstep somewhere a man was singing loudly, in a drawl: ""Lead, kindly Light."" Mrs. Morel was always indignant with the drunken men that they must sing that hymn when they got maudlin.

        ""As if 'Genevieve' weren't good enough,"" she said.

        The kitchen was full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops. On the hob a large black saucepan steamed slowly. Mrs. Morel took a panchion, a great bowl of thick red earth, streamed a heap of white sugar into the bottom, and then, straining herself to the weight, was pouring in the liquor.

        Just then Morel came in. He had been very jolly in the Nelson, but coming home had grown irritable. He had not quite got over the feeling of irritability and pain, after having slept on the ground when he was so hot; and a bad conscience afflicted him as he neared the house. He did not know he was angry. But when the garden gate resisted his attempts to open it, he kicked it and broke the latch. He entered just as Mrs. Morel was pouring the infusion of herbs out of the saucepan. Swaying slightly, he lurched against the table. The boiling liquor pitched. Mrs. Morel started back.

        ""Good gracious,"" she cried, ""coming home in his drunkenness!""

        ""Comin' home in his what?"" he snarled, his hat over his eye.

        Suddenly her blood rose in a jet.

        ""Say you're NOT drunk!"" she flashed.

        She had put down her saucepan, and was stirring the sugar into the beer. He dropped his two hands heavily on the table, and thrust his face forwards at her.

        ""'Say you're not drunk,'"" he repeated. ""Why, nobody but a nasty little bitch like you 'ud 'ave such a thought.""

        He thrust his face forward at her.

        ""There's money to bezzle with, if there's money for nothing else.""

        ""I've not spent a two-shillin' bit this day,"" he said.

        ""You don't get as drunk as a lord on nothing,"" she replied. ""And,"" she cried, flashing into sudden fury, ""if you've been sponging on your beloved Jerry, why, let him look after his children, for they need it.""

        ""It's a lie, it's a lie. Shut your face, woman.""

        They were now at battle-pitch. Each forgot everything save the hatred of the other and the battle between them. She was fiery and furious as he. They went on till he called her a liar.

        ""No,"" she cried, starting up, scarce able to breathe. ""Don't call me that—you, the most despicable liar that ever walked in shoe-leather."" She forced the last words out of suffocated lungs.

        ""You're a liar!"" he yelled, banging the table with his fist. ""You're a liar, you're a liar.""

        She stiffened herself, with clenched fists.

        ""The house is filthy with you,"" she cried.

        ""Then get out on it—it's mine. Get out on it!"" he shouted. ""It's me as brings th' money whoam, not thee. It's my house, not thine. Then ger out on't—ger out on't!""

        ""And I would,"" she cried, suddenly shaken into tears of impotence. ""Ah, wouldn't I, wouldn't I have gone long ago, but for those children. Ay, haven't I repented not going years ago, when I'd only the one""—suddenly drying into rage. ""Do you think it's for YOU I stop—do you think I'd stop one minute for YOU?""

        ""Go, then,"" he shouted, beside himself. ""Go!""

        ""No!"" She faced round. ""No,"" she cried loudly, ""you shan't have it ALL your own way; you shan't do ALL you like. I've got those children to see to. My word,"" she laughed, ""I should look well to leave them to you.""

        ""Go,"" he cried thickly, lifting his fist. He was afraid of her. ""Go!""

        ""I should be only too glad. I should laugh, laugh, my lord, if I could get away from you,"" she replied.

        He came up to her, his red face, with its bloodshot eyes, thrust forward, and gripped her arms. She cried in fear of him, struggled to be free. Coming slightly to himself, panting, he pushed her roughly to the outer door, and thrust her forth, slotting the bolt behind her with a bang. Then he went back into the kitchen, dropped into his armchair, his head, bursting full of blood, sinking between his knees. Thus he dipped gradually into a stupor, from exhaustion and intoxication.

        The moon was high and magnificent in the August night. Mrs. Morel, seared with passion, shivered to find herself out there in a great white light, that fell cold on her, and gave a shock to her inflamed soul. She stood for a few moments helplessly staring at the glistening great rhubarb leaves near the door. Then she got the air into her breast. She walked down the garden path, trembling in every limb, while the child boiled within her. For a while she could not control her consciousness; mechanically she went over the last scene, then over it again, certain phrases, certain moments coming each time like a brand red-hot down on her soul; and each time she enacted again the past hour, each time the brand came down at the same points, till the mark was burnt in, and the pain burnt out, and at last she came to herself. She must have been half an hour in this delirious condition. Then the presence of the night came again to her. She glanced round in fear. She had wandered to the side garden, where she was walking up and down the path beside the currant bushes under the long wall. The garden was a narrow strip, bounded from the road, that cut transversely between the blocks, by a thick thorn hedge.

        She hurried out of the side garden to the front, where she could stand as if in an immense gulf of white light, the moon streaming high in face of her, the moonlight standing up from the hills in front, and filling the valley where the Bottoms crouched, almost blindingly. There, panting and half weeping in reaction from the stress, she murmured to herself over and over again: ""The nuisance! the nuisance!""

        She became aware of something about her. With an effort she roused herself to see what it was that penetrated her consciousness. The tall white lilies were reeling in the moonlight, and the air was charged with their perfume, as with a presence. Mrs. Morel gasped slightly in fear. She touched the big, pallid flowers on their petals, then shivered. They seemed to be stretching in the moonlight. She put her hand into one white bin: the gold scarcely showed on her fingers by moonlight. She bent down to look at the binful of yellow pollen; but it only appeared dusky. Then she drank a deep draught of the scent. It almost made her dizzy.

        Mrs. Morel leaned on the garden gate, looking out, and she lost herself awhile. She did not know what she thought. Except for a slight feeling of sickness, and her consciousness in the child, herself melted out like scent into the shiny, pale air. After a time the child, too, melted with her in the mixing-pot of moonlight, and she rested with the hills and lilies and houses, all swum together in a kind of swoon.

        When she came to herself she was tired for sleep. Languidly she looked about her; the clumps of white phlox seemed like bushes spread with linen; a moth ricochetted over them, and right across the garden. Following it with her eye roused her. A few whiffs of the raw, strong scent of phlox invigorated her. She passed along the path, hesitating at the white rose-bush. It smelled sweet and simple. She touched the white ruffles of the roses. Their fresh scent and cool, soft leaves reminded her of the morning-time and sunshine. She was very fond of them. But she was tired, and wanted to sleep. In the mysterious out-of-doors she felt forlorn.

        There was no noise anywhere. Evidently the children had not been wakened, or had gone to sleep again. A train, three miles away, roared across the valley. The night was very large, and very strange, stretching its hoary distances infinitely. And out of the silver-grey fog of darkness came sounds vague and hoarse: a corncrake not far off, sound of a train like a sigh, and distant shouts of men.

        Her quietened heart beginning to beat quickly again, she hurried down the side garden to the back of the house. Softly she lifted the latch; the door was still bolted, and hard against her. She rapped gently, waited, then rapped again. She must not rouse the children, nor the neighbours. He must be asleep, and he would not wake easily. Her heart began to burn to be indoors. She clung to the door-handle. Now it was cold; she would take a chill, and in her present condition!

        Putting her apron over her head and her arms, she hurried again to the side garden, to the window of the kitchen. Leaning on the sill, she could just see, under the blind, her husband's arms spread out on the table, and his black head on the board. He was sleeping with his face lying on the table. Something in his attitude made her feel tired of things. The lamp was burning smokily; she could tell by the copper colour of the light. She tapped at the window more and more noisily. Almost it seemed as if the glass would break. Still he did not wake up.

        After vain efforts, she began to shiver, partly from contact with the stone, and from exhaustion. Fearful always for the unborn child, she wondered what she could do for warmth. She went down to the coal-house, where there was an old hearthrug she had carried out for the rag-man the day before. This she wrapped over her shoulders. It was warm, if grimy. Then she walked up and down the garden path, peeping every now and then under the blind, knocking, and telling herself that in the end the very strain of his position must wake him.

        At last, after about an hour, she rapped long and low at the window. Gradually the sound penetrated to him. When, in despair, she had ceased to tap, she saw him stir, then lift his face blindly. The labouring of his heart hurt him into consciousness. She rapped imperatively at the window. He started awake. Instantly she saw his fists set and his eyes glare. He had not a grain of physical fear. If it had been twenty burglars, he would have gone blindly for them. He glared round, bewildered, but prepared to fight.

        ""Open the door, Walter,"" she said coldly.

        His hands relaxed. It dawned on him what he had done. His head dropped, sullen and dogged. She saw him hurry to the door, heard the bolt chock. He tried the latch. It opened—and there stood the silver-grey night, fearful to him, after the tawny light of the lamp. He hurried back.

        When Mrs. Morel entered, she saw him almost running through the door to the stairs. He had ripped his collar off his neck in his haste to be gone ere she came in, and there it lay with bursten button-holes. It made her angry.

        She warmed and soothed herself. In her weariness forgetting everything, she moved about at the little tasks that remained to be done, set his breakfast, rinsed his pit-bottle, put his pit-clothes on the hearth to warm, set his pit-boots beside them, put him out a clean scarf and snap-bag and two apples, raked the fire, and went to bed. He was already dead asleep. His narrow black eyebrows were drawn up in a sort of peevish misery into his forehead while his cheeks' down-strokes, and his sulky mouth, seemed to be saying: ""I don't care who you are nor what you are, I SHALL have my own way.""

        Mrs. Morel knew him too well to look at him. As she unfastened her brooch at the mirror, she smiled faintly to see her face all smeared with the yellow dust of lilies. She brushed it off, and at last lay down. For some time her mind continued snapping and jetting sparks, but she was asleep before her husband awoke from the first sleep of his drunkenness.

Life springs eternal
On a gaudy neon street
Not that I care at all
I spent the best part of my losing streak
In an Army Jeep

And I check the odds
And I place my bet
I pour a drink
And I pull the blind
And I wonder what I'll find

Barstow for the night
Find some crossroad trucker
To demonstrate his might
But these days it seems that
Nowhere is far enough away
So I'm leaving Las Vegas today

Lights so bright
Blackjack
On a Saturday night
I'm leaving Las Vegas
I'm leaving for good

Waiting for my ship to come in

Can take this loser hand
And make it win

(We got the funky track that's phat)
But anyway it's my turn so let me introduce
Special One first up from the gangsta crew
Known as TCD with a title and a rep, it's quite apparent
Serving funky shit to keep you motherfuckers staring
Pump it up, mack shit for your ears
Kick it loud and clear, making hoes disappear
Hittin' donuts in a tre' sideways, to the
Next light, triple gold thangs and my shit's tight
Five deep mobbin' through in The Town
Deuce Tone, Gangsta Flake with the top down
Damn, this shit's hittin' hard in the trunk
Got me three wheel switchin' on them bitches on the next block
Headed straight to the top
And as long as my skills pay the bills I'mma never stop
Kicking that shit you love
Pass the dank and a drank for the bitch to buzz
It's a ghetto thang so I bring the ghetto slang
Hookin' niggas like the 'caine when I do my thang
Five real G's mobbin' on a mission
Check it, it's the funky expedition that we call a little something to ride to

Expedition, funky expedition

Come and catch a thrill with the super skill rhyme flowing
Daughter on attack with the knack to keep your speakers blowing
Riding with a gat in my lap and one finger on a Zap
Looking for some niggas in a Cadillac
Yeah, we on point, rollin' a point
Special One and CMG blazin' up a joint
Keepin' a steady pace in a car race
Sidin' on a strip with a grip and an eighth in my glove case
Never leavin' a trace, but leaving the 5-O's blind
'Cause I'm fucking conscious of these streets of mine
Rollin' lit with the tint shed shallow
And I'll be back around the block for niggas to jock tomorrow
From East O to the B town, looking for a freak now
With hella scratch to get at
Check it, CMG on a mission
To get with some niggas to ride on this funky expedition

Foothill Boulevard, the bumpy ass strip
Homies steady clownin' on the gas, brake, dip
It's a conscious groove, making all my daughters move
Rollin' through the town with big bass boom
Let's get bigger on these niggas up the street
Jock 'em for a minute let 'em take us out to eat
But I concentrate on all my niggas later
I flow to this shit 'cause I'm Special One the greater
But it's this funky that got me gripping still like this
Come into my show, if you fine, you may kiss
Don't mess with the bomb, I never stress no tension

246,C.R.E.A.M. (Cash Rules Everything Around Me),"What does it mean to master a discipline? I guess I think about this question a lot now that all my friends are in graduate school. Are all my friends in graduate school? Maybe I’m extrapolating that conclusion from how much everyone I know seems to complain about graduate school of late. If we believe in anything after all the schools we’ve spent so much time learning about, it is that all of them are stupid and petty. We usually take it all back when we realize we’re mostly griping because we feel stupid and petty having invested all this time into working on half-wit PowerPoint slides. That’s the process of mastery, developing the ability to assess what you do not know. Suffice it to say that becoming an expert in something requires a lot of buffoonery on our parts, and we do hate to goof.

I am still a little uncomfortable with being wrong all the time. Wrong used to be in the classroom. Now wrong presents in clinic as well. At least I am starting to get a better feel for wrong’s cadence. When your attending physician says “What is the most common cause of urinary tract infections?” you say E. coli. UTI? E. coli. Et cetera. Call and response. The first time a pediatrician asked me that I think I said staph, which is why what I just said, E. coli, the better answer, has stuck. The right answer is right there in the epidemiological data, and I didn’t know the data. She was nice about it. I was not so kind to myself after, but I’ll never forget the diagnostic pattern now.

Thus one begins to derive a perverse pride from participation in rounding, maybe the central ritual of medical training. She doctor, you student. Call and response. In my limited experience as a student, the best way to manage in clinic is to embrace your student role full throttle. Earnestness helps, as does appending “as a student” to each of your statement so as not to rock the boat. That way you survive. Feel me? For me, then, the few times when the doctor isn’t right brings us both closer to the profession’s crisis of faith.

Sometimes it isn’t clear if the student or the resident or the department’s research rainmaker has the most up-to-date information on evidence-based clinical practice. To reach consensus we will all check uptodate.com, and often one of us will be put in the uncomfortable position of telling the others that the most recent review on there is not recent enough. A pager call will interrupt the flow of conversation, the daily hour for I.R.L. itself an insistent nod to the tradition of academic rounds, and somebody will take the break to look up the answer to a “clinical question” on a smartphone. I know a few doctors who keep photo albums of interesting pathology specimens on their phones. They are careful with them, too: Otherwise they might put data on an open server or information cloud in an inadvertent patient privacy violation under HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

HIPAA Hooray! Would that be a good hashtag, with its nod to Naughty by Nature, its cutesy, ungainly acronym? Medical school call and response, which can obscure meaning in impenetrable inside references and jargon, has a lot in common with “hashtag rap,” Kanye West’s dismissive term for a style tic that has become ubiquitous in hip-hop lyric writing within the last two years. A hashtag rap substitutes a hashtag, or pound sign (#), for “like” or “as” in a simile, as if the rapper is posting the thought association on Twitter, where the conditional nature of the relationship between the terms is implied. Consider the following instant classic hashtag flow in “Forever” by crossover heartthrob Drake:

Swimming in the money, come and find me: Nemo —
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo.

Well, I’ll admit I enjoyed that. The writer Rivka Galchen, who got an M.D. from Mount Sinai School of Medicine before finishing her Columbia M.F.A., has said that medical jargon helped restore her aesthetic pleasure in language. At their best hashtag rap and call and response are okay with me.
Hashtag rap may be the logical extension of rappers’ frequent invocation of an acronym popularized by the Wu-Tang Clan, “C.R.E.A.M.,” which is now so widely used that spelling out “cash rules everything around me” after every usage seems besides the point. However valid that comparison, hashtag rap definitely strikes me as the equivalent to someone “pimping” you on the etiology of anion gap metabolic acidosis and you shooting back “MUDPILES”:

Methanol
Uremia
Diabetic (alcoholic, starvation) ketoacidosis
Propylene glycol, and formerly paraldehydes and phenformin
Iron and isoniazid
Lactic acidosis
Ethanol, ethylene glycol
Salicylates

For a hashtag rap to work, the association must be so automatic that further exposition is superfluous. In such cases context has become intuitive. Why not shout out what you know and leave the reasoning out? This is how one becomes a doctor, by internalizing cognitive patterns and packaging them into a differential diagnosis “bucket” off the books. In time, we hear, a presumptive diagnosis will come easily to us off the cuff.
By trade I am both a physician-in-training and a “rap genius,” which is to say a founding editor of Rap Genius, the foremost hip-hop lyrics exegesis website on the Internet. Sometime around the start of medical school a college friend looking to scale back his hours at a New York hedge fund asked me if I would help him develop the editorial voice for his new programming side project. Not that I qualified: Back in high school my brother had a pan-ethnic hip-hop collective, the Kevin Gnapoor Experience (KGE), named for the oversexed math nerd in Mean Girls. Its biggest hit’s hook was “What class we in? Duh-na-na-na!” (“Duh-na-na-na” refers to DNA Science I, an advanced biology elective.) Not that it mattered: My participation seemed like a good idea, if not a foregone conclusion to my friend, the Web expert, at the launch time.

So I have continued to write and edit Rap Genius on and off since my first day of medical school. Like Jay-Z’s new book Decoded, or the Yale Anthology of Rap, Rap Genius conceives of hip-hop as a corpus. We have defined ours with the help of the Internet hivemind, sort of like what Facebook has done for circles of friends, or Google for information proper, except they got there first. When we want to know what a rapper means by a name he just dropped or a new slang word she wooed out of the ether, we transcribe the lyric, post it on the site with a mixtape mp3 for cross-reference, and wait for the genius of crowds to strike. Within 24 hours we will probably receive two or three competing interpretations that our editors will monitor, address, and then collate into a humorous footnote. The constant feedback has made me a more meticulous and diligent student than I ever imagined I could be. Their piece said, then brushed off the shoulder like so much dirt, has helped Rap Genius build a kind of rapid response system for users, really just copious admissions of our own inartfulness and inexpertise. Whatever our own failings as exegetes, our work has built the site’s audience up to about 250,000 unique visitors a day.

Sometimes I try to imagine what it might be like to encounter a Rap Genius user as a future patient. Google Analytics data mining suggests that he most likely found RapGenius.com after a friend shared one of our footnotes to a rap lyric on Facebook or Twitter. He is likely a he from America. Maybe he has a connection to Australia or South Africa. And he is sure that his life has granted him a certain authority about the rap canon, that or a need to seek out authority on the subject that his own situation cannot confer. More germane to my website work, I am certain he is a genius. His genius is not necessarily ’hood genius or street smarts. He has critical authority as a participant in the writing of the website specifically because his perspective differs from mine. It is separate from the experiences I have of America as a medical student who also writes a rap website on the side and who is consequently accustomed to life without a lot of free “life” time.

Embracing the accumulated wisdom of a community necessitates denying some of the intellectual authority of any one genius of the field. It is a little foreign to me, having not only grappled with “dead white men” in my college syllabi, but the ones we saw in the flesh on the table like Vesalius before us, and Galen before him. Certainly experience is the best teacher. See one, do one, teach one, is that what they say? It is sure strange to be training to become a kind of authority figure at a time when an entire body of world knowledge is available to anyone in one place.

As an Internet wiki, Rap Genius tends to throw around the word meme a lot. One would think I’d hear it more at medical school, as Richard Dawkins coined it in The Selfish Gene, but the virality I know best at this point is that on the Web. There is, however, a meme going around medical students, as ever, that the crawl of biomedical science research has outpaced the ability of one person to memorize its more salient points in four years of top-notch 21st century education. The notion of even trying is enough to exhaust even the most eager preclinical student. It is disheartening the first time you learn that your candle might have only one end to burn.
I take solace in the fact that a similar realization once hit Cam’ron, the founder of The Diplomats. A consensus has developed among American music critics that the creative forces around Dipset single-handedly “saved” New York hip-hop. This swagger so got to their frontman, Cam’ron (Cameron Giles) that in his debilitating anxiety to duplicate the success of his dizzying 2004 solo album Purple Haze, he developed irritable bowel syndrome. In response to his chronic medical trouble he recorded “I.B.S.,” a polemic against the whole notion of hip-hop saviors, in 2006:

Ay yo, god body, I’m hard-bodied — word, mami — vanishin’
Had to go low, the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota
I couldn’t get cake, a rock in a hard place
For me that’s a odd place, I’m only here by God’s grace
Like a lab rat, them tests dishonor Cam
Ultrasound, MIR, CAT scan, sonogram
Laryngoscopy, endoscopy, I be stressed (I be stressed)
The prognosis, diagnosed, I.B.S.

Cam’s use of “cake” here may be synonymous with bupkes, but is also slang for heroin. His wordplay here is characteristically tortuous: As Rap Genius managing editor Mahbod Moghadam wrote in liner notes to this track on our site, “this song is an example of an ‘extended metaphysical conceit.’ Cam raps the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (I.B.S.) as a way of saying ‘he shits on y’all’ (i.e., he’s the best). Then there’s the ‘I BS’ (I’m full of BS) pun (get it? Get it?).” In Understanding Media Marshall McLuhan speculated that the television medical drama would succeed because it “creates an obsession with bodily warfare.” Even McLuhan probably could not have conceived of the hip-hop medical drama of “I.B.S.,” but it is an example of an expert creating dramas as a kind of palliative against his own anxieties about the limits of his own genius where the only omnipresent thing is scientific expertise.

Self-medicating is of course a common theme in rap, as it is in any other popular music genre. Cam’ron’s protégé Juelz Santana recently released “Mixing Up the Medicine,” built around a sample of Bob Dylan’s “Subterranean Homesick Blues.” Santana introduces his verse as “rap penicillin,” a magic bullet to reinvigorate the game. Though Santana’s swagger is winning, it is not without precedent: “Mixing Up the Medicine” came out almost a year and a half after “Dr. Carter,” a Lil Wayne (né Dwayne Carter) fantasy of himself as a physician on call to resuscitate hip-hop:

[Nurse]
Good afternoon, Dr. Carter.
I don’t know about this one.
His confidence is down, vocab and metaphors needs work
And he lack respect for the game
[Dr. Carter]
Uh, let me see…
[Nurse]
You think you can save him?

It is perhaps not surprising that these songs have been chopped ’n’ screwed on YouTube, chopped ’n’ screwed being a style of beat slowdown that originated out of Houston in the early Nineties to mimic the feeling of being on cough syrup, promethazine and codeine.

Both Lil Wayne and Juelz Santana play on a hip-hop trope older than Biggie and 2Pac — the former prophetically Ready to Die, the latter still releasing deep cuts via hologram over 10 years after his death — hip-hop as salvation. They are writing specifically to the most recent “death of hip-hop” meme, crystallized in an October 2009 article by New Yorker music critic Sasha Frere-Jones, which argued that commercial success and radio omnipresence killed New York hip-hop artistry. That idea is nothing new, as Frere-Jones was certainly aware, and may date back as far as the late 70s when Afrika Bambataa was chanting “Planet Rock” to add Kraftwerk’s edge to party music from the South Bronx. Hip-hop constantly knocks itself down and declares its own death — its own unfitness for the times, or its inability to generate new ideas — then builds itself back up better equipped to address a “new generation” of artists informed for the better by the artistic failures that came before.

Yes, raps are rhythmic speech over a beat — Gucci Mane’s signature introduction “It’s Gucci!” is as good a facsimile for the cadence of the S3 “Kentucky” gallop I can find — and usually, though not always, the lyrics rhyme. Using the architecture of a single rap song as a stand-in for the entire genre would be about as silly as trying to recreate “normal” human anatomy from the insides of a single cadaver. What makes hip-hop interesting is its intertextual nature, the way one track does the same thing and wears the structure differently. Compare it, maybe, to hip-hop éminences grise who playfully diss, or “ether,” as Nas to Jay-Z, younger or less accomplished artists. They knock them down for a while to ensure they have been learning and listening. When they get over the beef, they are rebuilt into better professionals. When I was studying English in college, we used to call this notion of writers “in conversation” in this way “the anxiety of influence.” Well, Harold Bloom did, anyway, and I never took any of his literature classes. As Kanye West said last year, though not of Bloom specifically, “No one man should have all that power.”

So I see what Rap Genius does as something akin to ethnography, an archive of a series of experiences and associations for a thoughtful student of hip-hop that the listener can have at the ready later on when a lyric triggers a new association. When an expert points out how little we know of what we write, we listen, learn, and immediately update the text. They call us on it, and we respond as soon and as best we can. The medical anthropologist Paul Farmer has said that he feels like it’s become harder for him to do his life’s work in ethnography because he can’t learn all the right languages in due time. Not that I would know: I have skimmed his books Pathologies of Power and Infections and Inequalities. Once I read that the average preclinical medical student learns 10,000 new words in her two years of basic science study. Learning hip-hop, which is more than a dialect to “translate,” has taught me as much if not more terminology, and I believe it made me a better taker of medical histories.

When they are not making too many mistakes, the energetic efforts of upstarts to learn the language on time are undeniably appealing. Two recent graduates of Wesleyan University did just that after responding to Sasha Frere-Jones’ “death of hip-hop” essay, and in so doing are resurrecting weird strains in New York hip-hop. Victor Vazquez and Himanshu Suri of Das Racist sublimated their enthusiasm for Cam’ron into a series of self-produced mixtapes, with lyrics discussing everything from their food preferences to their voracious college readings in critical race theory. They are willing to be silly and amateurish: In one memorable bit from their early live shows, they yell “When I say ‘call’, you say, ‘response’! Vazquez, posting as YouTube user bisonbisonagain, even annotated his own performance of “Call and Response” at the 2009 Montreal POP Festival:

Jitty Rap Authenticity Theorists Das Racist engaging in the musical/poetic tradition of Call and Response to a Caucasian audience at the POP Montreal Festival in Montreal, Canada, affectionately known by the locals as “The Maple Leaf State.” Call and response patterns between two musicians are common in Indian Classical Music, particularly in the style of Jugalbandi. Call and response is likewise widely present in parts of the Americas touched by the trans-Atlantic slave trade. It is extensively used in Cuban music, both in the secular rumba and in the African religious ceremonies (Santeria).

The whole joke here is that this dense academic banter informs without enlightening: The writer, riffing on the voice of East Coast ethnomusicology professors — think Anthony Braxton at Wesleyan, Wayne Marshall at MIT, or Robert Farris Thompson at Yale — dismisses a major Canadian city as if it were a stopover on a scenic tour of New England. Everybody hates a tourist, no?

The last paragraph maybe sounds authoritative. That was my secret hope. Actually I just named the first three ethnomusicologists I could think of off the top of my head, then confirmed on the Web that I got their home institutions right. Given any medical professionals reading this piece, I am sure that any one of those readers could fake or sincere as much in response to any single article published in the New England Journal. The reason they continue to converse with one another about their work is that their training has taught them that the humbling is a valuable way to develop more nuanced knowledge for the collective whole. Either that, or they just like free-associating from a firm knowledge base, coasting on their ability to hashtag rap with the best of the teenage hip-hop talents handpicked by Lil Wayne to be in Young Money.

For my part, I am still working on not making so many free associations and assumptions before I can back them up with automatic knowledge drops. This past winter we learned the mental status exam. Four students and I met weekly with an inpatient under the supervision of an attending psychiatrist on the Bellevue substance abuse ward. Usually I got to the interview site earlier than my classmates The activity room where we saw our patient was homey enough — multimedia compositions, yoga mats, plastic form-fitting chairs — but I was mainly afraid that if I showed up for our sessions late that I would get locked out. While the midday atmosphere of the rooms was characteristically sedate — we met our patients on Wednesdays after lunchtime — the sound system was not. Usually the speakers had on “Throwback at Noon,” Mister Cee’s long-running show on New York’s Hot 97. One time I walked into the activity room to Nas (“The World Is Yours”). Hits from Cam’ron, Busta Rhymes, and Ma$e followed. With their music surrounding you, it is hard not to get a little overwhelmed: Their cockiness tries its way into your body as if by force. Osmosis. When my classmates arrived 15 minutes later, the attending psychiatrist turned off the activity speakers.

“No, I was enjoying it,” I insisted. “It’s funny: I help run a rap website. Hot 97 is kind of our bread and butter.” On Rap Genius no one has to know that your primary exposure to “the game” comes from life experiences like supervised visits to the Bellevue psychiatric ward. Would such a disclosure undermine Rap Genius’s credibility or reinforce it? Now that I get to thinking about it, I have not felt so self-conscious since confronting those fifth graders in the classroom all those three years ago, or since my last patient encounter, or upon meeting every single person with whom I come into contact in clinical practice. Like most graduate students-come-latelies, I love rap, but do not consider myself anything even approaching an expert in “the game.”

“Oh,” my attending said. “The volume.”

Now this ain't the name calling game
See, I can refrain from using names to get fame
Since I'm known to create the kinds of beats that make your rump shake
Records are great, but now let's set the record straight

(They thought you was a sellout)
I'm sellin' out tours 'cause sellin' CDs, I'm the one MB
You wanna beat the G, I beat you like hizzos
In the backseat of my Caddy you'll be callin' me Hammer Daddy

I'll work you like a slave
Misbehavin' you were gonna
Pay tax on one of my brothers' souls
Hit the street, caught up in your deuce
And I refuse to forget that alright you talked tough
But face to face was a just a trick, bro

They put me in the mix, too legit to quit
I came wit' a long list of it
And in the future you'll find me on the billboard
Or on the floor of the sign receiving music awards

Suckers, read Billboard and weep
You're in a hot seat, when I start talkin' to ya
And when I see ya, the styles you wrote man
A mean left hook took ya out, and it came from Oakland

Check it, you punks don't know me
A true OG, yo, I was runnin' the whole scene
You started talking that mess but I'm callin' your bluff trick
I thought you knew and boy you still can't touch this

It's better than the average bro
I'm not the average Joe with the average flow

I'm fed up, so now I gotta set 'em up
Knock 'em to the ground and never ever let 'em up
But like a trick he might kick I'll be prepared to red 'em up
However, if you wanna slang 'em, then we can get 'em up

Black sheep, you're weak, you're meek, you're tryin' to grow feet
Dres I make ya look head but first, I'mma get your teeth
Talkin' about my mama's where I draw the line Redman
Dancin' with the corners of yo dome I'mma blow your mind, so!

Since I'm not the run of the mill
I feel the need to say you wanna be, you gotta be real
'Cause if ya ever come my way like I used to say
Homeboy you better pray just to make it today

I know what it is
The ratta tat piece of corny rhymes you keep sayin' we don't find worth playin'
I don't feel like I'm a gangsta so you claim that I'm a sellout
When we meet up on the street, then we'll see who bail out

249,I Believe,"[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
Blood on the floor boards probably from the murder that went down right before I moved in
Blow it off and I ain't really trippin' had my share of victims, so I'm feeling six foot ten
Been up in this bitch a couple weeks and I can feel it when I'm walkin' in the hallway then I noticed something different
Everywhere I go I got the heat now, why the fuck I gotta act like this when I'm up in my own kitchen
Open up the fridge to get a glass of water and I see a shadow get to movin' out the corner of my eye and I'm
Trippin' and I'm really wiggin' out because the only thing up in my hand's a fuckin' glass of water and some iodine
Why am I actin' like this dumb shit cause I'm home alone and ain't nobody in the fuckin' house with me
The light in the basement, the water in the bath how the fuck I hear the noise up on the third story balcony?
Tryna get some sleep? Nigga! I be in for thirty minutes, then I'm getting woke up by the moans
It's always soundin' like somebody talkin' on the phone little kids always laughing and they humming out a song
Summoned a demon by the devil, I don't know what I'm dealing with and maybe I should really get to pushing
Hoppin' up in the whip and never get back before they attack I would'a been faster but I never had no pillow for my cushion
You tell me that you don't believe in ghosts? Hmm, well I don't know what I am looking at because it's looking back
And I don't wanna make no sudden moves to get your noodle cracked the only thing I wanna do is walk up in the room and pack
Enough of this, I been out for the dough, I gotta go and I ain't signed up for the motherfucking ghost on my porch or
I don't want no more or for another second, lookin' at 'em harbourin' the blood stains on my floor board

There is blood on my floor boards
So much blood on my floor boards

Mind control I'm controlled lost in a realm where time is slow
Life is so, when I'm off in my own hell I can go where the lights are low (cypher souls)
Deep in the underground I found love with the knife I hold
But when I awoke, what I was told
Will you commit a murder? Well I suppose..
That's when it happens take a blood bath then a match to the mattress
I'm strapped in hear the sounds of the blackness
Smell the rigor mortis from an ill practice
Have you ever had the urge to kill?
Hit em with a power surge burn 'til he has to squeal
Ask i will.. Go against everything I believe even if it means mask and will
That's for real..
Make you wonder why me? Sever veins let me summon my peace
I'm inhaling my weed I'm concealing my deeds and I'm really feelin Brainsick will center my chi
Breathe life into me like right when the beast might strike in the night what a sight that would be knife twice in em
Ain't no Minnesota nice in 'em neither my venom like 9 millimeters wit the sights in em
I'm playing tug'o war for now and you  would never know the pain of an orphan child
Morbid smiles in the rain when its pouring out and we the motherfuckin' problem they should warn about.. You hear me?
Flash images fast past in intervals black plague the ritual cynical individual
Black bag the minimum that face you givin' 'em castrate the victim of when the mission is critical
Ain't no love for those wicked as us sick enough for bone flesh and guts MK ultra folklore
Influenced from another dimension unlike some I just wanna be done don't give me no more

About the way things used to be
And I can't stop thinking about
About the love that you make to me
And I can't get you outta my head
How in the world will I begin
To let you walk right out my life
And blow my heart away
And I can't stop caring about
About the apple of my eye

Without the center of my life

That I won't die if you decide
You won't see me again

How could your love be leavin' me
And I can't get you outta my mind

And if you walk right out my life
God knows I'd surely die
And I can't stop doing without
Without the rhythm of my heart
No I can't stop doing without
For I would surely fall apart
And I can't get you outta my mind
Cause I know I can't deny it
And I would die if you decide
You won't see me again

And I guess there's nothing more to say

But I'm here and here I'll stay
So everyday I cry
Yes everyday I fall
Do you ever wonder why, why I love everything about you

But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

[Verse 2]
It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still i love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day
So everyday goes by
And everyday i fall
It makes me wonder why
My life's worth nothing without you

But everyday i say i'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

The book closes and we try to forget
But i know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange
And so the light fades away
Try, try, try as i may

It seems my life's worth nothing without you

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black
Background. There is a moment's hesitation, and then the
Simple words in white lettering:

THE GODFATHER

While this remains, we hear: ""I believe in America.""
Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a
Man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great
Emotion.

BONASERA
America has made my fortune.

As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.

BONASERA
I raised my daughter in the American
Fashion; I gave her freedom, but
Taught her never to dishonor her
Family. She found a boy friend,
Not an Italian. She went to the
Movies with him, stayed out late.
Two months ago he took her for a
Drive, with another boy friend.
They made her drink whiskey and
Then they tried to take advantage
Of her. She resisted; she kept her
Honor. So they beat her like an
Animal. When I went to the hospital
Her nose was broken, her jaw was
Shattered and held together by
Wire, and she could not even weep
Because of the pain.

He can barely speak; he is weeping now.

BONASERA
I went to the Police like a good
American. These two boys were
Arrested and brought to trial. The
Judge sentenced them to three years
In prison, and suspended the
Sentence. Suspended sentence!
They went free that very day. I
Stood in the courtroom like a fool,
And those bastards, they smiled at
Me. Then I said to my wife, for
Justice, we must go to The Godfather.

By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office
In his home.

The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with
Patterned shadows. We are watching BONASERA over the
Shoulder of DON CORLEONE. TOM HAGEN sits near a small
Table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands
Impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a
Glass of wine. We can HEAR music, and the laughter and
Voices of many people outside.

DON CORLEONE
Bonasera, we know each other for
Years, but this is the first time
You come to me for help. I don't
Remember the last time you invited
Me to your house for coffee...even
Though our wives are friends.

BONASERA
What do you want of me? I'll give
You anything you want, but do what
I ask!

DON CORLEONE
And what is that Bonasera?

BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.

DON CORLEONE
No. You ask for too much.

BONASERA
I ask for Justice.

DON CORLEONE
The Court gave you justice.

BONASERA
An eye for an eye!

DON CORLEONE
But your daughter is still alive.

BONASERA
Then make them suffer as she
Suffers. How much shall I pay you.

Both HAGEN and SONNY react.

DON CORLEONE
You never think to protect yourself
With real friends. You think it's
Enough to be an American. All
Right, the Police protects you,
There are Courts of Law, so you
Don't need a friend like me.
But now you come to me and say Don
Corleone, you must give me justice.
And you don't ask in respect or
Friendship. And you don't think to
Call me Godfather; instead you come
To my house on the day my daughter
Is to be married and you ask me to
Do murder...for money.

BONASERA
America has been good to me...

DON CORLEONE
Then take the justice from the
Judge, the bitter with the sweet,
Bonasera. But if you come to me
With your friendship, your loyalty,
Then your enemies become my enemies,
And then, believe me, they would
Fear you...

Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.

BONASERA
Be my friend.

DON CORLEONE
Good. From me you'll get Justice.

BONASERA
Godfather.

DON CORLEONE
Some day, and that day may never
Come, I would like to call upon you
To do me a service in return.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight. There
Are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard
And gardens. There is music and laughing and dancing and
Countless tables covered with food and wine.

DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a
Son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of
The wedding party. He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the
Hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the
Children, and makes them all welcome. They in turn carry
With them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked
Bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.

The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,
MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN
And his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the
Bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI. As they move into
The pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.

DON CORLEONE
Where's Michael?

SONNY
He'll be here Pop, it's still early.

DON CORLEONE
Then the picture will wait for him.

Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves
Back to the house. SONNY gives a delicious smile in the
Direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI. She returns
It. Then he moves to his wife.

SONNY
Sandra, watch the kids. They're
Running wild.

SANDRA
You watch yourself.

HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine
Barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait. TOM
Crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is
Next, straightens, and follows HAGEN.

EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)

Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,
Working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out
Of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers
Down in their notebooks. We HEAR the music and laughter
Coming from the party in the distance.

A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.

BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the
Watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to
Embrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.

The MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another
Number in the notebook. A shiney new Cadillac with wooden
Bumpers.

PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping
Bellies with the ladies.

CLEMENZA
Paulie...wine...WINE.

He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.
PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings
It to him.

PAULIE
You look terrif on the floor!

CLEMENZA
What are you, a dance judge? Go do
Your job; take a walk around the
Neighborhood... see everything is
Okay.

PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps
Back into the dance.

The MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another
Number in the notebook.

TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-
OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his
Enormous brown shoes.

The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out
Of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by
CLEMENZA and PAULIE.

SONNY
Buddy, this is a private party.

The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the
Sedan. SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.
The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,
Without saying a word. SONNY steps back, spits on the
Ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,
And another TWO MEN. He doesn't say a thing for most of the
Walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.

SONNY
Goddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the
Dark study.

NAZORINE
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured
By the American Army, and sent to
New Jersey as a prisoner of war...

DON CORLEONE
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I
Can do.

NAZORINE
Now that the war is over, Enzo,
This boy is being repatriated to
Italy. And you see, Godfather...
(he wrings his hands,
Unable to express himself)
He...my daughter...they...

DON CORLEONE
You want him to stay in this country.

NAZORINE
Godfather, you understand everything.

DON CORLEONE
Tom, what we need is an Act of
Congress to allow Enzo to become a
Citizen.

NAZORINE
(impressed)
An Act of Congress!

HAGEN
(nodding)
It will cost.

The DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE
Nods.

NAZORINE
Is that all? Godfather, thank
You...
(backing out, enthusiastically)
Oh, wait till you see the cake I
Made for your beautiful daughter!

NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.
DON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.

HAGEN
Who do I give this job to?

The DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.

DON CORLEONE
Not to one of our paisans...give it
To a Jew Congressman in another
District. Who else is on the list
For today?

The DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting
To see him.

HAGEN
Francesco Nippi. His nephew has
Been refused parole. A bad case.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

WHAT HE SEES:

NIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.

HAGEN (O.S.)
His father worked with you in the
Freight yards when you were young.

LUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.

HAGEN (O.S.)
He's not on the list, but Luca
Brasi wants to see you.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

The DON turns to HAGEN.

DON CORLEONE
Is it necessary?

HAGEN
You understand him better than
Anyone.

The DON nods to this. Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

WHAT HE SEES:

MICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain,
Leads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally
Stopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

The DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds,
Following them.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

MICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces
Her to his GIRL.

EXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945)

The DON's eyes peering through the blinds.

EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

KAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding,
Burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine. She
Is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and
The vitality.

KAY
I've never seen anything like it.

MICHAEL
I told you I had a lot of relatives.

KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.
We see what she sees:

Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine
Barrels.

KAY
(amused)
Michael, what are those men doing?

MICHAEL
They're waiting to see my father.

KAY
They're talking to themselves.

MICHAEL
They're going to talk to my father,
Which means they're going to ask
Him for something, which means they
Better get it right.

KAY
Why do they bother him on a day
Like this?

MICHAEL
Because they know that no Sicilian
Will refuse a request on his
Daughter's wedding day.

EXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945)

CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her
Overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI. He
Is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.
She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from
Him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white
Envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she
Holds. In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one
Of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,
Where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.
CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the
Bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the
Things hold.

Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.

CARLO
(whispered)
Cut it out, Connie.

The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,
Is fat with money.

PAULIE (O.S.)
What do you think? Twenty grand?

A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a
Prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking
Eyes from the purse.

PAULIE
Who knows? Maybe more. Twenty,
Thirty grand in small bills cash in
That silk purse. Holy Toledo, if
This was somebody else's wedding!

SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY
MANCINI, the Maid of Honor. Every once in a while he
Glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with
Some WOMEN.

He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.

SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.

WOMAN
Is it true what they say about your
Husband, Sandra?

SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and
Further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.
Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.
SONNY and LUCY are gone.

INT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945)

The empty hallway. The bathroom door opens and LUCY
Surreptitiously steps out.

She looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing,
Motioning for her to come up.

She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.

EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

KAY and MICHAEL.

KAY
(in a spooky low tone)
Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a
Relative?

She has picked out LUCA BRASI.

MICHAEL
No. His name is Luca Brasi. You
Wouldn't like him.

KAY
(Excited)
Who is he?

MICHAEL
(Sizing her up)
You really want to know?

KAY
Yes. Tell me.

MICHAEL
You like spaghetti?

KAY
You know I love spaghetti.

MICHAEL
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll
Tell you a Luca Brasi story.

She starts to eat her spaghetti.

She begins eating, looking at him eagerly.

MICHAEL
Once upon a time, about fifteen
Years ago some people wanted to
Take over my father's olive oil
Business. They had Al Capone send
Some men in from Chicago to kill my
Father, and they almost did.

KAY
Al Capone!

MICHAEL
My Father sent Luca Brasi after
Them. He tied the two Capone men
Hand and foot, and stuffed small
Bath towels into their mouths.
Then he took an ax, and chopped one
Man's feet off...

KAY
Michael...

MICHAEL
Then the legs at the knees...

KAY
Michael you're trying to scare me...

MICHAEL
Then the thighs where they joined
The torso.

KAY
Michael, I don't want to hear
Anymore...

MICHAEL
Then Luca turned to the other man...

KAY
Michael, I love you.

MICHAEL
...who out of sheer terror had
Swallowed the bath towel in his
Mouth and suffocated.

The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a
Tall story.

KAY
I never know when you're telling me
The truth.

MICHAEL
I told you you wouldn't like him.

KAY
He's coming over here!

LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near
Their table.

MICHAEL
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay
Adams.

KAY
(having survived LUCA)
How do you do.

MICHAEL
My brother, Tom Hagen.

HAGEN
Hello Kay. Your father's inside,
Doing some business.
(privately)
He's been asking for you.

MICHAEL
Thanks Tom.

HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously
Following.

KAY
If he's your brother, why does he
Have a different name?

MICHAEL
My brother Sonny found him living
In the streets when he was a kid,
So my father took him in. He's a
Good lawyer.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE at the window. He has seen the intimacy of the
YOUNG COUPLE.

LUCA (O.S.)
Don Corleone...

THE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves
Forward to kiss his hand. He takes the envelope from his
Jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes
A formal speech.

LUCA
(with difficulty)
Don Corleone...I am honored, and
Grateful...that you invited me to
Your home...on the wedding day of
Your...daughter.
May their first child...be a
Masculine child. I pledge my never
Ending loyalty.
(he offers the envelope)
For your daughter's bridal purse.

DON CORLEONE
Thank you, Luca, my most valued
Friend.

THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so
Tightly we might imagine it to be painful.

LUCA
Let me leave you, Don Corleone. I
Know you are busy.

He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with
The same formality he entered with. DON CORLEONE breathes
More easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.

DON CORLEONE
I'm sure it's the most generous
Gift today.

HAGEN
The Senator called--apologized for
Not coming personally, but said
You'd understand. Also, some of
The Judges...they've all sent gifts.
And another call from Virgil
Sollozzo.

DON CORLEONE is not pleased.

HAGEN
The action is narcotics. Sollozzo
Has contacts in Turkey for the
Poppy, in Sicily for the plants to
Process down to morphine or up to
Heroin. Also he has access to this
Country. He's coming to us for
Financial help, and some sort of
Immunity from the law. For that we
Get a piece of the action, I
Couldn't find out how much.
Sollozzo is vouched for by the
Tattaglia family, and they may have
A piece of the action. They call
Sollozzo the Turk.
He's spent a lot of time in Turkey
And is suppose to have a Turkish
Wife and kids. He's suppose to be
Very quick with the knife, or was,
When he was younger. Only in
Matters of business and with some
Reasonable complaint. Also he has
An American wife and three children
And he is a good family man.

THE DON nods.

HAGEN
He's his own boss, and very
Competent.

DON CORLEONE
And with prison record.

HAGEN
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the
United States. He's known to the
Government as a top narcotics man.
That could be a plus for us; he
Could never get immunity to testify.

DON CORLEONE
When did he call?

HAGEN
This morning.

DON CORLEONE
On a day like this. Consiglero, do
You also have in your notes the the
Turk made his living from
Prostitution before the war, like
The Tattaglias do now. Write that
Down before you forget it. The
Turk will wait.

We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers
From outside. In Italian, with unmistakable style.

DON CORLEONE
What that? It sounds like Johnny.

He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the
Room with light.

DON CORLEONE
It is Johnny. He came all the way
From California to be at the wedding.

HAGEN
Should I bring him in.

DON CORLEONE
No. Let the people enjoy him. You
See? He is a good godson.

HAGEN
It's been two years. He's probably
In trouble again.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

JOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and
Excitement of the wedding GUESTS.

KAY
I didn't know your family knew
Johnny Fontane.

MICHAEL
Sure.

KAY
I used to come down to New York
Whenever he sang at the Capitol and
Scream my head off.

MICHAEL
He's my father's godson; he owes
Him his whole career.

JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.
They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.

DON CORLEONE
My Godson has come three thousand
Miles to do us honor and no one
Thinks to wet his throat.

At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who
Takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.

JOHNNY
I kept trying to call you after my
Divorce and Tom always said you
Were busy. When I got the Wedding
Invitation I knew you weren't sore
At me anymore, Godfather.

DON CORLEONE
Can I do something for you still?
You're not too rich, or too famous
That I can't help you?

JOHNNY
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather,
And...my career, I'm almost washed
Up...

He's very disturbed. The GODFATHER indicates that he come
With him to the office so no one will notice. He turns to
HAGEN.

DON CORLEONE
Tell Santino to come in with us.
He should hear some things.

They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

HAGEN glances up the staircase.

HAGEN
Sonny?

Then he goes up.

INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

SONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her
Gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing
Against the door. Her face peeks out from the layers of
Petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.

LUCY
Sonnyeeeeeeee.

Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his
Body. But there is a knocking as well. They stop, freeze
In that position.

HAGEN (O.S.)
Sonny? Sonny, you in there?

INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)

Outside, HAGEN by the door.

HAGEN
The old man wants you; Johnny's
Here...he's got a problem.

SONNY (O.S.)
Okay. One minute.

HAGEN hesitates. We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the
Door again. TOM leaves.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE
ACT LIKE A MAN! By Christ in
Heaven, is it possible you turned
Out no better than a Hollywood
Finocchio.

Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing. The DON
Smiles. SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still
Adjusting his clothes.

DON CORLEONE
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me
About this Hollywood Pezzonovanta
Who won't let you work.

JOHNNY
He owns the studio. Just a month
Ago he bought the movie rights to
This book, a best seller. And the
Main character is a guy just like
Me. I wouldn't even have to act,
Just be myself.

The DON is silent, stern.

DON CORLEONE
You take care of your family?

JOHNNY
Sure.

He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as
He can.

DON CORLEONE
You look terrible. I want you to
Eat well, to rest. And spend time
With your family. And then, at the
End of the month, this big shot
Will give you the part you want.

JOHNNY
It's too late. All the contracts
Have been signed, they're almost
Ready to shoot.

DON CORLEONE
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough
To hurt.

DON CORLEONE
Now go back to the party and leave
It to me.

He closes the door, smiling to himself. Turns to HAGEN.

DON CORLEONE
When does my daughter leave with
Her bridegroom?

HAGEN
They'll cut the cake in a few
Minutes...leave right after that.
Your new son-in-law, do we give him
Something important?

DON CORLEONE
No, give him a living. But never
Let him know the family's business.
What else, Tom?

HAGEN
I've called the hospital; they've
Notified Consiglere Genco's family
To come and wait. He won't last
Out the night.

This saddens the DON. He sighs.

DON CORLEONE
Genco will wait for me. Santino,
Tell your brothers they will come
With me to the hospital to see
Genco. Tell Fredo to drive the big
Car, and ask Johnny to come with us.

SONNY
And Michael?

DON CORLEONE
All my sons.
(to HAGEN)
Tom, I want you to go to California
Tonight. Make the arrangements.
But don't leave until I come back
From the hospital and speak to you.
Understood?

HAGEN
Understood.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over
The entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels
In a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most
Extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument
Of his gratitude. The CROWD is favorably impressed: they
Begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,
In the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and
Kiss the Groom. Louder and louder, five hundred forks
Hitting five hundred glasses.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

Silence.

HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day. The GUESTS are gone. A
Single black car is in the courtyard. FREDDIE is behind the
Driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who
Sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.

DON CORLEONE
Will your girl friend get back to
The city all right?

MICHAEL
Tom said he'd take care of it.

The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through
The gate of the great Corleone Mall.

INT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)

A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can
See a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but
All plump and dressed in black.

DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end. But then the
DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder. MICHAEL
Stops and turns toward his FATHER. The two looks at one
Another for some time. SILENCE. DON CORLEONE then lifts
His hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's
Uniform.

DON CORLEONE
What was this for?

MICHAEL
For bravery.

DON CORLEONE
And this?

MICHAEL
For killing a man.

DON CORLEONE
What miracles you do for strangers.

MICHAEL
I fought for my country. It was my
Choice.

DON CORLEONE
And now, what do you choose to do?

MICHAEL
I'm going to finish school.

DON CORLEONE
Good. When you are finished, come
And talk to me. I have hopes for
You.

Again they regard each other without a word. MICHAEL turns,
And continues on. DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then
Follows.

INT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR
VIEW. He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.

DON CORLEONE
(whispered)
Genco, I've brought my sons to pay
Their respects. And look, even
Johnny Fontane, all the way from
Hollywood.

GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man. DON CORLEONE
Takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around
His bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.

GENCO
Godfather, Godfather, it's your
Daughter's wedding day, you cannot
Refuse me. Cure me, you have the
Power.

DON CORLEONE
I have no such power...but Genco,
Don't fear death.

GENCO
(with a sly wink)
It's been arranged, then?

DON CORLEONE
You blaspheme. Resign yourself.

GENCO
You need your old Consigliere. Who
Will replace me?
(suddenly)
Stay with me Godfather. Help me
Meet death. If he sees you, he
Will be frightened and leave me in
Peace. You can say a word, pull a
Few strings, eh? We'll outwit that
Bastard as we outwitted all those
Others.
(clutching his hand)
Godfather, don't betray me.

The DON motions all the others to leave the room. They do.
He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and
Whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.

INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

FADE IN:

The interior of a non-stop Constellation. HAGEN is one of
The very few passengers on this late flight. He looks like
Any young lawyer on a business trip. He is tired from the
Difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed
During the wedding. On the seat next to him is an enormous,
Bulging briefcase. He closes his eyes.

INT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)

The honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE. CARLO is in his
Undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the
Envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the
Contents. CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble
Bathroom. She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and
Tries to get his interest.

INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE in his office. LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.

DON CORLEONE
Luca, I am worried about this man
Sollozzo. Find out what you can,
Through the Tattaglias. Let them
Believe you could be tempted away
From the Corleone Family, if the
Right offer was made. Learn what
He has under his fingernails...

INT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)

The hallway of an apartment building. SONNY enters, climbs
Two steps at a time. He knocks, and then whispers.

SONNY
It's me, Sonny.

The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling
Him into the apartment.

INT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)

LUCA BRASI's tiny room. He is partly dressed. He kneels
And reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked
Trunk. He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof
Vest. He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then
Puts on his shirt and jacket. He takes his gun, quickly
Disassembles, checks, and reassembles it. And leaves.

INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

A CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.

INT NIGHT: MOVING TRAIN (SUMMER 1945)

MICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New
Hampshire.

INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

LUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty
Subway train.

INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

HAGEN on the Constellation. He reaches into his briefcase,
And takes out several pictures and papers.

One photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm
In arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a
Lovely young child star to his immediate right.

HAGEN considers other papers.

INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.
He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.

DON CORLEONE
Remember my new Consigliere, a
Lawyer with his briefcase can steal
More than a hundred men with guns.

EXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)

JACK WOLTZ ESTATE. HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,
Armed only with his briefcase. A GATEMAN opens the gate,
And TOM enters.

EXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)

HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal
Gardens, martinis in hand.

WOLTZ
You should have told me your boss
Was Corleone, Tom, I had to check
You out. I thought you were just
Some third rate hustler Johnny was
Running in to bluff me.
(a piece of statuary)
Florence, thirteenth century.
Decorated the garden of a king.

They cross the garden and head toward the stables.

WOLTZ
I'm going to show you something
Beautiful.

They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a
Huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: ""KHARTOUM.""
TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they
Rise as WOLTZ approaches.

WOLTZ
You like horses? I like horses, I
Love 'em. Beautiful, expensive
Racehorses.

The animal inside is truly beautiful. WOLTZ whispers to him
With true love in his voice.

WOLTZ
Khartoum...Kartoum...You are
Looking at six hundred thousand
Dollars on four hoofs. I bet even
Russian Czars never paid that kind
Of dough for a single horse. But
I'm not going to race him I'm going
To put him out to Stud.

INT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,
Attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS. Great paintings hang on the
Walls. The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.

HAGEN
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.
That is very close, a very sacred
Religious relationship.

WOLTZ
Okay, but just tell him this is one
Favor I can't give. But he should
Try me again on anything else.

HAGEN
He never asks a second favor when
He has been refused the first.
Understood?

WOLTZ
You smooth son of a bitch, let me
Lay it on the line for you, and
Your boss. Johnny Fontane never
Gets that movie. I don't care how
Many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball
Goombahs come out of the woodwork!

HAGEN
I'm German-Irish.

WOLTZ
Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny
Will never get that part because I
Hate that pinko punk and I'm going
To run him out of the Movies. And
I'll tell you why. He ruined one
Of Woltz Brothers' most valuable
Proteges. For five years I had
This girl under training; singing
Lessons! Acting lessons! Dancing
Lessons! We spent hundreds of
Thousands of dollars--I was going
To make her a star. I'll be even
More frank, just to show you that
I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it
Wasn't all dollars and cents. That
Girl was beautiful and young and
Innocent and she was the greatest
Piece of ass I've ever ad and I've
Had them all over the world. Then
Johnny comes along with that olive
Oil voice and guinea charm and she
Runs off. She threw it all away to
Make me look ridiculous. A MAN IN
MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE
MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!

EXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)

An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott
Street with a large old sign: ""GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,
INC."" next to an open-faced fruit market.

A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we
Cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters
The building. This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.

INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps
Before he actually rises into view. He is a small man, very
Dark, with curly black hair. But wiry, and tight and hard,
And obviously very dangerous. He is greeted at the head of
The stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,
Introducing himself. For a moment, there is a complex of
Handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful
Introductions. Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's
Glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.
They are very respectful of one another. Folding chairs are
Brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around
In a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,
CLEMENZA and TESSIO. The DON is the slightest bit foolish
With all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no
One. Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear
That this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.

SOLLOZZO
My business is heroin, I have poppy
Fields, laboratories in Narseilles
And Sicily, ready to go into
Production. My importing methods
Are as safe as these things can be,
About five per cent loss. The risk
Is nothing, the profits enormous.

DON CORLEONE
Why do you come to me? Why do I
Deserve your generosity?

SOLLOZZO
I need two million dollars in
Cash...more important, I need a
Friend who has people in high
Places; a friend who can guarantee
That if one of my employees be
Arrested, they would get only light
Sentences. Be my friend.

DON CORLEONE
What percentages for my family?

SOLLOZZO
Thirty per cent. In the first year
Your share would be four million
Dollars; then it would go up.

DON CORLEONE
And what is the percentage of the
Tattaglia family?

SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.

SOLLOZZO
My compliments. I'll take care of
Them from my share.

DON CORLEONE
So. I receive 30 per cent just for
Finance and legal protection. No
Worries about operations, is that
What you tell me?

SOLLOZZO
If you think two million dollars in
Cash is just finance, I congratulate
You Don Corleone.

There is a long silence; in which each person present feels
The tension. The DON is about to give his answer.

DON CORLEONE
I said I would see you because I've
Heard you're a serious man, to be
Treated with respect...
(pause)
But I'll say no to you.

We feel this around the room.

DON CORLEONE
I'll give you my reasons. I have
Many, many friends in Politics.
But they wouldn't be so friendly if
My business was narcotics instead
Of gambling. They think gambling
Is something like liquor, a harmless
Vice...and they think narcotics is
Dirty business.

SOLLOZZO takes a breath.

DON CORLEONE
No...how a man makes his living is
None of my business. But this
Proposition of yours is too risky.
All the people in my family lived
Well the last ten years, I won't
Risk that out of greed.

SOLLOZZO
Are you worried about security for
Your million?

DON CORLEONE
No.

SOLLOZZO
The Tattaglias will guarantee your
Investment also.

This startles SONNY; he blurts out.

SONNY
The Tattaglia family guarantees our
Investment?

SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face
Him. Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out
Of line.

DON CORLEONE
Young people are greedy, and they
Have no manners. They speak when
They should listen. But I have a
Sentimental weakness for my
Children, and I've spoiled them, as
You see. But Signor Sollozzo, my
No is final.

SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal. He
Glances one last time at SONNY. He rises; all the others do
As well. He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally
Takes his leave. When the footsteps can no longer be heard:

The DON turns to SONNY.

DON CORLEONE
Santino, never let anyone outside
The family know what you are
Thinking. I think your brain is
Going soft from all that comedy you
Play with that young girl.

TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display
With the word ""THANK YOU"" spelled out in flowers.

DON CORLEONE
What is this nonsense?

HAGEN
It's from Johnny. It was announced
This morning. He's going to play
The lead in the new Woltz Brothers
Film.

INT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)

It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,
Presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping. Soft light bathes the room
From the large windows. We move closer to him until we see
His face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ. He turns uncomfortably;
Mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets. Something
Wet.

He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.
He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood. He is
Frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on
His sheets and pajamas. He grunts, pulls the puddle of
Blood in his bed. He feels his own body frantically,
Moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face
With the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of
His bed. Just blood from the hacked neck. White reedy
Tendons show. He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle
Of blood to see more clearly. Froth covers the muzzle, and
The enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered
With blood.

WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot. No sound comes out.
Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure
Terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and
Knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.

INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

CLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER. Nodding.

DON CORLEONE
Send Johnny my congratulations.

----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED)

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945)

Fifth Avenue in the snow. Christmas week. People are
Bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents.

KAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store,
Carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.

KAY
We have something for your mother,
For Sonny, we have the tie for
Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the
Reynolds pen...

MICHAEL
And what do you want for Christmas?

KAY
Just you.

They kiss.

INT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

CLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music. THE VIEW PANS
AROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight.

MICHAEL (O.S.)
We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony
At the City Hall, no big fuss, no
Family, just a couple of friends as
Witnesses.

The two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on
The two single beds that they have pushed together.

KAY
What will your father say?

MICHAEL
As long as I tell him beforehand he
Won't object. He'll be hurt, but
He won't object.

KAY
What time do they expect us?

MICHAEL
For dinner. Unless I call and tell
Them we're still in New Hampshire.

KAY
Michael.

MICHAEL
Then we can have dinner, see a
Show, and spend one more night.

He moves to the telephone.

MICHAEL (CONT'D.)
Operator. Get me
(fill in number)

KAY
Michael, what are you doing?

MICHAEL
Shhh, you be the long distance
Operator. Here.

KAY
Hello...this is Long Distance. I
Have a call from New Hampshire. Mr.
Michael Corleone. One moment please.

She hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.

MICHAEL
Hello, Tom? Michael. Yeah...
Listen, we haven't left yet. I'm
Driving down to the city with Kay
Tomorrow morning. There's something
Important I want to tell the old
Man before Christmas. Will he be
Home tomorrow night?

INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

HAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office. In the background,
Through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in
His office. TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.

HAGEN (O.S.)
Sure. Anything I can do for you.

MICHAEL (O.S.)
No. I guess I'll see you Christmas.
Everyone's going to be out at Long
Beach, right?

HAGEN
Right.

He smiles. MICHAEL has hung up. He looks at the piles of
Work, and can't face it. He rises, puts on his coat and
Hat, and continues out.

He peeks into the DON's office.

HAGEN
Michael called; he's not leaving
New Hampshire until tomorrow
Morning. I've got to go, I promised
Theresa I'd pick up some toys for
The kids.

The DON smiles and nods.

TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.
FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the
Afternoon paper. He puts aside the papers the office
Manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE,
Raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the
Paper.

DON CORLEONE
Tell Paulie to get the car from the
Lot; I'll be ready to go home in a
Few minutes.

FREDO
I'll have to get it myself; Paulie
Called in sick this morning.

DON CORLEONE
That's the third time this month.
I think maybe you'd better get a
Healthier bodyguard for me. Tell
Tom.

FREDO
(going)
Paulie's a good kid. If he's sick,
He's sick. I don't mind getting
The car.

FREDDIE leaves. He slowly puts on his jacket. Looks out
His window.

EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

FREDDIE crosses the street.

INT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

OFFICE MANAGER
Buon Watale, Don Corleone.

The MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat. Once again, the
DON glances out his window.

The black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.

DON CORLEONE
Merry Christmas.
(handing the MANAGER
An envelope)

And he starts down the stairs.

EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail. When
FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the
Driver's seat. The DON moves to the car, and is about to
Get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open
Fruit stand near the corner.

The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him. The DON walks among
The trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular
Piece of fruit. As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the
Pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag. The DON
Pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then
Turns back to the car.

EXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945)

TOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift
Wrapped. He continues past the windows. As he walks,
Someone walks right in his way. He looks up. It is SOLLOZZO.

He takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him.

SOLLOZZO
(quietly)
Don't be frightened. I just want
To talk to you.

A car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.

SOLLOZZO
(urgently)
Get in; I want to talk to you.

HAGEN pulls his arm free. He is frightened.

HAGEN
I haven't got time.

TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.

SOLLOZZO
Get in the car. If I wanted to
Kill you you'd be dead already.
Trust me.

HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving
Our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story
Of Hansel and Gretel. We HEAR the car doors shut, and the
Car drive off.

EXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945)

RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show. KAY and
MICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and
She sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex. KAY
Nostalgically hums ""The Bells of Saint Mary's,"" as they walk
Arm in arm.

KAY
Would you like me better if I were
A nun?

MICHAEL
No.

KAY
Would you like me better if I were
Ingrid Bergman?

They have passed a little enclosed newsstand. KAY sees
Something that terrifies her. She doesn't know what to do.
MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.

KAY
(a little voice)
Michael?

MICHAEL
I'm thinking about it.

KAY
Michael...

MICHAEL
No, I would not like you better if
You were Ingrid Bergman.

She cannot answer him. Rather she pulls him by the arm,
Back to the newsstand, and points. His face goes grave.

The headlines read: ""VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED
DOWN.""

MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a
Dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them. KAY
Knows to remain silent.

MICHAEL
(desperately)
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the
Car, when TWO MEN step from the corner. Suddenly, the DON
Drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness
Toward the parked car.

DON CORLEONE
Fredo, Fredo!

The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins
Rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.

Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain,
And continues toward the car.

The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking
Over an entire case of fruit.

The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.

Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit. There are
More GUNSHOTS.

FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car;
Having difficulty opening the door. He rushes out, a gun
Trembling in his hand; his mouth open. He actually drops
The gun.

The gun falls amid the rolling fruit.

The GUNMEN are panicked. They fire once more at the downed
DON CORLEONE. His leg and arm twitch where they are hit;
And pools of blood are beginning to form.

The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion;
They disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.

The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared:
Rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely
From around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from
Windows. But the street itself is now empty.

FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great
Puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and
Face down in them.

FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying
Something we cannot understand. He begins to weep profusely.

INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

LUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night. He
Gets off.

He emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.

EXT NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)

LUCA walks down the late night street. He approaches an
Elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still
Winking this late at night. He waits and watches. Then the
Sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.

INT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless
Glistening wooden floors. Now, at this late time, the
Chairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR
Is waxing them. A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her
Receipts. LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at
The bar. ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves
Behind the bar.

MAN
Luca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

LUCA
I know.

LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.

SOLLOZZO
Do you know who I am?

LUCA Nods.

SOLLOZZO
You've been talking to the
Tattaglias. They thought we could
Do business.

LUCA listens.

SOLLOZZO
I need somebody strong to protect
My operation, physically. I've
Heard you're not happy with your
Family, you might make a switch.

LUCA
If the money is good enough.

SOLLOZZO
On the first shipment, I can
Guarantee you fifty thousand dollars.

LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.

SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,
Rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.
BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter
Magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette. Then,
He does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and
Puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.

INT NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

The telephone in SONNY's house is ringing. He approaches
It, obviously fresh from a nap.

SONNY
Yeah.

VOICE (O.S.)
Do you recognize my voice?

SONNY
I think so. Detective squad?

VOICE (O.S.)
Right. Don't say my name, just
Listen. Somebody shot your father
Outside his place fifteen minutes
Ago.

SONNY
Is he alive?

VOICE (O.S.)
I think so, but I can't get close
Enough. There's a lot of blood.
I'll try to find out more.

SONNY
Find out anything you can...you got
A Grand coming.
(click)

SONNY cradles the phone. An incredible rage builds up in
Him, his face actually turning red. He would like to rip
The phone to pieces in his bare hands. Then he controls it.
Quickly, he dials another number.

SONNY
Theresa, let me talk to Tom. Not
Yet? Have him call me as soon as
He gets home.

He hangs up.

SANDRA (O.S.)
Sonny? Sonny, who is it?
(she enters the room)
What is it?

SONNY
(calmly)
They shot the old man.

SANDRA
Oh God...

SONNY
Honey...don't worry. Nothing else
Is going to happen.

There is a POUNDING on the door. A BABY starts crying.

SANDRA
(really frightened)
SONNY?

SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and
Moves quickly. He opens the front door quickly. It is
CLEMENZA. He enters, SONNY closes the door. SANDRA goes to
Look after the baby.

CLEMENZA
(excited)
You heard about your father?

SONNY
Yeah.

CLEMENZA
The word is out in the streets that
He's dead.

SONNY
Where the hell was Paulie, why
Wasn't he with the Don?

CLEMENZA
Paulie's been a little sick all
Winter...he was home.

SONNY
How many times did he stay home the
Last couple of months?

CLEMENZA
Maybe three, four times. I always
Asked Freddie if he wanted another
Bodyguard, but he said no. Things
Have been so smooth the last ten
Years...

SONNY
Go get Paulie, I don't care how
Sick he is. Pick him up yourself,
And bring him to my father's house.

CLEMENZA
That's all? Don't you want me to
Send some people over here?

SONNY
No, just you and Paulie.

CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the
Couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.

SONNY
A couple of our people will come to
Stay here. Do whatever they say;
I'm going over to the main house.
If you want me, use Pop's special
Phone.

The telephone rings again. SONNY answers it.

SONNY
Hello.

SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
Santino Corleone?

SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is. SONNY
Indicates that she be quiet.

SONNY
Yeah.

SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
We have Tom Hagen. In about three
Hours he'll be released with our
Proposition. Don't do anything
Until you've heard what he has to
Say. You can only cause a lot of
Trouble. What's done is done.
(a pause)
Don't lose that famous temper of
Yours.

SONNY
(quietly)
I'll wait.

EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL. It is night, but the
Courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the
Tops of all the houses. It is very cold. We see the figure
Of SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.

INT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house. Then he calls
Out.

SONNY
Ma? Ma, where are you.

The kitchen door swings open. He moves quickly and takes
Her by the arm. He is deliberately calm.

SONNY
Ma, I just got a call. Pop's
Hurt...I don't know how bad.

MAMA
(quietly)
Santino? Have they killed him?

SONNY
(almost in tears)
We don't know yet, Ma.

MAMA
I'll get dressed. In case we can
See him...

She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs. SONNY
Turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying. He
Takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil,
And sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his
Father's office.

INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

He switches the lights on in the DON's office. The massive
Desk dominates the room. SONNY moves quickly to the
Telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk,
And dials a number.

SONNY
Tessio...This is Santino Corleone.
I want fifty reliable men out here.

TESSIO (O.S.)
I heard, Sonny...but what about
Clemenza's regime?

SONNY
I don't want to use Clemenza's
People right now. Understood?

He hangs up. He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the
Dial, and removes a small notebook. He takes it back to the
Desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.
We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA
BRASI. SONNY dials the number. There is no answer.

SONNY
Luca.

INT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)

The interior of an abandoned building. SEVERAL MEN in suits
And ties sit around in the booths.

HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.

SOLLOZZO
I know you're not in the muscle end
Of the family--so I don't want you
To be afraid. I want you to help
The Corleones and I want you to
Help me.

HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette
In his mouth. ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye
To the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered
China cup. HAGEN sips gratefully.

SOLLOZZO
Your boss is dead...

HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.
SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.

SOLLOZZO
(pushing the bottle)
Have some more. We got him outside
His office, just before I picked
You up. You have to make the peace
Between me and Santino.

HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.

SOLLOZZO
Sonny was hot for my deal, right?
You know it's the smart thing to
Do, too. I want you to talk Sonny
Into it.

HAGEN
(pulling himself together)
Sonny will come after you with
Everything he's got.

SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.

SOLLOZZO
That's going to be his first
Reaction. You have to talk some
Sense into him. The Tattaglia
Family stands behind me with all
Their people. The other New York
Families will go along with anything
That prevents a full scale war.

He leans close to HAGEN.

SOLLOZZO
The Don was slipping; in the old
Days I could never have gotten to
Him. Now he's dead, nothing can
Bring him back. Talk to Sonny,
Talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza
And Tessio...it's good business.

HAGEN
Even Sonny won't be able to call
Off Luca Brasi.

SOLLOZZO
I'll worry about Luca. You take
Care of Sonny and the other two kids.

HAGEN
I'll try...It's what the Don would
Want us to do.

SOLLOZZO
(lifting his hands in
An expression of harmlessness)
Good...then you can go...
(he escorts him to
The door)
I don't like violence. I'm a
Businessman, and blood is a big
Expense.

He opens the door; they step out together.

EXT NITE: BUILDING

HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.

But a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.
He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to
SOLLOZZO in private.

Then SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression. He opens the
Door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.

SOLLOZZO
The old man is still alive. Five
Bullets in his Sicilian hide and
He's still alive.
(he gives a fatalistic
Shrug)
Bad luck for me, bad luck for you.

EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL driving during the night. There is a little fog in
The air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making
It difficult to see well. The wipers move across the view,
As the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still
Decorated for Christmas. The courtyard is bathed with white
Floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look. The
Narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link
Chain. There are strange cars parked along the curving
Cement walk. SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and
Chain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.

MAN
Who're you?

ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and
Then turns.

MAN 2
It's the Don's kid; take the car,
I'll bring him inside.

The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.

INT NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)

The Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL
Doesn't recognize. They pay little attention to him. Most
Of them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.

INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas
Tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.

THERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a
Cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water
Glass half filled with whiskey. On the other side of the
Sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is
Sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black
With his saliva. PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the
Other side of the room. CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at
Him.

CLEMENZA
Your mother's at the hospital with
The old man: He's gonna pull through.

MICHAEL nods his relief.

MICHAEL
Thanks.

He moves to THERESA.

MICHAEL
(gently)
You heard from Tom yet?

Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and
Trembles. Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the
Room; everyone speaks in a whisper.

MICHAEL
(taking her hand)
C'mon.

He leads her into his father's office without knocking.

INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

SONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad. They look
Up, startled.

SONNY
Don't worry, Theresa; they just
Want to give Tom the proposition,
Then they're going to turn him loose.

He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise,
He kisses him on the cheek.

SONNY
I was worried when we couldn't get
In touch with you in that hick town.

MICHAEL
How's Mom?

SONNY
Good. She's been through it before.
Me too. You were too young to know
About it. You better wait outside;
There're some things you shouldn't
Hear.

MICHAEL
I can help you out...

SONNY
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be
Sore as hell if I let you get mixed
Up in this.

MICHAEL
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.

SONNY
Theresa.

She understands, and leaves them alone.

SONNY
All right, Mikey...who do we have
To hit, Clemenza or Paulie?

MICHAEL
What?

SONNY
One of them fingered the old man.

MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on
Trial for their lives.

MICHAEL
Clemenza? No, I don't believe it.

SONNY
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay.
It was Paulie.

MICHAEL
How can you be sure?

SONNY
On the three days Paulie was sick
This month, he got calls from a
Payphone across from the old man's
Building. We got people in the
Phone company.
(he shrugs)
Thank God it was Paulie...we'll
Need Clemenza bad.

MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the
Situation.

MICHAEL
Is it going to be all-out war, like
Last time?

SONNY
Until the old man tells me different.

MICHAEL
Then wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.

SONNY
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't
Care what it costs. I don't care
If we have to fight all the five
Families in New York. The Tattaglia
Family's going to eat dirt. I
Don't care if we all go down
Together.

MICHAEL
(softly)
That's not how Pop would have
Played it.

SONNY
I know I'm not the man he was. But
I'll tell you this and he'll tell
You too. When it comes to real
Action, I can operate as good as
Anybody short range.

MICHAEL
(calmly)
All right, Sonny. All right.

SONNY
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.

MICHAEL
Is it like they say? Is he that
Good?

Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief.
Then open the door and rush out.

Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped
In a tight embrace with his WIFE.

HAGEN
If I plead before the Supreme
Court, I'll never do better than I
Did tonight with that Turk.

EXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

The windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's
Study. It stands out against the cold, dark night.

INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

The living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on
The edge of the sofa. The clock reads: 4:00 a.m.

INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted,
In shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep. It is four in the
Morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many
Snacks. They can barely talk anymore.

HAGEN
Is the hospital covered?

SONNY
The cops have it locked in and I
Got my people there visiting Pop
All the time. What about the hit
List.

HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.

HAGEN
Too much, too far, too personal.
The Don would consider this all
Purely a business dispute: Get rid
Of Sollozzo, and everything falls
In line. YOU don't have to go
After the Tattaglias.

CLEMENZA nods.

HAGEN
What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't
Seem worried about Luca. That
Worries me.

SONNY
If Luca sold out we're in real
Trouble.

HAGEN
Has anyone been able to get in
Touch with him?

SONNY
No, and I've been calling all night.
Maybe he's shacked up.

HAGEN
Luca never sleeps over with a broad.
He always goes home when he's
Through. Mike, keep ringing Luca's
Number.

MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the
Number once again. He can hear the phone ringing on the
Other end but no one answers. Then hangs up.

HAGEN
Keep trying every fifteen minutes.
(exhausted)

SONNY
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what
Do we do if the old man dies?

HAGEN
Without your father's political
Contacts and personal influence,
The Corleone family loses half its
Strength. Without your father, the
Other New York families might wind
Up supporting Sollozzo, and the
Tattaglias just to make sure there
Isn't a long destructive war. The
Old days are over, this is 1946;
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore. If
Your father dies...make the deal,
Sonny.

SONNY
(angry)
That's easy to say; it's not your
Father.

HAGEN
(quietly)
I was as good a son to him as you
Or Mike.

SONNY
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it
That way.

HAGEN
We're all tired...

SONNY
OK, we sit tight until the old man
Can give us the lead. But Tom, I
Want you to stay inside the Mall.
You too, Mike, no chances. Tessio,
You hold your people in reserve,
But have them nosing around the
City. The hospital is yours; I
Want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours
A day.

There is a timid knock on the door.

SONNY
What is it?

PAULIE GATTO looks in.

CLEMENZA
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...

PAULIE
The guy at the gate's outside...says
There's a package...

SONNY
Tessio, see what it is.

TESSIO gets up, leaves.

PAULIE
You want me to hang around?

SONNY
Yeah. Hang around.

PAULIE
Outside?

CLEMENZA
Outside.

PAULIE
Sure.

He closes the door.

SONNY
Clemenza. You take care of Paulie.
I don't ever want to see him again.
Understood?

CLEMENZA
Understood.

SONNY
Okay, now you can move your men
Into the Mall, replace Tessio's
People. Mike, tomorrow you take a
Couple of Clemenza's people and go
To Luca's apartment and wait for
Him to show. That crazy bastard
Might be going after Sollozzo right
Now if he's heard the news.

HAGEN
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up
In this so directly. You know the
Old man doesn't want that.

SONNY
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.

MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected. He dials Luca
Brasi's number once again. The ring repeats, but no one
Answers.

TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest
In his hand. He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped
Inside.

CLEMENZA
A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi
Sleeps with the fishes.

INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

LUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we
Remember him. BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.
LUCA looks up at him.

Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.
LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both
Clamp down as hard as they can. Suddenly, a garrote is
Thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight. His
Face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally
Purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a
Far more extreme way than a normal tongue could. His eyes
Bulge.

ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's
Strength leaves him.

BRUNO
(making an ugly face)
Oh Christ...all over the floor.

SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his
Face.

LUCA falls to the floor.

SOLLOZZO
The Godfather is next.

----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb. There are rows of
Pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block. A
Dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a
Noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell. This
Is ROCCO LAMPONE. The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,
Talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the
Side of the house. ROCCO moves to the garage, which is
Specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work
Washing a shiny brand new Lincoln. LAMPONE admires the car.

LAMPONE
Nice.

CLEMENZA
Crazy Detroit delivered it with a
Wooden bumper. They're going to
Send me the chrome bumpers in a
Couple months. I waited two years
For this car to come with wooden
Bumpers!

He scrubs and polishes with great affection.

CLEMENZA
Today you make your bones on Paulie.
You understand everything?

LAMPONE
Sure.

As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it,
Unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.

CLEMENZA
.22 soft-nosed load. Accurate up
To five feet.

LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away. GATTO's car pulls into
The driveway, and he sounds the horn.

The two men walk to the car. GATTO is driving, a bit
Nervous, like he doesn't know what is up. LAMPONE gets in
The rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of
Recognition. He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting
To chide PAULIE for being late. PAULIE flinches a little
When he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:

PAULIE
Rocco, sit on the other side. A
Big guy like you blocks my rearview
Mirror.

CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.

CLEMENZA
Goddamn Sonny. He's running scared.
He's already thinking of going to
The mattresses. We have to find a
Place on the West Side. Paulie,
You know a good location?

PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook
He was on. Also there's the money he can make by selling
Sollozzo any secret location.

PAULIE
I'll think about it.

CLEMENZA
(grunting)
Drive while you thinking; I wanna
Get to the City this month!

The car pulls out.

EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)

Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump. OUR
VIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.

EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

The Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter
Light.

INT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

Inside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.
He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of
Him.

CLEMENZA
Pay attention!

EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

The car is parked in the City. PAULIE comes down from an
Available apartment and gets back into the car.

PAULIE
Good for ten men...

CLEMENZA
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm
Suppose to call when I found
Somethin'.

The car pulls off.

EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

New part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.
CLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.

CLEMENZA
You wait; I'll call.

He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the
Corner and enters the Luna Restaurant.

INT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

CLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.
The WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some
Bread--and then a plate of veal on his table. He eats.

EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

CLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants;
He is well fed.

We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to
Expect has happened to Paulie.

There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel,
LAMPONE in the rear seat. CLEMENZA steps in.

CLEMENZA
He talked my ear off. Want us to
Go back to Long Beach; have another
Job for us. Rocco, you live in the
City, can we drop you off?

LAMPONE (O.S.)
Ah, I left my car at your place.

CLEMENZA
OK, then you gotta come back.

The car pulls out. By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and
Secure.

PAULIE
You think we'll go for that last
Place?

CLEMENZA
Maybe, or you gotta know now.

PAULIE
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.

EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)

The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.
Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.

CLEMENZA
Paulie, pull over. I gotta take a
Leak.

The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds. CLEMENZA
Steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.

He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer
See the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting
The ground. We wait on this for a moment; and then there
Are two GUNSHOTS. CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and
Turns, moving back to the car.

PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind
Him are shattered.

CLEMENZA
Leave the gun.

LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few
Feet where there is another car. They get in, and drive off.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL. It is late afternoon. Many strange
Cars are parked on the nearby streets. We can see the group
Of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries
With concealed weapons.

MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.

He is bundled in a warm marine coat. He looks at the
Strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe. They
Look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the
Respect of his position. He is like an exile Prince. He
Wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.

A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground
Equipment. The basketball ring now half coming off. This
Is where he was a child. Then a shout.

CLEMENZA (O.S.)
Mike. Hey Mikey; telephone.

CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window. MICHAEL
Hurries into the house.

INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

CLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.
He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the
Hook.

CLEMENZA
Some dame.

MICHAEL picks it up.

MICHAEL
Hello. Kay?

KAY (O.S.)
How is your father?

MICHAEL
He'll be OK.

KAY (O.S.)
(pause)
I love you.

He glances at the THUGS in the kitchen. Tries to shield the
Phone.

KAY (O.S.)
I LOVE YOU.

MICHAEL
Yeah Kay, I'm here.

KAY (O.S.)
Can you say it?

MICHAEL
Huh?

KAY (O.S.)
Tell me you love me.

MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table. He curls
Up in a corner, and in a quarter voice:

MICHAEL
I can't...

KAY (O.S.)
Please say it.

MICHAEL
Look. I'll see you tonight, OK?

KAY (O.S.)
OK.
(click)

CLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all
The button men stationed around the house.

CLEMENZA
How come you don't tell that nice
Girl you love her...here, learn
Something... you may have to feed
Fifty guys some day. You start
With olive oil...fry some garlic,
See. And then fry some sausage...or meat
Balls if you like...then you throw
In the tomatoes, the tomato
Paste...some basil; and a little
Red wine...that's my trick.

SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.

SONNY
You take care of Paulie?

CLEMENZA
You won't see Paulie anymore. He's
Sick for good this winter.

MICHAEL starts to leave.

SONNY
Where are you going?

MICHAEL
To the city.

SONNY
(to Clemenza; dipping
Bread into the sauce)
Send some bodyguards.

MICHAEL
I don't need them, Sonny. I'm just
Going to see Pop in the hospital.
Also, I got other things.

CLEMENZA
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.

SONNY
OK, but be careful.

EXT NITE: CAR

MICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven
Into the city. THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front
Seat.

INT NITE: HOTEL LOBBY

MICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying
To book rooms.

INT NITE: HOTEL

MICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel. He is
Preoccupied, she's concerned.

MICHAEL
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty.
I'll just sit with him; I want to
Show respect.

KAY
Can I go to the hospital with you?

MICHAEL
I don't think so. You don't want
To end up on page 3 of the Daily
News.

KAY
My parents don't read the Daily
News. All right, if you think I
Shouldn't. I can't believe the
Things the papers are printing.
I'm sure most of it's not true.

MICHAEL
I don't think so either.
(silence)
I better go.

KAY
When will I see you again?

MICHAEL
I want you to go back to New
Hampshire...think things over.

He leans over her; kisses her.

KAY
When will I see you again?

MICHAEL
Goodbye.

Quietly, he moves out the door.

KAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:

KAY
Goodbye.

EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with
A neon sign ""HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY."" MICHAEL steps out, pays
The fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.

MICHAEL looks.

He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted. He
Is the only one on the street. There are gay, twinkling
Christmas decorations all over the building. He walks,
Slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps. He
Hesitates, looks around. This area is empty. He checks the
Address on a scrap of paper. It is correct. He tries the
Door, it is empty.

He walks in.

INT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital
Lobby. He looks to the right; there is a long, empty
Corridor. To the left: the same.

HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated
Building lit by eerie green neon lighting. All we hear are
His sole footsteps.

He walks up to a desk marked ""INFORMATION"". No one is there.
He moves quickly to a door marked ""OFFICE""; swings into it;
No one is there. He looks onto the desk: There is half a
Sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.

MICHAEL
Hello? Hello?

Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,
Alertly. MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all
Alone. The floors have just been mopped. They are still wet.

INT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS

Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several
Flights.

INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

He steps out onto the fourth floor. He looks. There are
Merely empty corridors. He takes out his scrap of paper;
Checks it. ""Room 4A."" Now he hurries, trying to follow the
Code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker
And quicker they flash by him. Now he stops, looks up ""4A--
Corleone"".

There is a special card table set up there with some
Magazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the
Ashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.

INT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A

Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he
Will find. He looks. Lit by the moonlight through the
Window, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the
Room, and under a transparent oxygen tent. All that can be
Heard is the steady though strained breathing. Slowly
MICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,
Securely asleep. Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the
Bed, and run to his nose and mouth.

VOICE (O.S.)
What are you doing here?

This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around. It is a
NURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.

NURSE
You're not supposed to be here now.

MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.

MICHAEL
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my
Father. What happened to the
Detectives who were guarding him?

NURSE
Oh your father just had too many
Visitors. It interfered with the
Hospital service. The police came
And made them all leave just ten
Minutes ago.
(comfortingly)
But don't worry. I look in on him.

MICHAEL
You just stand here one minute...

Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.

MICHAEL
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm
Down at the hospital. I came down
Late. There's no one here. None
Of Tessio's people--no detectives,
No one. The old man is completely
Unprotected.

SONNY (O.S.)
All right, get him in a different
Room; lock the door from the inside.
I'll have some men there inside of
Fifteen minutes. Sit tight, and
Don't panic.

MICHAEL
(furiously, but kept inside)
I won't panic.

He hangs up; returns to the NURSE...

NURSE
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.

MICHAEL
(coldly)
You and I are going to move my
Father right now...to another room
On another floor...Can you
Disconnect those tubes so we can
Wheel the bed out?

NURSE
Absolutely not! We have to get
Permission from the Doctor.

MICHAEL
You've read about my father in the
Papers. You've seen that no one's
Here to guard him. Now I've just
Gotten word that men are coming to
This hospital to kill him. Believe
Me and help me.

NURSE
(frightened)
We don't have to disconnect them,
We can wheel the stand with the bed.

She does so...and they perform the very difficult task of
Moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.

INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

They roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently
Down the corridor. We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.
MICHAEL hears them, stops.

MICHAEL
Hurry, into there.

They push it into the first available room. MICHAEL peeks
Out from the door. The footsteps are louder; then they
Emerge. It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet
Of flowers.

MICHAEL
(stepping out)
Who is it?

ENZO
Michael...do you remember me, Enzo,
The baker's helper to Nazorine, now
His son-in-law.

MICHAEL
Enzo, get out of here. There's
Going to be trouble.

A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.

ENZO
If there...will be trouble...I stay
With you, to help. I owe it to the
Godfather.

MICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.

MICHAEL
Go outside; stand in front...I'll
Be out in a minute.

INT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

They part. MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they
Put his FATHER.

NURSE
(frightened)
He's awake.

MICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he
Cannot speak. MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.

MICHAEL
Pop...Pop, it's me Michael. Shhhh,
Don't try to speak. There are men
Who are coming to try to kill you.
But I'm with you...I'm with you
Now...

The OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot. MICHAEL tenderly
Puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.

EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)

Outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,
Pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only
Weapon. MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him. They
Both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.
They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,
Lights it. ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.

MICHAEL
Get rid of those and look like
You've got a gun in your pocket.

The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas
Decorations.

MICHAEL
Listen...

We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming. MICHAEL
And ENZO look with fear in their eyes. Then MICHAEL takes
The bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.
They stand, hands in their pockets.

A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.
MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive. The car
Seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.
MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved. MICHAEL looks down; the
BAKER's hands are shaking. He looks at his own, and they
Are not.

Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of
Police sirens. They are clearly coming toward the hospital,
Getting louder and louder. MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.

In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of
The hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed
POLICE and DETECTIVES. He smiles his relief and starts
Toward them. TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his
Arms while ANOTHER frisks him. A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,
Spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,
With beefy red face and white hair seems furious. This is
McCLUSKEY.

MCCLUSKEY
I thought I got all you guinea
Hoods locked up. Who the hell are
You and what are you doing here?

ANOTHER COP standing nearby:

COP
He's clean, Captain.

MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.

MICHAEL
(quietly)
What happened to the detectives who
Were supposed to be guarding my
Father?

MCCLUSKEY
(furious)
You punk-hood. Who the hell are
You to tell me my business. I
Pulled them off. I don't care how
Many Dago gangsters kill each other.
I wouldn't lift a finger to keep
Your old man from getting knocked
Off. Now get the hell out of here;
Get off this street you punk, and
Stay away from this hospital.

MICHAEL stands quiet.

MICHAEL
I'll stay until you put guards
Around my father's room.

MCCLUSKEY
Phil, lock this punk up.

A DETECTIVE
The Kid's clean, Captain...He's a
War hero, and he's never been mixed
Up in the rackets...

MCCLUSKEY
(furious)
Goddam it, I said lock him up. Put
The cuffs on him.

MICHAEL
(deliberately, right
To McCLUSKEY's face,
As he's being handcuffed)
How much is the Turk paying you to
Set my father up, Captain?

Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL
Squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.
MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw. He looks at
McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and
He falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S
MEN arrive.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

HIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL. The gateway now has a
Long black car blocking it. There are more BUTTON MEN
Stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying
Rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN
Standing by open windows. It is clear that the war is
Escalating. A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,
MICHAEL and HAGEN. MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged. He
Stops and looks up at the open window. We can see MEN
Holding rifles.

MICHAEL
Christ, Sonny really means business.

They continue walking. TESSIO joins them. The various
BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.

CLEMENZA
How come all the new men?

TESSIO
We'll need them now. After the
Hospital incident, Sonny got mad.
We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock
This morning.

INT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY

They enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

SONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.

SONNY
I've got a hundred button men on
The streets twenty-four hours a day.
If Sollozzo shows one hair on his
Ass he's dead.

He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,
Kiddingly.

SONNY
Mikey, you look beautiful!

MICHAEL
Cut it out.

SONNY
The Turk wants to talk! The nerve
Of that son of a bitch! After he
Craps out last night he wants a meet.

HAGEN
Was there a definite proposal?

SONNY
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to
Meet him to hear his proposition.
The promise is the deal will be so
Good we can't refuse.

HAGEN
What about that Tattaglias? What
Will they do about Bruno?

SONNY
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out
What they did to my father.

HAGEN
We should hear what they have to say.

SONNY
No, no Consiglere. Not this time.
No more meetings, no more
Discussions, no more Sollozzo
Tricks. Give them one message: I
WANT SOLLOZZO. If not, it's all
Out war. We go to the mattresses
And we put all the button men out
On the street.

HAGEN
The other families won't sit still
For all out war.

SONNY
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.

HAGEN
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't
Want to hear this. This is not a
Personal thing, this is Business.

SONNY
And when they shot me father...

HAGEN
Yes, even the shooting of your
Father was business, not personal...

SONNY
No no, no more advice on how to
Patch it up Tom. You just help me
Win. Understood?

HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.

HAGEN
I found out about this Captain
McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.
He's definitely on Sollozzo's
Payroll, and for big money.
McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's
Bodyguard. What you have to
Understand is that while Sollozzo
Is guarded like this, he's
Invulnerable. Nobody has ever
Gunned down a New York Police
Captain. Never. It would be
Disastrous. All the five families
Would come after you Sonny; the
Corleone family would be outcasts;
Even the old man's political
Protection would run for cover. So
Just...take that into consideration.

SONNY
(still fuming)
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk
Forever. We'll wait.

MICHAEL
We can't wait. No matter what
Sollozzo say about a deal, he's
Figuring out how to kill Pop. You
Have to get Sollozzo now.

SONNY
The kid's right.

HAGEN
What about McCluskey?

MICHAEL
Let's say now that we have to kill
McCluskey. We'll clear that up
Through our Newspaper contacts later.

SONNY
Go on Mike.

MICHAEL
They want me to go to the conference
With Sollozzo. Set up the meeting
For two days from now. Sonny, get
Our informers to find out where the
Meeting will be held.
Insist it has to be a public place:
A bar or restaurant at the height
Of the dinner hour. So I'll feel
Safe. They'll check me when I meet
Them so I won't be able to carry a
Weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a
Way to have one planted there for
Me.
(pause)
Then I'll kill them both.

Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.
Silence. SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter. He points
A finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.

SONNY
You? You, the high-class college
Kid. You never wanted to get mixed
Up in the family business. Now you
Wanta gun down a police Captain and
The Turk just because you got
Slapped in the face. You're taking
It personal, it's just business and
He's taking it personal.

Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps
His face serious.

MICHAEL
(angrily, but cold)
Sonny, it's all personal, and I
Learned it from him, the old man,
The Godfather. He took my joining
The Marines personal. I take
Sollozzo trying to kill my father
Personal, and you know I'll kill
Them Sonny.

MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.

INT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945)

CLOSE on a revolver.

CLEMENZA (O.S.)
It's as cold as they come,
Impossible to trace.
(he turns it upside down)
Don't worry about prints Mike, I
Put a special tape on the trigger
And butt. Here.
(he hands the gun to
Another pair of hands)
Whatsamatter? Trigger too tight.
(it fires: very LOUD)
I left it noisy, so it'll scare any
Pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander
Away.

MICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.

CLEMENZA
Just let your hand drop to your
Side, and let the gun slip out.
Everybody will still think you got
It. They'll be starin' at your
Face, see? Then walk out of the
Place real fast, but don't run.
Don't look anybody directly in the
Eye, but don't look away from them
Neither. Hey, they'll be scared
Stiff o you, believe me. Nobody's
Gonna bother with you. Don't worry
About nothing; you'd be surprised
How good these things go. O.K.,
Put your hat on, let's see how you
Look. Helps with identification.

They put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.

CLEMENZA
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse
To change their identification when
We make them see the light. Then
You take a long vacation and we
Catch the hell.

MICHAEL
How bad will it be?

CLEMENZA
Probably all the other families
Will line up against us. But, it's
Alright. These things have to
Happen once every ten years or
So...gets rid of the bad blood.
You gotta stop 'em at the beginning.
Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at
Munich, they shoulda never let him
Get away with that, they were just
Asking for big trouble...

INT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house. A card
Table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the
Corleone buttonmen.

He continues into the living room. It's a mess. SONNY
Asleep on the sofa. On the coffee table are the remains of
A take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of
Whisky. The radio is playing.

MICHAEL
Why don't you stop living like a
Bum and get this place cleaned up.

SONNY
What are you, inspecting the
Barracks?
(SONNY sits up with
His head in his hands)
You ready? Did Clemenza tell you
Be sure to drop the gun right away?

MICHAEL
A million times.

SONNY
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to
Pick you up in an hour and a half
On Times Square, under the big
Camels sign.

HAGEN
We don't let Mike go until we have
The hostage, Sonny.

CLEMENZA
It's okay...the hostage is outside
Playing pinochle with three of my
Men.

The phone rings in the DON's office.

SONNY
That could be a Tattaglia informer
With the meeting place.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

HAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS
Move in.

HAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.

SONNY
One of Tattaglia's people?

HAGEN
No. Our informer in McCluskey's
Precinct. Tonight at 8:00 he
Signed out for Louis' Restaurant in
The Bronx. Anyone know it.

TESSIO
Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.
A small family place with big
Booths where people can talk in
Private. Good food. Everybody
Minds their business. Perfect.
(he moves to the desk
And makes a crude drawing)
This is the entrance, Mike. When
You finish just walk out and turn
Left, then turn the corner.
Clemenza, you gotta work fast to
Plant the gun. They got an old-
Fashioned toilet with a space
Between the water container and the
Wall. We can tape the gun behind
There.

CLEMENZA
Mike, they're gonna frisk you in
The car. You'll be clean so they
Won't worry 'bout nothing. In the
Restaurant, wait and talk a while,
And then ask permission to go. See?
Then when you come out, don't waste
Time; don't sit down...you come out
Blasting. And don't take chances.
In the head, two shots apiece. And
Out as fast as your legs can move.

SONNY
I want somebody very good, very
Safe to plant that gun. I don't
Want my brother coming out of that
Toilet with just his dick in his
Hand.

CLEMENZA
The gun will be there.

SONNY
(to MICHAEL, warmly)
You're on, kid...I'll square it
With Mom your not seeing her before
You left. And I'll get a message
To your girl friend when I think
The time is right.

CLEMENZA
We gotta move...

MICHAEL
O.K. How long do you think before
I can come back?

SONNY
Probably a year...

HAGEN
(starting to crack)
Jesus, I don't know...

SONNY
Can you do it Mike?

MICHAEL moves out.

EXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)

The enormous ""CAMELS"" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands
MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat
CLEMENZA had given him. A long black car pulls around the
Corner and slows before him. The DRIVER, leaning over, open
The front door.

DRIVER
Get in, Mike.

He does, the car drives off.

EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

Inside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat
And shakes MIKE's hand.

SOLLOZZO
I'm glad you came, Mike. I hope we
Can straighten everything out. All
This is terrible, it's not the way
I wanted things to happen at all.
It should never have happened.

MICHAEL
I want to settle things tonight. I
Want my father left alone.

SOLLOZZO
He won't be; I swear to you be my
Children he won't be. Just keep an
Open mind when we talk. I hope
You're not a hothead like your
Brother, Sonny. It's impossible to
Talk business with him.

McCLUSKEY grunts.

MCCLUSKEY
He's a good kid. He's all right.
Turn around, up on your knees,
Facing me.

He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.

MCCLUSKEY
I'm sorry about the other night
Mike. I'm getting too old for my
Job, too grouchy. Can't stand the
Aggravation. You know how it is.
He's clean.

EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where
They're heading.

The car takes the George Washington Bridge. MICHAEL is
Concerned.

MICHAEL
We're going to New Jersey?

SOLLOZZO
(sly)
Maybe.

MICHAEL closes his eyes.

EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)

The car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way
To New Jersey. Then suddenly it hits the divider,
Temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the
Lanes going back to New York. It then hits it very fast, on
The way back to the city.

EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

SOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and
Then leans to the DRIVER.

SOLLOZZO
Nice work; I'll remember it.

MICHAEL is relieved.

EXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

The car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in
The Bronx: The ""LUNA AZURA"". There is no one on the street.
MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with
Them. He gets out, and opens the door. SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY
And MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the
Car. They enter the restaurant.

INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

A very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.
SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small
Round table near the center of the room. There are empty
Booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,
And ONE or TWO WAITERS. It is very quiet.

MCCLUSKEY
Is the Italian food good here?

SOLLOZZO
Try the veal; it's the finest in
New York.

The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.
They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three
Glasses. Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:

SOLLOZZO
I am going to talk Italian to Mike.

MCCLUSKEY
Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll
Concentrate on my veal and my
Spaghetti.

SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian. MICHAEL listening
Carefully and nodding every so often. Then MICHAEL answers
In Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on. The WAITER occasionally
Brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.
Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in
Italian, accidentally lapses into English.

MICHAEL
(using English for emphasis)
Most important...I want a sure
Guarantee that no more attempts
Will be made on my father's life.

SOLLOZZO
What guarantees can I give you? I
Am the hunted one. I've missed my
Chance. You think too highly of
Me, my friend...I am not so
Clever...all I want if a truce...

MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling
Holding his open hands up as if to say: ""I have no tricks up
My sleeve"". Then he looks away and makes a distressed look
On his face.

SOLLOZZO
What is it?

MICHAEL
Is it all right if I go to the
Bathroom?

SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious. He studies MICHAEL with
His dark eyes. Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's
Thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.

MCCLUSKEY
I frisked him; I've frisked
Thousands of young punks; he's clean.

He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;
Indicating the bathroom with his eyes. The MAN nods,
Indicating no one is there.

SOLLOZZO
Don't take too long.

MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and
Disappears inside.

INT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very
Hard. He actually uses the urinal. Then he washes his
Hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.
Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.
Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he
Cannot feel the gun. We see behind the tank his hand is
Just a few inches from the gun...he gropes
Searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him. Then he
Breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep
Breath and shoves it under his waistband. For some
Unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately
Washes his hands and dries them. Then he goes out.

INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.
McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal. SOLLOZZO
Turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at
MICHAEL. MICHAEL looks back. Then he smiles and continues
Back to the table. He sits down.

MICHAEL
Now I can talk. I feel much better.

The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now
He too relaxes. SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down
Comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton
His jacket. SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again
But MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear
Him.

The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to
Speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away
From him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts
The gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his
Temple. He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's
Head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the
Entire area.

The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is
Sprayed and stained with blood.

SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he
Seems to hang in space suspended.

MICHAEL pivots, and looks:

There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal
Suspended in air before his gaping mouth.

MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging
Throat. He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound. Then
Coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right
Through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.

The air is filled with pink mist.
MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.
He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.
Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty.
The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an
Expression of horror on his face.
MICHAEL looks at his two victims:
SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by
The table.
McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.
MICHAEL is wildly at a peak. He starts to move out. His
Hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.
He moves, not letting the gun go.

MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.

His hand: still holding the gun.

His face: finally he closes his eyes.

His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.

He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.

He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had
Been recreated in wax.

Then he leaves.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

FADE IN:

INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

A MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old
Upright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.
ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.

A little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,
Quietly eating. They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there
Is an occasional laugh.

ROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered
With a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.

A large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.

The sentimental tune is continued over the following:

INT DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)

A MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie
Still together in a bullet-riddled automobile.

INT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945)

A MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.

INT DAY: MATTRESS

Ten mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty
Living room of an apartment. THREE or FOUR MEN including
CLEMENZA, are taking naps.

An arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.

The MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and
Pouring the wine.

Trash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.

INT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

A MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an
Office building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S.
Truman.

EXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945)

ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning
Three steps of a front stoop.

INT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a
Crossword puzzle.

A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.

Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.
Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.

A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of
Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.

EXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945)

A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet
Alley.

INT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945)

A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in
A pool of blood on the tablecloth.

INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an
Apartment. We catch a glimpse of one headline: ""Five Family
War...""

The table. The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts. ONE
Has fallen asleep on his arms at the table.

SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.

The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse. Picks up
And takes a drag from his cigarette. The OTHER MAN nods
Appreciatively.

MAN
Nice Augie...nice.

EXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46)

Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York
Apartment building. We recognize a couple of SONNY's
Bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards
Against the curb.

Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of
Brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.

Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step,
Smoking a cigarette.

One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch,
Which is attached to a key chain. We HEAR the sound of a
Door opening; they look up.

The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.

SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI
Wrapped around him. She doesn't want to let go of him; she
Draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he
Comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.

He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard
On the first floor, and moves outside toward his car. The
Men quickly take up their positions. As he gets in his car:

DRIVER
Pick up your sister?

SONNY
Yeah.

The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the
Bodyguards in their cars.

INT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)

He knocks on the door. No answer. Then again.

CONNIE'S VOICE
Who is it?

SONNY
It's me, Sonny.

We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open. SONNY
Enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her
Back to him.

SONNY
(tenderly)
Connie, what is it?

He turns her around in his arms.

Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her
Rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.
As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red
With rage. She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing
Him from running out of the apartment.

CONNIE
(desperately)
It was my fault! I started a fight
With him and I tried to hit him so
He hit me. He didn't even try to
Hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.

Sonny listens, and calms himself. He touches her shoulder,
The thin silk robe.

SONNY
I'm goin' to have the doctor come
Over and take a look at you.

He starts to leave.

CONNIE
Oh Sonny, please don't do anything.
Please don't.

He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.

SONNY
Hey. Con. What'm I goin' to do?
Make your kid a orphan before he's
Born.

She laughs with him. He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.

EXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET

CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.
""Book"" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking
Beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the
Corner. The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the
Kids on the street are still playing stickball.

CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street
Suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block
And to a halt in front of the candy store. The tires
Scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a
MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast
The everyone is paralyzed. It is a moment before we
Recognize that it is SONNY.

His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on
The stoop and has CARLO by the throat.

He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down
Into the street. But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,
And hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to
Hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.
His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.

SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.

SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,
In a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing. His
Blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.

The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching
In fascination.

CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.

SONNY beats him mercilessly.

Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become
Spectators.

SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into
CARLO's face and body.

CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does
Nothing, other than hang onto the railing.

SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag
Him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in
The effort. Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;
Even biting them. CARLO screams but he does not let go.

It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will
Not be moved. SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him
More; but he is exhausted. Totally out of breath, he
Stammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.

SONNY
You...bastard...You...hurt my
Sister... again...and I'll
Kill...you.

He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.
And hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,
Leaving even his bodyguards in confusion. We notice ONE MAN
With a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially
Interested.

CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands. He slumps
Onto the stoop.

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall. It is a gray, rainy day.
Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of
Various points around the main house and compound. Things
Have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new
And secure gate house has been built. Security measures
That had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made
A permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval
Fortress. We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the
Result of a recent bomb attempt. The house nearest the
Crater is damaged by fire.

A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright
Yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the
Shelter of the gate house.

They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they
Call the main house.

KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still
Runs down onto her face.

She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the
Sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.

TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.

HAGEN
Kay, we weren't expecting you. You
Should call...

KAY
I've tried calling and writing. I
Want to reach Michael.

HAGEN
Nobody knows where he is. We know
He's all right, but that's all.

KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with
Rainwater.

KAY
What was that?

HAGEN
An accident. No one was hurt.

KAY
Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I
Come in to call another one?

TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has
To.

HAGEN
Sure...I'm sorry.

They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.

INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

In the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and
Takes her rainhat off.

KAY
Will you give this to him.

HAGEN
If I accept that letter and you
Told a Court of Law I accepted it,
They would interpret it as my
Having knowledge of his whereabouts.
Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.

We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE
Enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.

MAMA
You're Mikey's little girl.

KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.

MAMA
You eat anything?

KAY shakes her head.

MAMA
(to HAGEN)
Disgrazia, you don't even give the
Poor girl a cup of coffee?

HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves
Toward MAMA, the letter extended.

KAY
Will you give this letter to Michael.

HAGEN
Mama, no.

MAMA
You tell me what to do? Even he
Don't tell me what to do.

She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.

KAY
Why did they blame Michael?

MAMA
You listen to me, you go home to
Your family, and you find a good
Young man and get married. Forget
About Mikey; he's no good for you,
Anymore.

She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what
That means.

EXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)

A hospital in New York City. POLICE and teams of PRIVATE
DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area. An ambulance
With a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the
Hospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL
ASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying
The DON.

TESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing
Up the rear. HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a
Moment they disappear behind the ambulance. Then suddenly,
Siren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung
Cars.

EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

The Corleone Mall.

Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone
Mall. EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE
DETECTIVES.

It all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.
All is silent. The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday
Clothes, wait.

EXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)

One ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway,
Preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a
Team of BUTTON MEN.

Sitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with
A rifle on his lap.

INT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946)

Inside the Main CORLEONE House:

Hospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully
Under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and
Various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.

All the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA,
THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.

INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but
Been converted into a hospital room, with complete and
Extensive equipment. The various CHILDREN get a turn to
Kiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then
SONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO
Should leave.

They do, the door is closed.

INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the
Sunday dinner, and set the table.

CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.

CONNIE
What's the matter, Carlo?

CARLO
Shut up.

INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

All the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with
Grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN. The DON
Does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and
Glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized. HAGEN is
The spokesman for the family.

HAGEN
...since McCluskey's killing, the
Police have cracked down on most of
Our operations...on the other
Families too. There's been a lot
Of bad blood.

The OLD MAN glances at SONNY.

SONNY
Pop, they hit us and we hit them
Back.

HAGEN
We put out a lot of material
Through our contacts in the
Newspapers...about McCluskey's
Being tied up with Sollozzo in the
Drug Rackets...things are starting
To loosen up.

The OLD MAN nods.

SONNY
Freddie's gonna go to Las
Vegas...under the protection of Don
Francesco of L.A. I want him to
Rest...

FREDO
I'm goin' to learn the casino
Business.

The DON nods approvingly. Then he searches around the room
For a face he does not see. HAGEN knows who he's looking for.

HAGEN
Michael...
(he takes a breath)
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and
Rage.

HAGEN
He's safe now...we're already
Working on ways to bring him back.

The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they
Leave him alone.

INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)

HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is
Expansive and optimistic.

SONNY
We'll let the old man take it easy
For a couple of weeks. I want to
Get things going good before he
Gets better. What's the matter
With you?

HAGEN
You start operating, the five
Families will start their raids
Again. We're at a stalemate Sonny,
Your war is costing us a lot of
Money.

SONNY
No more stalemate Tom, we got the
Soldiers, we'll match them gun for
Gun if that's how they want it.
They know me for what I am, Tom--
And they're scared of me.

HAGEN
Yes. That's true, you're getting a
Hell of a reputation.

SONNY
Well it's war! We might not be in
This shape if we had a real war-
Time Consiglere, a Sicilian. Pop
Had Genco, who do I have?
(TOM starts to leave)
Hey Tom, hey...hey. It's Sunday,
We're gonna have dinner. Don't be
Sore.

INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table
Over Sunday dinner. SONNY is at the head of the table.

EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

SOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed
Mall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally
By the gate.

ONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house. A
Young BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.

-----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------

INT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)

CONNIE and CARLO's apartment. She's in a slip, on the phone.
We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.

CONNIE
Who is this?

GIRL (O.S.)
(giggle)
I'm a friend of Carlo's. I just
Wanted to tell him I can't see him
Tonight; I have to go out of town.

CONNIE's face turns red.

CONNIE
You lousy tramp bitch.
(click)

She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the
Bathroom drying his golden body.

CARLO
What was that?

CONNIE
Your girl friend. She says she
Can't make it tonight. You lousy
Bastard you have the nerve to give
Your whores my telephone number.
I'll kill you, you bastard!

She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then
She flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy
Belly heaving under the thin slip.

CARLO
(defending himself)
You're crazy. She was kidding
Around; I don't know, some nut.

He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue
Dressing.

CONNIE
You're staying home. You're not
Going out.

CARLO
OK, OK. You gonna make me something
To eat at least?

That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing
Heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and
Starts her wifely duties.

CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in
The doorway.

CONNIE
The food is on the table.

CARLO
I'm not hungry yet.

CONNIE
Eat it, it's on the table.

CARLO
Ba Fa Goulle.

CONNIE
BA FA GOULE YOU!

She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen. A moment
Later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking. CARLO
Slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically
Smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy
Veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.

CARLO
You filthy guinea spoiled brat.
Clean it up or I'll kick your head
In.

CONNIE
Like hell I will.

She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again. Slowly,
He slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in
His hand.

CARLO
Clean it up!

He swings the belt against her heavy hips. She moves back
Into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it
Ready.

CARLO
Even the female Corleones are
Murderers.

He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her. She
Makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids. He
Pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process. She
Gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table,
Gets her; and starts to slap her in the face.

She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.

CONNIE
The baby! The baby!

INT DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

She runs into the bedroom; he follows. She moves into a
Corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide
Under the bed.

He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.

He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he
Throws her on the bed, contemptuously. He grabs part of her
Thigh, pinching it very hard.

CARLO
You're fat as a pig.

Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving
Her in tears. She is crying; she pulls herself to the
Bedroom phone, and in a whisper:

CONNIE
Mama...mama, it's Connie. Mama, I
Can't talk any louder. No, I don't
Want to talk to Sonny.

We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.

INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)

In the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the
Whispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.

SONNY
Yeah Connie.

CONNIE (O.S.)
Sonny, just send a car to bring me
Home. I'll tell you then, it's
Nothing Sonny, don't you come.
Send TOM, please Sonny, it's
Nothing; I just want to come home.

SONNY's face is turning red.

SONNY
(in a controlled voice)
You wait there. You just wait there.

He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.

SONNY
(quietly)
That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...

HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he
Cannot interfere.

EXT DAY: MALL

SONNY leaves the house. HAGEN moves to the outside mall
Just as SONNY's car is driving off. He moves to a group of
BUTTON MEN.

HAGEN
Go after him.

EXT DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)

SONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.
After a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is
Trailing.

SONNY is driving; he is very angry.

EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

SONNY in his car; driving back. Still breathing hard and
Still furious. Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.
He starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a
Toll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the
COLLECTOR.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

FADE IN:

INT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT

The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.

HAGEN (O.S.)
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Don Corleone, at his request.

BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.
BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.

BONASERA
Yes, I understand. I'm listening.

HAGEN (O.S.)
You owe the Don a service. In one
Hour, not before, perhaps later, he
Will be at your funeral parlor to
Ask for your help. Be there to
Greet him. If you have any
Objections speak now, and I'll
Inform him.

Silence. BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.

BONASERA
Anything...Anything the Godfather
Wishes.

HAGEN (O.S.)
Good. He never doubted you.

BONASERA
The Don himself is coming to me
Tonight?

HAGEN (O.S.)
Yes.
(click)

BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE
Sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.

Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing. His WIFE knows
Something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes
From him. He lights a cigarette.

BONASERA
For the last year, they have been
Killing one another. So now, what?
Your Godfather comes to me...Why?
(whispering, slyly)
They've killed someone so important
That they wish to make his body
Disappear.

MRS. BONASERA
(frightened)
Amerigo!

BONASERA
They could make me an accomplice to
Their murder. They could send me
To jail!

He slips into his trousers. Then he moves to his WIFE to
Tie his tie, as she has done for years.

BONASERA
And if the other families find
Out...they will make me their enemy.
They could come here to our house.
I curse the day I ever went to the
Godfather.

EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.

INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without
Turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room,
Past the tables, and equipment. He operates the chain that
Lifts a large overhead garage type door. And looks out into
The alley.

He sits on a bench, and waits.

EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)

The tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley;
We notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral
Parlor.

CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.
BONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak. He notices TWO
OTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a
CORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet
Protruding.

BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way
The MEN should carry their sinister burden.

INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming
Room.

Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the
Darkness somewhat uncertainly. It is DON CORLEONE.

He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking. His
Cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.
Then, after a long gaze:

DON CORLEONE
Well my friend, are you ready to do
Me this service?

BONASERA nods. The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming
Table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.

BONASERA
What do you wish me to do?

DON CORLEONE
(staring at the table)
I want you to use all your powers,
All your skill, as you love me. I
Do not want his mother to see him
As he is.

He draws down the gray blanket.

BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:

The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.

EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

SONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.

A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the
Booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets
Him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll
Booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the
Car blocking him.

The windows of his car are shot out.

Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car.

His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.

His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it
Continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that
He will survive it.

Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and
Actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER
Fire.

His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.

A FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and
Make off in the distance.

SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they
Are too late.

INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

View on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room. He is silent
A moment, and then:

HAGEN
(quietly)
OK. Go to Clemenza's house and
Tell him to come here right away.
He'll tell you what to do.

The MEN leave him alone. He is quiet, standing in the
Middle of the living room a moment. He looks in the
Direction of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA
Moving around.

INT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)

TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the
DON's room. He opens the DON's door. Looks in.

INT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

The DON in his hospital bed. Asleep under sedation. HAGEN
Hesitates. He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN. He
Closes the door.

INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)

HAGEN alone in the office. He is drinking. He looks up at
The sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving. Then he
Hears footsteps.

The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE
Slowly enters the room. He walks directly to his stuffed
Armchair, sits down. His face is stern, as he looks into
HAGEN's eyes.

DON CORLEONE
Give me a drop of anisette.

HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.

DON CORLEONE
My wife was weeping before she fell
Asleep, outside my window I saw my
Caporegimes to the house, and it is
Midnight. So, Consigliere of mine,
I think you should tell your Don
What everyone knows.

HAGEN
(quietly)
I didn't tell Mama anything. I was
About to come up and wake you and
Tell you. Just now.

DON CORLEONE
But you needed a drink first.

HAGEN
Yes.

DON CORLEONE
Now you've had your drink.

Pause.

HAGEN
They shot Sonny on the Causeway.
(pause)
He's dead.

DON CORLEONE blinks. One feels that just for a second he
Loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of
Him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.

DON CORLEONE
I want no inquiries made. No acts
Of vengeance.
(pause)
Consigliere, arrange a meeting with
The heads of the five
Families...this war stops now.

He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...

DON CORLEONE
Call Bonasera...he will do me a
Service.

And leaves. HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...

HAGEN
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for
Don Corleone, at his request.

BONASERA (O.S.)
Yes, I understand I'm listening.

HAGEN
You owe the Don a service. He has
No doubt that you will repay it.

EXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)

Day in Manhattan. An impressive Bank Building in the
Financial center of New York. Many limousines are parked,
Uniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.

INT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)

The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.

CARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man,
Sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a
MAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and
Settles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man;
As the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:

DON CORLEONE (O.S.)
I want to thank you all for coming.
I consider it a service done to me
Personally and I am in the debt of
Each and every one of you.
Especially those of you who have
Traveled from such distances as
California, St. Louis, Kansas City;
And New Orleans...

The VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both
Younger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA,
Short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the
Table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his
JEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an
Older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO
CUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then
DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair
And a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his
Early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at
CONNIE's Wedding.

DON CORLEONE
Ah well, let's get down to business.
We are all honorable men here, we
Don't have to give assurances as if
We were lawyers.
(he sits, gazes out
At them, and sighs)
How did things ever go so far?
Well, no matter. A lot of
Foolishness has come to pass. It
Was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks. A
Large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times,
And two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during
The day's trading, and projected above.

DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.

DON CORLEONE
Tattaglia has lost a son; I have
Lost a son. We are quits. Let
There be a peace...
(he gestures
Expressively,
Submissively, with
His hands)
That is all I want...

BARZINI
Don Corleone is too modest. He had
The judges and politicians in his
Pocket and he refused to share them.
His refusal is not the act of a
Friend. He takes the bread out of
The mouths of our families. Times
Have changed, it's not like the old
Days where everyone can go his own
Way. If Don Corleone had all the
Judges and politicians in New York,
Then he must share them or let
Others use them. Certainly he can
Present a bill for such services,
We're not Communists, after all.
But he has to let us draw water
From the well. It's that simple.

DON CORLEONE
My friends, I didn't refuse out of
Malice. You all know me. When
Have I ever refused an accommodation?
But why, this time? Because I
Think this drug business will
Destroy us in the years to come.
It's not like whiskey or gambling
Or even women which most people
Want and is forbidden them by the
Pezzonovante of the Church and the
Government. But drugs? No. Even
Policemen, who help us in gambling
And other things would refuse to
Help us in drugs. But...I am
Willing to do whatever all of you
Think is necessary.

DON ZALUCHI
I don't believe in drugs. For
Years I paid my people extra so
They wouldn't do that kind of
Business...$200 a week. But it
Didn't matter. Somebody comes to
Them and says, ""I have powders, if
You put up three, four thousand
Dollar investment, we can make
Fifty thousand distributing."" Who
Can resist such a profit?
There's no way to control it, as a
Business...to keep it respectable.
(rapping the table)
I don't want it near schools! I
Don't want it sold to children.
That is an infamita.
(thinking)
In my city I would try to keep the
Traffic in the dark people, the
Colored. They are the best
Customers, the least troublesome,
And they are animals anyway. They
Have no respect for their wives or
Their families or themselves. Let
Them lose their souls with drugs.
But something has to be done, we
Can't have everybody running around
Doing just what they please, like a
Bunch of anarchists.

BARZINI
Then, are we agreed; the traffic in
Drugs will be permitted, but
Controlled; and Don Corleone agrees
To give it protection in the East.

DON CORLEONE nods.

BARZINI
That's the whole matter then, we
Have the peace, and let me pay my
Respects to Don Corleone, whom we
Have all known over the years as a
Man of his word.
(noticing TATTAGLIA
Is uneasy)
Don Philip?

TATTAGLIA
I agree to everything here, I'm
Willing to forget my own misfortune.
But I must hear strict assurance
From Corleone. When time goes by
And his position becomes stronger,
Will he attempt any individual
Vengeance?

They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that
DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something
Else in mind. Slowly the DON rises.

DON CORLEONE
I forego my vengeance for my dead
Son, for the common good. But I
Have selfish reasons. My youngest
Son had to flee, accused of
Sollozzo's murder, and I must now
Make arrangements so that he can
Come home with safety, cleared of
All those false charges. That is
My affair, and I will make those
Arrangements.
(with strength)
But I am a superstitious man...and
So if some unlucky accident should
Befall my youngest son, if some
Police officer should accidentally
Shoot him, or if he should hang
Himself in his cell, or if my son
Is struck by a bolt of lightning,
Then I will blame some of the
People here. That, I could never
Forgive, but...aside from that, let
Me swear by the souls of my
Grandchildren that I will never be
The one to break the peace we have
Made.

EXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)

The DON's black limousine. He sits quietly in the padded
Rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.

It is night. Lights flash by them every so often.

HAGEN
When I meet with Tattaglia's
People; should I insist that all
His drug middle-men be clean?

DON CORLEONE
Mention it, don't insist. Barzini
Is a man who will know that without
Being told.

HAGEN
You mean Tattaglia.

DON CORLEONE
(shaking his head)
Barzini.

HAGEN
(a revelation)
He was the one behind Sollozzo?

DON CORLEONE
Tattaglia is a pimp. He could
Never have outfought Santino. But
I wasn't sure until this day. No,
It was Barzini all along.

The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.

------------------------------------------FADE OUT------

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT

A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and
Downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left
Grotesque and misshapen.

GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea
Jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.

THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on
Either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his
Shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple
Honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable,
And with a pleasing build. Each of the SHEPHERDS carry
Knapsacks.

The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape,
Overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.

EXT DAY: SICILY ROAD

The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make
Their way to a dusty rural road. We HEAR a rinky horn
Sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.
An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL. The
Car pulls in front of them and stops. MICHAEL nods
Respectfully.

MICHAEL
Don Tommassino.

DON TOMMASSINO
Michael, why must you do this. We
Have been lucky so far, all these
Months you've been here we've kept
Your name a secret. It is from
Love for your father that I've
Asked you never to more than an
Hour from the Villa.

MICHAEL
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me;
Nothing will happen.

DON TOMMASSINO
You must understand that your
Father's enemies have friends in
Palermo.

MICHAEL
I know.

DON TOMMASSINO
Where are you going?

MICHAEL
Corleone.

DON TOMMASSINO
There is nothing there. Not anymore.

MICHAEL
I was told that my Grandfather was
Murdered on its main street; and
His murderers came to kill my
Father there when he was twelve
Years old.

DON TOMMASSINO
Long ago. Now there is nothing:
The men killed each other in family
Vendettas...the others escaped to
America.

MICHAEL
Don Tommassino...I should see this
Place.

DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.

DON TOMMASSINO
That is your birthright...but
Michael, use this car.

MICHAEL
No...I would like to walk to
Corleone.

The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.

DON TOMMASSINO
Be careful Michael, don't let them
Know your name.

The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues
On his journey.

EXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE

The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit
Trees, in bloom and bursting with life.

EXT DAY: VILLAGE

They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the
Post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the
Empty streets. Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only
Gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass. And there
Are many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.

The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main
Road ""VOTA COMMUNISTA"".

EXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD

They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally
A donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.

EXT DAY: FIELD

Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession
Of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong,
Marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men
Carrying billowing red banners.

EXT DAY: GROVE

They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees
Is a deep, tall field of wild flowers.

The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out
Loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.

MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.

FABRIZZIO
You tell us about America.

MICHAEL
How do you know I come from America?

FABRIZZIO
We hear. We were told you were a
Pezzonovanta...big shot.

MICHAEL
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.

FABRIZZIO
Hey America! Is she as rich as
They say?

MICHAEL
Yes.

FABRIZZIO
Take me to America! You need a
Good lupara in America?
(pats his shotgun)
You take me, I'll be the best man
You got. ""Oh say, can you
Seeee...By da star early light...""

MICHAEL laughs.

EXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD

The TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military
Convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of
The U.S. drivers, as they move by.

FABRIZZIO
America.
Hey America!
Take me with you!
Hey, take me to America G.I.!

EXT DAY: CORLEONE HILL

They continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until
They hesitate, and look down.

CALO
Corleone.

They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.

EXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET

MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of
The village. They walk behind him, and spread to either
Side about fifteen feet away from him.

They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.
MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.
They go on.

They move up a very narrow old street. MICHAEL looks at the
Doorways that they pass.

MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.

CALO sees MICHAEL looking.

CALO
The names of the dead.

MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street. He looks.

The street is empty, barren. Occasionally, an old woman
Will pass.

MICHAEL turns his head.

The other side of the street: empty and deathly.

A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old
Street, the shepherds a respectful distance away.

-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

EXT DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE

A green ribboned field of a baronial Estate. Further ahead
Is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been
Discovered in the ruins of Pompeii. There is a group of
Young village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,
Dressed in black. They have been gathering the pink sulla,
Purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon
Blossoms. They are singing, off in the distance as they work.

MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this
Fantasy-like scene.

FABRIZZIO
(calling out to them)
Hey, beautiful girls!

MICHAEL
(sternly)
Shhhhh.

He settles down to watch.

The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that
Cling to their bodies. They are still in their teens, but
Developed and womanly.

They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not
Aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.
Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them
Playfully, in the direction of the grove.

The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her
Left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws
Them back at her pursuers laughing.

They come closer and closer. Just short of the grove, she
Poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the
View of the THREE MEN. She stands there on her toes about
To run.

MICHAEL sees her; now face to face. He looks.

Her face. Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair
And a rich mouth.

FABRIZZIO
(murmuring)
Jesus Christ, take my soul. I'm
Dying.

Quickly, she turns, and runs away.

MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her. We hold
On him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS
Laughing. Then he turns to them.

FABRIZZIO
You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?

CALO pats him on the shoulder.

CALO
Easy man.

MICHAEL
What are you talking about?

FABRIZZIO
You can't hide it when you're hit
By the thunderbolt.

EXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE

The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate,
Is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.

MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central
Square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.

The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man;
He greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at
Their table.

FABRIZZIO
You know all the girls in this
Town, eh? We saw some beauties
Coming down the road. One in
Particular got our friend hit with
The Thunderbolt...
(he indicates MICHAEL)

VITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with
New interest.

VITELLI
You had better bring a few bottles
Home with you, my friend; you'll
Need help sleeping tonight.
(he laughs)

FABRIZZIO
This one could seduce the devil. A
Body! and eyes as big and black as
Olives.

VITELLI
(laughing with
Them...pouring more wine)
I know about what you mean!

FABRIZZIO
This was a beauty. Right, Calo?

VITELLI
(laughing)
Beautiful all over, eh?

FABRIZZIO
And hair. Black and curly, like a
Doll. And such a mouth.

VITELLI does not laugh quite so much.

VITELLI
Yes, we have beautiful girls here...
But virtuous.

VITELLI is no longer drinking with them.

MICHAEL
She wore a red dress, and a red
Ribbon in her hair. She looks more
Greek than Italian. Do you know a
Beauty like that?

As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less,
Until he wears a scowl.

VITELLI
No.

Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.

FABRIZZIO
God in Heaven, I think I
Understand...

He goes into the back room after the innkeeper. Then he
Returns.

FABRIZZIO
Let's get out of here; he's boiling
Up his blood to do us mischief.
It's his daughter.

They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.

CALO
Come quickly.

MICHAEL
Innkeeper. More wine!

FABRIZZIO
(whispered)
The old bastard mentioned two sons
He only has to whistle up.

MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.

MICHAEL
Tell him to come to me.

The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in
A moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI
Between them.

MICHAEL
(quietly)
I understand I've offended you by
Talking about your daughter. I
Offer you my apologies, I'm a
Stranger in this country, I don't
Know the customs very well. Let me
Say this, I meant no disrespect to
You or her...

CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.

VITELLI
(shrugs)
Who are you and what do you want
From my daughter?

MICHAEL
I am an American hiding in Sicily
From the police of my country. My
Name is Michael. You can inform
The police and make your fortune
But then your daughter would lose a
Father rather than gain a husband.
In any case, I want to meet your
Daughter. With your permission and
Under the supervision of your
Family. With all decorum. With
All respect. I am an honorable man.

CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then
Asks:

VITELLI
Are you a friend of the friends?

MICHAEL
When the proper time comes, I'll
Tell you everything that a wife's
Father should know.

FABRIZZIO
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.

VITELLI
(formally)
Come Sunday morning: My name is
Vitelli and my house is up there on
The hill, above the village.

MICHAEL
Your daughter's name?

VITELLI
Appolonia.

-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from
Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an
Alfa Romeo. CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday
Best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their
Luparas on their shoulders.

DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off,
Rocky and bouncing on the dirt road.

The Sunday churchbells ring.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE

MICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by
The yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the
MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.
Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate
Sunday clothing. Now he presents the wrapped gift to
APPOLONIA. She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives
Her permission to open it. She unwraps it. Her eyes light
At the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.

She looks at him.

APPOLONIA
Grazia.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE

Now the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's
Cafe.

MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS,
Though they are all dressed differently.

They go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is
Talking and talking.

MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.
She wears the gold necklace around her neck.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME

MICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path,
Seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.

As the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a
Half dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces
Further behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on
Their shoulders.

Further up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone,
And falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm. She modestly regains
Her balance, and they continue walking.

Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH

Church bells in an ancient belfry ring out. Music, old and
Dissonant, plays.

There is a bridal procession in the street of the village;
The same in feeling and texture as it might have been five
Hundred years ago.

Donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant
Flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white
Confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by
Countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.

We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with
All the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in
Sicily.

APPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome
Despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE

CALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the
Great wedding celebration. It is held in the Village
Square; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the
Tops of buildings, carrying luparas.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

INT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA

MICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight
Fills the room.

He turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA. A
Little frightened; but lovely.

He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her,
Looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.

Slowly and tenderly he kisses her. Her tiny hands come up
To his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.

She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.

--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

INT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA

Morning. MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the
Room.

APPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially
Covered by the bedsheets.

He looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.

EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

HIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA

We HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving
Erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost
Hitting th inner court wall.

APPOLONIA is laughing, driving. MICHAEL pretends to be
Frightened, as he teaches her to drive.

Outside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking
Guard duty.

The car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.

MICHAEL
It's safer to teach you English.

APPOLONIA
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday...See, I learned
It. Now teach me to drive!

DON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard. He seems tired and
Concerned.

MICHAEL
Ciao, Don Tommassino.

APPOLONIA kisses him.

MICHAEL
Things went badly in Palermo?

DON TOMMASSINO
The younger men have no respect.
Things are changing; I don't know
What will happen. Michael, because
Of the wedding, people now know
Your name.

MICHAEL
Is that why there are more men on
The walls?

DON TOMMASSINO
Even so, I don't think it is safe
Here anymore. I've made plans to
Move you to a villa near Siracuse.
You must go right away.

MICHAEL
What is it?

DON TOMMASSINO
Bad news from America. Your
Brother, Santino. He has been
Killed.

For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the
Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.

EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

Morning. MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.

Below, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs,
Combing his thick hair.

MICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.

MICHAEL
Get the car. I'll be leaving in
Ten minutes. Where's Calo?

FABRIZZIO
Calo is having a cup of coffee in
The kitchen. Is your wife coming
With you?

MICHAEL
No, she's going home to her family.
She'll join me in a few weeks...

INT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN

MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the
Kitchen. CALO is just finishing a bite. He rises when he
Sees MICHAEL.

CALO
Should I get your bag?

MICHAEL
No, I'll get it. Where's Appolonia?

CALO
(smiling)
She is sitting in the driver's seat
Of the car, dying to step on the
Gas. She'll be a real American
Woman before she gets to America.

MICHAEL smiles.

MICHAEL
Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in
The car.

He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.

He looks out from the opening in the doorway.

EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's
Seat, playing with the wheel like a child.

CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear
Seat.

Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.

Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO
Disappear through the gate.

MICHAEL
(muttering to himself)
Where the hell is he going?

MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.

MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer
Courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.

APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay
Where he is.

APPOLONIA
(calling out)
I'll drive to you.

He smiles affectionately.

CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling
By his side. There is no sight of FABRIZZIO. Suddenly the
Smile fades from MICHAEL's face. He steps forward and holds
Out his hand.

MICHAEL
No. No!

His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION,
As she switched on the ignition.

Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off;
And there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.

MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.

INT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM

MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room. We hear
Whispering around him, but can't make any of it out. A soft
Cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open. DON
TOMMASSINO is there, close to him. He looks at them and
From their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.

MICHAEL
Fabrizzio. Let your shepherds know
That the one who gives me Fabrizzio
Will own the finest pastures in
Sicily.

--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)

Easter.

A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime. Hordes
Of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children
And Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets,
Searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden
Easter eggs.

The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing
Baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around
His garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.

Suddenly, he stops and looks.

MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.

Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in
MICHAEL's direction.

MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son
And embraces him.

DON CORLEONE
Be my son...

INT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY

DON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the
Building.

DON CORLEONE
This old building has seen its day.
No way to do business...too small,
Too old.

They enter the DON's glass-panelled office.

DON CORLEONE
Have you thought about a wife? A
Family?

MICHAEL
(pained)
No.

DON CORLEONE
I understand, Michael. But you
Must make a family, you know.

MICHAEL
I want children, I want a family.
But I don't know when.

DON CORLEONE
Accept what's happened, Michael.

MICHAEL
I could accept everything that's
Happened; I could accept it, but
That I never had a choice. From
The time I was born, you had laid
This all out for me.

DON CORLEONE
No, I wanted other things for you.

MICHAEL
You wanted me to be your son.

DON CORLEONE
Yes, but sons who would be
Professors, scientists,
Musicians...and grandchildren who
Could be, who knows, a Governor, a
President even, nothing's impossible
Here in America.

MICHAEL
Then why have I become a man like
You?

DON CORLEONE
You are like me, we refuse to be
Fools, to be puppets dancing on a
String pulled by other men. I
Hoped the time for guns and killing
And massacres was over. That was
My misfortune. That was your
Misfortune. I was hunted on the
Streets of Corleone when I was
Twelve years old because of who my
Father was. I had no choice.

MICHAEL
A man has to choose what he will be.
I believe that.

DON CORLEONE
What else do you believe in?

MICHAEL doesn't answer.

DON CORLEONE
Believe in a family. Can you
Believe in your country? Those
Pezzonovante of the State who
Decide what we shall do with our
Lives? Who declare wars they wish
Us to fight in to protect what they
Own. Do you put your fate in the
Hands of men whose only talent is
That they tricked a bloc of people
To vote for them? Michael, in five
Years the Corleone family can be
Completely legitimate. Very
Difficult things have to happen to
Make that possible. I can't do
Them anymore, but you can, if you
Choose to.

MICHAEL listens.

DON CORLEONE
Believe in a family; believe in a
Code of Honor, older and higher,
Believe in Roots that go back
Thousands of years into your Race.
Make a family, Michael, and protect
It. These are our affairs, sono cosa
Nostra, Governments only protect
Men who have their own individual
Power. Be one of those men...you
Have the choice.

--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

EXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS (1955)

A MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.

FREDO (O.S.)
There's a new one. Construction
Going on everywhere.

MORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the
Bill marquees read: ""MARTIN AND LEWIS"", ""PATTI PAGE"", etc.

FREDO (O.S.)
That's one of the family's new ones.
Not bad, eh?

EXT DAY: FLAMINGO (1955)

The car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel.

Inside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man,
NERI, quiet and sinister.

MICHAEL
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the
Airport?

FREDO
He had business at the hotel, but
He'll drop in for dinner.

From the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a
Discourtesy.

INT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955)

A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of
MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI. Great fuss is made. They are
Being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.

FREDO
You look wonderful, kid; really
Wonderful. That doctor did some
Job on your face.

MICHAEL
You look good, too.

They enter the suite.

FREDO
Nice, eh?

FREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the
Bellboys, waiters and maids.

FREDO
(hurrying into the bedroom)
Kid, take a look-see.

MICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom.

There is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform,
Mirrors to each side. FREDO points upward.

A VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.

FREDO
Ever seen anything like that before?

MICHAEL
(dryly)
No.

INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM (1955)

MICHAEL is alone in the bedroom. He is just finishing
Dressing; he puts on his jacket. From the window, with the
Lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night. MICHAEL
Passes into the other room.

He stops, looks. He is disturbed.

INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

A magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite;
A lavish table setting for eight. Standing by the table are
HAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier,
Beautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.
NERI stands quietly by the door.

FREDO
Mike! The party starting!

MICHAEL
Come here a minute, Fredo.

FREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.

MICHAEL
Who are those girls?

FREDO
(jokingly)
That's for you to find out.

MICHAEL
Give them some money and send them
Home.

FREDO
Mike!

MICHAEL
Get rid of them...

INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

They are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite.
MICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY.

MICHAEL
Johnny, the Corleone family is
Thinking of selling out all our
Interests in the Olive Oil business
And settling here. Moe Greene will
Sell us his interest so it can be
Wholly owned by friends of the
Family.

FREDDIE seems anxious.

FREDO
Mike, you sure about Moe selling.
He never mentioned it to me and he
Loves the business.

MICHAEL
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.

MICHAEL
Johnny, the Don wants you to help
Us get started. We figure
Entertainment will be the big
Factor in drawing gamblers. We
Hope you'll sign a contract to
Appear five times a year for maybe
A week long engagement.
We hope your friends in the movies
Will do the same. We count on you
To convince them.

JOHNNY
Sure, I'll do anything for my
Godfather. You know that, Mike.

There is knock on the door. NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL,
Who nods. NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters,
Followed by TWO BODYGUARDS. He is a handsome hood, dressed
In the Hollywood style. His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast
Style.

MOE
Mike, good to see you. Got
Everything you want?

MICHAEL
Thanks.

MOE
The chef cooked for you special;
The dancers will kick your tongue
Out and you credit is good!
(to his BODYGUARDS)
Draw chips for all these people so
They can play on the house.

MICHAEL
Is my credit good enough to buy you
Out?

MOE laughs.

MOE
Buy me out?...

MICHAEL
The hotel, the casino. The Corleone
Family wants to buy you out.

GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense. NERI eyes
The BODYGUARDS.

MOE
(furious)
The Corleone family wants to buy me
Out. I buy you out. You don't buy
Me out.

MICHAEL
Your casino loses money. Maybe we
Can do better.

MOE
You think I scam?

MICHAEL
(the worst insult)
You're unlucky.

MOE
You goddamn dagos. I do you a
Favor and take Freddie in when
You're having a bad time, and then
You try to push me out.

MICHAEL
You took Freddie in because the
Corleone family bankrolled your
Casino. You and the Corleone
Family are evened out. This is for
Business; name your price.

MOE
The Corleone family don't have that
Kind of muscle anymore. The
Godfather is sick. You're getting
Chased out of New York by Barzini
And the other families, and you
Think you can find easier pickings
Here. I've talked to Barzini; I
Can make a deal with him and keep
My hotel!

MICHAEL
(quietly, deadly)
Is that why you thought you could
Slap Freddie around in public?

FREDO
(his face turns red)
Ah Mike, that was nothing. Moe
Didn't mean anything. He flies off
The handle sometimes; but me and
Him are good friends. Right, Moe?

MOE
Yeah sure. Sometimes I gotta kick
Asses to make this place run right.
Freddie and I had a little argument
And I had to straighten him out.

MICHAEL
You straightened my brother out?

MOE
Hell, he was banging cocktail
Waitresses two at a time. Players
Couldn't get a drink.

MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:

MICHAEL
I have to go back to New York
Tomorrow. Think of your price.

MOE
You son of a bitch, you think you
Can brush me off like that? I made
My bones when you were going out
With cheerleaders.

FREDO
(frightened)
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you
Can talk to the Don and advise him.

MICHAEL
The Don has semi-retired. I'm
Running the Family business now.
So anything you have to say, say it
To me.

Nobody answers. MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door.
MOE exits angrily.

MICHAEL
Freddie, you're my older brother.
I love you. But don't ever take
Sides with anybody against the
Family again.

EXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955)

KAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark
AIRPORT. ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.

She has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who
Plays with a cardboard bird on a string.

Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have
Learned to tell are bodyguards.

MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO
PORTERS carrying luggage.

NERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.

MICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.

LAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and
MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son. Automatically,
The luggage is put in. NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver;
And LAMPONE joins the other men. HAGEN gets into one of the
Other cars.

And the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other
Sedans.

INT DAY: LIMO (1955)

The little BOY looks out the window as they drive.

MICHAEL
I have to see my father and his
People when we get back to the Mall.

KAY
Oh Michael.

MICHAEL
We'll go to the show tomorrow
Night--we can change the tickets.

KAY
Don't you want dinner first?

MICHAEL
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.

KAY
Wake me up when you come to bed?

The little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding
Limousine window.

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

The limousine arrives at the Mall. We are inside.

KAY
Your sister wants to ask you
Something.

MICHAEL
Let HER ask.

NERI opens the door. KAY wants to talk just a little more.

KAY
She's afraid to. Michael...

MICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment
Longer.

KAY
Why are you so cold to her and
Carlo? They live with us on the
Mall now, but you never get close
To them.

MICHAEL
I'm busy.

KAY
Connie and Carlo want you to be
Godfather to their little boy.

NERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.

He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.

KAY
Will you?

MICHAEL
Let me think about it, O.K.?

She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY
And the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955)

VIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size. He
Wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt. He sits in a
Chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.

TESSIO (O.S.)
Barzini's people chisel my territory
And we do nothing about it. Pretty
Soon there won't be one place in
Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

MICHAEL (O.S.)
Just be patient.

TESSIO
I'm not asking you for help, Mike.
Just take off the handcuffs.

MICHAEL (O.S.)
Be patient.

CLEMENZA (O.S.)
We gotta fight sometime. Let us at
Least recruit our regimes to full
Strength.

MICHAEL (O.S.)
No, I don't want to give Barzini an
Excuse to start fighting.

TESSIO (O.S.)
Mike, you're wrong.

CLEMENZA (O.S.)
Don Corleone...Don Corleone.

The OLD MAN looks up. CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.
Beside him is an anxious TESSIO. NERI stands by the door;
HAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.

CLEMENZA
You said there would come a day
When Tessio and me could form our
Own Families. Only with your
Benediction, of course. I ask
Permission...

DON CORLEONE
My son is head of the Family now.
If you have his permission, you
Have my good will.

MICHAEL
In six months you can break off
From the Corleone Family and go on
Your own. Carlo, I'm counting on
You to make the move to Nevada;
You'll be my right-hand man out
There. Tom Hagen is no longer the
Consigliere.

Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.
He remains inexpressive.

MICHAEL
He's going to be our lawyer in
Vegas. Nobody goes to him with any
Other business as of now, this
Minute. No reflection on Tom;
That's the way I want it. Besides,
If I ever need any advice, who's a
Better Consigliere than my father.

CLEMENZA
Then in a six month time we're on
Our own; is that it?

MICHAEL
Maybe less...

TESSIO
Let us fill up our Regimes.

MICHAEL
No. I want things very calm for
Another six months.

TESSIO
Forgive me, Godfather, let our
Years of friendship be my excuse.
How can you hope for success there
Without your strength here to back
You up? The two go hand in hand.
And with you gone from here the
Barzini and the Tattaglias will be
Too strong for us.

CLEMENZA
And I don't like Barzini. I say
The Corleone Family has to move
From strength, not weakness. We
Should build our Regimes and take
Back our lost territories in Staten
Island, at least.

DON CORLEONE
Do you have faith in my judgement?

CLEMENZA
Yes, Godfather...

DON CORLEONE
Then do what Michael says...

MICHAEL
All I can say is that things are
Being resolved that are more
Effective than a thousand buttonmen
On the streets. Understood?

There are uneasy looks all around.

CARLO
Understood. I just wish I was
Doing more to help out.

MICHAEL
I'll come to you when I need you.

He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN. They all nod,
Reluctantly.

MICHAEL
All right, then it's resolved.

NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.

CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,
Then CARLO. NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the
Corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.

Then NERI closes the door.

MICHAEL relaxes.

HAGEN
Mike, why are you cutting me out of
The action?

MICHAEL
Tom, we're going to be legitimate
All the way, and you're the legal
Man. What could be more important
Than that.

HAGEN
I'm not talking about that. I'm
Talking about Rocco Lampone building
A secret regime. Why does Neri
Report directly to you, rather than
Through me or a caporegime?

DON CORLEONE
I told you that it wouldn't escape
His eye.

MICHAEL
How did you find out?

HAGEN
Bookkeepers know everything.
Rocco's men are all a little too
Good for the jobs they're supposed
To be doing. They get a little
More money than the job's worth.
(pause)
Lampone's a good man; he's operating
Perfectly.

MICHAEL
Not so perfectly if you noticed.

HAGEN
Mike, why am I out?

MICHAEL
You're not a wartime Consigliere.
Things may get tough with the move
We're trying.

HAGEN
OK, but then I agree with Tessio.
You're going about it all wrong;
You're making the move out of
Weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and
If he tears you apart, the other
Families won't come running to help
The Corleones...

DON CORLEONE
Tom, I never thought you were a bad
Consigliere, I thought Santino a
Bad Don, rest in peace. He had a
Good heart but he wasn't the right
Man to head the family when I had
My misfortune. Michael has all my
Confidence, as you do. For reasons
Which you can't know, you must have
No part in what will happen.

HAGEN
Maybe I can help.

MICHAEL
(coldly)
You're out, Tom.

TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence. TOM
Leaves.

MICHAEL looks at NERI.

MICHAEL
I'm going to talk to my father.

NERI nods, and then leaves. The DON opens the doors,
Breathes in the air, and steps outside.

EXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)

DON CORLEONE
I see you have your Luca Brasi.

MICHAEL
I'll need him.

DON CORLEONE
There are men in this world who
Demand to be killed. They argue in
Gambling games; they jump out of
Their cars in a rage if someone so
Much as scratches their fender.
These people wander through the
Streets calling out ""Kill me, kill
Me."" Luca Brasi was like that.
And since he wasn't scared of
Death, and in fact, looked for
It...I made him my weapon. Because
I was the only person in the world
That he truly hoped would not kill
Him. I think you have done the
Same with this man.

They walk through the DON's vegetable garden. Tomatoes,
Peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.
MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him. Then
Stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.

DON CORLEONE
Barzini will move against you first.

MICHAEL
How?

DON CORLEONE
He will get in touch with you
Through someone you absolutely
Trust. That person will arrange a
Meeting, guarantee your safety...

He rises, and looks at Michael...

DON CORLEONE
...and at that meeting you will be
Assassinated.

The DON walks on further.

DON CORLEONE
Your wife and children...you're
Happy with them?

MICHAEL
Yes.

DON CORLEONE
Good.

MICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:

MICHAEL
I've always respected you...

A long silence. The DON smiles at MICHAEL.

DON CORLEONE
And I...you.

EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

KAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left
Them off.

KAY
How is your husband feeling?

MAMA
He's not the same since they shot
Him. He lets Michael do all the
Work. He just plays the fool with
His garden, his peppers, his
Tomatoes, as if he was some peasant
Still. But men are like that...

She stops toward the Church.

MAMA
You come in, too.

KAY shakes her head.

MAMA
The Priest ain't gonna bite you
Cause you're not Catholic.
(whispered)
He's in the back drinkin' his wine.

KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.
They enter.

INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from
The holy water.

MAMA
You can.

Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and
Blesses herself. Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in
Awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally
The Altar.

MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles. There is a
Large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting
Candles. MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives
Her some.

MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the
Taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great
Dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights
Twenty candles.

She finishes, and bows her head.

EXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME

Very few people in the streets. TOTAL SILENCE. But black
Flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.
An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.
Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King.

Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration. We show
These in detail; and the flowered messages: ""A Benefactor to
Mankind"", ""He Knew and Pitied""...""Our Don Our Leader""...""The
Sacred Heart""...

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

Silence.

The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill
All the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.

Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the
Wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is
Somber and respectful.

MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform
Which holds the ornate coffin. We cannot see the remains of
Don Corleone.

BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved
Family. One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely
With grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.

The VIEW ALTERS,

And we see that the line is endless. JOHNNY FONTANE, tears
Openly falling, takes his turn.

Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last
Look at the great man.

CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE. LAMPONE
Immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York
Families to pay their respects.

First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI. Then PHILIP
TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.

Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.

MICHAEL watches the scene.

BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined
By his men.

As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on
Him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear
From the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that
He is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don
Corleone.

MICHAEL watches silently.

BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes. First
CLEMENZA. Then TESSIO.

CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes. He
Embraces and comforts her.

Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching
All who come close to him.

EXT DAY: MALL (LATER)

Later on the Mall; some people have left, although there are
Still hundreds of mourners.

A young GIRL approaches TESSIO. She's about 18.

GIRL
Do you remember me?

TESSIO
No...

GIRL
We danced together at Connie's
Wedding.

TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown',
And they move though the crowd, looking for Michael. He
Finds him.

TESSIO
Mike, could I have a minute?

MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place. NERI is close
By.

TESSIO
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
Says we can straighten any of our
Problems out.

MICHAEL
He talked to you?

TESSIO
(nods)
I can arrange security.

MICHAEL looks at him.

EXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955)

The Cemetery. Late day.

The hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the
Stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in
Queens Village.

Hundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take
Pictures, etc.

MICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.

MICHAEL
(softly)
Christ, Tom; I needed more time
With him. I really needed him.

HAGEN
Did he give you his politicians?

MICHAEL
Not all...I needed another four
Months and I would have had them
All.
(he looks at TOM)
I guess you've figured it all out?

HAGEN
How will they come at you?

MICHAEL
I know now.
(a passion wells up
Inside of MICHAEL)
I'll make them call me Don.

HAGEN
Have you agreed on a meeting?

MICHAEL
(nods)
A week from tonight. In Brooklyn
On Tessio's ground, where I'll be
Safe.

HAGEN looks at him; understands.

MICHAEL
But after the Baptism. I've
Decided to stand as godfather to
Connie's baby.

They look up.

The coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which
Stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel,
With the bold inscription: CORLEONE.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

FADE IN:

INT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)

ALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he
Pulls a small trunk from under his bed. He opens it, and we
See in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's
Uniform. He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.
Then the badge, and the identification card; with his
Picture on it. Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he
Begins to dress.

INT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)

MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in
Their room. MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is
Beginning to take on a matronly look.

INT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)

In a Long Island motel.

ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it,
Checks it, and puts it back together.

EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)

PETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln. He hesitates,
Takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then
Gets in, drives off.

EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

The Church.

Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the
Church. They laugh and talk. A MONSIGNOR is officiating.
Not all of the participants have arrived yet.

CONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO. She holds the
Infant; showing him off to interested people.

EXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955)

NERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN
Building. He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a
Policeman. He carries a huge flashlight.

EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955)

LAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort
Motel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising
""ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY"".

INT DAY: CHURCH

The Church.

CONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and
MICHAEL stand side by side around the urn.

PRIEST
(to MICHAEL)
Do you pledge to guide and protect
This child if he is left fatherless?
Do you promise to shield him
Against the wickedness of the world?

MICHAEL
Yes, I promise.

EXT DAY: FIFTH AVE.

NERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area. He
Continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center. On
His side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly
Across from the main entrance of the building. Slowly he
Approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his
Nightstick.

The DRIVER looks up in surprise.

NERI points to the ""No Parking"" sign.

The DRIVER turns his head away.

NERI
OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or
You wanna move?

DRIVER
(obviously a hood)
You better check with your precinct.

NERI
Move it!

The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately,
And hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's
Jacket.

NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street. Then
He crooks a finger at the DRIVER.

NERI
Let me see you license and
Registration.

EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY

LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.
It parks. A young, pretty GIRL gets out. Quickly, he
Returns into the room.

INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel. He
Rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.

INT DAY: CHURCH

The Church. Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently
Applies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.

PRIEST
Ephetha...be opened...So you may
Perceive the fragrance of God's
Sweetness.

EXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955)

The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center
Is arguing with NERI.

Now the DRIVER looks up.

WHAT HE SEES:

TWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving
Glass doors.

NERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass
Doors. The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of
BARZINI within them.

INT DAY: CHURCH

In the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL. The PRIEST hands him
The infant.

PRIEST
Do you renounce Satan.

MICHAEL
I do renounce him.

PRIEST
And all his works?

MICHAEL
I do renounce them.

INT DAY: MOTEL MURDER (1955)

LAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down
The iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.
PHILIP TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a
Semi-nude young GIRL leans up.

They are riddled with gunfire.

INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

CLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with
His package.

INT DAY: CHURCH

The PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant
MICHAEL holds.

PRIEST
Do you wish to be baptized?

MICHAEL
I do wish to be baptized.

INT DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)

CLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.

He walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate
Elevator waiting shaft.

The lights indicate the elevator has arrived.

The doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with
The dapper MOE GREENE.

CLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.

The PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.

PRIEST
I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.

Flash bulbs go off. Everyone is smiles, and crowds around
MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO.

--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

The christening party outside the Church.

Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to
Receive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.

Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.

As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up. LAMPONE gets out
And works his way to MICHAEL. He whispers in his ear. This
Is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.

CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.

CONNIE
Kiss your Godfather.

The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an
Excuse to back away.

MICHAEL
Carlo...we've had a change in the
Plans. Mama, Connie, Kay and the
Kids will have to take the trip out
To Vegas without us.

CONNIE
Oh Mike, it's our first vacation
Together.

CARLO
(anxious to please)
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...

MICHAEL
Go back to your house and wait for
Me...

He kisses KAY.

MICHAEL
(to KAY)
I'll just be a couple of days...

People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to
Drive off.

INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN

TESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.

HAGEN enters.

HAGEN
You'd better make your call to
Barzini; Michael's ready.

TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.

TESSIO
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

He hangs up and smiles.

TESSIO
I hope Mike can get us a good deal
Tonight.

HAGEN
(gravely)
I'm sure he will.

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

The TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car. On their
Way they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.

BUTTON MAN
The boss says he'll come in a
Separate car. He says for you two
To go on ahead.

TESSIO
(frowning)
Hell, he can't do that. It screws
Up all my arrangements.

THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.

HAGEN
(gently)
I can't go with you either, Tessio.

He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he
Panics, and then he accepts it.

TESSIO
(after the pause)
Tell Mike it was business...I
Always liked him.

HAGEN
He understands that.

TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.

TESSIO
(softly)
Tom, can you get me off the hook?
For old times' sake?

HAGEN
I can't.

HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group. Then about
Twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.

TESSIO is led into a waiting car.

HAGEN looks away, and walks off.

INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

CARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather
Nervously. He moves to the window and looks out.

WHAT HE SEES:

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

MICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,
LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.

They move toward us.

Excitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.

He wears a broad smile.

CARLO
Godfather!

MICHAEL
You have to answer for Santino.

The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish
Attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and
Backs into the living room.

INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

The door opens, and the grim party enters.

MICHAEL
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini
People. That little farce you
Played out with my sister. Did
Barzini kid you that would fool a
Corleone?

CARLO
(dignity)
I swear I'm innocent. I swear on
The head of my children, I'm
Innocent. Mike, don't do this to
Me, please Mike, don't do this to me!

MICHAEL
(quietly)
Barzini is dead. So is Philip
Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo
And Moe Greene...I want to square
All the family accounts tonight.
So don't tell me you're innocent;
Admit what you did.

CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.

MICHAEL
(almost kindly)
Don't be frightened. Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow? Do you
Think I'd make your children
Fatherless? After all, I'm
Godfather to your son. No, your
Punishment is that you're out of
The family business. I'm putting
You on a plane to Vegas--and I want
You to stay there. I'll send
Connie an allowance, that's all.
But don't keep saying you're
Innocent; it insults my intelligence
And makes me angry. Who approached
You, Tattaglia or Barzini?

CARLO
(sees his way out)
Barzini.

MICHAEL
(softly)
Good, good. Leave now; there's a
Car waiting to take you to the
Airport.

CARLO moves to the door; opens it. There is a car waiting;
With a group of MEN around it.

He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.

MICHAEL
I'll call your wife and tell her
What flight you're on.

EXT DAY: MALL

CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his
Things in the trunk.

ONE opens the front door for him.

SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.

CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back
To see the other man.

It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.

The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA
Suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck. He chokes
And leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.

The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.

His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.

Then the body goes slack.

CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car
Drives off.

EXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955)

MICHAEL and his party. They watch.

Then he turns and walks off, and they follow.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

FADE IN:

INT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955)

MICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving.

They do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights
Flash by.

NERI turns back.

NERI
You know I would never question
Anything you say.

MICHAEL
(smiles)
Speak your mind.

NERI
I'll do this for you; you know I
Should.

MICHAEL
No. This I have to do.

EXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)

MICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an
Italian Pizzeria. NERI opens the door.

MICHAEL
Sit in the car.

INT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)

He walks alone into the restaurant. A MAN is tossing pizza
Dough in the air.

MICHAEL
Where's the boss?

MAN
In the back. Hey Frank, someone
Wants you.

A MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.

MAN
What is it?

He stops, frozen in fear. It is FABRIZZIO.

VIEW ON MICHAEL. Gunfire from under his coat. FABRIZZIO is
Cut down. MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

Several moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that
These are the final days; the families are moving out; signs
Indicating that the property is for sale are evident.

A black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped,
The rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out,
Restrained by MAMA. She manages to break free and runs
Across the Mall into Michael's house.

INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

Inside the Corleone house. Big boxes have been packed;
Furniture prepared for shipping.

CONNIE
Michael!

She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon
MICHAEL and KAY.

KAY
(comforting)
Connie...

But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL. NERI
Is watchful.

CONNIE
You lousy bastard; you killed my
Husband...

KAY
Connie...

CONNIE
You waited until our father died
And nobody could stop you and you
Killed him, you killed him! You
Blamed him about Sonny, you always
Did, everybody did. But you never
Thought about me, never gave a damn
About me.
(crying)
What am I going to do now, what am
I going to do.

TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders
From him. But he stands there, waiting for his sister to
Finish.

KAY
Connie, how could you say such
Things?

CONNIE
Why do you think he kept Carlo on
The Mall? All the time he knew he
Was going to kill my husband. But
He didn't dare while my father was
Alive. And then he stood Godfather
To our child. That coldhearted
Bastard.
(to KAY)
And do you know how many men he had
Killed with Carlo? Just read the
Papers. That's your husband.

She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria
She has no saliva.

MICHAEL
Get her home and get a doctor.

The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her,
Gently but firmly.

KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from
MICHAEL. He feels her look.

MICHAEL
She's hysterical.

But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.

KAY
Michael, it's not true. Please
Tell me.

MICHAEL
Don't ask me.

KAY
Tell me!

MICHAEL
All right, this one time I'll let
You ask about my affairs, one last
Time.

KAY
Is it true?

She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so
Directly that we know he will tell the truth.

MICHAEL
(after a very long pause)
No.

KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs
Him. Then she kisses him.

KAY
(through her tears)
We both need a drink.

INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)

She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the
Drinks. From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the
Drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the
House with their BODYGUARDS.

She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive
Them. He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one
Foot slightly behind the other. One hand on his hip, like a
Roman Emperor. The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.

CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.

CLEMENZA
Don Corleone...

The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her
Husband has become.

INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

KAY wears a shawl over her hand. She drops many coins in
The coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in
A pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles.

A Memoir of a Childhood

By Frank McCourt

This book is dedicated to my brothers, Malachy, Michael, Alphonsus. I learn from you, I admire you and I love you.

Acknowledgments

This is a small hymn to an exaltation of women.
R'lene Dahlberg fanned the embers.
Lisa Schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me.
Mary Breasted Smyth, elegant novelist herself, read the first third
and passed it on to Molly Friedrich, who became my agent and thought that Nan Graham, Editor-in-Chief at Scribner, would be just the right person to put the book on the road.
And Molly was right.
My daughter, Maggie, has shown me how life can be a grand adventure, while exquisite moments with my granddaughter, Chiara, have helped me recall a small child's wonder.
My wife, Ellen, listened while I read and cheered me to the final
page.
I am blessed among men.


I
My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born. Instead, they returned to Ireland when I was four, my brother, Malachy, three, the twins, Oliver and Eugene, barely one, and my sister, Margaret, dead and gone.
When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.
People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years.
Above all-we were wet.
Out in the Atlantic Ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick. The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve.
It created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges. It provoked cures galore; to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper; for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles, wrapped it in a rag, and slapped it, sizzling, on the chest.
From October to April the walls of Limerick glistened with the damp. Clothes never dried: tweed and woolen coats housed living things, sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations. In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week's wages.
The rain drove us into the church-our refuge, our strength, our only dry place. At Mass, Benediction, novenas, we huddled in great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone, while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense, flowers and candles.
Limerick gained a reputation for piety, but we knew it was only the
rain.
My father, Malachy McCourt, was born on a farm in Toome, County
Antrim. Like his father before, he grew up wild, in trouble with the English, or the Irish, or both. He fought with the Old IRA and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head.
When I was a child I would look at my father, the thinning hair, the collapsing teeth, and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that. When I was thirteen my father's mother told me a secret: as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head. It was an accident, he was never the same after, and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar.
Because of the price on the head he had been dropped on, he had to be spirited out of Ireland via cargo ship from Galway. In New York, with Prohibition in full swing, he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins. Then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced.
After wandering and drinking in America and England he yearned for peace in his declining years. He returned to Belfast, which erupted all around him. He said, A pox on all their houses, and chatted with the ladies of Andersontown. They tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea. He no longer smoked or touched alcohol, so what was the use? It was time to go and he died in the Royal Victoria Hospital.
My mother, the former Angela Sheehan, grew up in a Limerick slum with her mother, two brothers, Thomas and Patrick, and a sister, Agnes. She never saw her father, who had run off to Australia weeks before her birth.
After a night of drinking porter in the pubs of Limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song, Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder?
Nobody spoke so he said it all the louder It's a dirty Irish trick and I can lick the Mick Who threw the overalls in Murphy's chowder.
He's in great form altogether and he thinks he'll play a while with little Patrick, one year old. Lovely little fella. Loves his daddy. Laughs when Daddy throws him up in the air. Upsy daisy, little Paddy, upsy daisy, up in the air in the dark, so dark, oh, Jasus, you miss the child on the way down and poor little Patrick lands on his head, gurgles
a bit, whimpers, goes quiet. Grandma heaves herself from the bed, heavy with the child in her belly, my mother. She's barely able to lift little Patrick from the floor. She moans a long moan over the child and turns on Grandpa. Get out of it. Out. If you stay here a minute longer I'll take the hatchet to you, you drunken lunatic. By Jesus, I'll swing at the end of a rope for you. Get out.
Grandpa stands his ground like a man. I have a right, he says, to stay in me own house.
She runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside. He stumbles from the house, up the lane, and doesn't stop till he reaches Melbourne in Australia.
Little Pat, my uncle, was never the same after. He grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way, his body the other. He never learned to read or write but God blessed him in another way. When he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. No one knew why he was called Ab Sheehan, The Abbot, but all Limerick loved him.
My mother's troubles began the night she was born. There is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains, praying to St. Gerard Majella, patron saint of expectant mothers. There is Nurse O'Halloran, the midwife, all dressed up in her finery. It's New Year's Eve and Mrs. O'Halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations. She tells my grandmother: Will you push, will you, push. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph, if you don't hurry with this child it won't be born till the New Year and what good is that to me with me new dress? Never mind St. Gerard Majella. What can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint? St. Gerard Majella my arse.
My grandmother switches her prayers to St. Ann, patron saint of difficult labor. But the child won't come. Nurse O'Halloran tells my grandmother, Pray to St. Jude, patron saint of desperate cases.
St. Jude, patron of desperate cases, help me. I'm desperate. She grunts and pushes and the infant's head appears, only the head, my mother, and it's the stroke of midnight, the New Year. Limerick City erupts with whistles, horns, sirens, brass bands, people calling and singing, Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and church bells all over ring out the Angelus and Nurse O'Halloran weeps for the waste of a dress, that child still in there and me in me finery. Will you come out, child, will you? Grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world, a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes.
Ah, Lord above, says Nurse O'Halloran, this child is a time straddler, born with her head in the New Year and her arse in the Old or was it her head in the Old Year and her arse in the New. You'll have to write to the Pope, missus, to find out what year this child was born in and I'll save this dress for next year.
And the child was named Angela for the Angelus which rang the midnight hour, the New Year, the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway.
Love her as in childhood
Though feeble, old and grey.
For you'll never miss a mother's love
Till she's buried beneath the clay.
At the St. Vincent de Paul School, Angela learned to read, write, and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done. She tried her hand at being a charwoman, a skivvy, a maid with a little white hat opening doors, but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said, You don't have the knack of it. You're pure useless. Why don't you go to America where there's room for all sorts of uselessness? I'll give you the fare.
She arrived in New York just in time for the first Thanksgiving Day of the Great Depression. She met Malachy at a party given by Dan MacAdorey and his wife, Minnie, on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn. Malachy liked Angela and she liked him. He had a hangdog look, which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck. He and his friend John McErlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy, that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans. Neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along Myrtle Avenue they pulled it over. The police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing, not pork and beans, but cases of buttons.
With Angela drawn to the hangdog look and Malachy lonely after three months in jail, there was bound to be a knee-trembler.
A knee-trembler is the act itself done up against a wall, man and woman up on their toes, straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that's in it.
That knee-trembler put Angela in an interesting condition and, of course, there was talk. Angela had cousins, the MacNamara sisters, Delia and Philomena, married, respectively, to Jimmy Fortune of County Mayo, and Tommy Flynn, of Brooklyn itself.
Delia and Philomena were large women, great-breasted and fierce. When they sailed along the sidewalks of Brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside, respect was shown. The sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They knew that Angela, unmarried, had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps.
Steps they took. With Jimmy and Tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where Malachy could be found on Friday, payday when he had a job. The man in the speak, Joey Cacciamani, did not want to admit the sisters but Philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he'd better open up for they were there on God's business. Joey said, Awright, awright, you Irish. Jeezoz! Trouble, trouble.
Malachy, at the far end of the bar, turned pale, gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile, offered them a drink. They resisted the smile and spurned the offer. Delia said, We don't know what class of a tribe you come from in the North of Ireland.
Philomena said, There is a suspicion you might have Presbyterians in your family, which would explain what you did to our cousin.
Jimmy said, Ah, now, ah, now. 'Tisn't his fault if there's Presbyterians in his family.
Delia said, You shuddup.
Tommy had to join in. What you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the Irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself.
Och, I am, said Malachy. I am.
Nobody asked you to talk, said Philomena. You done enough damage with your blather, so shut your yap.
And while your yap is shut, said Delia, we're here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin, Angela Sheehan.
Malachy said, Och, indeed, indeed. The right thing is the right thing and I'd be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little
talk.
Take the drink, said Tommy, and shove it up your ass.
Philomena said, Our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than
you are at her. We have morals in Limerick, you know, morals. We're not like jackrabbits from Antrim, a place crawling with Presbyterians.
Jimmy said, He don't look like a Presbyterian.
You shuddup, said Delia.
Another thing we noticed, said Philomena. You have a very odd
manner.
Malachy smiled. I do?
about
You do, says Delia. I think 'tis one of the first things we noticed you, that odd manner, and it gives us a very uneasy feeling.
'Tis that sneaky little Presbyterian smile, said Philomena.
Och, said Malachy, it's just the trouble I have with my teeth. Teeth or no teeth, odd manner or no odd manner, you're gonna marry
that girl, said Tommy. Up the middle aisle you're going.
Och, said Malachy, I wasn't planning to get married, you know.
There's no work and I wouldn't be able to support... Married is what you're going to be, said Delia. Up the middle aisle, said Jimmy.
You shuddup, said Delia.
Malachy watched them leave. I'm in a desperate pickle, he told Joey Cacciamani.
Bet your ass, said Joey. I see them babes comin' at me I jump inna Hudson River.
Malachy considered the pickle he was in. He had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in San Francisco or one of the other California Sans. Wouldn't he be better off in California, far from the great breasted MacNamara sisters and their grim husbands? He would, indeed, and he'd have a drop of the Irish to celebrate his decision and departure. Joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off Malachy's gullet. Irish, indeed! He told Joey it was a Prohibition concoction from the devil's own still. Joey shrugged. I don't know nothing. I only pour. Still, it was better than nothing and Malachy would have another and one for yourself, Joey, and ask them two decent Italians what they'd like and what are you talking about, of course, I have the money to pay for it.
He awoke on a bench in the Long Island Railroad Station, a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick, his escape money gone, the MacNamara sisters ready to eat him alive in Brooklyn.
On the feast of St. Joseph, a bitter day in March, four months after the knee-trembler, Malachy married Angela and in August the child was born. In November Malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child's birth. He thought he might name the child Malachy, after himself, but his North of Ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name Male on the certificate.
Not until late December did they take Male to St. Paul's Church to be baptized and named Francis after his father's father and the lovely saint of Assisi. Angela wanted to give him a middle name, Munchin, after the patron saint of Limerick but Malachy said over his dead body. No son of his would have a Limerick name. It's hard enough going through life with one name. Sticking on middle names was an atrocious American habit and there was no need for a second name when you're christened after the man from Assisi.
There was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather, John McErlaine, got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities. Philomena told her husband, Tommy, he'd have to be godfather. Child's soul is in danger, she said. Tommy put his head down and grumbled. All right. I'll be godfather but I'm not goin' to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin' trouble and goin' through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to John McErlaine at the speakeasy. The priest said, True for you, Tom, decent man that you are, fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy. Malachy, fresh from the speakeasy himself, felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest, one sacrilege on top of another. Take off that collar and we'll see who's the man. He had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim. Angela, new mother, agitated, forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font, a total immersion of the Protestant type. The altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to Angela, who sobbed and clutched him, dripping, to her bosom. The priest laughed, said he had never seen the likes, that the child was a regular little Baptist now and hardly needed a priest. This maddened Malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a Protestant. The priest said, Quiet, man, you're in God's house, and when Malachy said, God's house, my arse, he was thrown out on Court Street because you can't say arse in God's house.
After baptism Philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner. Malachy said, Tea? and she said, Yes, tea, or is it whiskey you want? He said tea was grand but first he'd have to go and deal with John McErlaine, who didn't have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather. Angela said, You're only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy, and he said, As God is my witness, the drink is the last thing on my mind. Angela started to cry. Your son's christening day and you have to go drinking. Delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the North of Ireland.
Malachy looked from one to the other, shifted on his feet, pulled his cap down over his eyes, shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets, said, Och, aye, the way they do in the far reaches of County Antrim, turned, hurried up Court Street to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where he was sure they'd ply him with free drink in honor of his son's baptism.
At Philomena's house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while Angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying. Philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at Angela, That's what you get for being such a fool. Hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic. You shoulda stayed single, put the child up for adoption, and you'd be a free woman today. Angela cried harder and Delia took up the attack, Oh, stop it, Angela, stop it. You have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin' into trouble with a drunkard from the North, a man that doesn't even look like a Catholic, him with his odd manner. I'd say
that... that... Malachy has a streak of the Presbyterian in him right enough. You shuddup, Jimmy.
If I was you, said Philomena, I'd make sure there's no more children. He don't have a job, so he don't, an' never will the way he drinks. So... no more children, Angela. Are you listenin' to me?
I am, Philomena.
A year later another child was born. Angela called him Malachy after his father and gave him a middle name, Gerard, after his father's brother.
The MacNamara sisters said Angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses.
Their husbands agreed.
I'm in a playground on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn with my brother, Malachy. He's two, I'm three. We're on the seesaw.
Up, down, up, down.
Malachy goes up.
I get off.
Malachy goes down. Seesaw hits the ground. He screams. His hand is
on his mouth and there's blood.
Oh, God. Blood is bad. My mother will kill me.
And here she is, trying to run across the playground. Her big belly
slows her.
She says, What did you do? What did you do to I don't know what to say. I don't know what I She pulls my ear. Go home. Go to bed. Bed?
In the middle of the day?
She pushes me toward the playground gate. Go. She picks up Malachy and waddles off.
My father's friend, Mr. MacAdorey, is outside
the child?
did.
our building. He's standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife, Minnie, looking at a
dog lying in the gutter. There is blood all around the dog's head. It's the color of the blood from Malachy's mouth.
Malachy has dog blood and the dog has Malachy blood.
I pull Mr. MacAdorey's hand. I tell him Malachy has blood like the
dog.
Oh, he does, indeed, Francis. Cats have it, too. And Eskimos. All
the same blood.
Minnie says, Stop that, Dan. Stop confusing the wee fellow. She
tells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died. Wanted to come home, the poor wee creature.
Mr. MacAdorey says, You'd better go home, Francis. I don't know what you did to your wee brother, but your mother took him off to the hospital. Go home, child.
Will Malachy die like the dog, Mr. MacAdorey? Minnie says, He bit his tongue. He won't die. Why did the dog die?
It was his time, Francis.
The apartment is empty and I wander between the two rooms, the bedroom and the kitchen. My father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with Malachy. I wish I had something to eat but there's nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice. My father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it. I fall asleep on my parents' bed and when my mother
shakes me it's nearly dark. Your little brother is going to sleep a while. Nearly bit his tongue off. Stitches galore. Go into the other
room.
My father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white
enamel mug. He lifts me to his lap.
Dad, will you tell me the story about Coo Coo?
Cuchulain. Say it after me, Coo-hoo-lin. I'll tell you the story
when you say the name right. Coo-hoo-lin.
I say it right and he tells me the story of Cuchulain, who had a
different name when he was a boy, Setanta. He grew up in Ireland where Dad lived when he was a boy in County Antrim. Setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to Culain and choked him. Oh, Culain was angry and he said, What am I to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs, hens, sheep?
Setanta said, I'm sorry. I'll guard your house with my stick and ball and I'll change my name to Cuchulain, the Hound of Culain. He did. He guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero, the Hound of Ulster itself. Dad said he was a greater hero than Hercules or Achilles that the Greeks were always bragging about and he could take on King Arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which, of course, you could never get with an Englishman anyway.
That's my story. Dad can't tell that story to Malachy or any other children down the hall.
He finishes the story and lets me sip his tea. It's bitter, but I'm happy there on his lap.
For days Malachy's tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk. But even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night. The neighbors say, Ooh, Ah, they're lovely boys, look at those big eyes.
Malachy stands in the middle of the room, looking up at everyone, pointing to his tongue and saying, Uck, uck. When the neighbors say, Can't you see we're looking at your little brothers? he cries, till Dad pats him on the head. Put in your tongue, son, and go out and play with Frankie. Go on.
In the playground I tell Malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth. Malachy shakes his head. No uck ball. Car uck kill dog. He cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it's terrible when you can't talk. He won't let me push him on the swing. He says, You uck kill me uck on seesaw. He gets Freddie Leibowitz to push him and he's happy, laughing when he swings to the sky. Freddie is big, he's seven, and I ask him to push me. He says, No, you tried to kill your brother.
I try to get the swing going myself but all I can do is move it back and forth and I'm angry because Freddie and Malachy are laughing at the way I can't swing. They're great pals now, Freddie, seven, Malachy, two. They laugh every day and Malachy's tongue gets better with all the laughing.
When he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine. He has blue eyes like my mother. He has golden hair and pink cheeks. I have brown eyes like Dad. I have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror. My mother tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall that Malachy is the happiest child in the world.
She tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall, Frankie has the odd manner like his father. I wonder what the odd manner is but I can't ask because I'm not supposed to be listening.
I wish I could swing up into the sky, up into the clouds. I might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers, Oliver and Eugene, cry in the middle of the night anymore. My mother says they're always hungry. She cries in the middle of the night, too. She says she's worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her. She wishes she had one little girl all for herself. She'd give anything for one little girl.
I'm in the playground with Malachy. I'm four, he's three. He lets me push him on the swing because he's no good at swinging himself and Freddie Leibowitz is in school. We have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she's worn out. Go out and play, she says, and give me some rest. Dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey, singing all the songs about suffering Ireland. Mam gets angry and says Ireland can kiss her arse. He says that's nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language, food on the table is what she wants, not suffering Ireland. She says it was a sad day Prohibition ended because Dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer. Sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch, rye bread, corned beef, pickles. He puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself. He says food is a shock to the system and he doesn't know where we get our appetites. Mam
says,
They get their appetites because they're starving half the time.
When Dad gets a job Mam is cheerful and she sings, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,
It had to be and the reason is this
Could it be true, someone like you
Could love me, love me?
When Dad brings home the first week's wages Mam is delighted she can pay the lovely Italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there's nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone. She cleans the kitchen, washes the mugs and plates, brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table, cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another Italian. She buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that, she says, is better than having the headlines from the Daily News blackening your arse. She boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks, diapers for the twins, our two sheets, our three towels. She hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun. She says you wouldn't want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there's nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun.
When Dad brings home the first week's wages on a Friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful. On Saturday night Mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and Dad will dry us. Malachy will turn around and show his behind. Dad will pretend to be shocked and we'll all laugh. Mam will make hot cocoa and we'll be able to stay up while Dad tells us a story out of his head. All we have to do is
say a name, Mr. MacAdorey or Mr. Leibowitz down the hall, and Dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in Brazil chased by Indians with green noses and puce shoulders. On nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs, fried tomatoes and fried bread, tea with lashings of sugar and milk and, later in the day, a big dinner of mashed potatoes, peas and ham, and a trifle Mam makes, layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry.
When Dad brings home the first week's wages and the weather is fine Mam takes us to the playground. She sits on a bench and talks to Minnie MacAdorey. She tells Minnie stories about characters in Limerick and Minnie tells her about characters in Belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in Ireland, North and South. Then they teach each other sad songs and Malachy and I leave the swings and see-saws to sit with them on the bench and sing, A group of young soldiers one night in a camp Were talking of sweethearts they had.
All seemed so merry except one young lad, And he was downhearted and sad.
Come and join us, said one of the boys, Surely there's someone for you.
But Ned shook his head and proudly he said I am in love with two, Each like a mother to me,
From neither of them shall I part.
For one is my mother,
God bless her and love her,
The other is my sweetheart.
Malachy and I sing that song and Mam and Minnie laugh till they cry at the way Malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to Mam at the end. Dan MacAdorey comes along on his way home from work and says Rudy Vallee better start worrying about the competition.
When we go home Mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt. Dad drinks the tea and eats nothing. Mam says, God above, How can you work all day and not eat? He says, The tea is enough. She says, You'll ruin your health, and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system. He drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the Daily News or he smokes a cigarette, stares at the wall, runs his tongue over his lips.
When Dad's job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages. On Friday night we wait for him and Mam gives us bread and tea. The darkness comes down and the lights come on along Classon Avenue. Other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can't have meat on a Friday. You can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and Bing Crosby is singing on the radio, Brother, can you spare a dime?
Malachy and I play with the twins. We know Mam won't sing Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table talking to herself, What am I going to do? till it's late and Dad rolls up the stairs singing Roddy McCorley. He pushes in the door and calls for us, Where are my troops? Where are my four warriors?
Mam says, Leave those boys alone. They're gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey.
He comes to the bedroom door. Up, boys, up. A nickel for everyone who promises to die for Ireland.
Deep in Canadian woods we met
From one bright island flown.
Great is the land we tread, but yet
Our hearts are with our own.
Up, boys, up. Francis, Malachy, Oliver, Eugene. The Red Branch Knights, the Fenian Men, the IRA. Up, up.
Mam is at the kitchen table, shaking, her hair hanging damp, her face wet. Can't you leave them alone? she says. Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
isn't it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it? She comes to us. Go back to bed, she
I want them up, he says. I want them
be free from the center to the sea.
Don't cross me, she says, for if you your mother's house.
a penny in your pocket without
says.
ready for the day Ireland will
do it'll be a sorry day in
He pulls his cap down over his face and cries, My poor mother. Poor Ireland. Och, what are we going to do?
Mam says, You're pure stone mad, and she tells us again to go to bed.
On the morning of the fourth Friday of Dad's job Mam asks him if he'll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again? He looks at us and shakes his head at Mam as if to say, Och, you shouldn't talk like that in front of the children.
Mam keeps at him. I'm asking you, Are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing Kevin Barry and the rest of the sad songs?
He puts on his cap, shoves his hands into his trouser pockets, sighs and looks up at the ceiling. I told you before I'll be home, he
says.
Later in the day Mam dresses us. She puts the twins into the pram
and off we go through the long streets of Brooklyn. Sometimes she lets Malachy sit in the pram when he's tired of trotting along beside her. She tells me I'm too big for the pram. I could tell her I have pains in my legs from trying to keep up with her but she's not singing and I know this is not the day to be talking about my pains.
We come to a big gate where there's a man standing in a box with windows all around. Mam talks to the man. She wants to know if she can go inside to where the men are paid and maybe they'd give her some of Dad's wages so he wouldn't spend it in the bars. The man shakes his head. I'm sorry, lady, but if we did that we'd have half the wives in Brooklyn storming the place. Lotta men have the drinking problem but there's nothing we can do long as they show up sober and do their work.
We wait across the street. Mam lets me sit on the sidewalk with my back against the wall. She gives the twins their bottles of water and sugar but Malachy and I have to wait till she gets money from Dad and we can go to the Italian for tea and bread and eggs.
When the whistle blows at half five men in caps and overalls swarm through the gate, their faces and hands black from the work. Mam tells us watch carefully for Dad because she can hardly see across the street
herself, her eyes are that bad. There are dozens of men, then a few, then none. Mam is crying, Why couldn't ye see him? Are ye blind or what?
She goes back to the man in the box. Are you sure there wouldn't be one man left inside?
No, lady, he says. They're out. I don't know how he got past you.
We go back through the long streets of Brooklyn. The twins hold up their bottles and cry for more water and sugar. Malachy says he's hungry and Mam tells him wait a little, we'll get money from Dad and we'll all have a nice supper. We'll go to the Italian and get eggs and make toast with the flames on the stove and we'll have jam on it. Oh, we will, and we'll all be nice and warm.
It's dark on Atlantic Avenue and all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station are bright and noisy. We go from bar to bar looking for Dad. Mam leaves us outside with the pram while she goes in or she sends me. There are crowds of noisy men and stale smells that remind me of Dad when he comes home with the smell of the whiskey on him.
The man behind the bar says, Yeah, sonny, whaddya want? You're not supposeta be in here, y'know.
I'm looking for my father. Is my father here?
Naw, sonny, how'd I know dat? Who's your fawdah?
His name is Malachy and he sings Kevin Barry.
Malarkey?
No, Malachy.
Malachy? And he sings Kevin Barry?
He calls out to the men in the bar, Youse guys, youse know guy
Malachy what sings Kevin Barry?
Men shake their heads. One says he knew a guy Michael sang Kevin
Barry but he died of the drink which he had because of his war wounds. The barman says, Jeez, Pete, I didn't ax ya to tell me history o'
da woild, did I? Naw, kid. We don't let people sing in here. Causes trouble. Specially the Irish. Let 'em sing, next the fists are flying. Besides, I never hoid a name like dat Malachy. Naw, kid, no Malachy here.
The man called Pete holds his glass toward me. Here, kid, have a sip, but the barman says, Whaddya doin', Pete? Tryina get the kid drunk? Do that again, Pete, an' I'll come out an' break y'ass.
Mam tries all the bars around the station before she gives up. She leans against a wall and cries. Jesus, we still have to walk all the way to Classon Avenue and I have four starving children. She sends me back into the bar where Pete offered me the sip to see if the barman would fill the twins' bottles with water and maybe a little sugar in each. The men in the bar think it's very funny that the barman should be filling baby bottles but he's big and he tells them shut their lip. He tells me babies should be drinking milk not water and when I tell him Mam doesn't have the money he empties the baby bottles and fills them with milk. He says, Tell ya mom they need that for the teeth an' bones. Ya drink water an' sugar an' all ya get is rickets. Tell ya Mom.
Mam is happy with the milk. She says she knows all about teeth and bones and rickets but beggars can't be choosers.
When we reach Classon Avenue she goes straight to the Italian grocery shop. She tells the man her husband is late tonight, that he's probably working overtime, and would it be at all possible to get a few things and she'll be sure to see him tomorrow?
The Italian says, Missus, you always pay your bill sooner or later and you can have anything you like in this store.
Oh, she says, I don't want much.
Anything you like, missus, because I know you're an honest woman and you got a bunch o' nice kids there.
We have eggs and toast and jam though we're so weary walking the long streets of Brooklyn we can barely move our jaws to chew. The twins fall asleep after eating and Mam lays them on the bed to change their diapers. She sends me down the hall to rinse the dirty diapers in the lavatory so that they can be hung up to dry and used the next day. Malachy helps her wash the twins' bottoms though he's ready to fall asleep himself.
I crawl into bed with Malachy and the twins. I look out at Mam at the kitchen table, smoking a cigarette, drinking tea, and crying. I want to get up and tell her I'll be a man soon and I'll get a job in the place with the big gate and I'll come home every Friday night with money for eggs and toast and jam and she can sing again Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss.
The next week Dad loses the job. He comes home that Friday night, throws his wages on the table and says to Mam, Are you happy now? You hang around the gate complaining and accusing and they sack me. They were looking for an excuse and you gave it to them.
He takes a few dollars from his wages and goes out. He comes home late roaring and singing. The twins cry and Mam shushes them and cries a long time herself.
We spend hours in the playground when the twins are sleeping, when Mam is tired, and when Dad comes home with the whiskey smell on him, roaring about Kevin Barry getting hanged on a Monday morning or the Roddy McCorley song, Up the narrow street he stepped Smiling and proud and young About the hemp rope on his neck The golden ringlets clung, There's never a tear in the blue eyes Both glad and bright are they, As Roddy McCorley goes to die On the bridge of Toome today.
When he sings he marches around the table, Mam cries and the twins howl with her. She says, Go out, Frankie, go out, Malachy. You shouldn't see your father like this. Stay in the playground. We don't mind going to the playground.
We can play with the leaves piling up on the ground and we can push each other on the swings but then winter comes to Classon Avenue and the swings are frozen and won't even move. Minnie MacAdorey says, God help these poor wee boys.
They don't have a glove between them. That makes me laugh because I know Malachy and I have four hands between us and one glove would be silly. Malachy doesn't know what I'm laughing at: He won't know anything till he's four going on five.
Minnie brings us in and gives us tea and porridge with jam in it. Mr. MacAdorey sits in an armchair with their new baby, Maisie. He holds her bottle and sings, Clap hands, clap hands, Till Daddy comes home, With buns in his pocket For Maisie alone.
Clap hands, clap hands,
Till Daddy comes home,
For Daddy has money
And Mammy has none.
Malachy tries to sing that song but I tell him stop, it's Maisie's song. He starts to cry and Minnie says, There, there. You can sing the
song.
and I
song.
That's a song for all the children. Mr. MacAdorey smiles at Malachy wonder what kind of world is it where anyone can sing anyone else's
Minnie says, Don't frown, Frankie. It makes your face dark and God it's dark enough. Some day you'll have a little sister and you can
knows
sing that song to her. Och, aye. You'll have a little sister, surely.
Minnie is right and Mam gets her wish. There's a new baby soon, a little girl, and they call her Margaret. We all love Margaret. She has black curly hair and blue eyes like Mam and she waves her little hands and chirps like any little bird in the trees along Classon Avenue. Minnie says there was a holiday in heaven the day this child was made. Mrs. Leibowitz says the world never saw such eyes, such a smile, such happiness. She makes me dance, says Mrs. Leibowitz.
sings
When Dad comes home from looking for a job he holds Margaret and to her: In a shady nook one moonlit night A leprechaun I spied.
With scarlet cap and coat of green
A cruiskeen by his side.
'Twas tick tock tick his hammer went Upon a tiny shoe.
Oh, I laugh to think he was caught at last, But the fairy was laughing, too.
He walks around the kitchen with her and talks to her. He tells her how lovely she is with her curly black hair and the blue eyes of her mother. He tells her he'll take her to Ireland and they'll walk the Glens of Antrim and swim in Lough Neagh. He'll get a job soon, so he will, and she'll have dresses of silk and shoes with silver buckles.
The more Dad sings to Margaret the less she cries and as the days pass she even begins to laugh. Mam says, Look at him trying to dance with that child in his arms, him with his two left feet. She laughs and we all laugh.
The twins cried when they were small and Dad and Mam would say Whisht and Hush and feed them and they'd go back to sleep. But when Margaret cries there's a high lonely feeling in the air and Dad is out of bed in a second, holding her to him, doing a slow dance around the table, singing to her, making sounds like a mother. When he passes the window where the streetlight shines in you can see tears on his cheeks and that's strange because he never cries for anyone unless he has the drink taken and he sings the Kevin Barry song and the Roddy McCorley song. Now he cries over Margaret and he has no smell of drink on him.
Mam tells Minnie MacAdorey, He's in heaven over that child. He hasn't touched a drop since she was born. I should've had a little girl a long time ago.
Och, they're lovely, aren't they? says Minnie. The little boys are grand, too, but you need a little girl for yourself.
My mother laughs, For myself? Lord above, if I didn't nurse her I wouldn't be able to get near her the way he wants to be holding her day and night.
Minnie says it's lovely, all the same, to see a man so charmed with his little girl for isn't everyone charmed with her?
Everyone.
The twins are able to stand and walk and they have accidents all the time. Their bottoms are sore because they're always wet and shitty. They put dirty things in their mouths, bits of paper, feathers, shoelaces, and they get sick. Mam says we're all driving her crazy. She dresses the twins, puts them in the pram, and Malachy and I take them to the playground. The cold weather is gone and the trees have green leaves up and down Classon Avenue.
We race the pram around the playground and the twins laugh and make goo-goo sounds till they get hungry and start to cry. There are two bottles in the pram filled with water and sugar and that keeps them quiet for awhile till they're hungry again and they cry so hard I don't know what to do because they're so small and I wish I could give them all kinds of food so that they'd laugh and make the baby sounds. They love the mushy food Mam makes in a pot, bread mashed up in milk and water and sugar. Mam calls it bread and goody.
If I take the twins home now Mam will yell at me for giving her no rest or for waking Margaret. We are to stay in the playground till she sticks her head out the window and calls for us. I make funny faces for the twins to stop their crying. I put a piece of paper on my head and let it fall and they laugh and laugh. I push the pram over to Malachy playing on the swings with Freddie Leibowitz. Malachy is trying to tell Freddie all about the way Setanta became Cuchulain. I tell him stop telling that story, it's my story. He won't stop. I push him and he cries, Waah, waah, I'll tell Mam. Freddie pushes me and everything turns dark in my head and I run at him with fists and knees and feet till he yells, Hey, stop, stop, and I won't because I can't, I don't know how, and if I stop Malachy will go on taking my story from me. Freddie pushes me away and runs off, yelling, Frankie tried to kill me. Frankie tried to kill me. I don't know what to do because I never tried to kill anyone before and now Malachy, on the swing, cries, Don't kill me, Frankie, and he looks so helpless I put my arms around him and help him off the swing. He hugs me. I won't tell your story anymore. I won't tell Freddie about Coo, Coo. I want to laugh but I can't because the twins are crying in the pram and it's dark in the playground and what's the use of trying to make funny faces and letting things fall off your head when they can't see you in the dark?
The Italian grocery shop is across the street and I see bananas, apples, oranges. I know the twins can eat bananas. Malachy loves bananas and I like them myself. But you need money, Italians are not known for giving away bananas especially to the McCourts who owe them money already for groceries.
My mother tells me all the time, Never, never leave that playground except to come home. But what am I to do with the twins bawling with the hunger in the pram? I tell Malachy I'll be back in a minute. I make sure no one is looking, grab a bunch of bananas outside the Italian grocery shop and run down Myrtle Avenue, away from the playground, around the block and back to the other end where there's a hole in the fence. We push the pram to a dark corner and peel the bananas for the twins. There are five bananas in the bunch and we feast on them in the dark corner. The twins slobber and chew and spread banana over their faces, their hair, their clothes. I realize then that questions will be asked. Mam will want to know why the twins are smothered in bananas, where did you get them? I can't tell her about the Italian shop on the corner. I will have to say, A man.
That's what I'll say. A man.
Then the strange thing happens. There's a man at the gate of the playground. He's calling me. Oh, God, it's the Italian. Hey, sonny, come 'ere. Hey, talkin' to ya. Come 'ere.
I go to him.
You the kid wid the little bruddas, right? Twins?
Yes, sir.
Heah. Gotta bag o' fruit. I don' give it to you I trow id out.
Right? So, heah, take the bag. Ya got apples, oranges, bananas. Ya like bananas, right? I think ya like bananas, eh? Ha, ha. I know ya like the bananas. Heah, take the bag. Ya gotta nice mother there. Ya father? Well, ya know, he's got the problem, the Irish thing. Give them twins a banana. Shud 'em up. I hear 'em all the way cross the street.
Thank you, sir.
Jeez. Polite kid, eh? Where ja loin dat?
My father told me to say thanks, sir.
Your father? Oh, well.
Dad sits at the table reading the paper. He says that President
Roosevelt is a good man and everyone in America will soon have a job. Mam is on the other side of the table feeding Margaret with a bottle. She has the hard look that frightens me.
Where did you get that fruit?
The man.
What man?
The Italian man gave it to me.
Did you steal that fruit?
Malachy says, The man. The man
And what did you do to Freddie
Lovely woman. I don't know what we'd
And you had to attack poor Freddie.
gave Frankie the bag.
Leibowitz? His mother was here.
do without her and Minnie MacAdorey.
Malachy jumps up and down. He din't. He din't. Din't try to kill Freddie. Din't try to kill me.
Dad says, Whisht, Malachy, whisht. Come over here. And he takes Malachy on his lap.
My mother says, Go down the hall and tell Freddie you're sorry.
But Dad says, Do you want to tell Freddie you're sorry?
I don't.
My parents look at one another. Dad says, Freddie is a good boy. He
was only pushing your little brother on the swing. Isn't that right? He was trying to steal my Cuchulain story.
Och, now. Freddie doesn't care about the Cuchulain story. He has
his own story. Hundreds of stories. He's Jewish. What's Jewish?
Dad laughs. Jewish is, Jewish is people with their own stories. They don't need Cuchulain. They have Moses. They have Samson.
What's Samson?
If you go down and talk to Freddie I'll tell you about Samson later. You can tell Freddie you're sorry and you'll never do it again and you can even ask him about Samson. Anything you like as long as you talk to Freddie. Will you?
The baby gives a little cry in my mother's arms and Dad jumps up, dropping Malachy to the floor. Is she all right? My mother says, Of course she's all right. She's feeding. God above, you're a bundle of nerves.
They're talking about Margaret now and I'm forgotten. I don't care. I'm going down the hall to ask Freddie about Samson, to see if Samson is as good as Cuchulain, to see if Freddie has his own story or if he still wants to steal Cuchulain. Malachy wants to go with me now that my father is standing and doesn't have a lap anymore.
Mrs. Leibowitz says, Oh, Frankie, Frankie, come in, come in. And little Malachy. And tell me, Frankie, what did you do to Freddie? Tried to kill him? Freddie is a good boy, Frankie. Reads his book. Listens to radio with his papa. He swinks you brother on swink. And you try to kill him. Oh, Frankie, Frankie. And you poor mother and her sick baby.
She's not sick, Mrs. Leibowitz.
Sick she is. Zat is one sick baby. I know from sick babies. I work in hoztipal. Don't tell me, Frankie. Come in, come in. Freddie, Freddie, Frankie is here. Come out. Frankie won't kill you no more. You and little Malachy. Nice Chewish name, have piece cake, eh? Why they give you a Chewish name, eh? So, glass milk, piece cake. You boys so thin, Irish don't eat.
We sit at the table with Freddie, eating cake, drinking milk. Mr. Leibowitz sits in an armchair reading the paper, listening to the radio. Sometimes he speaks to Mrs. Leibowitz and I don't understand because strange sounds come from his mouth. Freddie understands. When Mr. Leibowitz makes the strange sounds Freddie gets up and takes him a piece of cake. Mr. Leibowitz smiles at Freddie and pats his head and Freddie smiles back and makes the strange sounds.
Mrs. Leibowitz shakes her head at Malachy and me. Oy, so thin. She says Oy so much Malachy laughs and says Oy and the Leibowitzes laugh and Mr. Leibowitz says words we can understand, When Irish oyes are smiling. Mrs. Leibowitz laughs so hard her body shakes and she holds her stomach and Malachy says Oy again because he knows that makes everyone laugh. I say Oy but no one laughs and I know Oy belongs to Malachy the way Cuchulain belongs to me and Malachy can have his Oy.
Mrs. Leibowitz, my father said Freddie has a favorite story.
Malachy says, Sam, Sam, Oy. Everyone laughs again but I don't because I can't remember what comes after Sam. Freddie mumbles through his cake, Samson, and Mrs. Leibowitz tells him, Don't talk wiz you mouse full, and I laugh because she's grown-up and she says mouse instead of mouth. Malachy laughs because I laugh and the Leibowitzes look at each other and smile. Freddie says, Not Samson. My favorite story is David and the giant, Goliath. David killed him dead with a slingshot, a stone in his head. His brains was on the ground.
Were on the ground, says Mr. Leibowitz.
Yes, Papa. Papa.
That's what Freddie calls his father and Dad is what I call my
father.
My mother's whisper wakes me. What's up with the child? It's still
early and there isn't much morning in the room but you can see Dad over by the window with Margaret in his arms. He's rocking her and sighing,
Och.
Mam says, Is she, is she sick?
Och, she's very quiet and she's a wee bit cold.
My mother is out of the bed, taking the child. Go for the doctor.
Go for God's sake, and my father is pulling on his trousers over his shirt, no jacket, shoes, no socks on this bitter day.
We wait in the room, the twins asleep at the bottom of the bed, Malachy stirring beside me. Frankie, I want a drink of water. Mam rocks in her bed with the baby in her arms. Oh, Margaret, Margaret, my own little love. Open your lovely blue eyes, my little leanv.
I fill a cup of water for Malachy and me and my mother wails, Water for you and your brother. Oh, indeed, Water, is it? And nothing for your sister. Your poor little sister. Did you ask if she had a mouth in her head? Did you ask if she'd like a drop of water? Oh, no. Go on and drink your water, you and your brother, as if nothing happened. A regular day for the two of you, isn't it? And the twins sleeping away as if they didn't have a care and their poor little sister sick here in my arms. Sick in my arms. Oh, sweet Jesus in heaven.
Why is she talking like this? She's not talking like my mother today. I want my father. Where is my father?
I get back into bed and start to cry. Malachy says, Why you cry? Why you cry? till Mam is at me again. Your sister is sick in my arms and you're there whining and whinging. If I go over to that bed I'll give you something to whinge about.
Dad is back with the doctor. Dad has the whiskey smell. The doctor examines the baby, prods her, raises her eyelids, feels her neck, arms, legs. He straightens up and shakes his head. She's gone. Mam reaches for the baby, hugs her, turns to the wall. The doctor wants to know, Was there any kind of accident? Did anyone drop the baby? Did the boys play too hard with her? Anything?
My father shakes his head. Doctor says he'll have to take her to examine her and Dad signs a paper. My mother begs for another few minutes with her baby but the doctor says he doesn't have all day. When Dad reaches for Margaret my mother pulls away against the wall. She has the wild look, her black curly hair is damp on her forehead and there is sweat all over her face, her eyes are wide open and her face is shiny with tears, she keeps shaking her head and moaning, Ah, no, ah, no, till Dad eases the baby from her arms. The doctor wraps Margaret completely in a blanket and my mother cries, Oh, Jesus, you'll smother her. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me. The doctor leaves. My mother turns to the wall and doesn't make a move or sound. The twins are awake, crying with the hunger, but Dad stands in the middle of the room, staring at the ceiling. His face is white and he beats on his thighs with his fists. He comes to the bed, puts his hand on my head. His hand is shaking. Francis, I'm going out for cigarettes.
Mam stays in the bed all day, hardly moving. Malachy and I fill the twins' bottles with water and sugar. In the kitchen we find a half loaf of stale bread and two cold sausages. We can't have tea because the milk is sour in the icebox where the ice is melted again and everyone knows you can't drink tea without milk unless your father gives it to you out of his mug while he's telling you about Cuchulain.
The twins are hungry again but I know I can't give them water and sugar all day and night. I boil sour milk in a pot, mash in some of the stale bread, and try to feed them from a cup, bread and goody. They make faces and run to Mam's bed, crying. She keeps her face to the wall and they run back to me, still crying. They won't eat the bread and goody till I kill the taste of the sour milk with sugar. Now they eat and smile and rub the goody over their faces. Malachy wants some and if he can eat it, so can I. We all sit on the floor eating the goody and chewing on the
cold sausage and drinking water my mother keeps in a milk bottle in the icebox.
After we eat and drink we have to go to the lavatory down the hall but we can't get in because Mrs. Leibowitz is inside, humming and singing. She says, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Won't be two seconds. Malachy claps his hands and dances around, singing, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Mrs. Leibowitz opens the lavatory door. Look at him. Little actor awready. So, chiltren, how's you mother?
She's in bed, Mrs. Leibowitz. The doctor took Margaret and my father went for cigarettes.
Oh, Frankie, Frankie. I said that was one sick child.
Malachy is clutching himself. Have to pee. Have to pee.
So, pee awready. You boys pee and we see you mother.
After we pee Mrs. Leibowitz comes to see Mam. Oh, Mrs. McCourt. Oy
vey, darlink. Look at this. Look at these twins. Naked. Mrs. McCourt, what is mazzer, eh? The baby she is sick? So talk to me. Poor woman. Here turn around, missus. Talk to me. Oy, this is one mess. Talk to me, Mrs. McCourt.
She helps my mother sit up against the wall. Mam seems smaller. Mrs. Leibowitz says she'll bring some soup and tells me get some water to wash my mother's face. I dip a towel in cold water and pat her forehead. She presses my hand against her cheeks. Oh, Jesus, Frankie. Oh, Jesus. She won't let my hand go and I'm frightened because I've never seen her like this before. She's saying Frankie only because it's my hand she's holding and it's Margaret she's thinking about, not me. Your lovely little sister is dead, Frankie. Dead. And where is your father? She lets my hand drop. I said where is your father? Drinking. That's where he is. There isn't a penny in the house. He can't get a job but he finds money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink. She rears back, knocks her head on the wall and screams, Where is she? Where is she? Where is my little girl? Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me this night. I'll go mad, so I will, I'll go pure mad.
Mrs. Leibowitz rushes in. Missus, missus, what is it? The little girl. Where is she?
My mother screams again, Dead, Mrs. Leibowitz. Dead. Her head drops and she rocks back and forth. Middle of the night, Mrs. Leibowitz. In her pram. I should have been watching her. Seven weeks she had in this world and died in the middle of the night, alone, Mrs. Leibowitz, all alone in that pram.
Mrs. Leibowitz holds my mother in her arms. Shush, now, shush. Babies go like that. It happens, missus. God takes them.
In the pram, Mrs. Leibowitz. Near my bed. I could have picked her up and she didn't have to die, did she? God doesn't want little babies. What is God going to do with little babies?
I don't know, missus. I don't know from God. Have soup. Good soup. Make you strong. You boys. Get bowls. I give you soup.
What's bowls, Mrs. Leibowitz?
Oh, Frankie. You don't know bowl? For the soup, darlink. You don' have a bowl? So get cups for the soup. I mix pea soup and lentil soup. No ham. Irish like the ham. No ham, Frankie. Drink, missus. Drink you soup.
She spoons the soup into my mother's mouth, wipes the dribble from her chin. Malachy and I sit on the floor drinking from mugs. We spoon the soup into the twins' mouths. It is lovely and hot and tasty. My mother never makes soup like this and I wonder if there's any chance Mrs.
Leibowitz could ever be my mother. Freddie could be me and have my mother and my father, too, and he could have Malachy and the twins for brothers. He can't have Margaret anymore because she's like the dog in the street that was taken away. I don't know why she was taken away. My mother said she died in her pram and that must be like getting hit by a car because they take you away.
I wish little Margaret could be here for the soup. I could give it to her with a spoon the way Mrs. Leibowitz is giving it to my mother and she'd gurgle and laugh the way she did with Dad. She wouldn't cry anymore and my mother wouldn't be in the bed day and night and Dad would be telling me Cuchulain stories and I wouldn't want Mrs. Leibowitz to be my mother anymore. Mrs. Leibowitz is nice but I'd rather have my father telling me Cuchulain stories and Margaret chirping and Mam laughing when Dad dances with two left feet.
Minnie MacAdorey comes in to help. Mother o' God, Mrs. Leibowitz, these twins smell to the high heavens.
I don't know about Mother o' God, Minnie, but these twins need a wash. They need clean diapers. Frankie, where are the clean diapers?
I don't know.
Minnie says, They're just wearing rags for diapers. I'll get some of Maisie's. Frankie, you take off those rags and throw them out.
Malachy removes Oliver's rag and I struggle with Eugene. The safety pin is stuck and when he wriggles it comes loose, sticks him in the hip, and starts him screaming for Mam. But Minnie is back with a towel and soap and hot water. I help her wash away the caked shit and she lets me shake talcum powder on the twins' raw sore skin. She says they're good little boys and she has a big surprise for them. She goes down the hall and brings back a pot of mashed potatoes for all of us. There is plenty of salt and butter in the potatoes and I wonder if there's any chance Minnie could be my mother so that I could eat like this all the time. If I could have Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie for mothers at the same time I'd have no end of soup and mashed potatoes.
Minnie and Mrs. Leibowitz sit at the table. Mrs. Leibowitz says something has to be done. These children are running wild and where is the father? I hear Minnie whisper he's out for the drink. Mrs. Leibowitz says terrible, terrible, the way the Irish drink. Minnie says her Dan doesn't drink. Never touches the stuff and Dan told her that when the baby died that poor man, Malachy McCourt, went mad all over Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue, that he was thrown out of all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station, that the cops would have thrown him in jail if it was anything else but the death of that lovely little baby.
Here he has four lovely little boys, says Minnie, but it's no comfort to him. That little girl brought out something in him. You know he didn't even drink after she was born and that was a miracle.
Mrs. Leibowitz wants to know where Mam's cousins are, the big women with the quiet husbands. Minnie will find them and tell them the children are neglected, running wild, sore arses and everything.
Two days later Dad returns from his cigarette hunt. It's the middle of the night but he gets Malachy and me out of the bed. He has the smell of the drink on him. He has us stand at attention in the kitchen. We are soldiers. He tells us we must promise to die for Ireland.
We will, Dad, we will.
All together we sing Kevin Barry,
On Mountjoy one Monday morning,
High upon the gallows tree,
Kevin Barry gave his young life
For the cause of liberty.
Just a lad of eighteen summers
Sure there's no one can deny
As he marched to death that morning
How he held his head on high.
There's a knock at the door, Mr. MacAdorey. Och, Malachy, for God's sake, it's three in the morning. You have the whole house woke with the singing.
Och, Dan, I'm only teaching the boys to die for Ireland.
You can teach them to die for Ireland in the daytime, Malachy. 'Tis urgent, Dan, 'tis urgent.
I know, Malachy, but they're only children. Babies. You go to bed
now like a dacent man.
Bed, Dan! What am I to do in bed? Her little face is there day and
night, her curly black hair and her lovely blue eyes. Oh, Jesus, Dan, what will I do? Was it the hunger that killed her, Dan?
Of course not. Your missus was nursing her. God took her. He has his reasons.
One more song, Dan, before we go to bed. Good night, Malachy.
Come on, boys. Sing.
Because he loved the motherland, Because he loved the green
He goes to meet a martyr's fate With proud and joyous mien;
True to the last, oh! true to the last He treads the upward way;
Young Roddy McCorley goes to die
On the bridge at Toome today.
You'll die for Ireland, won't you, boys?
We will, Dad.
And we'll all meet your little sister in heaven, won't we, boys? We will, Dad.
My brother is standing with his face pressed against a leg of the
table and he's asleep. Dad lifts him, staggers across the room, places him in the bed by my mother. I climb into bed and my father, still in his clothes, lies beside me. I'm hoping he'll put his arms around me but he goes on singing about Roddy McCorley and talking to Margaret, Oh, my little curly-haired, blue-eyed love, I would dress you in silks and take you to Lough Neagh, till day is at the window and I fall asleep.
That night Cuchulain comes to me. There's a big green bird on his shoulder that keeps singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley and I don't like that bird because there's blood dripping from his mouth when he sings. In one hand Cuchulain carries the gae bolga, the spear that is so mighty only he can throw it. In the other hand he carries a banana, which he keeps offering to the bird, who just squawks and spits blood at
him. You'd wonder why Cuchulain puts up with a bird like that. If the twins ever spat blood at me when I offered them a banana I think I'd hit them on the head with it.
In the morning my father is at the kitchen table and I tell him my dream. He says there were no bananas in Ireland in the old times and even if there were Cuchulain would never offer one to that bird because that was the one that came over from England for the summer and perched on his shoulder when he was dying and propped up against a stone and when the men of Erin which is Ireland wanted to kill him they were afraid till they saw the bird drinking Cuchulain's blood and then they knew it was safe to attack him, the dirty bloody cowards. So you have to be wary of birds, Francis, birds and Englishmen.
Most of the day Mam lies in bed with her face to the wall. If she drinks tea or eats anything she throws up in the bucket under the bed and I have to empty it and rinse it in the lavatory down the hall. Mrs. Leibowitz brings her soup and funny bread that is twisted. Mam tries to slice it but Mrs. Leibowitz laughs and tells her just pull. Malachy calls it pull bread but Mrs. Leibowitz says, No, it's challah, and teaches us how to say it. She shakes her head. Oy, you Irish. You'll live forever but you'll never say challah like a Chew.
Minnie MacAdorey brings potatoes and cabbage and sometimes a piece of meat. Och, times are hard, Angela, but that lovely man, Mr. Roosevelt, will find a job for everyone and your husband will have work. Poor man, it's not his fault there's a Depression. He looks for work day and night. My Dan is lucky, four years with the city and he don't drink. He grew up in Toome with your husband. Some drink. Some don't. Curse of the Irish. Now eat, Angela. Build yourself up after your loss.
Mr. MacAdorey tells Dad there's work with the WPA and when he gets the work there's money for food and Mam leaves the bed to clean the twins and to feed us. When Dad comes home with the drink smell there's no money and Mam screams at him till the twins cry, and Malachy and I run out to the playground. On those nights Mam crawls back into bed and Dad sings the sad songs about Ireland. Why doesn't he hold her and help her sleep the way he did with my little sister who died? Why doesn't he sing a Margaret song or a song that will dry Mam's tears? He still gets Malachy and me out of bed to stand in our shirts promising to die for Ireland. One night he wanted to make the twins promise to die for Ireland but they can't even talk and Mam screamed at him, You mad oul' bastard, can't you leave the children alone?
He'll give us a nickel for ice cream if we promise to die for Ireland and we promise but we never get the nickel.
We get soup from Mrs. Leibowitz and mashed potatoes from Minnie MacAdorey and they show us how to take care of the twins, how to wash their bottoms and how to wash diaper rags after they get them all shitty. Mrs. Leibowitz calls them diapers and Minnie calls them nappies but it doesn't matter what they call them because the twins get them shitty anyway. If Mam stays in the bed and Dad goes out looking for a job we can do what we like all day. We can put the twins in the small swings in the park and swing them till they get hungry and cry. The Italian man calls to me from across the street, Hey, Frankie, c'mere. Watch out crossing da street. Dem twins hungry again? He gives us bits of cheese and ham and bananas but I can't eat bananas anymore after the way the bird spat blood at Cuchulain.
The man says his name is Mr. Dimino and that's his wife, Angela, behind the counter. I tell him that's my mother's name. No kiddin', kid. Your mother is Angela? I didn't know the Irish had any Angelas. Hey, Angela, his mother's name is Angela. She smiles. She says, Thatsa nice.
Mr. Dimino asks me about Mam and Dad and who cooks for us. I tell him we get food from Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. I tell him all about the diapers and the nappies and how they get shitty anyway and he laughs. Angela, you listenin' to this? Thank God you're Italian, Angela. He says, Kid, I gotta talk to Mrs. Leibowitz. Ya gotta have relations can take care of you. Ya see Minnie MacAdorey, tell her come in see me. You kids runnin' wild.
Two big women are at the door. They say, Who are you? I'm Frank. Frank! How old are you?
I'm four going on five.
You're not very big for your age, are you?
I don't know.
Is your mother here?
She's in the bed.
What is she doing in the bed on a fine day in the middle of the
day?
She's sleeping. Well, we'll come in. We have to talk to your
mother.
They brush past me into the room. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, the smell
of this place. And who are these children?
Malachy runs smiling to the big women. When he smiles you can see
how white and straight and pretty his teeth are and you can see the shiny blue of his eyes, the pink of his cheeks. All that makes the big women smile and I wonder why they didn't smile when they talked to me.
Malachy says, I'm Malachy and this is Oliver and this is Eugene, they're twins, and that's Frankie over there.
The big woman with the brown hair says, Well, you're not a bit shy, are you? I'm your mother's cousin, Philomena, and this is your mother's cousin, Delia. I'm Mrs. Flynn and she's Mrs. Fortune and that's what you call us.
Good God, says Philomena. Those twins are naked. Don't you have clothes for them?
Malachy says, They're all shitty.
Delia barks. See. That's what happens. A mouth like a sewer, and no wonder with a father from the North. Don't use that word. That's a bad word, a curse word. You could go to hell using a word like that.
What's hell? says Malachy. You'll know soon enough, says Delia.
The big women sit at the table with Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. Philomena says it's terrible what happened to Angela's little baby. They heard all about it and you'd wonder, wouldn't you, what they did with the little body. You might wonder and I might wonder but Tommy Flynn didn't wonder. Tommy said that Malachy from the North got money for that baby. Money? says Mrs. Leibowitz. That's right, says Philomena. Money. They take bodies any age and do experiments on them and there's not much left to give back nor would you want back bits of baby when they can't be buried in consecrated ground in that condition.
That's terrible, says Mrs. Leibowitz. A father or mother would never give the baby for something like that.
They would, says Delia, when they have the craving for the drink. They'd give their own mothers when they have the craving so what's a baby that's dead and gone in the first place?
Mrs. Leibowitz shakes her head and rocks in her chair. Oy, she says, oy, oy, oy. The poor baby. The poor mother. I thank God my husband don'have no what you call it? Craving? Right, craving. It's the Irish have the craving.
Not my husband, says Philomena. I'd break his face if he came home with the craving. Of course, Delia's Jimmy has the craving. Every Friday night you see him slipping into the saloon.
You needn't start insulting my Jimmy, says Delia. He works. He brings home his wages.
You'd want to keep an eye on him, says Philomena. The craving could get the better of him and you'd have another Malachy from the North on your hands.
Mind your own bloody business, says Delia. At least Jimmy is Irish, not born in Brooklyn like your Tommy.
And Philomena has no answer for that.
Minnie is holding her baby and the big women say she's a lovely baby, clean, not like this pack of Angela's running around this place. Philomena says she doesn't know where Angela got her dirty habits because Angela's mother was spotless, so clean you could eat your dinner off her floor.
I wonder why you'd want to eat your dinner off the floor when you had a table and a chair.
Delia says something has to be done about Angela and these children for they are a disgrace, so they are, enough to make you ashamed to be related. A letter has to be written to Angela's mother. Philomena will write it because a teacher in Limerick told her once she had a fine fist. Delia has to tell Mrs. Leibowitz that a fine fist means good handwriting.
Mrs. Leibowitz goes down the hall to borrow her husband's fountain pen, paper and an envelope. The four women sit at the table and make up a letter to send to my mother's mother: Dear Aunt Margaret, I take pen in hand to write you this letter and hope this finds you as it leaves us in the best of health. My husband Tommy is in fine form working away and Delia's husband Jimmy is in fine form working away and we hope this finds you in fine form. I am very sorry to tell you that Angela is not in fine form as the baby died, the little girl that was called Margaret after yourself, and Angela has not been the same since lying in the bed with her face to the wall. To make matters worser we think she's expecting again and that's too much altogether. The minute she losses one child there is another one on the way. We don't know how she does it. She's married four years, five children and another on the way. That shows you what can happen when you marry someone from the North for they have no control over themselves up there a bunch of Protestands that they are. He goes out for work every day but we know he spends all his time in the saloons and gets a few dollars for sweeping floors and lifting barrels and spends the money right back on the drink. It's terrible, Aunt Margaret, and we all think Angela and the children would be better off in her native land. We don't have the money to buy the tickets ourselves for times is hard but you might be able to see your way. Hopping this finds you in fine form as it leaves us thank God and His Blessed Mother.
I remain your loving neice
Philomena Flynn (what was MacNamara) and last but not least your neice Delia Fortune (what was MacNamara, too, ha ha ha)
Grandma Sheehan sent money to Philomena and Delia. They bought the tickets, found a steamer trunk at the St. Vincent de Paul Society, hired a van to take us to the pier in Manhattan, put us on the ship, said Good- bye and good riddance, and went away.
The ship pulled away from the dock. Mam said, That's the Statue of Liberty and that's Ellis Island where all the immigrants came in. Then she leaned over the side and vomited and the wind from the Atlantic blew it all over us and other happy people admiring the view. Passengers cursed and ran, seagulls came from all over the harbor and Mam hung limp and pale on the ship's rail.
II
In a week we arrived at Moville, County Donegal, where we took a bus to Belfast and from there another bus to Toome in County Antrim. We left the trunk in a shop and set out to walk the two miles up the road to Grandpa McCourt's house. It was dark on the road, the dawn barely stirring on the hills beyond.
Dad carried the twins in his arms and they took turns crying with the hunger. Mam stopped every few minutes to sit and rest on the stone wall along the road. We sat with her and watched the sky turn red and then blue. Birds started to chirp and sing in the trees and as the dawn came up we saw strange creatures in the fields, standing, looking at us. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?
Cows, son.
What are cows, Dad?
Cows are cows, son.
We walked farther along the brightening road and there were other
creatures in the fields, white furry creatures. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?
Sheep, son.
What are sheep, Dad?
My father barked at him, Is there any end to your questions? Sheep are sheep, cows are cows, and that over there is a goat. A goat is a goat. The goat gives milk, the sheep gives wool, the cow gives everything. What else in God's name do you want to know?
And Malachy yelped with fright because Dad never talked like that, never spoke sharply to us. He might get us up in the middle of the night and make us promise to die for Ireland but he never barked like this. Malachy ran to Mam and she said, There, there, love, don't cry. Your father is just worn out carrying the twins and 'tis hard answering all those questions when you're carting twins through the world.
Dad set the twins on the road and held out his arms to Malachy. Now the twins started to cry and Malachy clung to Mam, sobbing. The cows mooed, the sheep maaed, the goat ehehed, the birds twittered in the trees, and the beep beep of a motor car cut through everything. A man called from the motor car, Good Lord, what are you people doing on this road at this hour of an Easter Sunday morning?
Dad said, Good morning, Father.
Father? I said. Dad, is that your father?
Mam said, Don't ask him any questions.
Dad said, No, no, this is a priest.
Malachy said, What's a-? but Mam put her hand over his mouth. The priest had white hair and a white collar. He said, Where are
you going?
Dad said, Up the road to McCourts of Moneyglass, and the priest
took us in his motor car. He said he knew the McCourts, a fine family, good Catholics, some daily communicants, and he hoped he'd see us all at Mass, especially the little Yankees who didn't know what a priest was, God help us.
At the house my mother reaches for the gate latch. Dad says, No, no, not that way. Not the front gate. They use the front door only for visits from the priest or funerals.
We make our way around the house to the kitchen door. Dad pushes in the door and there's Grandpa McCourt drinking tea from a big mug and Grandma McCourt frying something.
Och, says Grandpa, you're here.
Och, we are, says Dad. He points to my mother. This is Angela, he says. Grandpa says, Och, you must be worn out, Angela. Grandma says nothing, she turns back to the frying pan. Grandpa leads us through the kitchen to a large room with a long table and chairs. He says, Sit down and have some tea. Would you like boxty?
Malachy says, What's boxty?
Dad laughs. Pancakes, son. Pancakes made with potatoes.
Grandpa says, We have eggs. It's Easter Sunday and you can have all
the eggs you can hold.
We have tea and boxty and boiled eggs and we all fall asleep. I
wake up in a bed with Malachy and the twins. My parents are in another bed over by the window. Where am I? It's getting dark. This is not the ship. Mam snores hink, Dad snores honk. I get up and poke at Dad. I have to pee. He says, Use the chamber pot.
What?
Under the bed, son. The chamber pot. It has roses on it and maidens cavorting in the glen. Pee in that, son.
I want to ask him what he's talking about for even if I'm bursting I feel strange peeing into a pot with roses and maidens cavorting, whatever they are. We had nothing like this in Classon Avenue where Mrs. Leibowitz sang in the lavatory while we clutched ourselves in the hall.
Now Malachy has to use the chamber pot but he wants to sit on it. Dad says, No, you can't do that, son. You have to go outside. When he says that I have to go, too, to sit. He leads us downstairs and through the big room where Grandpa is sitting reading by the fire and Grandma is dozing in her chair. It's dark outside, though the moon is bright enough for us to see where we're going. Dad opens the door of a little house that has a seat with a hole in it. He shows Malachy and me how to sit on the hole and how to wipe ourselves with squares of newspaper stuck on a nail. Then he tells us wait while he goes inside, closes the door and grunts. The moon is so bright I can look down the field and see the things called cows and sheep and I wonder why they don't go home.
In the house there are other people in the room with my grandparents. Dad says, These are your aunts: Emily, Nora, Maggie, Vera. Your aunt Eva is in Ballymena with children like you. My aunts are not like Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey, they nod their heads but they don't hug us or smile. Mam comes into the room with the twins and when
Dad tells his sisters, This is Angela and these are the twins, they just nod again.
Grandma goes to the kitchen and soon we have bread and sausages and tea. The only one who speaks at the table is Malachy. He points his spoon at the aunts and asks their names again. When Mam tells him eat his sausage and be quiet his eyes fill with tears and Aunt Nora reaches over to comfort him. She says, There, there, and I wonder why everyone says there there when Malachy cries. I wonder what there there means.
It's quiet at the table till Dad says, Things are terrible in America. Grandma says, Och, aye. I read it in the paper. But they say Mr. Roosevelt is a good man and if you stayed you might have work by now.
Dad shakes his head and Grandma says, I don't know what you're going to do, Malachy. Things are worse here than they are in America. No work here and, God knows, we don't have room in this house for six more people.
Dad says, I thought I might get work on some of the farms. We could get a small place.
Where would you stay in the meantime? says Grandma. And how would you support yourself and your family?
Och, I could go on the dole, I suppose.
You can't get off a ship from America and go on the dole, says Grandpa. They make you wait a while and what would you do while you're waiting?
Dad says nothing and Mam looks straight ahead at the wall.
You'd be better off in the Free State, says Grandma. Dublin is big and surely there's work there or in the farms around.
You're entitled to money from the IRA, too, says Grandpa. You did your bit and they've been handing out money to men all over the Free State. You could go to Dublin and ask for help. We can loan you the bus fare to Dublin. The twins can sit on your lap and you won't have to pay for them.
Dad says, Och, aye, and Mam stares at the wall with tears in her eyes.
After we ate we went back to bed and next morning, all the grown- ups sat around looking sad. Soon a man came in a motor car and took us back down the road to the shop which had our trunk. They lifted the trunk up on the roof of a bus and we got into the bus. Dad said we were going to Dublin. Malachy said, What's Dublin? but no one answered him. Dad held Eugene on his lap and Mam held Oliver. Dad looked out at the fields and told me this is where Cuchulain liked to go for a walk. I asked him where Cuchulain hit the ball into the dog's mouth and he said a few miles away.
Malachy said, Look, look, and we looked. It was a great silvery sheet of water and Dad said it was Lough Neagh, the largest lake in Ireland, the lake where Cuchulain used to swim after his great battles. Cuchulain would get so hot that when he jumped into Lough Neagh it boiled over and warmed the surrounding countryside for days. Some day we'd all come back and go swimming like Cuchulain himself. We'd fish for eels and fry them in a pan not like Cuchulain, who would pluck them from the lough and swallow them, wriggling, because there's great power in an eel.
Is that right, Dad?
'Tis.
Mam didn't look out the window at Lough Neagh. Her cheek rested on
top of Oliver's head and she stared at the floor of the bus.
Soon the bus is rolling into a place where there are big houses, motor cars, horses pulling carts, people on bicycles and hundreds walking. Malachy is excited. Dad, Dad, where's the playground, the swings? I want to see Freddie Leibowitz.
Och, son, you're in Dublin now, far from Classon Avenue. You're in Ireland, a long way from New York.
When the bus stops the trunk is lifted down and set on the floor of the bus station. Dad tells Mam she can sit on a bench in the station while he goes to see the IRA man in a place called Terenure. He says there are lavatories in the station for the boys, he won't be long, he'll have money when he returns and we'll all have food. He tells me go with him and Mam says, No, I need him to help. But when Dad says, I'll need help carrying all that money, she laughs and says, All right, go with your Pop.
Your Pop. That means she's in a good mood. If she says your father it means she's in a bad mood.
Dad holds my hand as I trot along beside him. He's a fast walker, it's a long way to Terenure and I'm hoping he'll stop and carry me the way he did with the twins in Toome. But he lopes along and says nothing except to ask people where Terenure is. In awhile he says we're in Terenure and now we have to find Mr. Charles Heggarty of the IRA. A man with a pink patch on his eye tells us we're on the right street, Charlie Heggarty lives at number fourteen, God blast him. The man tells Dad, I can see you're a man that did his bit. Dad says, Och, I did my bit, and the man says, I did me bit, too, and what did it get me but one eye less and a pension that wouldn't feed a canary.
But Ireland is free, says Dad, and that's a grand thing.
Free, my arse, the man says. I think we were better off under the English. Good luck to you anyway, mister, for I think I know what you're here for.
A woman opens the door at number fourteen. I'm afraid, she says, that Mr. Heggarty is busy. Dad tells her he just walked all the way from the middle of Dublin with his small son, that he left wife and three children waiting for him at the bus place, and if Mr. Heggarty is that busy then we'll wait for him on the doorstep.
The woman is back in a minute to say Mr. Heggarty has a little time to spare and would you come this way. Mr. Heggarty is sitting at a desk near a glowing fire. He says, What can I do for you? Dad stands before the desk and says, I have just returned from America with wife and four children. We have nothing. I fought with a Flying Column during the Troubles and I'm hoping you can help me now in the time of need.
Mr. Heggarty takes Dad's name and turns the pages of a big book on his desk. He shakes his head, No, no record of your service here. Dad makes a long speech. He tells Mr. Heggarty how he fought, where, when, how he had to be smuggled out of Ireland because of the price on his head, how he was raising his sons to love Ireland.
Mr. Heggarty says he's sorry but he can't be handing out money to every man who wanders in claiming he did his bit. Dad says to me, Remember this, Francis. This is the new Ireland. Little men in little chairs with little bits of paper. This is the Ireland men died for. Mr. Heggarty says he'll look into Dad's claim and he'll be sure to let him know what turns up. He'll let us have money to take the bus back into the city. Dad looks at the coins in Mr. Heggarty's hand and says, You could add to that and make the price of a pint.
Oh, it's the drink you want, is it?
One pint is hardly drink.
You'd walk the miles back and make the boy walk because you want a
pint, wouldn't you?
Walking never killed anyone.
I want you to leave this house, says Mr. Heggarty, or I'll call a
guard, and you can be sure you'll never hear from me again. We're not handing out money to support the Guinness family.
Night falls along the streets of Dublin. Children laugh and play under streetlights, mothers call from doorways, smells of cooking come at us all the way, through windows we see people around tables, eating. I'm tired and hungry and I want Dad to carry me but I know there's no use asking him now the way his face is tight and set. I let him hold my hand and I run to keep up with him till we reach the bus place where Mam is waiting with my brothers.
They're all asleep on the bench, my mother and three brothers. When Dad tells Mam there's no money she shakes her head and sobs, Oh, Jesus, what are we going to do? A man in a blue uniform comes over and asks her, What's up, missus? Dad tells him we're stranded there at the bus station, we have no money and no place to stay and the children are hungry. The man says he's going off duty now, he'll take us to the police barracks where he has to report anyway, and they'll see what can be done.
The man in uniform tells us we can call him guard. That's what you call policemen in Ireland. He asks us what you call policemen in America and Malachy says, cop. The guard pats him on the head and tells him he's a clever little Yankee.
At the police barracks the sergeant tells us we can spend the night. He's sorry but all he can offer is the floor. It's Thursday and the cells are filled with men who drank their dole money and wouldn't leave the pubs.
The guards give us hot sweet tea and thick slices of bread slathered with butter and jam and we're so happy we run around the barracks, playing. The guards say we're a great bunch of little Yanks and they'd like to take us home but I say, No, Malachy says, No, the twins say, No, No, and all the guards laugh. Men in cells reach out and pat our heads, they smell like Dad when he comes home singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley going to die. The men say, Jasus, will ye listen to them. They sound like bloody fillum stars. Did yez fall outa the sky or what? Women in cells at the other end tell Malachy he's gorgeous and the twins are dotes. One woman talks to me. C'mere, love, would you like a sweet? I nod, and she says, All right, put your hand out. She takes something sticky from her mouth and puts it on my hand. There you are now, she says, a nice bit of butterscotch. Put that in your mouth. I don't want to put it in my mouth because it's sticky and wet from her mouth but I don't know what you're supposed to do when a woman in a cell offers you sticky butterscotch and I'm about to put it in my mouth when a guard comes, takes the butterscotch and throws it back at the woman. You drunken hoor, he says, leave the child alone, and all the women laugh.
The sergeant gives my mother a blanket and she sleeps stretched out on a bench. The rest of us lie on the floor. Dad sits with his back to the wall, his eyes open under the peak of his cap, and he smokes when the guards give him cigarettes. The guard who threw the butterscotch at the woman says he's from Ballymena in the north and he talks with Dad about people they know there and in other places like Cushendall and Toome. The
guard says he'll have a pension some day and he'll live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away. Eels, he says, eels galore. Jasus, I love a fried eel. I ask Dad, Is this Cuchulain? and the guard laughs till his face turns red. Ah, Mother o' God, did yez hear this? The lad wants to know if I'm Cuchulain. A little Yank and he knows all about Cuchulain.
Dad says, No, he's not Cuchulain but he's a fine man who will live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away.
****
Dad is shaking me. Up, Francis, up. It is noisy in the barracks. A boy mopping the floor is singing, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this, Could it be true, someone like you Could love me, love me?
I tell him that's my mother's song and he's to stop singing it but he just puffs on his cigarette and walks away and I wonder why people have to sing other people's songs. Men and women coming out of the cells are yawning and grunting. The woman who offered me the butterscotch stops and says, I had a drop taken, child. I'm sorry I made a fool of you, but the guard from Ballymena tells her, Move on, you oul' hoor, before I lock you up again.
Oh, lock me up, she says. In, out. What does it matter, you blue arsed bastard.
Mam is sitting up on the bench, the blanket wrapped around her. A woman with gray hair brings her a mug of tea and tells her, Sure, I'm the sergeant's wife and he said you might need help. Would you like a nice soft-boiled egg, missus?
Mam shakes her head, no.
Ah, now, missus, surely you should have a nice egg in your condition.
But Mam shakes her head and I wonder how she can say no to a soft- boiled egg when there's nothing in the world like it.
All right, ma'am, says the sergeant's wife, a bit of toast, then, and something for the children and your poor husband.
She goes back to another room and soon there's tea and bread. Dad drinks his tea but gives us his bread and Mam says, Will you eat your bread, for God's sake. You won't be much use to us falling down with the hunger. He shakes his head and asks the sergeant's wife is there any chance of a cigarette. She brings him the cigarette and tells Mam the guards in the barracks have taken up a collection to pay our train fares to Limerick. There will be a motor car to pick up our trunk and leave us at Kingsbridge Railway Station and, You'll be in Limerick in three or four hours.
Mam puts up her arms and hugs the sergeant's wife. God bless you and your husband and all the guards, Mam says. I don't know what we'd do without you. God knows 'tis a lovely thing to be back among our own.
'Tis the least we could do, says the sergeant's wife. These are lovely children you have and I'm from Cork meself and I know what 'tis to be in Dublin without two pennies to rub together.
Dad sits at the other end of the bench, smoking his cigarette, drinking his tea. He stays that way till the motor car comes to take us through the streets of Dublin. Dad asks the driver if he'd mind going by way of the G. P. O. and the driver says, Is it a stamp you want or what? No, says Dad. I hear they put up a new statue of Cuchulain to honor the men who died in 1916 and I'd like to show it to my son here who has a great admiration for Cuchulain.
The driver says he has no notion of who this Cuchulain was but he wouldn't mind stopping one bit. He might come in himself and see what the commotion is all about for he hasn't been in the G. P. O. since he was a boy and the English nearly wrecked it with their big guns firing up from the Liffey River. He says you'll see the bullet holes all over the front and they should be left there to remind the Irish of English perfidy. I ask the man what's perfidy and he says ask your father and I would but we're stopping outside a big building with columns and that's the G. P. O.
Mam stays in the motor car while we follow the driver into the G. P. O. There he is, he says, there's your man Cuchulain.
And I feel tears coming because I'm looking at him at last, Cuchulain, there on his pedestal in the G. P. O. He's golden and he has long hair, his head is hanging and there's a big bird perched on his shoulder.
The driver says, Now what in God's name is this all about? What's this fellow doin' with the long hair and the bird on his shoulder? And will you kindly tell me, mister, what this has to do with the men of 1916?
Dad says, Cuchulain fought to the end like the men of Easter Week. His enemies were afraid to go near him till they were sure he was dead and when the bird landed on him and drank his blood they knew.
Well, says the driver, 'tis a sad day for the men of Ireland when they need a bird to tell them a man is dead. I think we better go now or we'll be missing that train to Limerick.
The sergeant's wife said she'd send a telegram to Grandma to meet us in Limerick and there she was on the platform, Grandma, with white hair, sour eyes, a black shawl, and no smile for my mother or any of us, even my brother, Malachy, who had the big smile and the sweet white teeth. Mam pointed to Dad. This is Malachy, she said, and Grandma nodded and looked away. She called two boys who were hanging around the railway station and paid them to carry the trunk. The boys had shaved heads, snotty noses, and no shoes and we followed them through the streets of Limerick. I asked Mam why they had no hair and she said their heads were shaved so that the lice would have no place to hide. Malachy said, What's a lice? and Mam said, Not lice. One of them is a louse. Grandma said, Will ye stop it! What kind o' talk is this? The boys whistled and laughed and trotted along as if they had shoes and Grandma told them, Stop that laughin' or 'tis droppin' an' breakin' that trunk ye'll be. They stopped the whistling and laughing and we followed them into a park with a tall pillar and a statue in the middle and grass so green it dazzled you.
Dad carried the twins, Mam carried a bag in one hand and held Malachy's hand with the other. When she stopped every few minutes to catch her breath, Grandma said, Are you still smokin' them fags? Them fags will be the death of you. There's enough consumption in Limerick without people smokin' fags on top of it an'
'tis a rich man's foolishness.
Along the path through the park there were hundreds of flowers of different colors that excited the twins. They pointed and made squeaky noises and we laughed, everyone except Grandma, who pulled her shawl over her head. Dad stopped and put the twins down so that they could be closer to the flowers. He said, Flowers, and they ran back and forth, pointing, trying to say Flowers. One of the boys with the trunk said, God, are they Americans? and Mam said, They are. They were born in New York. All the
boys were born in New York. The boy said to the other boy, God, they're Americans. They put the trunk down and stared at us and we stared back at them till Grandma said, Are ye goin' to stand here all day lookin' at flowers an' gawkin' at each other? And we all moved on again, out of the park, down a narrow lane and into another lane to Grandma's house.
There is a row of small houses on each side of the lane and Grandma lives in one of the small houses. Her kitchen has a shiny polished black iron range with a fire glowing in the grate. There is a table along the wall under the window and a press opposite with cups and saucers and vases. This press is always locked and she keeps the key in her purse because you're not supposed to use anything in there unless someone dies or returns from foreign parts or there's a visit by a priest.
There is a picture on the wall by the range of a man with long brown hair and sad eyes. He is pointing to his chest where there is a big heart with flames coming out of it. Mam tells us, That's the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and I want to know why the man's heart is on fire and why doesn't He throw water on it? Grandma says, Don't these children know anything about their religion? and Mam tells her it's different in America. Grandma says the Sacred Heart is everywhere and there's no excuse for that kind of ignorance.
Under the picture of the man with the burning heart there is a shelf with a red glass holding a flickering candle and next to it a small statue. Mam tells us, That's the Baby Jesus, the Infant of Prague, and if ye ever need anything pray to Him.
Malachy says, Mam, could I tell Him I'm hungry, and Mam puts her finger to her lips.
Grandma grumbles around the kitchen making tea and telling Mam to cut the loaf of bread and don't make the cuts too thick. Mam sits by the table with her breath coming hard and says she'll cut the bread in a minute. Dad takes the knife and starts slicing the bread and you can see Grandma doesn't like that. She frowns at him but says nothing even though he makes thick slices.
There aren't enough chairs for everyone so I sit on the stairs with my brothers to have bread and tea. Dad and Mam sit at the table and Grandma sits under the Sacred Heart with her mug of tea. She says, I don't know under God what I'm goin' to do with ye. There is no room in this house. There isn't room for even one of ye.
Malachy says, Ye, ye, and starts to giggle and I say, Ye, ye, and the twins say, Ye, ye, and we're laughing so hard we can hardly eat our bread.
Grandma glares at us. What are ye laughin' at? There's nothin' to laugh at in this house. Ye better behave yeerselves before I go over to
ye.
She won't stop saying Ye, and now Malachy is helpless with
laughter, spewing out his bread and tea, his face turning red.
Dad says, Malachy and the rest of you, stop it. But Malachy can't, he goes on laughing till Dad says, Come over here. He rolls up Malachy's
sleeve and raises his hand to slap his arm.
Are you going to behave yourself?
Malachy's eyes fill with tears and he nods, I will, because Dad
never raised his hand like that before. Dad says, Be a good boy and go sit with your brothers, and he pulls down the sleeve and pats Malachy on the head.
That night Mam's sister, Aunt Aggie, came home from her job in the clothing factory. She was big like the MacNamara sisters, and she had flaming red hair. She wheeled a large bicycle into the little room behind the kitchen and came out to her supper. She was living in Grandma's because she had a fight with her husband, Pa Keating, who told her, when he had drink taken, You're a great fat cow, go home to your mother. That's what Grandma told Mam and that's why there was no room for us in Grandma's house. She had herself, Aunt Aggie, and her son Pat, who was my uncle and who was out selling newspapers.
Aunt Aggie complained when Grandma told her Mam would have to sleep with her that night. Grandma said, Oh, will you shut your gob. 'Tis only for one night an' that won't kill you an' if you don't like it you can go back to your husband where you belong anyway instead of runnin' home to me. Jesus, Mary an' Holy St. Joseph, look at this house- you an' Pat an' Angela and her clatther of Americans. Will I have any peace in the latter end of my life?
She spread coats and rags on the floor of the little back room and we slept there with the bicycle. Dad stayed on a chair in the kitchen, took us to the lavatory in the backyard when we needed it, and in the night hushed the twins when they cried from the cold.
In the morning, Aunt Aggie came for her bicycle telling us, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of my way?
When she left, Malachy kept saying, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of the way, will ye? and I could hear Dad laughing out in the kitchen till Grandma came down the stairs and he had to tell Malachy be quiet.
That day Grandma and Mam went out and found a furnished room on Windmill Street where Aunt Aggie had a flat with her husband, Pa Keating. Grandma paid the rent, ten shillings for two weeks. She gave Mam money for food, loaned us a kettle, a pot, a frying pan, knives and spoons, jam jars to be used for mugs, a blanket and a pillow. She said that was all she could afford anymore, that Dad would have to get up off his arse, get a job, go on the dole, go for the charity at the St. Vincent de Paul Society or go on the relief.
The room had a fireplace where we could boil water for our tea or an egg in case we ever came into money. We had a table and three chairs and a bed, which Mam said was the biggest she had ever seen. We were glad of the bed that night, worn out after nights on floors in Dublin and in Grandma's. It didn't matter that there were six of us in the bed, we were together, away from grandmothers and guards, Malachy could say ye ye ye and we could laugh as much as we liked.
Dad and Mam lay at the head of the bed, Malachy and I at the bottom, the twins wherever they could find comfort. Malachy made us laugh again. Ye, ye, ye, he said, and oy oy oy, and then fell asleep. Mam made the little hink hink snore sound that told us she was sleeping. In the moonlight I could look up the length of the bed and see Dad still awake and when Oliver cried in his sleep Dad reached for him and held him. Whisht, he said. Whisht.
Then Eugene sat up, screaming, tearing at himself. Ah, ah, Mommy, Mommy. Dad sat up. What? What's up, son? Eugene went on crying and when Dad leaped from the bed and turned on the gaslight we saw the fleas, leaping, jumping, fastened to our flesh. We slapped at them and slapped but they hopped from body to body, hopping, biting. We tore at the bites till they bled. We jumped from the bed, the twins crying, Mam moaning,
Oh, Jesus, will we have no rest! Dad poured water and salt into a jam jar and dabbed at our bites. The salt burned but he said we'd feel better
soon.
Mam sat by the fireplace with the twins on her lap. Dad pulled on
his trousers and dragged the mattress off the bed and out to the street. He filled the kettle and the pot with water, stood the mattress against the wall, pounded it with a shoe, told me to keep pouring water on the ground to drown the fleas dropping there. The Limerick moon was so bright I could see bits of it shimmering in the water and I wanted to scoop up moon bits but how could I with the fleas leaping on my legs. Dad kept pounding with the shoe and I had to run back through the house to the backyard tap for more water in the kettle and the pot. Mam said, Look at you. Your shoes are drenched and you'll catch your death and your father will surely get the pneumonia without a shoe to his foot.
A man on a bicycle stopped and wanted to know why Dad was beating that mattress. Mother o' God, he said, I never heard such a cure for fleas. Do you know that if a man could jump like a flea one lep would take him halfway to the moon? The thing to do is this, when you go back inside with that mattress stick it on the bed upside down and that will confuse the little buggers. They won't know where they are and they'll be biting the mattress or each other, which is the best cure of all. After they bite the human being they have the frenzy, you know, for there are other fleas around them that also bit the human being and the smell of the blood is too much for them and they go out of their minds. They're a right bloody torment an' I should know for didn't I grow up in Limerick, down in the Irishtown, an' the fleas there were so plentiful an' forward they'd sit on the toe of your boot an' discuss Ireland's woeful history with you. It is said there were no fleas in ancient Ireland, that they were brought in be the English to drive us out of our wits entirely, an'I wouldn't put it past the English. An'isn't it a very curious thing that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland an' the English brought in the fleas. For centuries Ireland was a lovely peaceful place, snakes gone, not a flea to be found. You could stroll the four green fields of Ireland without fear of snakes an' have a good night's sleep with no fleas to bother you. Them snakes were doin' no harm, they wouldn't bother you unless you cornered them an' they lived off other creatures that move under bushes an'such places, whereas the flea sucks the blood from you mornin' noon an' night for that's his nature an' he can't help himself. I hear for a fact that places that have snakes galore have no fleas. Arizona, for instance. You're forever hearing about the snakes of Arizona but when did you ever hear of fleas in Arizona? Good luck to you. I have to be careful standin' here for if one of them gets on my clothes I might as well invite his whole family home. They multiply faster than Hindus.
Dad said, You wouldn't by any chance have a cigarette, would you?
A cigarette? Oh, sure, of course. Here you are. Aren't I nearly destroyed from the fags myself. The oul' hacking cough, you know. So powerful it nearly knocks me off the bicycle. I can feel that cough stirring in me solar plexus an' workin' its way up through me entrails till the next thing it takes off the top o' me head.
He struck a match on a box, lit a cigarette for himself and held out the match for Dad. Of course, he said, you're bound to have the cough when you live in Limerick because this is the capital city of the weak chest and the weak chest leads to the consumption. If all the people that has consumption in Limerick were to die this would be a ghost town,
though I don't have consumption meself. No, this cough was a present from the Germans. He paused, puffed on his cigarette, and struggled with a cough. Bejesus, excuse the language, but the fags'll get me in the end. Well, I'll leave you now to the mattress an' remember what I told you, confuse the little buggers.
He wobbled away on his bicycle, the cigarette dangling from his mouth, the cough racking his body. Dad said, Limerickmen talk too much. Come on, we'll put this mattress back and see if there's any sleep in this night.
Mam sat by the fireplace with the twins asleep on her lap, and Malachy lay curled up on the floor by her feet. She said, Who was that you were talking to? It sounded very like Pa Keating, Aggie's husband. I could tell by the cough. He got that cough in France in the war when he swallowed the gas.
We slept the rest of that night, and in the morning we saw where the fleas had feasted, our flesh pink with flea welts and bright with the blood of our scratches.
Mam made tea and fried bread, and once more Dad dabbed at our bites with the salty water. He hauled the mattress outside again to the backyard. On a cold day like this the fleas would surely freeze to death and we'd all have a good night's sleep.
A few days later when we're settled into the room Dad is shaking me out of my dreams. Up, Francis, up. Put on your clothes and run over for your aunt Aggie. Your mother needs her. Hurry.
Mam is moaning in the bed, her face pure white. Dad has Malachy and the twins out of the bed and sitting on the floor by the dead fire. I run across the street and knock on Aunt Aggie's door till Uncle Pat Keating comes coughing and grumbling, What's up? What's up?
My mother is moaning in the bed. I think she's sick.
Now Aunt Aggie comes grumbling. Ye are nothing but trouble since ye came from America.
Leave him alone, Aggie, he's only a child that's doing what he's told.
She tells Uncle Pa go back to bed, that he has to go to work in the morning not like some from the North that she won't mention. He says, No, no, I'm coming. There's something wrong with Angela.
Dad tells me sit over there with my brothers. I don't know what's up with Mam because everyone is whispering and I can barely hear Aunt
Aggie
Pa is
about
never looks at him.
telling Uncle Pa the child is lost run for the ambulance and Uncle out the door, Aunt Aggie telling Mam you can say what you like Limerick but the ambulance is fast. She doesn't talk to my father,
Malachy says, Dad, is Mammy sick?
Och, she'll be all right, son. She has to see the doctor.
I wonder what child is lost because we're all here, one two three
four of us, not a lost child anywhere and why can't they tell me what's wrong with my mother. Uncle Pa comes back and the ambulance is right behind him. A man comes in with a stretcher and after they carry Mam away there are blood spots on the floor by the bed. Malachy bit his tongue and there was blood and the dog on the street had blood and he died. I want to ask Dad to tell me if Mam will be gone forever like my sister Margaret but he's going with Mam and there's no use asking Aunt Aggie anything for fear she'd bite your head off. She wipes away the blood spots and tells us get back into bed and stay there till Dad comes home.
It's the middle of the night and the four of us are warm in the bed and we fall asleep till Dad comes home and tells us Mam is nice and comfortable in the hospital and she'll be home in no time.
Later, Dad goes to the Labour Exchange for the dole. There is no hope of a laboring man with a North of Ireland accent getting a job in Limerick.
When he returns, he tells Mam we'll be getting nineteen shillings a week. She says that's just enough for all of us to starve on. Nineteen shillings for six of us? That's less than four dollars in American money and how are we supposed to live on that? What are we to do when we have to pay rent in a fortnight? If the rent for this room is five shillings a week we'll have fourteen shillings for food and clothes and coal to boil the water for the tea.
Dad shakes his head, sips his tea from a jam jar, stares out the window and whistles ""The Boys of Wexford. "" Malachy and Oliver clap their hands and dance around the room and Dad doesn't know whether to whistle or smile because you can't do both and he can't help himself. He has to stop and smile and pat Oliver's head and then go back to the whistling. Mam smiles, too, but it's a very quick smile and when she looks into the ashes you can see the worry where the corners of her mouth turn down.
Next day she tells Dad to mind the twins and takes Malachy and me with her to the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We stand in a queue with women wearing black shawls. They ask our names and smile when we talk. They say, Lord above, would you listen to the little Yankees, and they wonder why Mam in her American coat would be looking for charity since there's hardly enough for the poor people of Limerick without Yanks coming over and taking the bread out of their mouths.
Mam tells them a cousin gave her that coat in Brooklyn, that her husband has no work, that she has other children at home, twin boys. The women sniff and pull their shawls about them, they have their own troubles. Mam tells them she had to leave America because she couldn't stand it after her baby girl died. The women sniff again but now it's because Mam is crying. Some say they lost little ones, too, and there's nothing worse in the world, you could live as long as Methuselem's wife but you never get over it. No man can ever know what it is to be a mother that has lost a child, not if the man lived longer than two Methuselems.
They all have a good cry till a red-haired woman passes a little box around. The women pick something from the box between their fingers and stuff it up their noses. A young woman sneezes and the red-haired woman laughs. Ah, sure, Biddy, you're not able for that snuff. Come here, little Yankee boys, have a pinch. She plants the brown stuff in our nostrils and we sneeze so hard the women stop crying and laugh till they have to wipe their eyes with their shawls. Mam tells us, That's good for ye, 'twill clear yeer heads.
The young woman, Biddy, tells Mam we're two lovely boys. She points at Malachy. That little fella with the goldy ringlet, isn't he gorgeous? He could be a film star with Shirley Temple. And Malachy smiles and warms up the queue.
The woman with the snuff says to Mam, Missus, I don't want to be forward but I think you should be sitting down for we heard about your
loss.
Another woman worries, Ah, no, they don't like that. Who don't like what?
Ah, sure, Nora Molloy, the Society don't like us sittin' on the steps. They want us to be standin' respectful against the wall.
They can kiss my arse, says Nora, the red-haired woman. Sit down there, missus, on that step an' I'll sit next to you an' if there's one word out of the St. Vincent de Paul Society I'll take the face off 'em, so I will. Do you smoke, missus?
I do, says Mam, but I don't have them.
Nora takes a cigarette from a pocket in her apron, breaks it, and offers half to Mam.
The worried woman says, They don't like that either. They say every fag you smoke is taking food from the mouth of your child. Mr. Quinlivan inside is dead against it. He says if you have money for the fags you have money for food.
Quinlivan can kiss my arse, too, the grinny oul' bastard. Is he going to begrudge us a puff of a fag, the only comfort we have in the world?
A door opens at the end of the hall and a man appears. Are any of ye waiting for children's boots?
Women raise their hands, I am. I am.
Well, the boots are all gone. Ye'll have to come back next month. But my Mikey needs boots for school.
They're all gone, I told you.
But 'tis freezin' abroad, Mr. Quinlivan.
The boots are all gone. Nothing I can do. What's this? Who's
smoking?
Nora waves her cigarette. I am, she says, and enjoying it down to
the last ash.
Every puff you take, he starts.
I know, she says, I'm taking food out of the mouths of my children. You're insolent, woman. You'll get no charity here.
Is that a fact? Well, Mr. Quinlivan, if I don't get it here I know
where I will.
What are you talking about?
I'll go to the Quakers. They'll give me the charity.
Mr. Quinlivan steps toward Nora and points a finger. Do you know
what we have here? We have a souper in our midst. We had the soupers in the Famine. The Protestants went round telling good Catholics that if they gave up their faith and turned Protestant they'd get more soup than their bellies could hold and, God help us, some Catholics took the soup, and were ever after known as soupers and lost their immortal souls doomed to the deepest part of hell. And you, woman, if you go to the Quakers you'll lose your immortal soul and the souls of your children.
other
Then, Mr. Quinlivan, you'll have to save us, won't you?
He stares at her and she stares back at him. His eyes wander to the
women. One puts her hand to her mouth to smother a laugh.
What are you tittering about? he barks.
Oh, nothing, Mr. Quinlivan. Honest to God.
I'm telling ye once more, no boots. And he slams the door behind
him.
One by one the women are called into the room. When Nora comes out
she's smiling and waving a piece of paper. Boots, she says. Three pairs I'm gettin' for my children. Threaten the men in there with the Quakers and they'll give you the drawers off their arses.
When Mam is called she brings Malachy and me in with her. We stand before a table where three men are sitting asking questions. Mr. Quinlivan starts to say something but the man in the middle says, Enough out of you, Quinlivan. If we left it up to you we'd have the poor people of Limerick jumping into the arms of the Protestants.
He turns to Mam, he wants to know where she got that fine red coat. She tells him what she told the women outside and when she comes to the death of Margaret she shakes and sobs. She tells the men she's very sorry for crying like that but it was only a few months ago and she's not over it yet, not even knowing where her baby was buried if she was buried at all, not knowing even if she was baptized itself because she was so weak from having the four boys she didn't have the energy to be going to the church for the baptism and it's a heart scald to think Margaret might be in Limbo forever with no hope of her ever seeing the rest of us whether we're in heaven, hell, or Purgatory itself.
Mr. Quinlivan brings her his chair. Ah, now, missus. Ah, now. Sit down, will you. Ah, now.
The other men look at the table, the ceiling. The man in the middle says he's giving Mam a docket to get a week's groceries at McGrath's shop on Parnell Street. There will be tea, sugar, flour, milk, butter and a separate docket for a bag of coal from Sutton's coal yard on the Dock Road.
The third man says, Of course you won't be getting this every week, missus. We will be visiting your house to see if there's a real need. We have to do that, missus, so we can review your claim.
Mam wipes her face on the back of her sleeve and takes the docket. She tells the men, God bless you for your kindness. They nod and look at the table, the ceiling, the walls and tell her send in the next woman.
The women outside tell Mam, When you go to McGrath's, keep an eye on the oul' bitch for she'll cheat you on the weight. She'll put stuff on a paper on the scale with the paper hanging down on her side behind the counter where she thinks you can't see it. She'll pull on that paper so that you're lucky if you get half of what you're supposed to get. And she has pictures of the Virgin Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus all over the shop, and she's forever on her knees abroad in St. Joseph's chapel clackin' her rosary beads an' breathing like a virgin martyr, the oul' bitch.
Nora says, I'll go with you, missus. I'm on to the same Mrs. McGrath and I'll know if she's cheating you.
She leads the way to the shop in Parnell Street. The woman behind the counter is pleasant to Mam in her American coat till Mam shows the St. Vincent de Paul docket. The woman says, I don't know what you're doing here at this hour of the day. I never serve the charity cases before six in the evening. But this is your first time and I'll make an exception.
She says to Nora, Do you have a docket, too?
No. I'm a friend helping this poor family with their first docket from the St. Vincent de Paul.
The woman lays a sheet of newspaper on the scale and pours on flour from a large bag. When she finishes pouring, she says, There's a pound of flour.
I don't think so, says Nora. That's a very small pound of flour. The woman flushes and glares, Are you accusin' me?
Ah, no, Mrs. McGrath, says Nora. I think there was a little accident there the way your hip was pressed against that paper and you didn't even know the paper was pulled down a bit. Oh, God, no. A woman like you that's forever on her knees before the Virgin Mary is an inspiration to us all and is that your money I see on the floor there?
Mrs. McGrath steps back quickly and the needle on the scale jumps and quivers. What money? she says, till she looks at Nora, and knows. Nora smiles. Must be a trick of the shadows, she says, and smiles at the scale. There was a mistake right enough for that shows barely half a pound of flour.
That scale gives me more trouble, says Mrs. McGrath.
I'm sure it does, says Nora.
But my conscience is clear before God, says Mrs. McGrath.
I'm sure it is, says Nora, and you're admired by one and all at the
St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Legion of Mary.
I try to be a good Catholic.
Try? God knows 'tis little trying you'd have for you're well known
for having a kind heart and I was wondering if you could spare a couple of sweets for the little boys here.
Well, now, I'm not a millionaire, but here...
God bless you, Mrs. McGrath, and I know it's asking a lot but could you possibly lend me a couple of cigarettes?
Well, now, they're not on the docket. I'm not here to supply luxuries.
If you could see your way, missus, I'd be sure to mention your kindness to the St. Vincent de Paul.
All right, all right, says Mrs. McGrath. Here. One time for the cigarettes and one time only.
God bless you, says Nora, and I'm sorry you had so much trouble with that scale.
On the way home we stopped in the People's Park and sat on a bench while Malachy and I sucked on our sweets and Mam and Nora smoked their cigarettes. The smoking brought on Nora's cough and she told Mam the fags would kill her in the end, that there was a touch of consumption in her family and no one lived to a ripe old age, though who would want to in Limerick, a place where you could look around and the first thing you noticed was a scarcity of gray hairs, all the gray hairs either in the graveyard or across the Atlantic working on railroads or sauntering around in police uniforms.
You're lucky, missus, that you saw a bit of the world. Oh, God, I'd give anything to see New York, people dancing up and down Broadway without a care. No, I had to go and fall for a boozer with the charm, Peter Molloy, a champion pint drinker that had me up the pole and up the aisle when I was barely seventeen. I was ignorant, missus. We grew up ignorant in Limerick, so we did, knowing feck all about anything and signs on, we're mothers before we're women. And there's nothing here but rain and oul' biddies saying the rosary. I'd give me teeth to get out, go to America or even England itself. The champion pint drinker is always on the dole and sometimes he even drinks that and drives me so demented I wind up in the lunatic asylum.
She drew on her cigarette and gagged, coughing till her body rocked back and forth, and in between the coughs she whimpered, Jesus, Jesus. When the cough died away she said she had to go home and take her medicine. She said, I'll see you next week, missus, at the St. Vincent de
Paul. If you're stuck for anything send a message to me at Vize's Field. Ask anyone for the wife of Peter Molloy, champion pint drinker.
Eugene is sleeping under a coat on the bed. Dad sits by the fireplace with Oliver on his lap. I wonder why Dad is telling Oliver a Cuchulain story. He knows the Cuchulain stories are mine, but when I look at Oliver I don't mind. His cheeks are bright red, he's staring into the dead fire, and you can see he has no interest in Cuchulain. Mam puts her hand on his forehead. I think he has a fever, she says. I wish I had an onion and I'd boil it in milk and pepper. That's good for the fever. But even if I had what would I boil the milk on? We need coal for that fire.
She gives Dad the docket for the coal down the Dock Road. He takes me with him but it's dark and all the coal yards are closed.
What are we going to do now, Dad?
I don't know, son.
Ahead of us women in shawls and small children are picking up coal
along the road.
There, Dad, there's coal.
Och, no, son. We won't pick coal off the road. We're not beggars. He tells Mam the coal yards are closed and we'll have to drink milk
and eat bread tonight, but when I tell her about the women on the road she passes Eugene to him.
If you're too grand to pick coal off the road I'll put on my coat and go down the Dock Road.
She gets a bag and takes Malachy and me with her. Beyond the Dock Road there is something wide and dark with lights glinting in it. Mam says that's the River Shannon. She says that's what she missed most of all in America, the River Shannon. The Hudson was lovely but the Shannon sings. I can't hear the song but my mother does and that makes her happy. The other women are gone from the Dock Road and we search for the bits of coal that drop from lorries. Mam tells us gather anything that burns, coal, wood, cardboard, paper. She says, There are them that burn the horse droppings but we're not gone that low yet. When her bag is nearly full she says, Now we have to find an onion for Oliver. Malachy says he'll find one but she tells him, No, you don't find onions on the road, you get them in shops.
The minute he sees a shop he cries out, There's a shop, and runs
in.
Oonyen, he says. Oonyen for Oliver.
Mam runs into the shop and tells the women behind the counter, I'm
sorry. The woman says, Lord, he's a dote. Is he an American or what? Mam says he is. The woman smiles and shows two teeth, one on each
side of her upper gum. A dote, she says, and look at them gorgeous goldy curls. And what is it he wants now? A sweet?
Ah, no, says Mam. An onion.
The woman laughs, An onion? I never heard a child wanting an onion before. Is that what they like in America?
Mam says, I just mentioned I wanted to get an onion for my other child that's sick. Boil the onion in milk, you know.
True for you, missus. You can't beat the onion boiled in milk. And look, little boy, here's a sweet for yourself and one for the other little boy, the brother, I suppose.
Mam says, Ah, sure, you shouldn't. Say thank you, boys.
The woman says, Here's a nice onion for the sick child, missus.
Mam says, Oh, I can't buy the onion now, missus. I don't have a penny on me.
I'm giving you the onion, missus. Let it never be said a child went sick in Limerick for want of an onion. And don't forget to sprinkle in a little pepper. Do you have pepper, missus?
Ah, no, I don't but I should be getting it any day now.
Well, here, missus. Pepper and a little salt. Do the child all the good in the world.
Mam says, God bless you, ma'am, and her eyes are watery.
Dad is walking back and forth with Oliver in his arms and Eugene is playing on the floor with a pot and a spoon. Dad says, Did you get the onion?
I did, says Mam, and more. I got coal and the way of lighting it. I knew you would. I said a prayer to St. Jude. He's my favorite saint, patron of desperate cases.
I got the coal. I got the onion, no help from St. Jude.
Dad says, You shouldn't be picking up coal off the road like a common beggar. It isn't right. Bad example for the boys.
Then you should have sent St. Jude down the Dock Road.
Malachy says, I'm hungry, and I'm hungry, too, but Mam says, Ye'll wait till Oliver has his onion boiled in milk.
She gets the fire going, cuts the onion in half, drops it in the boiling milk with a little butter and sprinkles the milk with pepper. She takes Oliver on her lap and tries to feed him but he turns away and looks into the fire.
Ah, come on, love, she says. Good for you. Make you big and strong.
He tightens his mouth against the spoon. She puts the pot down, rocks him till he's asleep, lays him on the bed and tells the rest of us be quiet or she'll demolish us. She slices the other half of the onion and fries it in butter with slices of bread. She lets us sit on the floor around the fire where we eat the fried bread and sip at the scalding sweet tea in jam jars. She says, That fire is good and bright so we can turn off that gaslight till we get money for the meter.
The fire makes the room warm and with the flames dancing in the coal you can see faces and mountains and valleys and animals leaping. Eugene falls asleep on the floor and Dad lifts him to the bed beside Oliver. Mam puts the boiled onion pot up on the mantelpiece for fear a mouse or rat might be at it. She says she's tired out from the day, the Vincent de Paul Society, Mrs. McGrath's shop, the search for coal down the Dock Road, the worry over Oliver not wanting the boiled onion, and if he's like this tomorrow she's taking him to the doctor, and now she's going to bed.
Soon we're all in bed and if there's the odd flea I don't mind because it's warm in the bed with the six of us and I love the glow of the fire the way it dances on the walls and ceiling and makes the room go red and black, red and black, till it dims to white and black and all you can hear is a little cry from Oliver turning in my mother's arms.
In the morning Dad is lighting the fire, making tea, cutting the bread. He's already dressed and he's telling Mam hurry up and get dressed. He says to me, Francis, your little brother Oliver is sick and we're taking him to the hospital. You are to be a good boy and take care of your two brothers. We'll be back soon.
Mam says, When we're out go easy with that sugar. We're not millionaires.
When Mam picks up Oliver and wraps him in a coat Eugene stands on the bed. I want Ollie, he says. Ollie play.
Ollie will be back soon, she says, and you can play with him. Now you can play with Malachy and Frank.
Ollie, Ollie, I want Ollie.
He follows Oliver with his eyes and when they're gone he sits on the bed looking out the window. Malachy says, Genie, Genie, we have bread, we have tea. Sugar on your bread, Genie. He shakes his head and pushes away the bread Malachy is offering. He crawls to the place where Oliver slept with Mam, puts his head down and stares out the window.
Grandma is at the door. I heard your father and mother were running down Henry Street with the child in their arms. Now where are they gone to?
Oliver is sick, I said. He wouldn't eat the boiled onion in milk. What are you blatherin' about?
Wouldn't eat the boiled onion and got sick.
And who's minding ye?
I am.
And what's up with the child in the bed? What's That's Eugene. He misses Oliver. They're twins. I know they're twins. That child looks starved.
his name?
Have ye any
porridge here?
What's porridge? says Malachy.
Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! What's porridge! Porridge is
porridge. That's what porridge is. Ye are the most ignorant bunch o' Yanks I ever seen. Come on, put on yeer clothes and we'll go across the street to your aunt Aggie. She's there with the husband, Pa Keating, and she'll give ye some porridge.
She picks up Eugene, wraps him in her shawl and we cross the street to Aunt Aggie's. She's living with Uncle Pa again because he said she wasn't a fat cow after all.
Do you have any porridge? Grandma says to Aunt Aggie.
Porridge? Am I supposed to be feeding porridge to a crowd of Yanks? Pity about you, says Grandma. It won't kill you to give them a
little porridge.
And I suppose they'll be wanting sugar and milk on top of
everything or they might be banging on my door looking for an egg if you don't mind. I don't know why we have to pay for Angela's mistakes.
Jesus, says Grandma, 'tis a good thing you didn't own that stable in Bethlehem or the Holy Family would still be wanderin' the world crumblin' with the hunger.
Grandma pushes her way past Aunt Aggie, puts Eugene on a chair near the fire and makes the porridge. A man comes in from another room. He has black curly hair and his skin is black and I like his eyes because they're very blue and ready to smile. He's Aunt Aggie's husband, the man who stopped the night we were attacking the fleas and told us all about fleas and snakes, the man with the cough he got from swallowing gas in the war.
Malachy says, Why are you all black? and Uncle Pa Keating laughs and coughs so hard he has to ease himself with a cigarette. Oh, the little Yanks, he says. They're not a bit shy. I'm black because I work at the Limerick Gas Works shoveling coal and coke into the furnaces. Gassed in France and back to Limerick to work in the gas works. When you grow up you'll laugh.
Malachy and I have to leave the table so the big people can sit and have tea. They have their tea but Uncle Pa Keating, who is my uncle because he's married to my aunt Aggie, picks up Eugene and takes him on his lap. He says, This is a sad little fella, and makes funny faces and silly sounds. Malachy and I laugh but Eugene only reaches up to touch the blackness of Pa Keating's skin, and then when Pa pretends to bite his little hand, Eugene laughs and everyone in the room laughs. Malachy goes to Eugene and tries to make him laugh even more but Eugene turns away and hides his face in Pa Keating's shirt.
I think he likes me, says Pa, and that's when Aunt Aggie puts down her teacup and starts to bawl, Waah, waah, waah, big teardrops tumbling down her fat red face.
Aw, Jesus, says Grandma, there she is again. What's up with you this time?
And Aunt Aggie blubbers, To see Pa there with a child on his lap an' me with no hope of having my own.
Grandma barks at her, Stop talkin' like that in front of the children. Have you no shame? When God is good and ready He'll send you your family.
Aunt Aggie sobs, Angela with five born an' one just gone an' her so useless she couldn't scrub a floor an' me with none an' I can scrub an' clean with the best and make any class of a stew or a fry.
Pa Keating laughs, I think I'll keep this little fella.
Malachy runs to him. No, no, no. That's my brother, that's Eugene. And I say, No, no, no, that's our brother. Aunt Aggie pats the tears on her cheeks. She says, I don't want nothing of Angela's. I don't want nothing that's half Limerick and half North of Ireland, so I don't, so ye can take him home. I'll have me own someday if I have to do a hundred novenas to the Virgin Mary and her mother, St. Ann, or if I have to crawl from here to Lourdes on me two bended knees.
Grandma says, That's enough. Ye have had yeer porridge and 'tis time to go home and see if yeer father and mother are back from the hospital.
She puts on her shawl and goes to pick up Eugene but he clutches so hard at Pa Keating's shirt she has to pull him away though he keeps looking back at Pa till we're out the door.
***
We followed Grandma back to our room. She put Eugene in the bed and gave him a drink of water. She told him to be a good boy and go to sleep for his little brother, Oliver, would be home soon and they'd be playing again there on the floor.
But he kept looking out the window.
She told Malachy and me we could sit on the floor and play but to be quiet because she was going to say her prayers. Malachy went to the bed and sat by Eugene and I sat on a chair at the table making out words on the newspaper that was our tablecloth. All you could hear in the room was Malachy whispering to make Eugene happy and Grandma mumbling to the click of her rosary beads. It was so quiet I put my head on the table and fell asleep.
Dad is touching my shoulder. Come on, Francis, you have to take care of your little brothers.
Mam is slumped on the edge of the bed, making small crying sounds like a bird. Grandma is pulling on her shawl. She says, I'll go down to
Thompson the undertaker about the coffin and the carriage. The St. Vincent de Paul Society will surely pay for that, God knows.
She goes out the door. Dad stands facing the wall over the fire, beating on his thighs with his fists, sighing, Och, och, och.
Dad frightens me with his och, och, och, and Mam frightens me with her small bird sounds and I don't know what to do though I wonder if anyone will light the fire in the grate so that we can have tea and bread because it's a long time since we had the porridge. If Dad would move away from the fireplace I could light the fire myself. All you need is paper, a few bits of coal or turf, and a match. He won't move so I try to go around his legs while he's beating on his thighs but he notices me and wants to know why I'm trying to light the fire. I tell him we're all hungry and he lets out a crazy laugh. Hungry? he says. Och, Francis, your wee brother Oliver is dead. Your wee sister is dead and your wee brother is dead.
He picks me up and hugs me so hard I cry out. Then Malachy cries, my mother cries, Dad cries, I cry, but Eugene stays quiet. Then Dad sniffles, We'll have a feast. Come on, Francis.
He tells my mother we'll be back in awhile but she has Malachy and Eugene on her lap in the bed and she doesn't look up. He carries me through the streets of Limerick and we go from shop to shop with him asking for food or anything they can give to a family that has two children dead in a year, one in America, one in Limerick, and in danger of losing three more for the want of food and drink. Most shopkeepers shake their heads. Sorry for your troubles but you could go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or get the public assistance.
Dad says he's glad to see the spirit of Christ alive in Limerick and they tell him they don't need the likes of him with his northern accent to be telling them about Christ and he should be ashamed of himself dragging a child around like that like a common beggar, a tinker, a knacker.
A few shopkeepers give bread, potatoes, tins of beans and Dad says, We'll go home now and you boys can eat something, but we meet Uncle Pa Keating and he tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and would Dad like to have a pint in this pub here?
There are men sitting in this pub with great glasses of black stuff before them. Uncle Pa Keating and Dad have the black stuff, too. They lift their glasses carefully and slowly drink. There is creamy white stuff on their lips, which they lick with little sighs. Uncle Pa gets me a bottle of lemonade and Dad gives me a piece of bread and I don't feel hungry anymore. Still, I wonder how long we'll sit here with Malachy and Eugene hungry at home, hours from the porridge, which Eugene didn't eat anyway.
Dad and Uncle Pa drink their glass of black stuff and have another. Uncle Pa says, Frankie, this is the pint. This is the staff of life. This is the best thing for nursing mothers and for those who are long weaned.
He laughs and Dad smiles and I laugh because I think that's what you're supposed to do when Uncle Pa says something. He doesn't laugh when he tells the other men about Oliver dying. The other men tip their hats to Dad. Sorry for your troubles, mister, and surely you'll have a pint.
Dad says yes to the pints and soon he's singing Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry and song after song I never heard before and crying over his lovely little girl, Margaret, that died in America and his little boy, Oliver, dead beyond in the City Home Hospital. It frightens me the way he
yells and cries and sings and I wish I could be at home with my three brothers, no, my two brothers, and my mother.
The man behind the bar says to Dad, I think now, mister, you've had enough. We're sorry for your troubles but you have to take that child home to his mother that must be heartbroken by the fire.
Dad says, One, one more pint, just one, eh? and the man says no. Dad shakes his fist. I did me bit for Ireland, and when the man comes out and takes Dad's arm, Dad tries to push him away.
Uncle Pa says, Come on now, Malachy, stop the blaguarding. You have to go home to Angela. You have a funeral tomorrow and the lovely children waiting for you.
But Dad struggles till a few men push him out into the darkness. Uncle Pa stumbles out with the bag of food. Come on, he says. We'll go back to your room.
Dad wants to go to another place for a pint but Uncle Pa says he has no more money. Dad says he'll tell everyone his sorrows and they'll give him pints. Uncle Pa says that's a disgraceful thing to do and Dad cries on his shoulder. You're a good friend, he tells Uncle Pa. He cries again till Uncle Pa pats him on the back. It's terrible, terrible, says Uncle Pa, but you'll get over this in time.
Dad straightens up and looks at him. Never, he says. Never.
Next day we rode to the hospital in a carriage with a horse. They put Oliver in a white box that came with us in the carriage and we took him to the graveyard. They put the white box into a hole in the ground and covered it with earth. My mother and Aunt Aggie cried, Grandma looked angry, Dad, Uncle Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat Sheehan looked sad but did not cry and I thought that if you're a man you can cry only when you have the black stuff that is called the pint.
I did not like the jackdaws that perched on trees and gravestones and I did not want to leave Oliver with them. I threw a rock at a jackdaw that waddled over toward Oliver's grave. Dad said I shouldn't throw rocks at jackdaws, they might be somebody's soul. I didn't know what a soul was but I didn't ask him because I didn't care. Oliver was dead and I hated jackdaws. I'd be a man someday and I'd come back with a bag of rocks and I'd leave the graveyard littered with dead jackdaws.
The morning after Oliver's burial Dad went to the Labour Exchange to sign and collect the week's dole, nineteen shillings and sixpence. He said he'd be home by noon, that he'd get coal and make a fire, that we'd have rashers and eggs and tea in honor of Oliver, that we might even have a sweet or two.
He wasn't home by noon, or one, or two, and we boiled and ate the few potatoes the shopkeepers had given the day before. He wasn't home anytime before the sun went down that day in May. There was no sign of him till we heard him, long after the pubs closed, rolling along Windmill Street, singing, When all around a vigil keep, The West's asleep, the West's asleep- Alas, and well may Erin weep When Connacht lies in slumber deep.
There lake and plain smile fair and free, 'Mid rocks their guardian chivalry.
Sing, Oh, let man learn liberty
From crashing wind and lashing sea.
He stumbled into the room, hanging on to the wall. A snot oozed from his nose and he wiped it away with the back of his hand. He tried to speak. Zeeze shildren should be in bed. Lishen to me. Shildren go to bed.
Mam faced him. These children are hungry. Where's the dole money? We'll get fish and chips so they'll have something in their bellies when they go to sleep.
She tried to stick her hands into his pockets but he pushed her away. Have respheck, he said. Reshpeck in front of shildren.
She struggled to get at his pockets. Where's the money? The children are hungry. You mad oul' bastard, did you drink all the money again? Just what you did in Brooklyn.
He blubbered, Och, poor Angela. And poor wee Margaret and poor wee Oliver.
He staggered to me and hugged me and I smelled the drink I used to smell in America. My face was wet from his tears and his spit and his snot and I was hungry and I didn't know what to say when he cried all over my head.
Then he let me go and hugged Malachy, still going on about the wee sister and the wee brother cold in the ground, and how we all have to pray and be good, how we have to be obedient and do what our mother tells us. He said we have our troubles but it's time for Malachy and me to start school because there's nothing like an education, it will stand to you in the end, and you have to get ready to do your bit for Ireland.
***
Mam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Windmill Street. She can't sleep with the memory of Oliver in that room, Oliver in the bed, Oliver playing on the floor, Oliver sitting on Dad's lap by the fire. She says it's not good for Eugene to be in that place, that a twin will suffer more over the loss of his brother than even a mother can understand. There's a room going on Hartstonge Street with two beds instead of the one we have here for the six of us, no, the five of us. We're getting that room and to make sure she's going to the Labour Exchange on Thursday to stand in the queue to take the dole money the minute it's handed to Dad. He says she can't do that, he'd be disgraced with the other men. The Labour Exchange is a place for men not for women taking the money from under their noses. She says, Pity about you. If you didn't squander the money in the pubs I wouldn't have to follow you the way I did in Brooklyn.
He tells her he'll be shamed forever. She says she doesn't care. She wants that room on Hartstonge Street, a nice warm comfortable room with a lavatory down the hall like the one in Brooklyn, a room without fleas and the dampness that kills. She wants that room because it's on the same street as Leamy's National School and Malachy and I can come home at the dinner hour, which is noon, for a cup of tea and a cut of fried bread.
On Thursday Mam follows Dad to the Labour Exchange. She marches in behind him and when the man pushes the money toward Dad she takes it. The other men on the dole nudge each other and grin and Dad is disgraced because a woman is never supposed to interfere with a man's dole money. He might want to put sixpence on a horse or have a pint and if all the women start acting like Mam the horses will stop running and Guinness will go broke. But she has the money now and we move to Hartstonge Street. Then she carries Eugene in her arms and we go up the street to Leamy's National School. The headmaster, Mr. Scallan, says we are to
return on Monday with a composition book, a pencil, and a pen with a good nib on it. We are not to come to school with ringworm or lice and our noses are to be blown at all times, not on the floor, that spreads the consumption, or on our sleeves, but in a handkerchief or a clean rag. He asks us if we are good boys and when we say we are, he says, Good Lord, what's this? Are they Yanks or what?
Mam tells him about Margaret and Oliver and he says, Lord above, Lord above, there's great suffering in the world. Anyway, we'll put the little fellow, Malachy, in the infants' class and his brother in first class. They're in the same room with one master. Monday morning, then, nine o'clock prompt.
The boys in Leamy's want to know why we talk like that. Are ye Yanks or what? And when we tell them we came from America they want to know, Are ye gangsters or cowboys?
A big boy sticks his face up to mine. I'm asking ye a question, he says. Are ye gangsters or cowboys?
I tell him I don't know and when he pokes his finger into my chest Malachy says, I'm a gangster, Frank's a cowboy. The big boy says, Your little brother is smart and you're a stupid Yank.
The boys around him are excited. Fight, they yell, fight, and he pushes me so hard I fall. I want to cry but the blackness comes over me the way it did with Freddie Leibowitz and I rush at him, kicking and punching. I knock him down and try to grab his hair to bang his head on the ground but there's a sharp sting across the backs of my legs and I'm pulled away from him.
Mr. Benson, the master, has me by the ear and he's whacking me across the legs. You little hooligan, he says. Is that the kind of behavior you brought from America? Well, by God, you'll behave yourself before I'm done with you.
He tells me hold out one hand and then the other and hits me with his stick once on each hand. Go home now, he says, and tell your mother what a bad boy you were. You're a bad Yank. Say after me, I'm a bad boy.
I'm a bad boy.
Now say, I'm a bad Yank.
I'm a bad Yank.
Malachy says, He's not a bad boy. It's that big boy. He said we
were cowboys and gangsters.
Is that what you did, Heffernan?
I was only jokin', sir.
No more joking, Heffernan. It's not their fault that they're Yanks. 'Tisn't, sir.
And you, Heffernan, should get down on your two knees every night
and thank God you're not a Yank for if you were, Heffernan, you'd be the greatest gangster on two sides of the Atlantic. Al Capone would be coming to you for lessons. You're not to be bothering these two Yanks anymore, Heffernan.
I won't, sir.
And if you do, Heffernan, I'll hang your pelt on the wall. Now go home, all of ye.
There are seven masters in Leamy's National School and they all have leather straps, canes, blackthorn sticks. They hit you with the sticks on the shoulders, the back, the legs, and, especially, the hands. If they hit you on the hands it's called a slap. They hit you if you're
late, if you have a leaky nib on your pen, if you laugh, if you talk, and if you don't know things.
They hit you if you don't know why God made the world, if you don't know the patron saint of Limerick, if you can't recite the Apostles' Creed, if you can't add nineteen to forty-seven, if you can't subtract nineteen from forty-seven, if you don't know the chief towns and products of the thirty-two counties of Ireland, if you can't find Bulgaria on the wall map of the world that's blotted with spit, snot, and blobs of ink thrown by angry pupils expelled forever.
They hit you if you can't say your name in Irish, if you can't say the Hail Mary in Irish, if you can't ask for the lavatory pass in Irish. It helps to listen to the big boys ahead of you. They can tell you
about the master you have now, what he likes and what he hates.
One master will hit you if you don't know that Eamon De Valera is
the greatest man that ever lived. Another master will hit you if you don't know that Michael Collins was the greatest man that ever lived.
Mr. Benson hates America and you have to remember to hate America or he'll hit you.
Mr. O'Dea hates England and you have to remember to hate England or he'll hit you.
If you ever say anything good about Oliver Cromwell they'll all hit
you.
Even if they slap you six times on each hand with the ash plant or
the blackthorn with the knobs you must not cry. You'll be a sissy. There are boys who might jeer at you and mock you on the street but even they have to be careful because the day will come when the master hits and slaps them and they have to keep the tears behind their eyes or be disgraced forever. Some boys say it is better to cry because that pleases the masters. If you don't cry the masters hate you because you've made them look weak before the class and they promise themselves the next time they have you up they'll draw tears or blood or both.
Big boys in fifth class tell us Mr. O'Dea likes to get you in front of the class so that he can stand behind you, pinch your sideburns, which are called cossicks, pull up on them. Up, up, he says, till you're on tiptoe and the tears are filling your eyes. You don't want the boys in the class to see you cry but pulling on the cossicks makes the tears come whether you like it or not and the master likes that. Mr. O'Dea is the one master who can always bring the tears and the shame.
It is better not to cry because you have to stick with the boys in the school and you never want to give the masters any satisfaction.
If the master hits you there's no use complaining to your father or mother. They always say, You deserve it. Don't be a baby.
I know Oliver is dead and Malachy knows Oliver is dead but Eugene is too small to know anything. When he wakes in the morning he says, Ollie, Ollie, and toddles around the room looking under the beds or he climbs up on the bed by the window and points to children on the street, especially children with fair hair like him and Oliver. Ollie, Ollie, he says, and Mam picks him up, sobs, hugs him. He struggles to get down because he doesn't want to be picked up and hugged. He wants to find Oliver.
Dad and Mam tell him Oliver is in heaven playing with angels and we'll all see him again someday but he doesn't understand because he's only two and doesn't have the words and that's the worst thing in the whole world.
Malachy and I play with him. We try to make him laugh. We make funny faces. We put pots on our heads and pretend to let them fall off. We run across the room and pretend to fall down. We take him to the People's Park to see the lovely flowers, play with dogs, roll in the grass.
He sees small children with fair hair like Oliver. He doesn't say Ollie anymore. He only points.
Dad says Eugene is lucky to have brothers like Malachy and me because we help him forget and soon, with God's help, he'll have no memory of Oliver at all.
***
He died anyway.
Six months after Oliver went, we woke on a mean November morning
and there was Eugene, cold in the bed beside us. Dr. Troy came and said that child died of pneumonia and why wasn't he in the hospital long ago? Dad said he didn't know and Mam said she didn't know and Dr. Troy said that's why children die. People don't know. He said if Malachy or I showed the slightest sign of a cough or the faintest rattle in the throat we were to be brought to him no matter what time of day or night. We were to be kept dry at all times because there seemed to be a bit of a weakness in the chest in this family. He told Mam he was very sorry for her troubles and he'd give her a prescription for something to ease the pain of the days to come. He said God was asking too much, too damn much.
Grandma came over to our room with Aunt Aggie. She washed Eugene, and Aunt Aggie went to a shop for a little white gown and a set of rosary beads. They dressed him in a white gown and laid him on the bed by the window where he used to look out for Oliver. They placed his hands on his chest, one hand on top of the other, bound in the little white rosary beads. Grandma brushed the hair back from his eyes and forehead and she said, Doesn't he have lovely soft silky hair? Mam went to the bed and pulled a blanket over his legs to keep him warm. Grandma and Aunt Aggie looked at each other and said nothing. Dad stood at the end of the bed beating his fists against his thighs, talking to Eugene, telling him, Och, it was the River Shannon that harmed you, the dampness from that river that came and took you and Oliver. Grandma said, Will you stop that? You're making the whole house nervous. She took Dr. Troy's prescription and told me run over to O'Connor the chemist for the pills, that there would be no charge due to the kindness of Dr. Troy. Dad said he'd come with me, that we'd go to the Jesuit church and say a prayer for Margaret and Oliver and Eugene, all happy in heaven. The chemist gave us the pills, we stopped to say the prayers, and when we returned to the room, Grandma gave Dad money to bring a few bottles of stout from the pub. Mam said, No, no, but Grandma said, He doesn't have the pills to ease him, God help us, and a bottle of stout will be some small comfort. Then she told him he'd have to go to the undertaker tomorrow to bring the coffin back in a carriage. She told me to go with my father and make sure he didn't stay in the pub all night and drink all the money. Dad said, Och, Frankie shouldn't be in pubs, and she said, Then don't stay there. He put on his cap and we went to South's pub and he told me at the door I could go home now, that he'd be home after one pint. I said, No, and he said, Don't be disobedient. Go home to your poor mother. I said, No, and he said I was a bad boy and God would be displeased. I said I wasn't going home without him and he said, Och, what is the world coming to? He had one quick pint of porter in the pub and we went home with the bottles
of stout. Pa Keating was in our room with a small bottle of whiskey and bottles of stout and Uncle Pat Sheehan brought two bottles of stout for himself. Uncle Pat sat on the floor with his arms around his bottles and he kept saying, They're mine, they're mine, for fear they'd be taken from him. People who were dropped on their heads always worry someone will steal their stout. Grandma said, All right, Pat, drink your stout yourself. No one will bother you. She and Aunt Aggie sat on the bed by Eugene. Pa Keating sat at the kitchen table drinking his stout and offering everyone a sip of his whiskey. Mam took her pills and sat by the fire with Malachy on her lap. She kept saying Malachy had hair like Eugene and Aunt Aggie said no he did not till Grandma drove her elbow into Aunt Aggie's chest and told her shut up. Dad stood against the wall drinking his stout between the fireplace and the bed with Eugene. Pa Keating told stories and the big people laughed even though they didn't want to laugh or they weren't supposed to laugh in the presence of a dead child. He said when he was in the English army in France the Germans sent gas over which made him so sick they had to take him to the hospital. They kept him in the hospital a while and then sent him back to the trenches. English soldiers were sent home but they didn't give a fiddler's fart about the Irish soldiers, whether they lived or died. Instead of dying Pa made a vast fortune. He said he solved one of the great problems of trench warfare. In the trenches it was so wet and muddy they had no way of boiling the water for the tea. He said to himself, Jasus, I have all this gas in my system and 'tis a great pity to waste it. So he shoved a pipe up his arse, lit a match to it, and there in a second he had a fine flame ready to boil water in any billycan. Tommies came running from trenches all around when they heard the news and they gave him any amount of money if he'd let them boil water. He made so much money he was able to bribe the generals to let him out of the army and off he went to Paris where he had a fine time drinking wine with artists and models. He had such a high time of it he spent all his money and when he came back to Limerick the only job he could get was in the gas works shoveling coal into the furnaces. He said there was so much gas in his system now he could supply light to a small town for a year. Aunt Aggie sniffed and said that was not a proper story to be telling in the presence of a dead child and Grandma said it was better to have a story like that than to be sitting around with the long face. Uncle Pat Sheehan, sitting on the floor with his stout, said he was going to sing a song. More power to you, said Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat sang ""The Road to Rasheen. "" He kept saying, Rasheen, Rasheen, mavourneen mean, and the song made no sense because his father dropped him on his head long ago and every time he sang that song he had different words. Grandma said that was a fine song and Pa Keating said Caruso better look over his shoulder. Dad went over to the bed in the corner where he slept with Mam. He sat on the edge, put his bottle on the floor, covered his face with his hands and cried. He said, Frank, Frank, come here, and I had to go to him so that he could hug me the way Mam was hugging Malachy. Grandma said, We better go now and sleep a bit before the funeral tomorrow. They each knelt by the bed and said a prayer and kissed Eugene's forehead. Dad put me down, stood up and nodded to them as they left. When they were gone he lifted each of the stout bottles to his mouth and drained it. He ran his finger inside the whiskey bottle and licked it. He turned down the flame in the paraffin oil lamp on the table and said it was time for Malachy and me to be in bed. We'd have to sleep with him and Mam that
night as little Eugene would be needing the bed for himself. It was dark in the room now except for the sliver of streetlight that fell on Eugene's lovely soft silky hair.
Dad lights the fire in the morning, makes the tea, toasts the bread in the fire. He brings Mam's toast and tea but she waves it away and turns to the wall. He brings Malachy and me to Eugene to kneel and say a prayer. He says the prayers of one child like us are worth more in heaven than the prayers of ten cardinals and forty bishops. He shows us how to bless ourselves, In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen, and he says, Dear God, this is what you want, isn't it? You want my son, Eugene. You took his brother, Oliver, You took his sister, Margaret. I'm not supposed to question that, am I? Dear God above, I don't know why children have to die but that is Your will. You told the river to kill and the Shannon killed. Could You at last be merciful? Could You leave us the children we have? That is all we ask. Amen.
He helps Malachy and me wash our heads and feet so that we'll be clean for Eugene's funeral. We have to be very quiet even when he hurts us cleaning our ears with the corner of the towel we brought from America. We have to be quiet because Eugene is there with his eyes closed and we don't want him to be waking up and looking out the window for Oliver.
Grandma comes and tells Mam she has to get up. There are children dead, she says, but there are children alive and they need their mother. She brings Mam a little tea in a mug to wash down the pills that ease the pain. Dad tells Grandma it's Thursday and he has to go to the Labour Exchange for the dole and then down to the undertaker to bring the mourning carriage and the coffin. Grandma tells him to take me with him but he says it's better for me to stay with Malachy so that I can pray for my little brother dead in the bed. Grandma says, Is it coddin' me you are? Pray for a little child that's barely two and already playing with his little brother in heaven? You'll take your son with you and he'll remind you this is no day for the pubs. She looks at him and he looks at her and he puts on his cap.
At the Labour Exchange we stand at the end of the queue till a man comes from behind the counter and tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and he should go ahead of everyone else on this sorrowful day. Men touch their caps and say they're sorry for his troubles and some pat my head and give me pennies, twenty-four pennies, two shillings. Dad tells me I'm rich now and I should buy myself a sweet while he goes into this place for a minute. I know this place is a pub and I know he wants to get the black stuff that is called a pint but I don't say anything because I want to go to the shop next door for a piece of toffee. I chew my toffee till it melts and leaves my mouth all sweet and sticky. Dad is still in the pub and I wonder if I should get another piece of toffee as long as he's in there with the pint. I'm about to give the money to the woman in the shop when my hand is slapped down and there's Aunt Aggie, raging. Is this what you do, she says, on the day of your brother's funeral? Gorgin' yourself on sweets. And where's that father of yours?
He's, he's, in the pub.
Of course he's in the pub. You out here stuffin' yourself with sweets and him in there gettin' himself into a staggerin' condition the day your poor little brother goes to the graveyard.
She tells the shop woman, Just like his father, the same odd manner, the same oul' northern jaw. She tells me get into that pub and tell my father to stop the drinking and get the coffin and the carriage. She will not set foot inside the pub for the drink is the curse of this poor godforsaken country.
Dad is sitting at the back of the pub with a man who has a dirty face and hair growing out of his nose. They're not talking but staring straight ahead and their black pints are resting on a small white coffin on the seat between them. I know that's Eugene's coffin because Oliver had one like it and I want to cry when I see the black pints on top of it. I'm sorry now I ever ate that toffee and I wish I could take it out of my stomach and give it back to the woman in the shop because it's not right to be eating toffee when Eugene is dead in the bed and I'm frightened by the two black pints on his white coffin. The man with Dad is saying, No, mister, you can't leave a child's coffin in a carriage no more. I did that once, went in for a pint and they robbed that little coffin out of the bloody carriage. Can you credit that? It was empty, thank God, but there you are. Desperate times we live in, desperate. The man with Dad lifts his pint and takes a long swallow and when he puts his glass down there's a hollow sound in the coffin. Dad nods at me. We'll be going in a minute, son, but when he goes to put his glass on the coffin after the long swallow I push it away.
That's Eugene's coffin. I'll tell Mam you put your glass on Eugene's coffin.
Now, son. Now, son.
Dad, that's Eugene's coffin. The other man says, Will we have another pint, mister?
Dad says to me, Wait outside another few minutes, Francis. No.
Don't be a bad boy.
No.
The other man says, By Jesus, if that was my son I'd kick his arse from here to the County Kerry. He have no right to be talkin' to his father in that manner on a sorrowful day. If a man can't have a pint the day of a funeral what's the use of livin' at all, at all.
Dad says, All right. We'll go.
They finish their pints and wipe the wet brown stains off the coffin with their sleeves. The man climbs up to the driver's seat of the carriage and Dad and I ride inside. He has the coffin on his lap and he presses it against his chest. At home our room is filled with big people, Mam, Grandma, Aunt Aggie, her husband, Pa Keating, Uncle Pat Sheehan, Uncle Tom Sheehan, who is Mam's oldest brother and who never came near us before because he hates people from the North of Ireland. Uncle Tom has his wife, Jane, with him. She's from Galway and people say she has the look of a Spaniard and that's why no one in the family talks to her.
The man takes the coffin from Dad and when he brings it into the room Mam moans, Oh, no, oh, God, no. The man tells Grandma he'll be back in awhile to take us to the graveyard. Grandma tells him he'd better not come back to this house in a drunken state because this child that's going to the graveyard suffered greatly and deserves a bit of dignity and she won't put up with a driver that's drunk and ready to fall out of the high seat.
The man says, Missus, I drove dozens o' children to the graveyard an' never once fell out of any seat, high or low.
The men are drinking stout from bottles again and the women are sipping sherry from jam jars. Uncle Pat Sheehan tells everyone, This is my stout, this is my stout, and Grandma says, 'Tis all right, Pat. No one will take your stout. Then he says he wants to sing ""The Road to Rasheen"" till Pa Keating says, No, Pat, you can't sing on the day of a funeral. You can sing the night before. But Uncle Pat keeps saying, This is my stout and I want to sing ""The Road to Rasheen, "" and everyone knows he talks like that because he was dropped on his head. He starts to sing his song but stops when Grandma takes the lid off the coffin and Mam sobs, Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus, will it ever stop? Will I be left with one child?
Mam is sitting on a chair at the head of the bed. She's stroking Eugene's hair and face and hands. She tells him that of all the children in the world he was the sweetest and the most delicate and loving. She tells him 'tis a terrible thing to lose him but isn't he in heaven now with his brother and his sister and isn't that a comfort to us, knowing Oliver is no longer lonesome for his twin. Still, she puts her head down next to Eugene and cries so hard all the women in the room cry with her. She cries till Pa Keating tells her we have to go before the darkness falls, that we can't be in graveyards in the dark.
Grandma whispers to Aunt Aggie, Who'll put the child in the coffin? and Aunt Aggie whispers, I won't. That's the job for the mother.
Uncle Pat hears them. I'll put the child in the coffin, he says. He limps to the bed and places his arms around Mam's shoulders. She looks up at him and her face is drenched. He says, I'll put the child in the coffin, Angela.
Oh, Pat, she says. Pat.
I can do it, he says. Sure he's only a small child an' I never lifted a small child before in my life. I never had a small child in me arms. I won't drop him, Angela. I won't. Honest to God, I won't.
I know you won't, Pat. I know you won't.
I'll lift him an' I won't be singin'""The Road to Rasheen.""
I know you won't, Pat, Mam says.
Pat pulls down the blanket Mam put there to keep Eugene warm.
Eugene's feet are white and bright with little blue veins. Pat bends over, picks up Eugene and holds him against his chest. He kisses Eugene's forehead and then everyone in the room kisses Eugene. He places Eugene in the coffin and steps back. We are all gathered around looking at Eugene for the last time.
Uncle Pat says, See, I didn't drop him, Angela, and she touches his
face.
Aunt Aggie goes to the pub for the driver. He puts the lid on the
coffin and screws it down. He says, Who's comin' in the carriage? and takes the coffin to the carriage. There's room only for Mam and Dad, Malachy and me. Grandma says, Ye go ahead to the graveyard and we'll wait here.
I don't know why we can't keep Eugene. I don't know why they have to send him away with that man who puts his pint on the white coffin. I don't know why they had to send Margaret away and Oliver. It is a bad thing to put my sister and my brothers in a box and I wish I could say something to someone.
The horse clop-clopped through the streets of Limerick. Malachy said, Are we going to see Oliver? and Dad said, No, Oliver is in heaven and don't ask me what heaven is because I don't know.
Mam said, Heaven is a place where Oliver and Eugene and Margaret are happy and warm and we'll see them there some day.
Malachy said, The horse did his doodoo on the street and there was a smell, and Mam and Dad had to smile.
At the graveyard the driver climbs down and opens the door of the carriage. Gimme that coffin, he says, an' I'll carry it up to the grave. He yanks at the coffin and stumbles. Mam says, You're not carrying my child in the condition you're in. She turns to Dad. You carry him, she says. Do what you like, says the driver.
Do what you bloody well like, and he climbs up to his seat.
It's getting dark now and the coffin seems whiter than ever in Dad's arms. Mam takes our hands and we follow Dad through the graves. The jackdaws are quiet in the trees because their day is nearly over and they have to rest so that they can get up early in the morning and feed their babies.
Two men with shovels are waiting by a small open grave. One man says, Ye are very late. Good thing this is a small job or we'd be gone. He climbs into the grave. Hand it to me, he says, and Dad hands him the coffin.
The man sprinkles some straw and grass on the coffin and as he climbs out the other man shovels in the earth. Mam lets out a long cry, Oh, Jesus, Jesus, and a jackdaw croaks in a tree. I wish I had a rock to hit that jackdaw. When the men finish shoveling in the earth they wipe their foreheads and wait. One says, Ah, well, now, there's usually a little something for the thirst that's in it.
Dad says, Oh, yes, yes, and gives them money. They say, Sorry for your troubles, and they leave.
We make our way back to the carriage at the graveyard gate but the carriage is gone. Dad looks around in the darkness and comes back shaking his head. Mam says, That driver is nothing but a dirty old drunkard, God forgive me.
It's a long walk from the graveyard to our room. Mam tells Dad, These children need some nourishment and you have money left from the dole this morning. If you're thinking of going to the pubs tonight you can forget it. We're taking them to Naughton's and they can have fish and chips and lemonade for 'tisn't every day they bury a brother.
The fish and chips are delicious with vinegar and salt and the lemonade is tart in our throats.
When we get home the room is empty. There are empty stout bottles on the table and the fire is out. Dad lights the paraffin oil lamp and you can see the hollow left in the pillow by Eugene's head. You expect to hear him and see him toddling across the room, climbing up on the bed to look out the window for Oliver.
Dad tells Mam he's going out for a walk. She says no. She knows what he's up to, that he can't wait to spend his last few shillings in the pubs. All right, he says. He lights the fire and Mam makes tea and soon we're in bed.
Malachy and I are back in the bed where Eugene died. I hope he's not cold in that white coffin in the graveyard though I know he's not there anymore because angels come to the graveyard and open the coffin and he's far from the Shannon dampness that kills, up in the sky in heaven with Oliver and Margaret where they have plenty of fish and chips and toffee and no aunts to bother you, where all the fathers bring home
the money from the Labour Exchange and you don't have to be running around to pubs to find them.
III
Mam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Hartstonge Street. She sees Eugene morning, noon and night. She sees him climbing the bed to look out at the street for Oliver and sometimes she sees Oliver outside and Eugene inside, the two of them chatting away. She's happy they're chatting like that but she doesn't want to be seeing and hearing them the rest of her life. It's a shame to move when we're so near Leamy's National School but if she doesn't move soon she'll go out of her mind and wind up in the lunatic asylum.
We move to Roden Lane on top of a place called Barrack Hill. There are six houses on one side of the lane, one on the opposite side. The houses are called two up, two down, two rooms on top, two on the bottom. Our house is at the end of the lane, the last of the six. Next to our door is a small shed, a lavatory, and next to that a stable.
Mam goes to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to see if there's any chance of getting furniture. The man says he'll give us a docket for a table, two chairs, and two beds. He says we'll have to go to a second- hand furniture shop down in the Irishtown and haul the furniture home ourselves. Mam says we can use the pram she had for the twins and when she says that she cries. She wipes her eyes on her sleeves and asks the man if the beds we're getting are secondhand. He says of course they are, and she says she's very worried about sleeping in beds someone might have died in, especially if they had the consumption. The man says, I'm very sorry, but beggars can't be choosers.
It takes us all day to haul the furniture on the pram from one end of Limerick to the other. There are four wheels on the pram but one is bockety, it wants to go in a different direction. We have two beds, one sideboard with a mirror, a table and two chairs. We're happy with the house. We can walk from room to room and up and down the stairs. You feel very rich when you can go up and down the stairs all day as much as you please. Dad lights the fire and Mam makes the tea. He sits at the table on one chair, she sits on the other and Malachy and I sit on the trunk we brought from America. While we're drinking our tea an old man passes our door with a bucket in his hand. He empties the bucket into the lavatory and flushes and there's a powerful stink in our kitchen. Mam goes to the door and says, Why are you emptying your bucket in our lavatory? He raises his cap to her. Your lavatory, missus? Ah, no. You're making a bit of a mistake there, ha, ha. This is not your lavatory. Sure, isn't this the lavatory for the whole lane. You'll see passing your door here the buckets of eleven families and I can tell you it gets very powerful here in the warm weather, very powerful altogether. 'Tis December now, thank God, with a chill in the air and Christmas around the corner and the lavatory isn't that bad, but the day will come when you'll be calling for a gas mask. So, good night to you, missus, and I hope you'll be happy in your house.
Mam says, Wait a minute, sir. Could you tell me who cleans this lavatory?
Cleans? Ah, Jasus, that's a good one. Cleans, she says. Is it joking you are? These houses were built in the time of Queen Victoria herself and if this lavatory was ever cleaned it must have been done by someone in the middle of the night when no one was lookin'.
And he shuffles up the lane laughing away to himself.
Mam comes back to her chair and her tea. We can't stay here, she says. That lavatory will kill us with all diseases.
Dad says, We can't move again. Where will we get a house for six shillings a week? We'll keep the lavatory clean ourselves. We'll boil buckets of water and throw them in there.
Oh, will we? says Mam, and where will we get the coal or turf or blocks to be boiling water?
Dad says nothing. He finishes his tea and looks for a nail to hang our one picture. The man in the picture has a thin face. He wears a yellow skullcap and a black robe with a cross on his chest. Dad says he was a Pope, Leo the Thirteenth, a great friend of the workingman. He brought this picture all the way from America where he found it thrown out by someone who had no time for the workingman. Mam says he's talking a lot of bloody nonsense and he says she shouldn't say bloody in front of the children. Dad finds a nail but wonders how he's going to get it into the wall without a hammer. Mam says he could go borrow one from the people next door but he says you don't go around borrowing from people you don't know. He leans the picture against the wall and drives the nail with the bottom of a jam jar. The jam jar breaks and cuts his hand and a blob of blood falls on the Pope's head. He wraps his hand in the dish rag and tells Mam, Quick, quick, wipe the blood off the Pope before it dries. She tries to wipe the blood away with her sleeve but it's wool and spreads the blood till the whole side of the Pope's face is smeared. Dad says, Lord above, Angela, you've destroyed the Pope entirely, and she says, Arrah, stop your whining, we'll get some paint and go over his face some day, and Dad says, He's the only Pope that was ever a friend to the workingman and what are we to say if someone from the St. Vincent de Paul Society comes in and sees blood all over him? Mam says, I don't know. It's your blood and 'tis a sad thing when a man can't even drive a nail straight. It just goes to show how useless you are. You'd be better off digging fields and anyway I don't care. I have pain in my back and I'm going to bed.
Och, what am I going to do? Dad says.
Take down the Pope and hide him in the coal hole under the stairs where he won't be seen and he'll be out of harm's way.
I can't, says Dad. It would be bad luck. Coal hole is no place for a Pope. When the Pope is up, he's up.
Suit yourself, says Mam.
I will, says Dad.
This is our first Christmas in Limerick and the girls are out in
the lane, skipping rope and singing, Christmas is coming And the goose is getting fat, Please put a penny In the old man's hat.
If you haven't a penny
A ha'penny will do
And if you haven't a ha'penny
God bless you.
Boys tease the girls and call out,
May your mother have an accident
Abroad in the loo.
Mam says she'd like to have a nice Christmas dinner but what can you do when the Labour Exchange reduces the dole to sixteen shillings after Oliver and Eugene died? You pay the rent of six shillings, you have ten shillings left, and what use is that to four people?
Dad can't get any work. He gets up early on weekdays, lights the fire, boils water for the tea and his shaving mug. He puts on a shirt and attaches a collar with studs. He puts on his tie and his cap and goes to the Labour Exchange to sign for the dole. He will never leave the house without collar and tie. A man without collar and tie is a man with no respect for himself. You never know when the clerk at the Labour Exchange might tell you there's a job going at Rank's Flour Mills or the Limerick Cement Company, and even if it's a laboring job what will they think if you appear without collar and tie?
Bosses and foremen always show him respect and say they're ready to hire him, but when he opens his mouth and they hear the North of Ireland accent, they take a Limerickman instead. That's what he tells Mam by the fire and when she says, Why don't you dress like a proper workingman? he says he'll never give an inch, never let them know, and when she says, Why can't you try to talk like a Limerickman? he says he'll never sink that low and the greatest sorrow of his life is that his sons are now afflicted with the Limerick accent. She says, Sorry for your troubles and I hope that's all you'll ever have, and he says that some day, with God's help, we'll get out of Limerick and far from the Shannon that kills.
I ask Dad what afflicted means and he says, Sickness, son, and things that don't fit.
When he's not looking for work Dad goes for long walks, miles into the country. He asks farmers if they need any help, that he grew up on a farm and can do anything. If they hire him he goes to work right away with his cap on and his collar and tie. He works so hard and long the farmers have to tell him to stop. They wonder how a man can work through a long hot day with no thought of food or drink. Dad smiles. He never brings home the money he earns on farms. That money seems to be different from the dole, which is supposed to be brought home. He takes the farm money to the pub and drinks it. If he's not home when the Angelus rings at six o'clock Mam knows he had a day of work. She hopes he might think of his family and pass the pub even once, but he never does. She hopes he might bring home something from the farm, potatoes, cabbage, turnips, carrots, but he'll never bring home anything because he'd never stoop so low as to ask a farmer for anything. Mam says 'tis all right for her to be begging at the St. Vincent de Paul Society for a docket for food but he can't stick a few spuds in his pocket. He says it's different for a man. You have to keep the dignity. Wear your collar and tie, keep up the appearance, and never ask for anything. Mam says, I hope it keeps fine for you.
When the farm money is gone he rolls home singing and crying over Ireland and his dead children, mostly about Ireland. If he sings Roddy McCorley, it means he had only the price of a pint or two. If he sings Kevin Barry, it means he had a good day, that he is now falling down drunk and ready to get us out of bed, line us up and make us promise to die for Ireland, unless Mam tells him leave us alone or she'll brain him with the poker.
You wouldn't do that, Angela.
I would and more. You better stop the nonsense and go to bed.
Bed, bed, bed. What's the use of going to bed? If I go to bed I'll
only have to get up again and I can't sleep in a place where there's a river sending poison to us in mist and fog.
He goes to bed, pounds the wall with his fist, sings a woeful song, falls asleep. He's up at daylight because no one should sleep beyond the dawn. He wakes Malachy and me and we're tired from being kept up the night before with his talking and singing. We complain and say we're sick, we're tired, but he pulls back the overcoats that cover us and forces us out on the floor. It's December and it's freezing and we can see our breath. We pee into the bucket by the bedroom door and run down stairs for the warmth of the fire Dad has already started. We wash our faces and hands in a basin that sits under the water tap by the door. The pipe that leads to the tap has to be held to the wall by a piece of twine looped around a nail. Everything around the tap is damp, the floor, the wall, the chair the basin sits on. The water from the tap is icy and our fingers turn numb. Dad says this is good for us, it will make men of us. He throws the icy water on his face and neck and chest to show there's nothing to fear. We hold our hands to the fire for the heat that's in it but we can't stay there long because we have to drink our tea and eat our bread and go to school. Dad makes us say grace before meals and grace after meals and he tells us be good boys at school because God is watching every move and the slightest disobedience will send us straight to hell where we'll never have to worry about the cold again.
And he smiles.
Two weeks before Christmas Malachy and I come home from school in a heavy rain and when we push in the door we find the kitchen empty. The table and chairs and trunk are gone and the fire is dead in the grate. The Pope is still there and that means we haven't moved again. Dad would never move without the Pope. The kitchen floor is wet, little pools of water all around, and the walls are twinkling with the damp. There's a noise upstairs and when we go up we find Dad and Mam and the missing furniture. It's nice and warm there with a fire blazing in the grate, Mam sitting in the bed, and Dad reading The Irish Press and smoking a cigarette by the fire. Mam tells us there was a terrible flood, that the rain came down the lane and poured in under our door. They tried to stop it with rags but they only turned sopping wet and let the rain in. People emptying their buckets made it worse and there was a sickening stink in the kitchen. She thinks we should stay upstairs as long as there is rain. We'll be warm through the winter months and then we can go downstairs in the springtime if there is any sign of a dryness in the walls or the floor. Dad says it's like going away on our holidays to a warm foreign place like Italy. That's what we'll call the upstairs from now on, Italy. Malachy says the Pope is still on the wall downstairs and he's going to be all cold and couldn't we bring him up? but Mam says, No, he's going to stay where he is because I don't want him on the wall glaring at me in the bed. Isn't it enough that we dragged him all the way from Brooklyn to Belfast to Dublin to Limerick? All I want now is a little peace, ease and comfort....
Mam takes Malachy and me to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to stand in the queue and see if there's any chance of getting something for the Christmas dinner-a goose or a ham, but the man says everyone in
Limerick is desperate this Christmas. He gives her a docket for groceries at McGrath's shop and another one for the butcher.
No goose, says the butcher, no ham. No fancy items when you bring the docket from the St. Vincent de Paul. What you can have now, missus, is black pudding and tripe or a sheep's head or a nice pig's head. No harm in a pig's head, missus, plenty of meat and children love it, slice that cheek, slather it with mustard and you're in heaven, though I suppose they wouldn't have the likes of that in America where they're mad for the steak and all classes of poultry, flying, walking or swimming itself.
He tells Mam, no, she can't have boiled bacon or sausages and if she has any sense she'll take the pig's head before they're all gone the way the poor people of Limerick are clamoring for them.
Mam says the pig's head isn't right for Christmas and he says 'tis more than the Holy Family had in that cold stable in Bethlehem long ago. You wouldn't find them complaining if someone offered them a nice fat pig's head.
No, they wouldn't complain, says Mam, but they'd never eat the pig's head. They were Jewish.
And what does that have to do with it? A pig's head is a pig's head.
And a Jew is a Jew and 'tis against their religion and I don't blame them.
The butcher says, Are you a bit of an expert, missus, on the Jews and the pig.
I am not, says Mam, but there was a Jewish woman, Mrs. Leibowitz, in New York, and I don't know what we would have done without her.
The butcher takes the pig's head off a shelf and when Malachy says, Ooh, look at the dead dog, the butcher and Mam burst out laughing. He wraps the head in newspaper, hands it to Mam and says, Happy Christmas. Then he wraps up some sausages and tells her, Take these sausages for your breakfast on Christmas Day. Mam says, Oh, I can't afford sausages, and he says, Am I asking you for money? Am I? Take these sausages. They might help make up for the lack of a goose or a ham.
Sure, you don't have to do that, says Mam.
I know that, missus. If I had to do it, I wouldn't.
Mam says she has a pain in her back, that I'll have to carry the
pig's head. I hold it against my chest but it's damp and when the newspaper begins to fall away everyone can see the head. Mam says, I'm ashamed of me life that the world should know we're having pig's head for Christmas. Boys from Leamy's National School see me and they point and laugh. Aw, Gawd, look at Frankie McCourt an'his pig's snout. Is that what the Yanks ate for Christmas dinner, Frankie?
One calls to another, Hey, Christy, do you know how to ate a pig's
head?
No, I don't, Paddy.
Grab him by the ears an' chew the face offa him.
And Christy says, Hey, Paddy, do you know the only part of the pig the McCourts don't ate?
No, I don't, Christy.
The only part they don't ate is the oink.
After a few streets the newspaper is gone altogether and everyone
can see the pig's head. His nose is flat against my chest and pointing up at my chin and I feel sorry for him because he's dead and the world is
laughing at him. My sister and two brothers are dead, too, but if anyone laughed at them I'd hit them with a rock.
I wish Dad would come and help us because Mam has to stop every few steps and lean against a wall. She's holding her back and telling us she'll never be able to climb Barrack Hill. Even if Dad came he wouldn't be much use because he never carries anything, parcels, bags, packages. If you carry such things you lose your dignity. That's what he says. He carried the twins when they were tired and he carried the Pope, but that was not the same as carrying ordinary things like a pig's head. He tells Malachy and me that when you grow up you have to wear a collar and tie and never let people see you carry things.
He's upstairs sitting by the fire, smoking a cigarette, reading The Irish Press, which he loves because it's De Valera's paper and he thinks De Valera is the greatest man in the world. He looks at me and the pig's head and tells Mam it's a disgraceful thing to let a boy carry an object like that through the streets of Limerick. She takes off her coat and eases herself into the bed and tells him that next Christmas he can go out and find the dinner. She's worn out and gasping for a cup of tea so would he drop his grand airs, boil the water for the tea and fry some bread before his two small sons starve to death.
On Christmas morning he lights the fire early so that we can have sausages and bread and tea. Mam sends me to Grandma to see if we can borrow a pot for the pig's head. Grandma says, What are ye having for yeer dinner? Pig's head! Jesus, Mary an' Joseph, that's goin' beyond the beyonds. Couldn't your father get out and find a ham or a goose at least? What kind of man is he at all, at all?
Mam puts the head in the pot, just covered with water, and while the pig is boiling away Dad takes Malachy and me to Mass at the Redemptorist church. It's warm in the church and sweet with flowers and incense and candles. He takes us to see the Baby Jesus in the crib. He's a big fat baby with fair curls like Malachy. Dad tells us that's Jesus' mother there, Mary, in the blue dress, and his father, St. Joseph, the old man with the beard. He says they're sad because they know Jesus will grow up and be killed so that we can all go to heaven. I ask why the Baby Jesus has to die and Dad says you can't ask questions like that. Malachy says, Why? and Dad tells him be quiet.
Mam is in a terrible state at home. There isn't enough coal to cook the dinner, the water isn't boiling anymore and she says she's demented with worry. We'll have to go down the Dock Road again to see if there's any coal or turf lying around from the lorries. Surely we'll find something on the road this day of all days. Even the poorest of the poor don't go out on Christmas Day picking coal off the road. There's no use asking Dad to go because he will never stoop that low and even if he did he won't carry things through the streets. It's a rule he has. Mam can't go because of the pain in her back.
She says, You'll have to go, Frank, and take Malachy with you.
It's a long way to the Dock Road but we don't mind because our bellies are filled with sausages and bread and it's not raining. We carry a canvas bag Mam borrowed from Mrs. Hannon next door and Mam is right, there is no one on the Dock Road. The poor are all at home having pig's head or maybe a goose and we have the Dock Road to ourselves. We find bits of coal and turf stuck in cracks on the road and in the walls of the coal yards. We find bits of paper and cardboard that will be useful in starting the fire again. We're wandering around trying to fill the bag
when Pa Keating comes along. He must have washed himself for Christmas because he's not as black as he was when Eugene died. He wants to know what we're doing with that bag and when Malachy tells him he says, Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! Christmas Day and ye don't have a fire for yeer pig's head. That's a bloody disgrace.
He takes us to South's pub, which is not supposed to be open, but he's a regular customer and there's a back door for men who want their pint to celebrate the birthday of the Baby Jesus above in the crib. He orders his pint and lemonade for us and asks the man if there's any chance of getting a few lumps of coal. The man says he's been serving drink for twenty-seven years and nobody ever asked him for coal before. Pa says it would be a favor and the man says if Pa asked for the moon he'd fly up and bring it back. The man leads us to the coal hole under the stairs and tells us take what we can carry. It's real coal and not bits from the Dock Road and if we can't carry it we can drag it along the ground.
It takes us a long time to go from South's pub to Barrack Hill because of a hole in the bag. I pull the bag and it's Malachy's job to pick up the lumps that fall through the hole and put them back again. Then it starts to rain and we can't stand in a doorway till it passes because we have that coal and it's leaving a black trail along the pavement and Malachy is turning black from picking up the lumps, pushing them into the bag and wiping the rain from his face with his wet black hands. I tell him he's black, he tells me I'm black, and a woman in a shop tells us get away from that door, 'tis Christmas Day and she doesn't want to be looking at Africa.
We have to keep dragging the bag or we'll never have our Christmas dinner. It will take ages to get a fire going and ages more to get our dinner because the water has to be boiling when Mam puts in the head of cabbage and the potatoes to keep the pig company in the pot. We drag the bag up O'Connell Avenue and we see people in their houses sitting around tables with all kinds of decorations and bright lights. At one house they push up the window and the children point and laugh and call to us, Look at the Zulus. Where are yeer spears?
Malachy makes faces at them and wants to throw coal at them but I tell him if he throws coal there's less for the pig and we'll never get our dinner.
The downstairs in our house is a lake again from the rain pouring under the door but it doesn't matter because we're drenched anyway and we can wade through the water. Dad comes down and drags the bag upstairs to Italy. He says we're good boys for getting so much coal, that the Dock Road must have been covered with it. When Mam sees us she starts to laugh, and then she cries. She's laughing because we're so black and crying because we're sopping wet. She tells us take off all our clothes and she washes the coal off our hands and faces. She tells Dad the pig's head can wait a while so that we can have a jam jar of hot tea.
It's raining outside and there's a lake downstairs in our kitchen but up here in Italy the fire is going again and the room is so dry and warm that, after our tea, Malachy and I doze off in the bed and we don't wake till Dad tells us the dinner is ready. Our clothes are still wet, so Malachy sits on the trunk at the table wrapped in Mam's red American overcoat and I'm wrapped in an old coat that Mam's father left behind when he went to Australia.
There are delicious smells in the room, cabbage, potatoes, and the pig's head, but when Dad lifts the head from the pot to a plate Malachy says, Oh, the poor pig. I don't want to eat the poor pig.
Mam says, If you were hungry you'd eat it. Now stop the nonsense and eat your dinner.
Dad says, Wait a minute. He takes slices from the two cheeks, places them on our plates and smears them with mustard. He takes the plate that holds the pig's head and puts it on the floor under the table. Now, he says to Malachy, that's ham, and Malachy eats it because he's not looking at what it came from and it isn't pig's head anymore. The cabbage is soft and hot and there are plenty of potatoes with butter and salt. Mam peels our potatoes but Dad eats his skin and all. He says all the nourishment of a potato is in the skin and Mam says it's a good thing he's not eating eggs, he'd be chewing the shells and all.
He says he would, and it's a disgrace that the Irish throw out millions of potato skins every day and that's why thousands are dying of consumption and surely there's nourishment in the shell of an egg since waste is the eighth deadly sin. If he had his way, and Mam says, Never mind your way. Eat your dinner.
He eats half a potato with its skin on and puts the other half back in the pot. He eats a small slice of the pig's cheek and a leaf of cabbage and leaves the rest on his plate for Malachy and me. He makes more tea and we have that with bread and jam so that no one can say we didn't have a sweet on Christmas Day.
It's dark now and still raining outside and the coal is glowing in the grate where Mam and Dad sit and smoke their cigarettes. There's nothing to do when your clothes are wet but get back into bed where it's cozy and your father can tell you a story about how Cuchulain became a Catholic and you fall asleep and dream about the pig standing in the crib at the Redemptorist church crying because he and the Baby Jesus and Cuchulain all have to grow up and die.
The angel that brought Margaret and the twins comes again and brings us another brother, Michael. Dad says he found Michael on the seventh step of the stairs to Italy. He says that's what you have to watch for when you ask for a new baby, the Angel on the Seventh Step.
Malachy wants to know how you can get a new brother from the Angel on the Seventh Step if you don't have any stairs in your house and Dad tells him that asking too many questions is an affliction.
Malachy wants to know what an affliction is.
Affliction. I'd like to know what that word means. Affliction, but Dad says, Och, child, the world is an affliction and everything in it, puts on his cap and goes to the Bedford Row Hospital to see Mam and Michael. She's in the hospital with the pain in her back and she has the baby with her to make sure he was healthy when he was left on the seventh step. I don't understand this because I'm sure angels would never leave a sick baby on the seventh step. There's no use asking Dad or Mam about this. They say, You're getting as bad as your brother for asking questions. Go play.
I know that big people don't like questions from children. They can ask all the questions they like, How's school? Are you a good boy? Did you say your prayers? but if you ask them did they say their prayers you might be hit on the head.
Dad brings Mam home with the new baby and she has to stay in bed for a few days with the pain in her back. She says this baby is the
spitting image of our sister who died, with his wavy black hair, his lovely blue eyes, and the gorgeous eyebrows. That's what Mam says.
I want to know if the baby will be spitting. I also want to know which is the seventh step because there are nine steps on the stairs and I'd like to know if you count from the bottom or the top. Dad doesn't mind answering this question. Angels come down from above, he says, and not up from kitchens like ours which are lakes from October till April.
So I find the seventh step by counting from the top.
The baby Michael has a cold. His head is stuffed and he can barely breathe. Mam worries because it's Sunday and the Dispensary for the poor is closed. If you go to the doctor's house and the maid sees you're from the lower classes she tells you go to the Dispensary where you belong. If you tell her the child is dying in your arms she'll say the doctor is in the country riding his horse.
Mam cries because the baby is struggling to get air through his mouth. She tries to clear his nostrils with a bit of rolled up paper but she's afraid to push it too far up. Dad says, There's no need for that. You're not supposed to be pushing things inside a child's head. It looks like he's going to kiss the baby. Instead, he has his mouth on the little nose and he's sucking sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head. He spits it into the fire, Michael gives out a loud cry and you can see him drawing the air into his head and kicking his legs and laughing. Mam looks at Dad as if he just came down from heaven and Dad says, That's what we did in Antrim long before there were doctors riding their horses.
Michael entitles us to a few extra shillings on the dole but Mam says it isn't enough and now she has to go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society for food. One night there is a knock on the door and Mam sends me down to see who it is. There are two men from the St. Vincent de Paul and they want to see my mother and father. I tell them my parents are upstairs in Italy and they say, What?
Upstairs where 'tis dry. I'll tell them.
They want to know what that little shed is beside our front door. I tell them it's the lavatory. They want to know why it isn't in the back of the house and I tell them it's the lavatory for the whole lane and it's a good thing it's not in the back of our house or we'd have people traipsing through our kitchen with buckets that would make you sick.
They say, Are you sure there's one lavatory for the whole lane? I am.
They say, Mother of God.
Mam calls down from Italy. Who's down there?
The men.
What men? From the St. Vincent de Paul.
They're careful the way they step into the lake in the kitchen and
they make tsk tsk and tut tut noises and they tell one another, Isn't this a disgrace? till they get upstairs to Italy. They tell Mam and Dad they're sorry to disturb them but the Society has to be sure they're helping deserving cases. Mam offers them a cup of tea but they look around and say, No, thank you. They want to know why we're living upstairs. They want to know about the lavatory. They ask questions because big people can ask all the questions they like and write in notebooks, especially when they're wearing collars and ties and suits. They ask how old Michael is, how much Dad gets at the Labour Exchange, when did he last have a job, why doesn't he have a job now and what class of an accent is that he has?
Dad tells them the lavatory could kill us with every class of disease, that the kitchen floods in the winter and we have to move upstairs to stay dry. He says the River Shannon is responsible for all the dampness in the world and killing us one by one.
Malachy tells them we're living in Italy and they smile.
Mam asks if there's any chance of getting boots for Malachy and me and they say she'll have to come down to Ozanam House and apply. She says she hasn't been feeling well since the baby came and she wouldn't be able to stand long in a queue, but they say everyone has to be treated the same, even a woman down in the Irishtown that had triplets and, thank you, we'll make our report to the Society.
When they're leaving Malachy wants to show them where the angel left Michael on the seventh step but Dad tells him, Not now, not now. Malachy cries and one of the men gives him a piece of toffee from his pocket and I wish I had something to cry about so that I'd get a piece, too.
I have to go downstairs again and show the men where to step to keep their feet dry. They keep shaking their heads and saying, God Almighty and Mother of God, this is desperate. That's not Italy they have upstairs, that's Calcutta.
Dad is telling Mam up in Italy she should never beg like that. What do you mean, beg?
Don't you have any pride, begging for boots like that?
And what would you do, Mr. Grand Manner? Would you let them go
barefoot?
I'd rather fix the shoes they have.
The shoes they have are falling to pieces.
I can fix them, he says.
You can't fix anything. You're useless, she says.
He comes home the next day with an old bicycle tire. He sends me to
Mr. Hannon next door for the loan of a last and a hammer. He takes Mam's sharp knife and he hacks at the tire till he has pieces to fit on the soles and heels of our shoes. Mam tells him he's going to destroy the shoes altogether but he pounds away with the hammer, driving the nails through the rubber pieces and into the shoes. Mam says, God above, if you left the shoes alone they'd last till Easter, at least, and we might get the boots from the St. Vincent de Paul. But he won't stop till the soles and heels are covered with squares of rubber tire which stick out on each side of the shoe and flop before and behind. He makes us put on the shoes and tells us our feet will be good and warm but we don't want to wear them anymore because the tire pieces are so lumpy we stumble when we walk around Italy. He sends me back to Mr. Hannon with the last and hammer and Mrs. Hannon says, God above, what's up with your shoes? She laughs and Mr. Hannon shakes his head and I feel ashamed. I don't want to go to school next day and I pretend to be sick but Dad gets us up and gives us our fried bread and tea and tells us we should be grateful we have any shoes at all, that there are boys in Leamy's National School who go to school barefoot on bitter days. On our way to school Leamy's boys laugh at us because the tire pieces are so thick they add a few inches to our height and the boys say, How's the air up there? There are six or seven barefoot boys in my class and they don't say anything and I wonder if it's better to have shoes with rubber tires that make you trip and stumble or to go barefoot. If you have no shoes at all you'll have all the barefoot boys on your side. If you have rubber tires on your shoes
you're all alone with your brother and you have to fight your own battles. I sit on a bench in the schoolyard shed and take off my shoes and stockings but when I go into the class the master wants to know where my shoes are. He knows I'm not one of the barefoot boys and he makes me go back to the yard, bring in the shoes and put them on. Then he says to the class, There is sneering here. There is jeering at the misfortunes of others. Is there anyone in this class that thinks he's perfect? Raise your hands.
There are no hands. Is there anyone in this class that comes from a rich family with money galore to spend on shoes? Raise your hands.
There are no hands.
He says, There are boys here who have to mend their shoes whatever way they can. There are boys in this class with no shoes at all. It's not their fault and it's no shame. Our Lord had no shoes. He died shoeless. Do you see Him hanging on the cross sporting shoes? Do you, boys?
No, sir.
What is it you don't see Our Lord doing?
Hanging on the cross and sporting shoes, sir.
Now if I hear of one boy in this class jeering and sneering at
McCourt or his brother over their
will come out, boys?
The stick, sir.
The stick will sting, boys.
air, it will land on the backside
sneers. Where will it land, boys?
shoes the stick will come out. What
The ash plant will whistle through the
of the boy that jeers, the boy that
On the boy that jeers, sir.
And?
The boy that sneers, sir.
The boys bother us no more and we wear our shoes with the rubber
tires the few weeks to Easter when the St. Vincent de Paul Society gives us the gift of boots.
If I have to get up in the middle of the night to pee in the bucket I go to the top of the stairs and look down to see if the angel might be on the seventh step. Sometimes I'm sure there's a light there and if everyone's asleep I sit on the step in case the angel might be bringing another baby or just coming for a visit. I ask Mam if the angel just brings the babies and then forgets about them. She says, Of course not. The angel never forgets the babies and comes back to make sure the baby is happy.
I could ask the angel all kinds of questions and I'm sure he'd answer, unless it's a girl angel. But I'm sure a girl angel would answer questions, too. I never heard anyone say they didn't.
I sit on the seventh step a long time and I'm sure the angel is there. I tell him all the things you can't tell your mother or father for fear of being hit on the head or told go out and play. I tell him all about school and how I'm afraid of the master and his stick when he roars at us in Irish and I still don't know what he's talking about because I came from America and the other boys were learning Irish a year before me.
I stay on the seventh step till it gets too cold or Dad gets up and tells me go back to bed. He's the one who told me the angel comes to the seventh step in the first place and you'd think he'd know why I'm sitting there. I told him one night that I was waiting for the angel, and he said, Och, now, Francis, you're a bit of a dreamer.
I get back into bed but I can hear him whisper to my mother. The poor wee lad was sitting on the stairs talking away to an angel.
He laughs and my mother laughs and I think, Isn't it curious the way big people laugh over the angel who brought them a new child.
Before Easter we move back downstairs to Ireland. Easter is better than Christmas because the air is warmer, the walls are not dripping with the damp, and the kitchen isn't a lake anymore, and if we're up early we might catch the sun slanting for a minute through the kitchen window.
In fine weather men sit outside smoking their cigarettes if they have them, looking at the world and watching us play. Women stand with their arms folded, chatting. They don't sit because all they do is stay at home, take care of the children, clean the house and cook a bit and the men need the chairs. The men sit because they're worn out from walking to the Labour Exchange every morning to sign for the dole, discussing the world's problems and wondering what to do with the rest of the day. Some stop at the bookie to study the form and place a shilling or two on a sure thing. Some spend hours in the Carnegie Library reading English and Irish newspapers. A man on the dole needs to keep up with things because all the other men on the dole are experts on what's going on in the world. A man on the dole must be ready in case another man on the dole brings up Hitler or Mussolini or the terrible state of the Chinese millions. A man on the dole goes home after a day with the bookie or the newspaper and his wife will not begrudge him a few minutes with the ease and peace of his cigarette and his tea and time to sit in his chair and think of the world.
Easter is better than Christmas because Dad takes us to the Redemptorist church where all the priests wear white and sing. They're happy because Our Lord is in heaven. I ask Dad if the baby in the crib is dead and he says, No, He was thirty-three when He died and there He is, hanging on the cross. I don't understand how He grew up so fast that He's hanging there with a hat made of thorns and blood everywhere, dripping from His head, His hands, His feet, and a big hole near His belly.
Dad says I'll understand when I grow up. He tells me that all the time now and I want to be big like him so that I can understand everything. It must be lovely to wake up in the morning and understand everything. I wish I could be like all the big people in the church, standing and kneeling and praying and understanding everything.
At the Mass people go up to the altar and the priest puts something into their mouths. They come back to their seats with their heads down, their mouths moving. Malachy says he's hungry and he wants some, too. Dad says, Shush, that's Holy Communion, the body and blood of Our Lord.
But, Dad.
Shush, it's a mystery.
There's no use asking more questions. If you ask a question they
tell you it's a mystery, you'll understand when you grow up, be a good boy, ask your mother, ask your father, for the love o' Jesus leave me alone, go out and play.
Dad gets his first job in Limerick at the cement factory and Mam is happy. She won't have to stand in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society asking for clothes and boots for Malachy and me. She says it's not begging, it's charity, but Dad says it's begging and shameful. Mam says she can now pay off the few pounds she owes at Kathleen O'Connell's shop and she can pay back what she owes her own mother. She hates to be under obligation to anyone, especially her own mother.
The cement factory is miles outside Limerick and that means Dad has to be out of the house by six in the morning. He doesn't mind because he's used to the long walks. The night before Mam makes him a flask of tea, a sandwich, a hard-boiled egg. She feels sorry for him the way he has to walk three miles out and three miles back. A bicycle would be handy but you'd have to be working a year for the price of it.
Friday is payday and Mam is out of the bed early, cleaning the house and singing.
Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this...
There isn't much to clean in the house. She sweeps the kitchen floor and the floor of Italy upstairs. She washes the four jam jars we use for mugs. She says if Dad's job lasts we'll get proper cups and maybe saucers and some day, with the help of God and His Blessed Mother, we'll have sheets on the bed and if we save a long time a blanket or two instead of those old coats which people must have left behind during the Great Famine. She boils water and washes the rags that keep Michael from shitting all over the pram and the house itself. Oh, she says, we'll have a lovely tea when your Pop brings home the wages tonight.
Pop. She's in a good mood.
Sirens and whistles go off all over the city when the men finish work at half-past five. Malachy and I are excited because we know that when your father works and brings home the wages you get the Friday Penny. We know this from other boys whose fathers work and we know that after your tea you can go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and buy sweets. If your mother is in a good mood she might even give you tuppence to go to the Lyric Cinema the next day to see a film with James Cagney.
The men who work in factories and shops in the city are coming into the lanes to have their supper, wash themselves and go to the pub. The women go to the films at the Coliseum or the Lyric Cinema. They buy sweets and Wild Woodbine cigarettes and if their husbands are working a long time they treat themselves to boxes of Black Magic chocolates. They love the romance films and they have a great time crying their eyes out when there's an unhappy ending or a handsome lover goes away to be shot by Hindus and other non-Catholics.
We have to wait a long time for Dad to walk the miles from the cement factory. We can't have our tea till he's home and that's very hard because you smell the cooking of other families in the lane. Mam says it's a good thing payday is Friday when you can't eat meat because the smell of bacon or sausages in other houses would drive her out of her mind. We can still have bread and cheese and a nice jam jar of tea with lashings of milk and sugar and what more do you want?
The women are gone to the cinemas, the men are in the pubs, and still Dad isn't home. Mam says it's a long way to the cement factory even if he's a fast walker. She says that but her eyes are watery and she's not singing anymore. She's sitting by the fire smoking a Wild Woodbine she got on credit from Kathleen O'Connell. The fag is the only luxury she has and she'll never forget Kathleen for her goodness. She doesn't know how long she can keep the water boiling in this kettle. There's no use making the tea till Dad gets home because it will be stewed, coddled, boiled and unfit to drink. Malachy says he's hungry and she gives him a piece of bread and cheese to keep him going. She says, This job could be
the saving of us. 'Tis hard enough for him to get a job with his northern accent and if he loses this one I don't know what we're going to do.
The darkness is in the lane and we have to light a candle. She has to give us our tea and bread and cheese because we're so hungry we can't wait another minute. She sits at the table, eats a bit of bread and cheese, smokes her Wild Woodbine. She goes to the door to see if Dad is coming down the lane and she talks about the paydays when we searched for him all over Brooklyn. She says, Some day we'll all go back to America and we'll have a nice warm place to live and a lavatory down the hall like the one in Classon Avenue and not this filthy thing outside our door.
The women are coming home from the cinemas, laughing, and the men, singing, from the pubs. Mam says there's no use waiting up any longer. If Dad stays in the pubs till closing time there will be nothing left from his wages and we might as well go to bed. She lies in her bed with Michael in her arms. It's quiet in the lane and I can hear her crying even though she pulls an old coat over her face and I can hear in the distance, my father.
I know it's my father because he's the only one in Limerick who sings that song from the North, Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today. He comes round the corner at the top of the lane and starts Kevin Barry. He sings a verse, stops, holds on to a wall, cries over Kevin Barry. People stick their heads out windows and doors and tell him, For Jasus' sake, put a sock in it. Some of us have to get up in the morning for work. Go home and sing your feckin' patriotic songs.
He stands in the middle of the lane and tells the world to step outside, he's ready to fight, ready to fight and die for Ireland, which is more than he can say for the men of Limerick, who are known the length and breadth of the world for collaborating with the perfidious Saxons.
He's pushing in our door and singing,
And if, when all a vigil keep,
The West's asleep, the West's asleep! Alas! and well my Erin weep,
That Connacht lies in slumber deep,
But hark! a voice like thunder spake 'The West's awake! the West's awake! Sing, Oh, hurrah, let England quake, We'll watch till death for Erin's sake!'
He calls from the bottom of the stairs, Angela, Angela, is there a drop of tea in this house?
She doesn't answer and he calls again, Francis, Malachy, come down here, boys. I have the Friday Penny for you.
I want to go down and get the Friday Penny but Mam is sobbing with the coat over her mouth and Malachy says, I don't want his old Friday Penny. He can keep it.
Dad is stumbling up the stairs, making a speech about how we all have to die for Ireland. He lights a match and touches it to the candle by Mam's bed. He holds the candle over his head and marches around the room, singing, See who comes over the red-blossomed heather, Their green banners kissing the pure mountain air, Heads erect, eyes to front,
stepping proudly together, Sure freedom sits throned on each proud spirit there.
Michael wakes and lets out a loud cry, the Hannons are banging on the wall next door, Mam is telling Dad he's a disgrace and why doesn't he get out of the house altogether.
He stands in the middle of the floor with the candle over his head. He pulls a penny from his pocket and waves it to Malachy and me. Your Friday Penny, boys, he says. I want you to jump out of that bed and line up here like two soldiers and promise to die for Ireland and I'll give the two of you the Friday Penny.
Malachy sits up in the bed. I don't want it, he says.
And I tell him I don't want it, either.
Dad stands for a minute, swaying, and puts the penny back in his
pocket. He turns toward Mam and she says, You're not sleeping in this bed tonight. He makes his way downstairs with the candle, sleeps on a chair, misses work in the morning, loses the job at the cement factory, and we're back on the dole again.
IV
The master says it's time to prepare for First Confession and First Communion, to know and remember all the questions and answers in the catechism, to become good Catholics, to know the difference between right and wrong, to die for the Faith if called on.
The master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says, Och, Angela, puts on his cap and goes for a long walk.
The master says we're each to bring threepence for the First Communion catechism with the green cover. The catechism has all the questions and answers we have to know by heart before we can receive First Communion. Older boys in the fifth class have the thick Confirmation catechism with the red cover and that costs sixpence. I'd love to be big and important and parade around with the red Confirmation catechism but I don't think I'll live that long the way I'm expected to die for this or that. I want to ask why there are so many big people who haven't died for Ireland or the Faith but I know if you ask a question like that you get you the thump on the head or you're told go out and play.
It's very handy to have Mikey Molloy living around the corner from me. He's eleven, he has fits and behind his back we call him Molloy the Fit. People in the lane say the fit is an affliction and now I know what affliction means. Mikey knows everything because he has visions in his fits and he reads books. He's the expert in the lane on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General and he promises, I'll tell you everything, Frankie, when you're eleven like me and you're not so thick and ignorant.
It's a good thing he says Frankie so I'll know he's talking to me because he has crossed eyes and you never know who he's looking at. If he's talking to Malachy and I think he's talking to me he might go into a
rage and have a fit that will carry him off. He says it's a gift to have crossed eyes because you're like a god looking two ways at once and if you had crossed eyes in the ancient Roman times you had no problem getting a good job. If you look at pictures of Roman emperors you'll see there's always a great hint of crossed eyes. When he's not having the fit he sits on the ground at the top of the lane reading the books his father brings home from the Carnegie Library. His mother says books books books, he's ruining his eyes with the reading, he needs an operation to straighten them but who'll pay for it. She tells him if he keeps on straining his eyes they'll float together till he has one eye in the middle of his head. Ever after his father calls him Cyclops, who is in a Greek story.
Nora Molloy knows my mother from the queues at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. She tells Mam that Mikey has more sense than twelve men drinking pints in a pub. He knows the names of all the Popes from St. Peter to Pius the Eleventh. He's only eleven but he's a man, oh, a man indeed. Many a week he saves the family from pure starvation. He borrows a handcart from Aidan Farrell and knocks on doors all over Limerick to see if there are people who want coal or turf delivered, and down the Dock Road he'll go to haul back great bags a hundredweight or more. He'll run messages for old people who can't walk and if they don't have a penny to give him a prayer will do.
If he earns a little money he hands it over to his mother, who loves her Mikey. He is her world, her heart's blood, her pulse, and if anything ever happened to him they might as well stick her in the lunatic asylum and throw away the key.
Mikey's father, Peter, is a great champion. He wins bets in the pubs by drinking more pints than anyone. All he has to do is go out to the jakes, stick his finger down his throat and bring it all up so that he can start another round. Peter is such a champion he can stand in the jakes and throw up without using his finger. He's such a champion they could chop off his fingers and he'd carry on regardless. He wins all that money but doesn't bring it home. Sometimes he's like my father and drinks the dole itself and that's why Nora Molloy is often carted off to the lunatic asylum demented with worry over her hungry famishing family. She knows as long as you're in the asylum you're safe from the world and its torments, there's nothing you can do, you're protected, and what's the use of worrying. It's well known that all the lunatics in the asylum have to be dragged in but she's the only one that has to be dragged out, back to her five children and the champion of all pint drinkers.
You can tell when Nora Molloy is ready for the asylum when you see her children running around white with flour from poll to toe. That happens when Peter drinks the dole money and leaves her desperate and she knows the men will come to take her away. You know she's inside frantic with the baking. She wants to make sure the children won't starve while she's gone and she roams Limerick begging for flour. She goes to priests, nuns, Protestants, Quakers. She goes to Rank's Flour Mills and begs for the sweepings from the floor. She bakes day and night. Peter begs her to stop but she screams, This is what comes of drinking the dole. He tells her the bread will only go stale. There's no use talking to her. Bake bake bake. If she had the money she'd bake all the flour in Limerick and regions beyond. If the men didn't come from the lunatic asylum to take her away she'd bake till she fell to the floor.
The children stuff themselves with so much bread people in the lane say they're looking like loaves. Still the bread goes stale and Mikey is so bothered by the waste he talks to a rich woman with a cookbook and she tells him make bread pudding. He boils the hard bread in water and sour milk and throws in a cup of sugar and his brother loves it even if that's all they have the fortnight their mother is in the lunatic asylum.
My father says, Do they take her away because she's gone mad baking bread or does she go mad baking bread because they're taking her away?
Nora comes home calm as if she had been at the seaside. She always says, Where's Mikey? Is he alive? She worries over Mikey because he's not a proper Catholic and if he had a fit and died who knows where he might wind up in the next life. He's not a proper Catholic because he could never receive his First Communion for fear of getting anything on his tongue that might cause a fit and choke him. The master tried over and over with bits of the Limerick Leader but Mikey kept spitting them out till the master got into a state and sent him to the priest, who wrote to the bishop, who said, Don't bother me, handle it yourself. The master sent a note home saying Mikey was to practice receiving Communion with his father or mother but even they couldn't get him to swallow a piece of the Limerick Leader in the shape of a wafer. They even tried a piece of bread shaped like the wafer with bread and jam and it was no use. The priest tells Mrs. Molloy not to worry. God moves in mysterious ways His wonders to perform and surely He has a special purpose for Mikey, fits and all. She says, Isn't it remarkable he can swally all kinds of sweets and buns but if he has to swally the body of Our Lord he goes into a fit? Isn't that remarkable? She worries Mikey might have the fit and die and go to hell if he has any class of a sin on his soul though everyone knows he's an angel out of heaven. Mikey tells her God is not going to afflict you with the fit and then boot you into hell on top of it. What kind of a God would do a thing like that?
Are you sure, Mikey?
I am. I read it in a book.
He sits under the lamppost at the top of the lane and laughs over
his First Communion day, which was all a cod. He couldn't swallow the wafer but did that stop his mother from parading him around Limerick in his little black suit for The Collection? She said to Mikey, Well, I'm not lying so I'm not. I'm only saying to the neighbors, Here's Mikey in his First Communion suit. That's all I'm saying, mind you. Here's Mikey. If they think you swallied your First Communion who am I to contradict them and disappoint them? Mikey's father said, Don't worry, Cyclops. You have loads of time. Jesus didn't become a proper Catholic till he took the bread and wine at the Last Supper and He was thirty-three years of age. Nora Molloy said, Will you stop calling him Cyclops? He has two eyes in his head and he's not a Greek. But Mikey's father, champion of all pint drinkers, is like my uncle Pa Keating, he doesn't give a fiddler's fart what the world says and that's the way I'd like to be myself.
Mikey tells me the best thing about First Communion is The Collection. Your mother has to get you a new suit somehow so she can show you off to the neighbors and relations and they give you sweets and money and you can go to the Lyric Cinema to see Charlie Chaplin.
What about James Cagney?
Never mind James Cagney. Lots of blather. Charlie Chaplin is your only man. But you have to be with your mother on The Collection. The grown-up people of Limerick are not going to be handing out money to
every little Tom Dick and Mick with a First Communion suit that doesn't have his mother with him.
Mikey got over five shillings on his First Communion day and ate so many sweets and buns he threw up in the Lyric Cinema and Frank Goggin, the ticket man, kicked him out. He says he didn't care because he had money left over and went to the Savoy Cinema the same day for a pirate film and ate Cadbury chocolate and drank lemonade till his stomach stuck out a mile. He can't wait for Confirmation day because you're older, there's another collection and that brings more money than First Communion. He'll go to the cinema the rest of his life, sit next to girls from lanes and do dirty things like an expert. He loves his mother but he'll never get married for fear he might have a wife in and out of the lunatic asylum. What's the use of getting married when you can sit in cinemas and do dirty things with girls from lanes who don't care what they do because they already did it with their brothers. If you don't get married you won't have any children at home bawling for tea and bread and gasping with the fit and looking in every direction with their eyes. When he's older he'll go to the pub like his father, drink pints galore, stick the finger down the throat to bring it all up, drink more pints, win the bets and bring the money home to his mother to keep her from going demented.
He says he's not a proper Catholic which means he's doomed so he can do anything he bloody well likes. He says, I'll tell you more when you grow up, Frankie. You're too young now and you don't know your arse from your elbow.
The master, Mr. Benson, is very old. He roars and spits all over us every day. The boys in the front row hope he has no diseases for it's the spit that carries all the diseases and he might be spreading consumption right and left. He tells us we have to know the catechism backwards, forwards and sideways. We have to know the Ten Commandments, the Seven Virtues, Divine and Moral, the Seven Sacraments, the Seven Deadly Sins. We have to know by heart all the prayers, the Hail Mary, the Our Father, the Confiteor, the Apostles' Creed, the Act of Contrition, the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary. We have to know them in Irish and English and if we forget an Irish word and use English he goes into a rage and goes at us with the stick. If he had his way we'd be learning our religion in Latin, the language of the saints who communed intimately with God and His Holy Mother, the language of the early Christians, who huddled in the catacombs and went forth to die on rack and sword, who expired in the foaming jaws of the ravenous lion. Irish is fine for patriots, English for traitors and informers, but it's the Latin that gains us entrance to heaven itself. It's the Latin the martyrs prayed in when the barbarians pulled out their nails and cut their skin off inch by inch. He tells us we're a disgrace to Ireland and her long sad history, that we'd be better off in Africa praying to bush or tree. He tells us we're hopeless, the worst class he ever had for First Communion but as sure as God made little apples he'll make Catholics of us, he'll beat the idler out of us and the Sanctifying Grace into us.
Brendan Quigley raises his hand. We call him Question Quigley because he's always asking questions. He can't help himself. Sir, he says, what's Sanctifying Grace?
The master rolls his eyes to heaven. He's going to kill Quigley. Instead he barks at him, Never mind what's Sanctifying Grace, Quigley. That's none of your business. You're here to learn the catechism and do
what you're told. You're not here to be asking questions. There are too many people wandering the world asking questions and that's what has us in the state we're in and if I find any boy in this class asking questions I won't be responsible for what happens. Do you hear me, Quigley?
I do.
I do what?
I do, sir.
He goes on with his speech, There are boys in this class who will
never know the Sanctifying Grace. And why? Because of the greed. I have heard them abroad in the schoolyard talking about First Communion day, the happiest day of your life. Are they talking about receiving the body and blood of Our Lord? Oh, no. Those greedy little blaguards are talking about the money they'll get, The Collection. They'll go from house to house in their little suits like beggars for The Collection. And will they take any of that money and send it to the little black babies in Africa? Will they think of those little pagans doomed forever for lack of baptism and knowledge of the True Faith? Little black babies denied knowledge of the Mystical Body of Christ? Limbo is packed with little black babies flying around and crying for their mothers because they'll never be admitted to the ineffable presence of Our Lord and the glorious company of saints, martyrs, virgins. Oh, no. It's off to the cinemas, our First Communion boys run to wallow in the filth spewed across the world by the devil's henchmen in Hollywood. Isn't that right, McCourt?
'Tis, sir.
Question Quigley raises his hand again. There are looks around the room and we wonder if it's suicide he's after.
What's henchmen, sir?
The master's face goes white, then red. His mouth tightens and opens and spit flies everywhere. He walks to Question and drags him from his seat. He snorts and stutters and his spit flies around the room. He flogs Question across the shoulders, the bottom, the legs. He grabs him by the collar and drags him to the front of the room.
Look at this specimen, he roars.
Question is shaking and crying. I'm sorry, sir.
The master mocks him. I'm sorry, sir. What are you sorry for? I'm sorry I asked the question. I'll never ask a question again,
sir.
The day you do, Quigley, will be the day you wish God would take
you to His bosom. What will you wish, Quigley?
That God will take me to His bosom, sir.
Go back to your seat, you omadhaun, you poltroon, you thing from
the far dark corner of a bog.
He sits down with the stick before him on the desk. He tells
Question to stop the whimpering and be a man. If he hears a single boy in this class asking foolish questions or talking about The Collection again he'll flog that boy till the blood spurts.
what?
What will I do, boys?
Flog the boy, sir.
Till?
Till the blood spurts, sir.
Now, Clohessy, what is the Sixth Commandment?
Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not commit adultery
Thou shalt not commit adultery, sir.
And what is adultery, Clohessy?
Impure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, sir.
Good, Clohessy. You're a good boy. You may be slow and forgetful in
the sir department and you may not have a shoe to your foot but you're powerful with the Sixth Commandment and that will keep you pure.
Paddy Clohessy has no shoe to his foot, his mother shaves his head to keep the lice away, his eyes are red, his nose always snotty. The sores on his kneecaps never heal because he picks at the scabs and puts them in his mouth. His clothes are rags he has to share with his six brothers and a sister and when he comes to school with a bloody nose or a black eye you know he had a fight over the clothes that morning. He hates school. He's seven going on eight, the biggest and oldest boy in the class, and he can't wait to grow up and be fourteen so that he can run away and pass for seventeen and join the English army and go to India where it's nice and warm and he'll live in a tent with a dark girl with the red dot on her forehead and he'll be lying there eating figs, that's what they eat in India, figs, and she'll cook the curry day and night and plonk on a ukulele and when he has enough money he'll send for the whole family and they'll all live in the tent especially his poor father who's at home coughing up great gobs of blood because of the consumption. When my mother sees Paddy on the street she says, Wisha, look at that poor child. He's a skeleton with rags and if they were making a film about the famine he'd surely be put in the middle of it.
I think Paddy likes me because of the raisin and I feel a bit guilty because I wasn't that generous in the first place. The master, Mr. Benson, said the government was going to give us the free lunch so we wouldn't have to be going home in the freezing weather. He led us down to a cold room in the dungeons of Leamy's School where the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, was handing out the half pint of milk and the raisin bun. The milk was frozen in the bottles and we had to melt it between our thighs. The boys joked and said the bottles would freeze our things off and the master roared, Any more of that talk and I'll warm the bottles on the backs of yeer heads. We all searched our raisin buns for a raisin but Nellie said they must have forgotten to put them in and she'd inquire from the man who delivered. We searched again every day till at last I found a raisin in my bun and held it up. The boys started grousing and said they wanted a raisin and Nellie said it wasn't her fault. She'd ask the man again. Now the boys were begging me for the raisin and offering me everything, a slug of their milk, a pencil, a comic book. Toby Mackey said I could have his sister and Mr. Benson heard him and took him out to the hallway and knocked him around till he howled. I wanted the raisin for myself but I saw Paddy Clohessy standing in the corner with no shoes and the room was freezing and he was shivering like a dog that had been kicked and I always felt sad over kicked dogs so I walked over and gave Paddy the raisin because I didn't know what else to do and all the boys yelled that I was a fool and a feckin' eejit and I'd regret the day and after I handed the raisin to Paddy I longed for it but it was too late now because he pushed it right into his mouth and gulped it and looked at me and said nothing and I said in my head what kind of an eejit are you to be giving away your raisin.
Mr. Benson gave me a look and said nothing and Nellie Ahearn said, You're a great oul'Yankee, Frankie.
The priest will come soon to examine us on the catechism and everything else. The master himself has to show us how to receive Holy
Communion. He tells us gather round him. He fills his hat with the Limerick Leader torn into little bits. He gives Paddy Clohessy the hat, kneels on the floor, tells Paddy to take one bit of paper and place it on his tongue. He shows us how to stick out the tongue, receive the bit of paper, hold it a moment, draw in the tongue, fold your hands in prayer, look toward heaven, close your eyes in adoration, wait for the paper to melt in your mouth, swallow it, and thank God for the gift, the Sanctifying Grace wafting in on the odor of sanctity. When he sticks out his tongue we have to hold in the laugh because we never saw a big purple tongue before. He opens his eyes to catch the boys who are giggling but he can't say anything because he still has God on his tongue and it's a holy moment. He gets off his knees and tells us kneel around the classroom for the Holy Communion practice. He goes around the room placing bits of paper on our tongues and mumbling in Latin. Some boys giggle and he roars at them that if the giggling doesn't stop it's not Holy Communion they'll be getting but the Last Rites and what is that sacrament called, McCourt?
Extreme Unction, sir.
That's right, McCourt. Not bad for a Yank from the sinful shores of Amerikay.
He tells us we have to be careful to stick out our tongues far enough so that the Communion wafer won't fall to the floor. He says, That's the worst thing that can happen to a priest. If the wafer slides off your tongue that poor priest has to get down on his two knees, pick it up with his own tongue and lick the floor around it in case it bounced from one spot to another. The priest could get a splinter that would make his tongue swell to the size of a turnip and that's enough to choke you and kill you entirely.
He tells us that next to a relic of the True Cross the Communion wafer is the holiest thing in the world and our First Communion is the holiest moment in our lives. Talking about First Communion makes the master all excited. He paces back and forth, waves his stick, tells us we must never forget that the moment the Holy Communion is placed on our tongues we become members of that most glorious congregation, the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church, that for two thousand years men, women and children have died for the Faith, that the Irish have nothing to be ashamed of in the martyr department. Haven't we provided martyrs galore? Haven't we bared our necks to the Protestant ax? Haven't we mounted the scaffold, singing, as if embarking on a picnic, haven't we, boys?
We have, sir.
What have we done, boys?
Bared our necks to the Protestant ax, sir.
And?
Mounted the scaffold singing, sir.
As if?
Embarking on a picnic, sir.
He says that, perhaps, in this class there is a future priest or a
martyr for the Faith, though he doubts it very much for we are the laziest gang of ignoramuses it has ever been his misfortune to teach.
But it takes all kinds, he says, and surely God had some purpose when He sent the likes of ye to infest this earth. Surely God had a purpose when among us He sent Clohessy with no shoes, Quigley with his damnable questions and McCourt heavy with sin from America. And remember
this, boys, God did not send His only begotten Son to hang on the cross so that ye can go around on yeer First Communion day with the paws clutching for The Collection. Our Lord died so that ye might be redeemed. It is enough to receive the gift of Faith. Are ye listening to me?
We are, sir.
And what's enough?
The gift of Faith, sir.
Good. Go home.
At night three of us sit under the light pole at the top of the
lane reading, Mikey, Malachy and I. The Molloys are like us with their father drinking the dole money or the wages and leaving no money for candles or paraffin oil for the lamp. Mikey reads books and the rest of us read comic books. His father, Peter, brings books from the Carnegie Library so that he'll have something to do when he's not drinking pints or when he's looking after the family anytime Mrs. Molloy is in the lunatic asylum. He lets Mikey read any book he likes and now Mikey is reading this book about Cuchulain and talking as if he knows everything about him. I want to tell him I knew all about Cuchulain when I was three going on four, that I saw Cuchulain in Dublin, that Cuchulain thinks nothing of dropping into my dreams. I want to tell him stop talking about Cuchulain, he's mine, he was mine years ago when I was young, but I can't because Mikey reads us a story I never heard of before, a dirty story about Cuchulain which I can never tell my father or mother, the story of how Emer became Cuchulain's wife.
Cuchulain was getting to be an old man of twenty-one. He was lonely and wanted to get married, which made him weak, says Mikey, and got him killed in the end. All the women in Ireland were mad about Cuchulain and they wanted to marry him. He said that would be grand, he wouldn't mind marrying all the women of Ireland. If he could fight all the men of Ireland why couldn't he marry all the women? But the King, Conor MacNessa, said, That's all very well for you, Cu, but the men of Ireland don't want to be lonely in the far reaches of the night. The King decided there would have to be a contest to see who would marry Cuchulain and it would be a pissing contest. All the women of Ireland assembled on the plains of Muirthemne to see who could piss the longest and it was Emer. She was the champion woman pisser of Ireland and married Cuchulain and that's why to this day she is called Great Bladdered Emer.
Mikey and Malachy laugh over this story though I don't think Malachy understands it. He's young and far from his First Communion and he's only laughing over the piss word. Then Mikey tells me I've committed a sin by listening to a story that has that word in it and when I go to my First Confession I'll have to tell the priest. Malachy says, That's right. Piss is a bad word and you have to tell the priest because 'tis a sin word.
I don't know what to do. How can I go to the priest and tell him this terrible thing in my First Confession? All the boys know what sins they're going to tell so that they'll get the First Communion and make The Collection and go to see James Cagney and eat sweets and cakes at the Lyric Cinema. The master helped us with our sins and everyone has the same sins. I hit my brother. I told a lie. I stole a penny from my mother's purse. I disobeyed my parents, I ate a sausage on Friday.
But now I have a sin no one else has and the priest is going to be shocked and drag me out of the confession box into the aisle and out into the street where everyone will know I listened to a story about
Cuchulain's wife being the champion woman pisser in all Ireland. I'll never be able to make my First Communion and mothers will hold their small children up and point at me and say, Look at him. He's like Mikey Molloy, never made his First Communion, wandering around in a state of sin, never made The Collection, never saw James Cagney.
I'm sorry I ever heard of First Communion and The Collection. I'm sick and I don't want any tea or bread or anything. Mam tells Dad it's a strange thing when a child won't have his bread and tea and Dad says, Och, he's just nervous over the First Communion. I want to go over to him and sit on his lap and tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me but I'm too big to be sitting on laps and if I did Malachy would go out in the lane and tell everyone I was a big baby. I'd like to tell my troubles to the Angel on the Seventh Step but he's busy bringing babies to mothers all over the world. Still, I'll ask Dad.
Dad, does the Angel on the Seventh Step have other jobs besides bringing babies?
He does.
Would the Angel on the Seventh Step tell you what to do if you didn't know what to do?
Och, he would, son, he would. That's the job of an angel, even the one on the seventh step.
Dad goes for a long walk, Mam takes Michael and goes to see Grandma, Malachy plays in the lane, and I have the house to myself so that I can sit on the seventh step and talk to the angel. I know he's there because the seventh step feels warmer than the other steps and there's a light in my head. I tell him my troubles and I hear a voice. Fear not, says the voice.
He's talking backward and I tell him I don't know what he's talking about.
Do not fear, says the voice. Tell the priest your sin and you'll be forgiven.
Next morning I'm up early and drinking tea with Dad and telling him about the Angel on the Seventh Step. He places his hand on my forehead to see if I'm feeling all right. He asks if I'm sure I had a light in my head and heard a voice and what did the voice say?
I tell him the voice said Fear not and that means Do not fear.
Dad tells me the angel is right, I shouldn't be afraid, and I tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me. I tell him all about Great Bladdered Emer and I even use the piss word because the angel said, Fear not. Dad puts down his jam jar of tea and pats the back of my hand. Och, och, och, he says, and I wonder if he's going demented like Mrs. Molloy, in and out of the lunatic asylum, but he says, Is that what you were worried about last night?
I tell him it is and he says it's not a sin and I don't have to tell the priest.
But the Angel on the Seventh Step said I should.
All right. Tell the priest if you like but the Angel on the Seventh Step said that only because you didn't tell me first. Isn't it better to be able to tell your father your troubles rather than an angel who is a light and a voice in your head?
'Tis, Dad.
The day before First Communion the master leads us to St. Joseph's Church for First Confession. We march in pairs and if we so much as move a lip on the streets of Limerick he'll kill us on the spot and send us to
hell bloated with sin. That doesn't stop the bragging about the big sins. Willie Harold is whispering about his big sin, that he looked at his sister's naked body. Paddy Hartigan says he stole ten shillings from his aunt's purse and made himself sick with ice cream and chips. Question Quigley says he ran away from home and spent half the night in a ditch with four goats. I try to tell them about Cuchulain and Emer but the master catches me talking and gives me a thump on the head.
We kneel in the pews by the confession box and I wonder if my Emer sin is as bad as looking at your sister's naked body because I know now that some things in the world are worse than others. That's why they have different sins, the sacrilege, the mortal sin, the venial sin. Then the masters and grown-up people in general talk about the unforgivable sin, which is a great mystery. No one knows what it is and you wonder how you can know if you've committed it if you don't know what it is. If I tell a priest about Great Bladdered Emer and the pissing contest he might say that's the unforgivable sin and kick me out of the confession box and I'll be disgraced all over Limerick and doomed to hell tormented forever by devils who have nothing else to do but stab me with hot pitchforks till I'm worn out.
I try to listen to Willie's confession when he goes in but all I can hear is a hissing from the priest and when Willie comes out he's crying.
It's my turn. The confession box is dark and there's a big crucifix hanging over my head. I can hear a boy mumbling his confession on the other side. I wonder if there's any use trying to talk to the Angel on the Seventh Step. I know he's not supposed to be hanging around confession boxes but I feel the light in my head and the voice is telling me, Fear not.
The panel slides back before my face and the priest says, Yes, my child?
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my First Confession. Yes, my child, and what sins have you committed?
I told a lie. I hit my brother. I took a penny from my mother's
purse. I said a curse.
Yes, my child. Anything else?
I, I listened to a story about Cuchulain and Emer.
Surely that's not a sin, my child. After all we are assured by
certain writers that Cuchulain turned Catholic in his last moments as did his King, Conor MacNessa.
'Tis about Emer, Father, and how she married him.
How was that, my child?
She won him in a pissing contest.
There is heavy breathing. The priest has his hand over his mouth
and he's making choking sounds and talking to himself, Mother o' God. Who, who told you that story, my child?
Mikey Molloy, Father.
And where did he hear it?
He read it in a book, Father.
Ah, a book. Books can be dangerous for children, my child. Turn your mind from those silly stories and think of the lives of the saints. Think of St. Joseph, the Little Flower, the sweet and gentle St. Francis of Assisi, who loved the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. Will you do that, my child?
I will, Father.
Are there any other sins, my child?
No, Father.
For your penance say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, and say a
special prayer for me.
I will. Father, was that the worst sin?
What do you mean?
Am I the worst of all the boys, Father?
No, my child, you have a long way to go. Now say an Act of
Contrition and remember Our Lord watches you every minute. God bless you, my child.
First Communion day is the happiest day of your life because of The Collection and James Cagney at the Lyric Cinema. The night before I was so excited I couldn't sleep till dawn. I'd still be sleeping if my grandmother hadn't come banging at the door.
Get up! Get up! Get that child outa the bed. Happiest day of his life an' him snorin' above in the bed.
I ran to the kitchen. Take off that shirt, she said. I took off the shirt and she pushed me into a tin tub of icy cold water. My mother scrubbed me, my grandmother scrubbed me. I was raw, I was red.
They dried me. They dressed me in my black velvet First Communion suit with the white frilly shirt, the short pants, the white stockings, the black patent leather shoes. Around my arm they tied a white satin bow and on my lapel they pinned the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a picture of the Sacred Heart, with blood dripping from it, flames erupting all around it and on top a nasty looking crown of thorns.
Come here till I comb your hair, said Grandma. Look at that mop, it won't lie down. You didn't get that hair from my side of the family. That's that North of Ireland hair you got from your father. That's the kind of hair you see on Presbyterians. If your mother had married a proper decent Limerickman you wouldn't have this standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair.
She spat twice on my head.
Grandma, will you please stop spitting on my head. If you have anything to say, shut up. A little spit won't kill you. Come on, we'll be late for the Mass.
We ran to the church. My mother panted along behind with Michael in her arms. We arrived at the church just in time to see the last of the boys leaving the altar rail where the priest stood with the chalice and the host, glaring at me. Then he placed on my tongue the wafer, the body and blood of Jesus. At last, at last.
It's on my tongue. I draw it back.
It stuck.
I had God glued to the roof of my mouth. I could hear the master's
voice, Don't let that host touch your teeth for if you bite God in two you'll roast in hell for eternity.
I tried to get God down with my tongue but the priest hissed at me, Stop that clucking and get back to your seat.
God was good. He melted and I swallowed Him and now, at last, I was a member of the True Church, an official sinner.
When the Mass ended there they were at the door of the church, my mother with Michael in her arms, my grandmother. They each hugged me to their bosoms. They each told me it was the happiest day of my life. They each cried all over my head and after my grandmother's contribution that morning my head was a swamp.
Mam, can I go now and make The Collection?
She said, After you have a little breakfast.
No, said Grandma. You're not making no collection till you've had a
proper First Communion breakfast at my house. Come on.
We followed her. She banged pots and rattled pans and complained
that the whole world expected her to be at their beck and call. I ate the egg, I ate the sausage, and when I reached for more sugar for my tea she slapped my hand away.
Go aisy with that sugar. Is it a millionaire you think I am? An American? Is it bedecked in glitterin' jewelry you think I am? Smothered in fancy furs?
The food churned in my stomach. I gagged. I ran to her backyard and threw it all up. Out she came.
Look at what he did. Thrun up his First Communion breakfast. Thrun up the body and blood of Jesus. I have God in me backyard. What am I goin' to do? I'll take him to the Jesuits for they know the sins of the Pope himself.
She dragged me through the streets of Limerick. She told the neighbors and passing strangers about God in her backyard. She pushed me into the confession box.
In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's a day since my last confession.
A day? And what sins have you committed in a day, my child?
I overslept. I nearly missed my First Communion. My grandmother said I have standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair. I threw up my First Communion breakfast. Now Grandma says she has God in her backyard and what should she do.
The priest is like the First Confession priest. He has the heavy breathing and the choking sounds.
Ah... ah... tell your grandmother to wash God away with a little water and for your penance say one Hail Mary and one Our Father. Say a prayer for me and God bless you, my child.
Grandma and Mam were waiting close to the confession box. Grandma said, Were you telling jokes to that priest in the confession box? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you were telling jokes to Jesuits I'll tear the bloody kidneys outa you. Now what did he say about God in me backyard?
He said wash Him away with a little water, Grandma. Holy water or ordinary water?
He didn't say, Grandma.
Well, go back and ask him.
But, Grandma...
She pushed me back into the confessional.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a minute since my last
confession.
A minute! Are you the boy that was just here?
I am, Father.
What is it now?
My grandma says, Holy water or ordinary water? Ordinary water, and
tell your grandmother not to be bothering me again.
I told her, Ordinary water, Grandma, and he said don't be bothering
him again.
Don't be bothering him again. That bloody ignorant bogtrotter.
I asked Mam, Can I go now and make The Collection? I want to see James Cagney.
Grandma said, You can forget about The Collection and James Cagney because you're not a proper Catholic the way you left God on the ground. Come on, go home.
Mam said, Wait a minute. That's my son. That's my son on his First Communion day. He's going to see James Cagney.
No he's not.
Yes he is.
Grandma said, Take him then to James Cagney and see if that will
save his Presbyterian North of Ireland American soul. Go ahead.
She pulled her shawl around her and walked away.
Mam said, God, it's getting very late for The Collection and you'll
never see James Cagney. We'll go to the Lyric Cinema and see if they'll let you in anyway in your First Communion suit.
We met Mikey Molloy on Barrington Street. He asked if I was going to the Lyric and I said I was trying. Trying? he said. You don't have money?
I was ashamed to say no but I had to and he said, That's all right. I'll get you in. I'll create a diversion.
What's a diversion?
I have the money to go and when I get in I'll pretend to have the fit and the ticket man will be out of his mind and you can slip in when I let out the big scream. I'll be watching the door and when I see you in I'll have a miraculous recovery. That's a diversion. That's what I do to get my brothers in all the time.
Mam said, Oh, I don't know about that, Mikey. Wouldn't that be a sin and surely you wouldn't want Frank to commit a sin on his First Communion day.
Mikey said if there was a sin it would be on his soul and he wasn't a proper Catholic anyway so it didn't matter. He let out his scream and I slipped in and sat next to Question Quigley and the ticket man, Frank Goggin, was so worried over Mikey he never noticed. It was a thrilling film but sad in the end because James Cagney was a public enemy and when they shot him they wrapped him in bandages and threw him in the door, shocking his poor old Irish mother, and that was the end of my First Communion day.

Grandma won't talk to Mam anymore because of what I did with God in her backyard. Mam doesn't talk to her sister, Aunt Aggie, or her brother Uncle Tom. Dad doesn't talk to anyone in Mam's family and they don't talk to him because he's from the North and he has the odd manner. No one talks to Uncle Tom's wife, Jane, because she's from Galway and she has the look of a Spaniard. Everyone talks to Mam's brother Uncle Pat, because he was dropped on his head, he's simple, and he sells newspapers. Everyone calls him The Abbot or Ab Sheehan and no one knows why. Everyone talks to Uncle Pa Keating because he was gassed in the war and married Aunt Aggie and if they didn't talk to him he wouldn't give a fiddler's fart anyway and that's why the men in South's pub call him a gas man.
That's the way I'd like to be in the world, a gas man, not giving a fiddler's fart, and that's what I tell the Angel on the Seventh Step till I remember you're not supposed to say fart in the presence of an angel.
Uncle Tom and Galway Jane have children but we're not supposed to talk to them because our parents are not talking. They have a son and daughter, Gerry and Peggy, and Mam will yell at us for talking to them but we don't know how not to talk to our cousins.
People in families in the lanes of Limerick have their ways of not talking to each other and it takes years of practice. There are people who don't talk to each other because their fathers were on opposite sides in the Civil War in 1922. If a man goes off and joins the English army his family might as well move to another part of Limerick where there are families with men in the English army. If anyone in your family was the least way friendly to the English in the last eight hundred years it will be brought up and thrown in your face and you might as well move to Dublin where no one cares. There are families that are ashamed of themselves because their forefathers gave up their religion for the sake of a bowl of Protestant soup during the Famine and those families are known ever after as soupers. It's a terrible thing to be a souper because you're doomed forever to the souper part of hell. It's even worse to be an informer. The master at school said that everytime the Irish were about to demolish the English in a fair fight a filthy informer betrayed them. A man who's discovered to be an informer deserves to be hanged or, even worse, to have no one talk to him for if no one talks to you you're better off hanging at the end of a rope.
In every lane there's always someone not talking to someone or everyone not talking to someone or someone not talking to everyone. You can always tell when people are not talking by the way they pass each other. The women hoist their noses, tighten their mouths and turn their faces away. If the woman is wearing a shawl she takes a corner and flings it over her shoulder as if to say, One word or look from you, you ma faced bitch, and I'll tear the countenance from the front of your head.
It's bad when Grandma won't talk to us because we can't run to her when we need to borrow sugar or tea or milk. There's no use going to Aunt Aggie. She'll only bite your head off. Go home, she'll say, and tell your father to get off his northern arse and get a job like the decent men of Limerick.
They say she's always angry because she has red hair or she has red hair because she's always angry.
Mam is friendly with Bridey Hannon, who lives next door with her mother and father. Mam and Bridey talk all the time. When my father goes for his long walk Bridey comes in and she and Mam sit by the fire drinking tea and smoking cigarettes. If Mam has nothing in the house Bridey brings tea, sugar and milk. Sometimes they use the same tea leaves over and over and Mam says the tea is stewed, coddled and boiled.
Mam and Bridey sit so close to the fire their shins turn red and purple and blue. They talk for hours and they whisper and laugh over secret things. We're not supposed to hear the secret things so we're told go out and play. I often sit on the seventh step listening and they have no notion I'm there. It might be lashing rain out but Mam says, Rain or no, out you go, and she'll tell us, If you see your father coming, run in and tell me. Mam says to Bridey, Did you ever hear that poem that someone must have made up about me and him?
What poem, Angela?
'Tis called ""The Man from the North. "" I got this poem from Minnie MacAdorey in America.
I never heard that poem. Say it for me.
Mam says the poem but she laughs all through it and I don't know why, He came from the North so his words were few But his voice was kind and his heart was true.
And I knew by his eyes that no guile had he, So I married my man from the North Country.
Oh, Garryowen may be more gay
Than this quiet man from beside Lough Neagh And I know that the sun shines softly down
On the river that runs through my native town.
But there's not-and I say it with joy and with pride A better man in all Munster wide
And Limerick town has no happier hearth
Than mine has been with my man from the North.
I wish that in Limerick they only knew The kind kind neighbors I came unto. Small hate or scorn would there ever be Between the South and the North Country.
She always repeats the third verse and laughs so hard she's crying and I don't know why. She goes into hysterics when she says, And Limerick town has no happier hearth Than mine has been with my man from the North.
If he comes back early and sees Bridey in the kitchen the man from the North says, Gossip, gossip, gossip, and stands there with his cap on till she leaves.
Bridey's mother and other people in our lane and lanes beyond will come to the door to ask Dad if he'll write a letter to the government or a relation in a distant place. He sits at the table with his pen and bottle of ink and when the people tell him what to write he says, Och, no, that's not what you want to say, and he writes what he feels like writing. The people tell him that's what they wanted to say in the first place, that he has a lovely way with the English language and a fine fist for the writing. They offer him sixpence for his trouble but he waves it away and they hand it to Mam because he's too grand to be taking sixpence. When the people leave he takes the sixpence and sends me to Kathleen O'Connell's shop for cigarettes.
Grandma sleeps in a big bed upstairs with a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus over her head and a statue of the Sacred Heart on the mantel piece. She wants to switch from gaslight to electric light someday so that she'll have a little red light under the statue forever. Her devotion to the Sacred Heart is known up and down the lane and in lanes beyond.
Uncle Pat sleeps in a small bed in a corner of the same room where Grandma can make sure he comes in at a proper hour and kneels by the bed to say his prayers. He might have been dropped on his head, he may not know how to read and write, he may drink one pint too many, but there's no excuse for not saying his prayers before he goes to sleep.
Uncle Pat tells Grandma he met a man who is looking for a place to stay that will let him wash himself morning and night and give him two
meals a day, dinner and tea. His name is Bill Galvin and he has a good job down at the lime kiln. He's covered all the time with white lime dust but surely that's better than coal dust.
Grandma will have to give up her bed and move into the small room. She'll take the Sacred Heart picture and leave the statue to watch over the two men. Besides, she has no place for a statue in her little room.
Bill Galvin comes after work to see the place. He's small, all white, and he snuffles like a dog. He asks Grandma if she'd mind taking down that statue because he's a Protestant and he wouldn't be able to sleep. Grandma barks at Uncle Pat for not telling her he was dragging a Protestant into the house. Jesus, she says, there will be gossip up and down the lane and beyond.
Uncle Pat says he didn't know Bill Galvin was a Protestant. You could never tell by looking at him especially the way he's covered with lime. He looks like an ordinary Catholic and you'd never imagine a Protestant would be shoveling lime.
Bill Galvin says his poor wife that just died was a Catholic and she had the walls covered with pictures of the Sacred Heart and the Virgin Mary showing their hearts. He's not against the Sacred Heart himself, it's just that seeing the statue will remind him of his poor wife and give him the heartache.
Grandma says, Ah, God help us, why didn't you tell me that in the first place? Sure I can put the statue on the windowsill in my room and your heart won't be tormented at the sight of it.
Every morning Grandma cooks Bill's dinner and takes it to him at the lime kiln. Mam wonders why he can't take it with him in the morning and Grandma says, Do you expect me to get up at dawn and boil cabbage and pig's toes for his lordship to take in his dinner can?
Mam tells her, In another week school will be over and if you give Frank sixpence a week he'll surely be glad to take Bill Galvin his dinner.
I don't want to go to Grandma's every day. I don't want to take Bill Galvin his dinner all the way down the Dock Road, but Mam says that's sixpence we could use and if I don't do it I'm going nowhere else.
You're staying in the house, she says. You're not playing with your
pals.
Grandma warns me to take the dinner can directly and not be
meandering, looking this way and that, kicking canisters and ruining the toes of my shoes. This dinner is hot and that's the way Bill Galvin wants
it.
There's a lovely smell from the dinner can, boiled bacon and
cabbage and two big floury white potatoes. Surely he won't notice if I try half a potato. He won't complain to Grandma because he hardly ever talks outside of a snuffle or two.
It's better if I eat the other half potato so that he won't be asking why he got a half. I might as well try the bacon and cabbage too and if I eat the other potato he'll surely think she didn't send one at all.
The second potato melts in my mouth and I'll have to try another bit of cabbage, another morsel of bacon. There isn't much left now and he'll be very suspicious so I might as well finish off the rest.
What am I going to do now? Grandma will destroy me, Mam will keep me in for a year. Bill Galvin will bury me in lime. I'll tell him I was
attacked by a dog on the Dock Road and he ate the whole dinner and I'm lucky I escaped without being eaten myself.
Oh, is that so? says Bill Galvin. And what's that bit of cabbage hanging on your gansey? Did the dog lick you wit his cabbagey gob? Go home and tell your grandmother you ate me whole dinner and I'm falling down with the hunger here in this lime kiln.
She'll kill me.
Tell her don't kill you till she sends me some class of a dinner and if you don't go to her now and get me a dinner I'll kill you and throw your body into the lime there and there won't be much left for your mother to moan over.
Grandma says, What are you doin' back with that can? He could bring that back by himself.
He wants more dinner.
What do you mean more dinner? Jesus above, is it a hole he has in his leg?
He's falling down with the hunger below in the lime kiln. Is it coddin' me you are?
He says send him any class of a dinner.
I will not. I sent him his dinner.
He didn't get it.
He didn't? Why not?
I ate it.
What?
I was hungry and I tasted it and I couldn't stop.
Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph.
She gives me a clout on the head that brings tears to my eyes. She
screams at me like a banshee and jumps around the kitchen and threatens to drag me to the priest, the bishop, the Pope himself if he lived around the corner. She cuts bread and waves the knife at me and makes sandwiches of brawn and cold potatoes.
Take these sandwiches to Bill Galvin and if you even look cross- eyed at them I'll skin your hide.
Of course she runs to Mam and they agree the only way I can make up for my terrible sin is to deliver Bill Galvin's dinner for a fortnight without pay. I'm to bring back the can every day and that means I have to sit watching him stuff the food into his gob and he's not one that would ever ask you if you had a mouth in your head.
Every day I take the can back Grandma makes me kneel to the statue of the Sacred Heart and tell Him I'm sorry and all this over Bill Galvin, a Protestant.
Mam says, I'm a martyr for the fags and so is your father.
There may be a lack of tea or bread in the house but Mam and Dad always manage to get the fags, the Wild Woodbines. They have to have the Woodbines in the morning and anytime they drink tea. They tell us every day we should never smoke, it's bad for your lungs, it's bad for your chest, it stunts your growth, and they sit by the fire puffing away. Mam says, If 'tis a thing I ever see you with a fag in your gob I'll break your face. They tell us the cigarettes rot your teeth and you can see they're not lying. The teeth turn brown and black in their heads and fall out one by one. Dad says he has holes in his teeth big enough for a sparrow to raise a family. He has a few left but he gets them pulled at the clinic and applies for a false set. When he comes home with the new teeth he shows his big new white smile that makes him look like an
American and whenever he tells us a ghost story by the fire he pushes the lower teeth up beyond his lip to his nose and frightens the life out of us. Mam's teeth are so bad she has to go to Barrington's Hospital to have them all pulled at the same time and when she comes home she's holding at her mouth a rag bright with blood. She has to sit up all night by the fire because you can't lie down when your gums are pumping blood or you'll choke in your sleep. She says she'll give up smoking entirely when this bleeding stops but she needs one puff of a fag this minute for the comfort that's in it. She tells Malachy go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and ask her would she ever let her have five Woodbines till Dad collects the dole on Thursday. If anyone can get the fags out of Kathleen, Malachy can. Mam says he has the charm, and she tells me, There's no use sending you with your long puss and your father's odd manner.
When the bleeding stops and Mam's gums heal she goes to the clinic for her false teeth. She says she'll give up the smoking when her new teeth are in but she never does. The new teeth rub on her gums and make them sore and the smoke of the Woodbines eases them. She and Dad sit by the fire when we have one and smoke their cigarettes and when they talk their teeth clack. They try to stop the clacking by moving their jaws back and forth but that only makes it worse and they curse the dentists and the people above in Dublin who made the teeth and while they curse they clack. Dad claims these teeth were made for rich people in Dublin and didn't fit so they were passed on to the poor of Limerick who don't care because you don't have much to chew when you're poor anyway and you're grateful you have any class of a tooth in your head. If they talk too long their gums get sore and the teeth have to come out. Then they sit talking by the fire with their faces collapsed. Every night they leave the teeth in the kitchen in jam jars filled with water. Malachy wants to know why and Dad tells him it cleans them. Mam says, No, you can't have teeth in your head while you're sleeping for they'll slip and choke you to death entirely.
The teeth are the cause of Malachy going to Barrington's Hospital and me having an operation. Malachy whispers to me in the middle of the night, Do you want to go downstairs and see if we can wear the teeth?
The teeth are so big we have trouble getting them into our mouths but Malachy won't give up. He forces Dad's upper teeth into his mouth and can't get them out again. His lips are drawn back and the teeth make a big grin. He looks like a monster in a film and it makes me laugh but he pulls at them and grunts, Uck, uck, and tears come to his eyes. The more he goes Uck, uck, the harder I laugh till Dad calls from upstairs, What are you boys doing? Malachy runs from me, up the stairs, and now I hear Dad and Mam laughing till they see he can choke on the teeth. They both stick their fingers in to pull out the teeth but Malachy gets frightened and makes desperate uck uck sounds. Mam says, We'll have to take him to the hospital, and Dad says he'll take him. He makes me go in case the doctor has questions because I'm older than Malachy and that means I must have started all the trouble. Dad rushes through the streets with Malachy in his arms and I try to keep up. I feel sorry for Malachy up there on Dad's shoulder, looking back at me, tears on his cheeks and Dad's teeth bulging in his mouth. The doctor at Barrington's Hospital says, No bother. He pours oil into Malachy's mouth and has the teeth out in a minute. Then he looks at me and says to Dad, Why is that child standing there with his mouth hanging open?
Dad says, That's a habit he has, standing with his mouth open.
The doctor says, Come here to me. He looks up my nose, in my ears, down my throat, and feels my neck.
The tonsils, he says. The adenoids. They have to come out. The sooner the better or he'll look like an idiot when he grows up with that gob wide as a boot.
Next day Malachy gets a big piece of toffee as a reward for sticking in teeth he can't get out and I have to go to the hospital to have an operation that will close my mouth.
On a Saturday morning Mam finishes her tea and says, You're going to dance.
Dance? Why?
You're seven years old, you made your First Communion, and now 'tis time for the dancing. I'm taking you down to Catherine Street to Mrs. O'Connor's Irish dancing classes. You'll go there every Saturday morning and that'll keep you off the streets. That'll keep you from wandering around Limerick with hooligans.
She tells me wash my face not forgetting ears and neck, comb my hair, blow my nose, take the look off my face, what look? never mind, just take it off, put on my stockings and my First Communion shoes which, she says, are destroyed because I can't pass a canister or a rock without kicking it. She's worn out standing in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society begging for boots for me and Malachy so that we can wear out the toes with the kicking. Your father says it's never too early to learn the songs and dances of your ancestors.
What's ancestors?
Never mind, she says, you're going to dance.
I wonder how I can die for Ireland if I have to sing and dance for
Ireland, too. I wonder why they never say, You can eat sweets and stay home from school and go swimming for Ireland.
Mam says, Don't get smart or I'll warm your ear.
Cyril Benson dances. He has medals hanging from his shoulders to his kneecaps. He wins contests all over Ireland and he looks lovely in his saffron kilt. He's a credit to his mother and he gets his name in the paper all the time and you can be sure he brings home the odd few pounds. You don't see him roaming the streets kicking everything in sight till the toes hang out of his boots, oh, no, he's a good boy, dancing for his poor mother.
Mam wets an old towel and scrubs my face till it stings, she wraps the towel around her finger and sticks it in my ears and claims there's enough wax there to grow potatoes, she wets my hair to make it lie down, she tells me shut up and stop the whinging, that these dancing lessons will cost her sixpence every Saturday, which I could have earned bringing Bill Galvin his dinner and God knows she can barely afford it. I try to tell her, Ah, Mam, sure you don't have to send me to dancing school when you could be smoking a nice Woodbine and having a cup of tea, but she says, Oh, aren't you clever. You're going to dance if I have to give up the fags forever.
If my pals see my mother dragging me through the streets to an Irish dancing class I'll be disgraced entirely. They think it's all right to dance and pretend you're Fred Astaire because you can jump all over the screen with Ginger Rogers. There is no Ginger Rogers in Irish dancing and you can't jump all over. You stand straight up and down and keep your arms against yourself and kick your legs up and around and never smile.
My uncle Pa Keating said Irish dancers look like they have steel rods up their arses, but I can't say that to Mam, she'd kill me.
There's a gramophone in Mrs. O'Connor's playing an Irish jig or a reel and boys and girls are dancing around kicking their legs out and keeping their hands to their sides. Mrs. O'Connor is a great fat woman and when she stops the record to show the steps all the fat from her chin to her ankles jiggles and I wonder how she can teach the dancing. She comes over to my mother and says, So, this is little Frankie? I think we have the makings of a dancer here. Boys and girls, do we have the makings of a dancer here?
We do, Mrs. O'Connor.
Mam says, I have the sixpence, Mrs. O'Connor.
Ah, yes, Mrs. McCourt, hold on a minute.
She waddles to a table and brings back the head of a black boy with
kinky hair, big eyes, huge red lips and an open mouth. She tells me put the sixpence in the mouth and take my hand out before the black boy bites me. All the boys and girls watch and they have little smiles. I drop in the sixpence and pull my hand back before the mouth snaps shut. Everyone laughs and I know they wanted to see my hand caught in the mouth. Mrs. O'Connor gasps and laughs and says to my mother, Isn't that a howl, now? Mam says it's a howl. She tells me behave myself and come home dancing. I don't want to stay in this place where Mrs. O'Connor can't take the sixpence herself instead of letting me nearly lose my hand in the black boy's mouth.
I don't want to stay in this place where you have to stand in line with boys and girls, straighten your back, hands by your sides, look ahead, don't look down, move your feet, move your feet, look at Cyril, look at Cyril, and there goes Cyril, all dressed up in his saffron kilt and the medals jingling, medals for this and medals for that and the girls love Cyril and Mrs. O'Connor loves Cyril for didn't he bring her fame and didn't she teach him every step he knows, oh, dance, Cyril, dance, oh, Jesus, he floats around the room, he's an angel out of heaven and stop the frowning, Frankie McCourt, or you'll have a puss on you like a pound of tripe, dance, Frankie, dance, pick up your feet for the love o' Jesus, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree, Maura, will you help that Frankie McCourt before he ties his two feet around his poll entirely, help him, Maura.
Maura is a big girl about ten. She dances up to me with her white teeth and her dancer's dress with all the gold and yellow and green figures that are supposed to come from olden times and she says, Give me your hand, little boy, and she wheels me around the room till I'm dizzy and making a pure eejit of myself and blushing and foolish till I want to cry but I'm saved when the record stops and the gramophone goes hoosh hoosh.
Mrs. O'Connor says, Oh, thank you, Maura, and next week, Cyril, you can show Frankie a few of the steps that made you famous. Next week, boys and girls, and don't forget the sixpence for the little black boy.
Boys and girls leave together. I make my own way down the stairs and out the door hoping my pals won't see me with boys who wear kilts and girls with white teeth and fancy dresses from olden times.
Mam is having tea with Bridey Hannon, her friend from next door. Mam says, What did you learn? and makes me dance around the kitchen, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree. She has a good
laugh with Bridey. That's not too bad for your first time. In a month you'll be like a regular Cyril Benson.
I don't want to be Cyril Benson. I want to be Fred Astaire.
They turn hysterical, laughing and squirting tea out of their mouths, Jesus love him, says Bridey. Doesn't he have a great notion of himself. Fred Astaire how are you.
Mam says Fred Astaire went to his lessons every Saturday and didn't go around kicking the toes out of his boots and if I wanted to be like him I'd have to go to Mrs. O'Connor's every week.
The fourth Saturday morning Billy Campbell knocks at our door. Mrs. McCourt, can Frankie come out and play? Mam tells him, No, Billy. Frankie is going to his dancing lesson.
He waits for me at the bottom of Barrack Hill. He wants to know why I'm dancing, that everyone knows dancing is a sissy thing and I'll wind up like Cyril Benson wearing a kilt and medals and dancing all over with girls. He says next thing I'll be sitting in the kitchen knitting socks. He says dancing will destroy me and I won't be fit to play any kind of football, soccer, rugby or Gaelic football itself because the dancing teaches you to run like a sissy and everyone will laugh.
I tell him I'm finished with the dancing, that I have sixpence in my pocket for Mrs. O'Connor that's supposed to go into the black boy's mouth, that I'm going to the Lyric Cinema instead. Sixpence will get the two of us in with tuppence left over for two squares of Cleeves' toffee, and we have a great time looking at Riders of the Purple Sage.
Dad is sitting by the fire with Mam and they want to know what steps I learned today and what they're called. I already did ""The Siege of Ennis"" and ""The Walls of Limerick, "" which are real dances. Now I have to make up names and dances. Mam says she never heard of a dance called ""The Siege of Dingle""but if that's what I learned go ahead, dance it, and I dance around the kitchen with my hands down by my sides making my own music, diddley eye di eye di eye diddley eye do you do you, Dad and Mam clapping in time with my feet. Dad says, Och, that's a fine dance and you'll be a powerful Irish dancer and a credit to the men who died for their country. Mam says, That wasn't much for a sixpence.
Next week it's a George Raft film and the week after that a cowboy film with George O'Brien. Then it's James Cagney and I can't take Billy because I want to get a bar of chocolate to go with my Cleeves' toffee and I'm having a great time till there's a terrible pain in my jaw and it's a tooth out of my gum stuck in my toffee and the pain is killing me. Still, I can't waste the toffee so I pull out the tooth and put it in my pocket and chew the toffee on the other side of my mouth blood and all. There's pain on one side and delicious toffee on the other and I remember what my uncle Pa Keating would say, There are times when you wouldn't know whether to shit or go blind.
I have to go home now and worry because you can't go through the world short a tooth without your mother knowing. Mothers know everything and she's always looking into our mouths to see if there's any class of disease. She's there by the fire and Dad is there and they're asking me the same old questions, the dance and the name of the dance. I tell them I learned ""The Walls of Cork"" and I dance around the kitchen trying to hum a made up tune and dying with the pain of my tooth. Mam says, ""Walls o' Cork, "" my eye, there's no such dance, and Dad says, Come over here. Stand there before me. Tell us the truth, Did you go to your dancing classes today?
I can't tell a lie anymore because my gum is killing me and there's blood in my mouth. Besides, I know they know everything and that's what they're telling me now. Some snake of a boy from the dancing school saw me going to the Lyric Cinema and told and Mrs. O'Connor sent a note to say she hadn't seen me in ages and was I all right because I had great promise and could follow in the footsteps of the great Cyril Benson.
Dad doesn't care about my tooth or anything. He says I'm going to confession and drags me over to the Redemptorist church because it's Saturday and confessions go on all day. He tells me I'm a bad boy, he's ashamed of me that I went to the pictures instead of learning Ireland's national dances, the jig, the reel, the dances that men and women fought and died for down those sad centuries. He says there's many a young man that was hanged and now moldering in a lime pit that would be glad to rise up and dance the Irish dance.
The priest is old and I have to yell my sins at him and he tells me I'm a hooligan for going to the pictures instead of my dancing lessons although he thinks himself that dancing is a dangerous thing almost as bad as the films, that it stirs up thoughts sinful in themselves, but even if dancing is an abomination I sinned by taking my mother's sixpence and lying and there's a hot place in hell for the likes of me, say a decade of the rosary and ask God's forgiveness for you're dancing at the gates of hell itself, child.
I'm seven, eight, nine going on ten and still Dad has no work. He drinks his tea in the morning, signs for the dole at the Labour Exchange, reads the papers at the Carnegie Library, goes for his long walks far into the country. If he gets a job at the Limerick Cement Company or Rank's Flour Mills he loses it in the third week. He loses it because he goes to the pubs on the third Friday of the job, drinks all his wages and misses the half day of work on Saturday morning.
Mam says, Why can't he be like the other men from the lanes of Limerick? They're home before the Angelus rings at six o'clock, they hand over their wages, change their shirts, have their tea, get a few shillings from the wife and they're off to the pub for a pint or two.
Mam tells Bridey Hannon that Dad can't be like that and won't be like that. She says he's a right bloody fool the way he goes to pubs and stands pints to other men while his own children are home with their bellies stuck to their backbones for the want of a decent dinner. He'll brag to the world he did his bit for Ireland when it was neither popular nor profitable, that he'll gladly die for Ireland when the call comes, that he regrets he has only one life to give for his poor misfortunate country and if anyone disagrees they're invited to step outside and settle this for once and for all.
Oh, no, says Mam, they won't disagree and they won't step outside, that bunch of tinkers and knackers and begrudgers that hang around the pubs. They tell him he's a grand man, even if he's from the North, and 'twould be an honor to accept a pint from such a patriot.
Mam tells Bridey, I don't know under God what I'm going to do. The dole is nineteen shillings and sixpence a week, the rent is six and six, and that leaves thirteen shillings to feed and clothe five people and keep us warm in the winter.
Bridey drags on her Woodbine, drinks her tea and declares that God is good. Mam says she's sure God is good for someone somewhere but He hasn't been seen lately in the lanes of Limerick.
Bridey laughs. Oh, Angela, you could go to hell for that, and Mam says, Aren't I there already, Bridey?
And they laugh and drink their tea and smoke their Woodbines and tell one another the fag is the only comfort they have.
'Tis.
Question Quigley tells me I have to go to the Redemptorist church on Friday and join the boys' division of the Arch Confraternity. You have to join. You can't say no. All the boys in the lanes and back streets that have fathers on the dole or working in laboring jobs have to join.
Question says, Your father is a foreigner from the North and he don't matter but you still have to join.
Everyone knows Limerick is the holiest city in Ireland because it has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family, the biggest sodality in the world. Any city can have a Confraternity, only Limerick has the Arch.
Our Confraternity fills the Redemptorist church five nights a week, three for the men, one for the women, one for the boys. There is Benediction and hymn singing in English, Irish and Latin and best of all the big powerful sermon Redemptorist priests are famous for. It's the sermon that saves millions of Chinese and other heathens from winding up in hell with the Protestants.
The Question says you have to join the Confraternity so that your mother can tell the St. Vincent de Paul Society and they'll know you're a good Catholic. He says his father is a loyal member and that's how he got a good pensionable job cleaning lavatories at the railway station and when he grows up himself he'll get a good job too unless he runs away and joins the Royal Canadian Mounted Police so that he can sing ""I'll Be Calling You Ooo Ooo Ooo, "" like Nelson Eddy singing to Jeanette MacDonald expiring with consumption there on the sofa. If he brings me to the Confraternity the man in the office will write his name in a big book and some day he might be promoted to prefect of a section, which is all he wants in life next to wearing the Mountie uniform.
The prefect is head of a section which is thirty boys from the same lanes and streets. Every section has the name of a saint whose picture is painted on a shield stuck on top of a pole by the prefect's seat. The prefect and his assistant take the attendance and keep an eye on us so that they can give us a thump on the head in case we laugh during Benediction or commit any other sacrileges. If you miss one night the man in the office wants to know why, wants to know if you're slipping away from the Confraternity or he might say to the other man in the office, I think our little friend here has taken the soup. That's the worst thing you can say to any Catholic in Limerick or Ireland itself because of what happened in the Great Famine. If you're absent twice the man in the office sends you a yellow summons to appear and explain yourself and if you're absent three times he sends The Posse, which is five or six big boys from your section who search the streets to make sure you're not out enjoying yourself when you should be on your knees at the Confraternity praying for the Chinese and other lost souls. The Posse will go to your house and tell your mother your immortal soul is in danger. Some mothers worry but others will say, Get away from my door or I'll come out and give every one o' ye a good fong in the hole of yeer arse. These are not good Confraternity mothers and the director will say we should pray for them that they'll see the error of their ways.
The worst thing of all is a visit from the director of the Confraternity himself, Father Gorey. He'll stand at the top of the lane
and roar in the voice that converted the Chinese millions, Where is the house of Frank McCourt? He roars even though he has your address in his pocket and knows very well where you live. He roars because he wants the world to know you're slipping away from the Confraternity and putting your immortal soul in danger. The mothers are terrified and the fathers will whisper, I'm not here, I'm not here, and they'll make sure you go to the Confraternity from this on out so they won't be disgraced and shamed entirely with the neighbors muttering behind their hands.
The Question takes me to the section St. Finbar's, and the prefect tells me sit over there and shut up. His name is Declan Collopy, he's fourteen and he has lumps on his forehead that look like horns. He has thick ginger eyebrows that meet in the middle and hang over his eyes and his arms hang down to his kneecaps. He tells me he's making this the best section in the Confraternity and if I'm ever absent he'll break my arse and send the bits to my mother. There's no excuse for absence because there was a boy in another section that was dying and still they brought him in on a stretcher. He says, If you're ever absent it better be a death, not a death in the family but your own death. Do you hear me?
I do, Declan.
Boys in my section tell me that prefects get rewards if there is perfect attendance. Declan wants to get out of school as soon as he can and get a job selling linoleum at Cannock's big shop on Patrick Street. His uncle, Foncey, sold linoleum there for years and made enough money to start his own shop in Dublin, where he has his three sons selling linoleum. Father Gorey, the director, can easily get Declan the reward of a job at Cannock's if he's a good prefect and has perfect attendance in his section and that's why Declan will destroy us if we're absent. He tells us, No one will stand between me and the linoleum.
Declan likes Question Quigley and lets him miss an occasional Friday night because the Question said, Declan, when I grow up and get married I'm going to cover my house in linoleum and I'll buy it all from you.
Other boys in the section try this trick with Declan but he says, Bugger off, ye'll be lucky enough to have a pot to piss in never mind yards of linoleum.
Dad says when he was my age in Toome he served Mass for years and it's time for me to be an altar boy. Mam says, What's the use? The child doesn't have proper clothes for school never mind the altar. Dad says the altar boy robes will cover the clothes and she says we don't have the money for robes and the wash they need every week.
He says God will provide and makes me kneel on the kitchen floor. He takes the part of the priest for he has the whole Mass in his head and I have to know the responses. He says, Introibo ad altare Dei, and I have to say, Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam.
Every evening after tea I kneel for the Latin and he won't let me move till I'm perfect. Mam says he could at least let me sit but he says Latin is sacred and it is to be learned and recited on the knees. You won't find the Pope sitting around drinking tea while he speaks the Latin.
The Latin is hard and my knees are sore and scabby and I'd like to be out in the lane playing though still I'd like to be an altar boy helping the priest vest in the sacristy, up there on the altar all decked out in my red and white robes like my pal Jimmy Clark, answering the priest in Latin, moving the big book from one side of the tabernacle to
the other, pouring water and wine into the chalice, pouring water over the priest's hands, ringing the bell at Consecration, kneeling, bowing, swinging the censer at Benediction, sitting off to the side with the palms of my hands on my knees all serious while he gives his sermon, everyone in St. Joseph's looking at me and admiring my ways.
In a fortnight I have the Mass in my head and it's time to go to St. Joseph's to see the sacristan, Stephen Carey, who is in charge of altar boys. Dad polishes my boots. Mam darns my socks and throws an extra coal on the fire to heat up the iron to press my shirt. She boils water to scrub my head, neck, hands and knees and any inch of skin that shows. She scrubs till my skin burns and tells Dad she wouldn't give it to the world to say her son went on the altar dirty. She wishes I didn't have scabby knees from running around kicking canisters and falling down pretending I was the greatest footballer in the world. She wishes we had a drop of hair oil in the house but water and spit will keep my hair from sticking up like black straw in a mattress. She warns me speak up when I go to St. Joseph's and don't be mumbling in English or Latin. She says, 'Tis a great pity you grew out of your First Communion suit but you have nothing to be ashamed of, you come from good blood, McCourts, Sheehans, or my mother's family the Guilfoyles that owned acre after acre in County Limerick before the English took it away and gave it to footpads from London.
Dad holds my hand going through the streets and people look at us because of the way we're saying Latin back and forth. He knocks at the sacristy door and tells Stephen Carey, This is my son, Frank, who knows the Latin and is ready to be an altar boy.
Stephen Carey looks at him, then me. He says, We don't have room for him, and closes the door.
Dad is still holding my hand and squeezes till it hurts and I want to cry out. He says nothing on the way home. He takes off his cap, sits by the fire and lights a Woodbine. Mam is smoking, too. Well, she says, is he going to be an altar boy?
There's no room for him.
Oh. She puffs on her Woodbine. I'll tell you what it is, she says. 'Tis class distinction. They don't want boys from lanes on the altar. They don't want the ones with scabby knees and hair sticking up. Oh, no, they want the nice boys with hair oil and new shoes that have fathers with suits and ties and steady jobs. That's what it is and 'tis hard to hold on to the Faith with the snobbery that's in it.
Och, aye.
Oh, och aye my arse. That's all you ever say. You could go to the priest and tell him you have a son that has a head stuffed with Latin and why can't he be an altar boy and what is he going to do with all that Latin?
Och, he might grow up to be a priest.
I ask him if I can go out and play. Yes, he says, go out and play. Mam says, You might as well.
VI
Mr. O'Neill is the master in the fourth class at school. We call him Dotty because he's small like a dot. He teaches in the one classroom with
a platform so that he can stand above us and threaten us with his ash plant and peel his apple for all to see. The first day of school in September he writes on the blackboard three words which are to stay there the rest of the year, Euclid, geometry, idiot. He says if he catches any boy interfering with these words that boy will go through the rest of his life with one hand. He says anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Now, repeat after me, Anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Of course we all know what an idiot is because that's what the masters keep telling us we are.
Brendan Quigley raises his hand. Sir, what's a theorem and what's a Euclid?
We expect Dotty to lash at Brendan the way all the masters do when you ask them a question but he looks at Brendan with a little smile. Ah, now, here's a boy with not one but two questions. What is your name, boy?
Brendan Quigley, sir.
This is a boy who will go far. Where will he go, boys?
Far, sir.
Indeed and he will. The boy who wants to know something about the
grace, elegance and beauty of Euclid can go nowhere but up. In what direction and no other can this boy go, boys?
Up, sir.
Without Euclid, boys, mathematics would be a poor doddering thing. Without Euclid we wouldn't be able to go from here to there. Without Euclid the bicycle would have no wheel. Without Euclid St. Joseph could not have been a carpenter for carpentry is geometry and geometry is carpentry. Without Euclid this very school could never have been built.
Paddy Clohessy mutters behind me, Feckin' Euclid.
Dotty barks at him. You, boy, what is your name?
Clohessy, sir.
Ah, the boy flies on one wing. What is your Christian name? Paddy.
Paddy what?
Paddy, sir.
And what, Paddy, were you saying to McCourt? I said we
down on our two knees and thank God for Euclid.
I'm sure you did, Clohessy. I see the lie festering in
What do I see, boys?
The lie, sir.
And what is the lie doing, boys?
Festering, sir.
Where, boys, where?
In his teeth, sir.
Euclid, boys, was a Greek. What, Clohessy, is a Greek? Some class of a foreigner, sir.
Clohessy, you are a half-wit. Now, Brendan, surely you
should get
your teeth.
know what a
Greek is?
Yes, sir. Euclid was a Greek.
Dotty gives him the little smile. He tells Clohessy he should model
himself on Quigley, who knows what a Greek is. He draws two lines side by side and tells us these are parallel lines and the magical and mysterious thing is that they never meet, not if they were to be extended to infinity, not if they were extended to God's shoulders and that, boys, is a long way though there is a German Jew who is upsetting the whole world with his ideas on parallel lines.
We listen to Dotty and wonder what all this has to do with the state of the world with the Germans marching everywhere and bombing everything that stands. We can't ask him ourselves but we can get Brendan Quigley to do it. Anyone can see Brendan is the master's pet and that means he can ask any question he likes. After school we tell Brendan he has to ask the question tomorrow, What use is Euclid and all those lines that go on forever when the Germans are bombing everything? Brendan says he doesn't want to be the master's pet, he didn't ask for it, and he doesn't want to ask the question. He's afraid if he asks that question Dotty will attack him. We tell him if he doesn't ask the question we'll attack him.
Next day Brendan raises his hand. Dotty gives him the little smile. Sir, what use is Euclid and all the lines when the Germans are bombing everything that stands?
The little smile is gone. Ah, Brendan. Ah, Quigley. Oh, boys, oh, boys.
He lays his stick on the desk and stands on the platform with his eyes closed. What use is Euclid? he says. Use? Without Euclid the Messerschmitt could never have taken to the sky. Without Euclid the Spitfire could not dart from cloud to cloud. Euclid brings us grace and beauty and elegance. What does he bring us, boys?
Grace, sir.
And?
Beauty, sir.
And?
Elegance, sir.
Euclid is complete in himself and divine in application. Do you
understand that, boys?
We do, sir.
I doubt it, boys, I doubt it. To love Euclid is to be alone in this world.
He opens his eyes and sighs and you can see the eyes are a little watery.
Paddy Clohessy is leaving the school that day and he's stopped by Mr. O'Dea, who teaches the fifth class. Mr. O'Dea says, You, what's your
name?
Clohessy, sir.
What class are you in?
Fourth class, sir.
Now tell me, Clohessy, is that master of yours talking to you about
Euclid?
He is, sir.
And what is he saying?
He's saying he's a Greek.
Of course he is, you diddering omadhaun. What else is he saying? He's saying there would be no school without Euclid.
Ah. Now is he drawing anything on the board?
He's drawing lines side by side that will never meet even if they
land on God's shoulders.
Mother o' God.
No, sir. God's shoulders.
I know, you idiot. Go home.
The next day there's a great noise at our classroom door and Mr. O'Dea is yelling, Come out, O'Neill, you chancer, you poltroon. We can hear everything he's saying because of the broken glass over the door.
The new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, is saying, Now, now, Mr. O'Dea. Control yourself. No quarreling in front of our pupils.
Well, then, Mr. O'Halloran, tell him stop teaching the geometry. The geometry is for the fifth form and not the fourth. The geometry is mine. Tell him to teach the long division and leave Euclid to me. Long division will stretch his intellect such as it is, God help us. I don't want the minds of these boys destroyed by that chancer up there on the platform, him handing out apple skins and causing diarrhea right and left. Tell him Euclid is mine, Mr. O'Halloran, or I'll put a stop to his gallop.
Mr. O'Halloran tells Mr. O'Dea to return to his classroom and asks Mr. O'Neill to step into the hall. Mr. O'Halloran says, Now, Mr. O'Neill, I have asked you before to stay away from Euclid.
You have, Mr. O'Halloran, but you might as well ask me to stop eating my daily apple.
I'll have to insist, Mr. O'Neill. No more Euclid.
Mr. O'Neill comes back to the room and his eyes are watery again. He says little has changed since the time of the Greeks for the barbarians are within the gates and their names are legion. What has changed since the time of the Greeks, boys?
It is torture to watch Mr. O'Neill peel the apple every day, to see the length of it, red or green, and if you're up near him to catch the freshness of it in your nose. If you're the good boy for that day and you answer the questions he gives it to you and lets you eat it there at your desk so that you can eat it in peace with no one to bother you the way they would if you took it into the yard. Then they'd torment you, Gimme a piece, gimme a piece, and you'd be lucky to have an inch left for yourself.
There are days when the questions are too hard and he torments us by dropping the apple peel into the wastebasket. Then he borrows a boy from another class to take the wastebasket down to the furnace to burn papers and apple peel or he'll leave it for the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, to take it all away in her big canvas sack. We'd like to ask Nellie to keep the peel for us before the rats get it but she's weary from cleaning the whole school by herself and she snaps at us, I have other things to be doin' with me life besides watchin' a scabby bunch rootin' around for the skin of an apple. Go 'way.
He peels the apple slowly. He looks around the room with the little smile. He teases us, Do you think, boys, I should give this to the pigeons on the windowsill? We say, No, sir, pigeons don't eat apples. Paddy Clohessy calls out, 'Twill give them the runs, sir, and we'll have it on our heads abroad in the yard.
Clohessy, you are an omadhaun. Do you know what an omadhaun is?
I don't, sir.
It's the Irish, Clohessy, your native tongue, Clohessy. An omadhaun
is a fool, Clohessy. You are an omadhaun. What is he, boys? An omadhaun, sir.
Clohessy says, That's what Mr. O'Dea called me, sir, a diddering omadhaun.
He pauses in his peeling to ask us questions about everything in the world and the boy with the best answers wins. Hands up, he says, who is the President of the United States of America?
Every hand in the class goes up and we're all disgusted when he asks a question that any omadhaun would know. We call out, Roosevelt.
Then he says, You, Mulcahy, who stood at the foot of the cross when Our Lord was crucified?
Mulcahy is slow. The Twelve Apostles, sir. Mulcahy, what is the Irish word for fool? Omadhaun, sir.
And what are you, Mulcahy?
An omadhaun, sir.
Fintan Slattery raises his hand. I know who stood at the foot of the cross, sir.
Of course Fintan knows who stood at the foot of the cross. Why wouldn't he? He's always running off to Mass with his mother, who is known for her holiness. She's so holy her husband ran off to Canada to cut down trees, glad to be gone and never to be heard from again. She and Fintan say the rosary every night on their knees in the kitchen and read all kinds of religious magazines: The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart, The Lantern, The Far East, as well as every little book printed by the Catholic Truth Society. They go to Mass and Communion rain or shine and every Saturday they confess to the Jesuits who are known for their interest in intelligent sins not the usual sins you hear from people in lanes who are known for getting drunk and sometimes eating meat on Fridays before it goes bad and cursing on top of it. Fintan and his mother live on Catherine Street and Mrs. Slattery's neighbors call her Mrs. Offer-It-Up because no matter what happens, a broken leg, a spilled cup of tea, a disappeared husband, she says, Well, now, I'll offer that up and I'll have no end of Indulgences to get me into heaven. Fintan is just as bad. If you push him in the schoolyard or call him names he'll smile and tell you he'll pray for you and he'll offer it up for his soul and yours. The boys in Leamy's don't want Fintan praying for them and they threaten to give him a good fong in the arse if they catch him praying for them. He says he wants to be a saint when he grows up, which is ridiculous because you can't be a saint till you're dead. He says our grandchildren will be praying to his picture. One big boy says, My grandchildren will piss on your picture, and Fintan just smiles. His sister ran away to England when she was seventeen and everyone knows he wears her blouse at home and curls his hair with hot iron tongs every Saturday night so that he'll look gorgeous at Mass on Sunday. If he meets you going to Mass he'll say, Isn't my hair gorgeous, Frankie? He loves that word, gorgeous, and no other boy will ever use it.
Of course he knows who stood at the foot of the cross. He probably knows what they were wearing and what they had for breakfast and now he's telling Dotty O'Neill it was the three Marys. Dotty says, Come up here, Fintan, and take your reward. He takes his time going to the platform and we can't believe our eyes when he takes out a pocketknife to cut the apple peel into little bits so that he can eat them one by one and not be stuffing the whole thing into his mouth like the rest of us when we win. He raises his hand, Sir, I'd like to give some of my apple away.
The apple, Fintan? No, indeed. You do not have the apple, Fintan. You have the peel, the mere skin. You have not nor will you ever achieve
heights so dizzy you'll be feasting on the apple itself. Not my apple, Fintan. Now did I hear you say you want to give away your reward?
You did, sir. I'd like to give three pieces, to Quigley, Clohessy and McCourt.
Why, Fintan?
They're my friends, sir.
The boys around the room are sneering and nudging each other and I
feel ashamed because they'll say I curl my hair and I'll be tormented in the schoolyard and why does he think I'm his friend? If they say I wear my sister's blouse there's no use telling them I don't have a sister because they'll say, You'd wear it if you had a sister. There's no use saying anything in the schoolyard because there's always someone with an answer and there's nothing you can do but punch them in the nose and if you were to punch everyone who has an answer you'd be punching morning noon and night.
Quigley takes the bit of peel from Fintan. Thanks, Fintan.
The whole class is looking at Clohessy because he's the biggest and the toughest and if he says thanks I'll say thanks. He says, Thanks very much, Fintan, and blushes and I say, Thanks very much, Fintan, and I try to stop myself from blushing but I can't and all the boys sneer again and I'd like to hit them.
After school the boys call to Fintan, Hoi, Fintan, are you goin'home to curl your gorgeous hair? Fintan smiles and climbs the steps of the schoolyard. A big boy from seventh class says to Paddy Clohessy, I suppose you'd be curlin' your hair too if you wasn't a baldy with a shaved head.
Paddy says, Shurrup, and the boy says, Oh, an' who's goin' to make me? Paddy tries a punch but the big boy hits his nose and knocks him down and there's blood. I try to hit the big boy but he grabs me by the throat and bangs my head against the wall till I see lights and black dots. Paddy walks away holding his nose and crying and the big boy pushes me after him. Fintan is outside on the street and he says, Oh, Francis, Francis, oh, Patrick, Patrick, what's up? Why are you crying, Patrick? and Paddy says, I'm hungry. I can't fight nobody because I'm starving with the hunger an' fallin' down an' I'm ashamed of meself.
Fintan says, Come with me, Patrick. My mother will give us something, and Paddy says, Ah, no, me nose is bleedin'.
Don't worry. She'll put something on your nose or a key on the back of your neck. Francis, you must come, too. You always look hungry.
Ah, no, Fintan.
Ah, do, Francis.
All right, Fintan.
Fintan's flat is like a chapel. There are two pictures, the Sacred
Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Jesus is showing His heart with the crown of thorns, the fire, the blood. His head is tilted to the left to show His great sorrow. The Virgin Mary is showing her heart and it would be a pleasant heart if it didn't have that crown of thorns. Her head is tilted to the right to show her sorrow because she knows her Son will come to a sad end.
There's a picture on another wall of a man with a brown robe and birds sitting all over him. Fintan says, Do you know who that is, Francis? No? That's your patron, St. Francis of Assisi, and do you know what today is?
The fourth of October.
That's right and it's his feast day and special for you because you can ask St. Francis for anything and he'll surely give it to you. That's why I wanted you to come here today. Sit down, Patrick, sit down, Francis.
Mrs. Slattery comes in with her rosary beads in her hand. She's happy to meet Fintan's new friends and would we like a cheese sandwich? And look at your poor nose, Patrick. She touches his nose with the cross on her rosary beads and says a little prayer. She tells us these rosary beads were blessed by the Pope himself and would stop the flow of a river if requested never mind Patrick's poor nose.
Fintan says he won't have a sandwich because he's fasting and praying for the boy who hit Paddy and me. Mrs. Slattery gives him a kiss on the head and tells him he's a saint out of heaven and asks if we'd like mustard on our sandwiches and I tell her I never heard of mustard on cheese and I'd love it. Paddy says, I dunno. I never had a sangwidge in me life, and we all laugh and I wonder how you could live ten years like Paddy and never have a sandwich. Paddy laughs, too, and you can see his teeth are white and black and green.
We eat the sandwich and drink tea and Paddy wants to know where the lavatory is. Fintan takes him through the bedroom to the backyard and when they come back Paddy says, I have to go home. Me mother'll kill me. I'll wait for you outside, Frankie.
Now I have to go to the lavatory and Fintan leads me to the backyard. He says, I have to go, too, and when I unbutton my fly I can't pee because he's looking at me and he says, You were fooling. You don't have to go at all. I like to look at you, Francis. That's all. I wouldn't want to commit any class of a sin with our Confirmation coming next year.
Paddy and I leave together. I'm bursting and run behind a garage to pee. Paddy is waiting for me and as we walk along Hartstonge Street he says, That was a powerful sangwidge, Frankie, an' him an' his mother is very holy but I wouldn't want to go to Fintan's flat anymore because he's very odd, isn't he, Frankie?
He is, Paddy.
The way he looks at it when you take it out, that's odd, isn't it, Frankie?
'Tis, Paddy.
A few days later Paddy whispers, Fintan Slattery said we could come to his flat at lunchtime. His mother won't be there and she leaves his lunch for him. He might give us some too and he has lovely milk. Will we go?
Fintan sits two rows from us. He knows what Paddy is saying to me and he moves his eyebrows up and down as if to say, Will you come? I whisper yes to Paddy and he nods to Fintan and the master barks at us to stop waggling our eyebrows and our lips or the ash plant will sing across our backsides.
Boys in the schoolyard see the three of us walk out and they pass remarks. Oh, Gawd, look at Fintan and his ingles. Paddy says, Fintan, what's an ingle? and Fintan says it's just a boy from olden times who sits in a corner, that's all. He tells us sit at the table in his kitchen and we can read his comic books if we like, Film Fun, the Beano, the Dandy, or the religious magazines or his mother's romance magazines, the Miracle and the Oracle, which always have stories about factory girls who are poor but beautiful in love with sons of earls and vice versa and the factory girl ends up throwing herself into the Thames with the
hopelessness only to be rescued by a passing carpenter who is poor but honest and will love the factory girl for her own humble self though it turns out the passing carpenter is really the son of a duke, which is much higher than an earl, so that now the poor factory girl is a duchess and can look down her nose at the earl who spurned her because she's happy tending her roses on her twelve-thousand-acre estate in Shropshire and being kind to her poor old mother, who refuses to leave her humble little cottage for all the money in the world.
Paddy says, I don't want to read nothing, it's all a cod, all them stories. Fintan removes the cloth covering his sandwich and glass of milk. The milk looks creamy and cool and delicious and the sandwich bread is almost as white. Paddy says, Is that a ham sangwidge? and Fintan says, 'Tis. Paddy says, That's a lovely looking sangwidge and is there mustard on it? Fintan nods and slices the sandwich in two. Mustard seeps out. He licks it off his fingers and takes a nice mouthful of milk. He cuts the sandwich again into quarters, eighths, sixteenths, takes The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart from the pile of magazines and reads while he eats his sandwich bits and drinks his milk and Paddy and I look at him and I know Paddy is wondering what we're doing here at all, at all, because that's what I'm wondering myself hoping Fintan will pass over the plate to us but he doesn't, he finishes the milk, leaves bits of sandwich on the plate, covers it with the cloth and wipes his lips in his dainty way, lowers his head, blesses himself and says grace after meals and, God, we'll be late for school, and blesses himself again on the way out with holy water from the little china font hanging by the door with the little image of the Virgin Mary showing her heart and pointing at it with two fingers as if we couldn't make it out for ourselves.
It's too late for Paddy and me to run and get the bun and milk from Nellie Ahearn and I don't know how I'm going to last from now till I can run home after school and get a piece of bread. Paddy stops at the school gate. He says, I can't go in there starving with the hunger. I'd fall asleep and Dotty'd kill me.
Fintan is anxious. Come on, come on, we'll be late. Come on, Francis, hurry up.
I'm not going in, Fintan. You had your lunch. We had nothing.
Paddy explodes. You're a feckin' chancer, Fintan. That's what you are an' a feckin' begrudger too with your feckin' sangwidge an' your feckin' Sacred Heart of Jesus on the wall an' your feckin' holy water. You can kiss my arse, Fintan.
Oh, Patrick.
Oh, Patrick my feckin' arse, Fintan. Come on, Frankie.
Fintan runs into school and Paddy and I make our way to an orchard
in Ballinacurra. We climb a wall and a fierce dog comes at us till Paddy talks to him and tells him he's a good dog and we're hungry and go home to your mother. The dog licks Paddy's face and trots away waving his tail and Paddy is delighted with himself. We stuff apples into our shirts till we can barely get back over the wall to run into a long field and sit under a hedge eating the apples till we can't swallow another bit and we stick our faces into a stream for the lovely cool water. Then we run to opposite ends of a ditch to shit and wipe ourselves with grass and thick leaves. Paddy is squatting and saying, There's nothing in the world like a good feed of apples, a drink of water and a good shit, better than any sangwidge of cheese and mustard and Dotty O'Neill can shove his apple up his arse.
There are three cows in a field with their heads over a stone wall and they say moo to us. Paddy says, Bejasus, 'tis milkin' time, and he's over the wall, stretched on his back under a cow with her big udder hanging into his face. He pulls on a teat and squirts milk into his mouth. He stops squirting and says, Come on, Frankie, fresh milk. 'Tis lovely. Get that other cow, they're all ready for the milkin'.
I get under the cow and pull on a teat but she kicks and moves and I'm sure she's going to kill me. Paddy comes over and shows me how to do it, pull hard and straight and the milk comes out in a powerful stream. The two of us lie under the one cow and we're having a great time filling ourselves with milk when there's a roar and there's a man with a stick charging across the field. We're over the wall in a minute and he can't follow us because of his rubber boots. He stands at the wall and shakes his stick and shouts that if he ever catches us we'll have the length of his boot up our arses and we laugh because we're out of harm's way and I'm wondering why anyone should be hungry in a world full of milk and apples.
It's all right for Paddy to say Dotty can shove the apple up his arse but I don't want to rob orchards and milk cows forever and I'll always try to win Dotty's apple peel so that I can go home and tell Dad how I answered the hard questions.
We're walking back through Ballinacurra. There's rain and lightning and we run but it's hard for me with the sole of my shoe flapping and threatening to trip me. Paddy can run all he wants in his long bare feet and you hear them slapping on the pavement. My shoes and stockings are soaked and they make their own sound, squish, squish. Paddy notices that and we make a song from our two sounds, slap slap, squish, squish, slap squish, squish slap. We laugh so hard over our song we have to hold on to one another. The rain gets heavier and we know we can't stand under a tree or we'll be fried entirely so we stand by a door which is opened in a minute by a big fat maid in a little white hat and a black dress with a little white apron who tells us get away from this door we're a disgrace. We run from the door and Paddy calls back, Mullingar heifer, beef to the heels, and he laughs till he chokes and has to lean against a wall with the weakness. There's no sense in standing in from the rain anymore, we're soaked to the skin, so we take our time down O'Connell Avenue. Paddy says he learned that Mullingar heifer thing from his uncle Peter, the one that was in India in the English army and they have a photo of him standing with a group of soldiers with their helmets and guns and bandoliers around their chests and there are dark men in uniform who are Indians and loyal to the King. Uncle Peter had a great time for himself in a place called Kashmir, which is lovelier than Killarney that they're always bragging about and singing. Paddy goes on again about running away and winding up in India in a silken tent with the girl with the red dot and the curry and the figs and he's making me hungry even if I'm stuffed with apples and milk.
The rain is clearing and there are birds honking over our heads. Paddy says they're ducks or geese or something on their way to Africa where it's nice and warm. The birds have more sense than the Irish. They come to the Shannon for their holidays and then they go back to the warm places, maybe even India. He says he'll write me a letter when he's over there and I can come to India and have my own girl with a red dot.
What's that dot for, Paddy?
It shows they're high class, the quality.
But, Paddy, would the quality in India talk to you if they knew you were from a lane in Limerick and had no shoes?
Course they would, but the English quality wouldn't. The English quality wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.
Steam of their piss? God, Paddy, did you think of that yourself?
Naw, naw, that's what my father says below in the bed when he's coughin' up the gobs and blamin' the English for everything.
And I think, Steam of their piss. I'll keep that for myself. I'll go around Limerick saying it, Steam of their piss, Steam of their piss, and when I go to America some day I'll be the only one who knows it.
Question Quigley is wobbling toward us on a big woman's bicycle and calls to me, Hoi, Frankie McCourt, you're going to be killed. Dotty O'Neill sent a note to your house and said you didn't come back to school after lunch, that you went on the mooch with Paddy Clohessy. Your mother is going to kill you. Your father is out looking for you and he's going to kill you, too.
Oh, God, I feel cold and empty and I wish I could be in India where it's nice and warm and there's no school and my father could never find me to kill me. Paddy tells the Question, He didn't go on the mooch and I didn't either. Fintan Slattery starved us to death and we were too late for the bun and the milk. Then Paddy says to me, Don't mind 'em, Frankie, 'tis all a cod. They're always sendin' notes to our house and we wipe our arses with them.
My mother and father would never wipe their arses with a note from the master and I'm afraid now to go home. The Question rides off on the bicycle, laughing, and I don't know why because he once ran away from home and slept in a ditch with four goats and that's worse than mooching from school half a day anytime.
I could turn up the Barrack Road now and go home and tell my parents I'm sorry I went on the mooch and I did it because of the hunger but Paddy says, Come on, we'll go down the Dock Road and throw rocks in the Shannon.
We throw rocks in the river and we swing on the iron chains along the bank. It's getting dark and I don't know where I'm going to sleep. I might have to stay there by the Shannon or find a door or I might have to go back out the country and find a ditch like Brendan Quigley with four goats. Paddy says I can go home with him, I can sleep on the floor and I'll dry out.
Paddy lives in one of the tall houses on Arthur's Quay looking at the river. Everyone in Limerick knows these houses are old and might fall down at any minute. Mam often says, I don't want any of ye going down to Arthur's Quay and if I find ye there I'll break yeer faces. The people down there are wild and ye could get robbed and killed.
It's raining again and small children are playing in the hallway and up the stairs. Paddy says, Mind yourself, because some of the steps are missing and there is shit on the ones that are still there. He says that's because there's only one privy and it's in the backyard and children don't get down the stairs in time to put their little arses on the bowl, God help us.
There's a woman with a shawl sitting on the fourth flight smoking a cigarette. She says, Is that you, Paddy?
'Tis, Mammy.
I'm fagged out, Paddy. Them steps is killin' me. Did you have your tea?
I didn't.
Well, I don't know if there's any bread left. Go up an' see. Paddy's family live in one big room with a high ceiling and a small
fireplace. There are two tall windows and you can see out to the Shannon. His father is in a bed in the corner, groaning and spitting into a bucket. Paddy's brothers and sisters are on mattresses on the floor, sleeping, talking, looking at the ceiling. There's a baby with no clothes crawling over to Paddy's father's bucket and Paddy pulls him away. His mother comes in, gasping, from the stairs. Jesus, I'm dead, she says.
She finds some bread and makes weak tea for Paddy and me. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. They don't say anything. They don't say what are you doing here or go home or anything till Mr. Clohessy says, Who's that? and Paddy tells him, 'Tis Frankie McCourt.
Mr. Clohessy says, McCourt? What class of a name is that? My father is from the North, Mr. Clohessy.
And what's your mother's name?
Angela, Mr. Clohessy.
Ah, Jaysus, 'twouldn't be Angela Sheehan, would it?
'Twould, Mr. Clohessy. Ah, Jaysus, he says, and he has a coughing fit which brings up all kinds of stuff from his insides and has him hanging over the bucket. When the cough passes he falls back on the pillow. Ah, Frankie, I knew your mother well. Danced with her, Mother o' Christ, I'm dying inside, danced with her I did below in the Wembley Hall and a champion dancer she was too.
He hangs over the bucket again. He gasps for air and reaches his arms out to get it. He suffers but he won't stop talking.
Champion dancer she was, Frankie. Not skinny mind you but a feather in my arms and there was many a sorry man when she left Limerick. Can you dance, Frankie?
Ah, no, Mr. Clohessy.
Paddy says, He can, Dada. He had the lessons from Mrs. O'Connor and Cyril Benson.
Well, dance, Frankie. Round the house an' mind the dresser, Frankie. Lift the foot, lad.
I can't, Mr. Clohessy. I'm no good.
No good? Angela's Sheehan's son? Dance, Frankie, or I'll get outa this bed an' wheel you round the house.
My shoe is broken, Mr. Clohessy.
Frankie, Frankie, you're bringin' the cough on me. Will you dance for the love o' Jesus so I can remember me youth with your mother in the Wembley Hall. Take off the feckin' shoe, Frankie, an' dance.
I have to make up dances and tunes to go with them the way I did a long time ago when I was young. I dance around the room with one shoe because I forgot to take it off. I try to make up words, Oh, The Walls of Limerick are falling down, falling down, falling down, The Walls of Limerick falling down and the River Shannon kills us.
Mr. Clohessy is laughing in the bed. Oh, Jaysus, I never heard likes o' that on land or sea. That's a great leg for the dancing you have there, Frankie. Oh, Jaysus. He coughs and brings up ropes of green and yellow stuff. It makes me sick to look at it and I wonder if I should go home from all this sickness and this bucket and let my parents kill me if they want to.
Paddy lies down on a mattress by the window and I lie beside him. I keep my clothes on like everybody else and I even forget to take off my
other shoe, which is wet and squishy and stinks. Paddy falls asleep right away and I look at his mother sitting by the bit of a fire smoking another cigarette. Paddy's father groans and coughs and spits into the bucket. He says, Feckin' blood, and she says, You'll have to go into the sanatorium sooner or later.
I will not. The day they put you in there is the end of you.
You could be givin'the consumption to the children. I could get the guards to take you away you're that much of a danger to the children.
If they were to get it they'd have it be now.
The fire dies and Mrs. Clohessy climbs over him into the bed. In a minute she's snoring even if he's still coughing and laughing about the days of his youth when he danced with Angela Sheehan light as a feather in the Wembley Hall.
It's cold in the room and I'm shivering in my wet clothes. Paddy is shivering too but he's asleep and he doesn't know he's cold. I don't know if I should stay here or get up and go home but who wants to be wandering the streets when a guard might ask you what you're doing out. It's my first time away from my family and I know I'd rather be in my own house with the smelly lavatory and stable next door. It's bad when our kitchen is a lake and we have to go up to Italy but it's worse in the Clohessys' when you have to go down four flights to the lavatory and slip on shit all the way down. I'd be better off with four goats in a ditch.
I drift in and out of sleep but I have to wake up for good when Mrs. Clohessy goes around pulling at her family to get them up. They all went to bed with their clothes on so they don't have to get dressed and there's no fighting. They grumble and run out the door to get downstairs to the backyard lavatory. I have to go too and I run down with Paddy but his sister Peggy is on the bowl and we have to piss against a wall. She says, I'll tell Ma what ye did, and Paddy says, Shurrup or I'll push you down into that feckin' lavatory. She jumps off the lavatory, pulls her drawers up and runs up the stairs crying, I'll tell, I'll tell, and when we get back to the room Mrs. Clohessy gives Paddy a belt on the head for what he did to his poor little sister. Paddy says nothing because Mrs. Clohessy is spooning porridge into mugs and jam jars and one bowl and telling us to eat up and go to school. She sits at the table eating her porridge. Her hair is gray black and dirty. It dangles in the bowl and picks up bits of porridge and drops of milk. The children slurp the porridge and complain they didn't get enough, they're starving with the hunger. They have snotty noses and sore eyes and scabby knees. Mr. Clohessy coughs and squirms on the bed and brings up the great gobs of blood and I run out of the room and puke on the stairs where there's a step missing and there's a shower of porridge and bits of apple to the floor below where people go back and forth to the lavatory in the yard. Paddy comes down and says, Sure that's all right. Everywan gets sick an' shits on them stairs an' the whole feckin' place is falling down anyway.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. If I go back to school I'll be killed and why should I go back to school or go home to get killed when I can go out the road and live on milk and apples the rest of my life till I go to America. Paddy says, Come on. School is all a cod anyway an' the masters is all madmen.
There's a knock at the Clohessys' door and it's Mam holding my little brother, Michael, by the hand, and Guard Dennehy, who is in charge of school attendance. Mam sees me and says, What are you doing with one shoe on? and Guard Dennehy says, Ah, now, missus, I think a more
important question would be, What are you doing with one shoe off, ha,
ha.
Michael runs to me. Mammy was crying. Mammy was crying for you,
Frankie.
She says, Where were you all night?
I was here.
You had me demented. Your father walked every street in Limerick
looking for you.
Mr. Clohessy says, Who's at the door?
It's my mother, Mr. Clohessy.
God above, is that Angela?
'Tis, Mr. Clohessy.
He struggles up on his elbows. Well, for the love of God, will you
come in, Angela. Don't you know me?
Mam looks puzzled. It's dark in the room and she tries to make out
who is in the bed. He says, 'Tis me, Dennis Clohessy, Angela. Ah, no.
'Tis, Angela.
Ah, no.
I know, Angela. I'm changed. The cough is killin' me. But I
remember the nights at the Wembley Hall. Aw, Jaysus, you were a great dancer. Nights at the Wembley Hall, Angela, and the fish and chips after. Oh, boys, oh, boys, Angela.
My mother has tears running down her face. She says, You were a great dancer yourself, Dennis Clohessy.
We could have won competitions, Angela. Fred and Ginger would have been lookin' over their shoulders but you had to run off to America. Aw, Jaysus.
He has another coughing fit and we have to stand and watch him hang over the bucket again and bring up the bad stuff from his insides. Guard Dennehy says, I think, missus, we found the by an' I'll be going. He says to me, If you ever go on the mooch again, by, we'll have you in the jail above. Are you listenin' to me, by?
I am, Guard.
Don't be tormentin' your mother, by. That's wan thing the guards won't put up with, the tormentin' of mothers.
I won't, Guard. I won't torment her.
He leaves and Mam goes to the bed to take Mr. Clohessy's hand. His face is caved in all around his eyes and his hair is shiny black with the sweat running from the top of his head. His children stand around the bed looking at him and looking at Mam. Mrs. Clohessy sits by the fire rattling the poker in the grate and pushing the baby away from the fire. She says, 'Tis his own bloody fault for not goin' into hospital, so 'tis.
Mr. Clohessy gasps, I'd be all right if I could live in a dry place. Angela, is America a dry place?
'Tis, Dennis.
The doctor told me go to Arizona. A funny man that doctor. Arizona how are you. I don't have the money to go around the corner for a pint.
Mam says, You'll be all right, Dennis. I'll light a candle for you. Save your money, Angela. My dancin' days are done.
I have to go now, Dennis. My son has to go to school.
Before you go, Angela, will you do one thing for me?
I will, Dennis, if 'tis in my power.
Would you ever give us a verse of that song you sang the night before you went to America?
That's a hard song, Dennis. I wouldn't have the wind for it.
Ah, come on, Angela. I never hear a song anymore. There isn't a song in this house. The wife there doesn't have a note in her head an' no step in her foot.
Mam says, All right. I'll try.
Oh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune, Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.
When the boys began to gather in the glen of a Summer night, And the Kerry piper's tuning made us long with wild delight.
She stops and presses her hand to her chest, Oh, God, my wind is gone. Help me, Frank, with the song, and I sing along, Oh, to think of it, Oh, to dream of it, fills my heart with tears.
Oh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.
Mr. Clohessy tries to sing with us, gone, alas, like our youth too soon, but it brings on the cough. He shakes his head and cries, I wouldn't doubt you, Angela. It takes me back. God bless you.
God bless you, too, Dennis, and thanks, Mrs. Clohessy, for having Frankie here off the streets.
'Twas no trouble, Mrs. McCourt. He's quiet enough.
Quiet enough, says Mr. Clohessy, but he's not the dancer his mother
was.
Mam says, 'Tis hard to dance with one shoe, Dennis.
I know, Angela, but you'd wonder why he didn't take it off. Is he a
bit strange?
Ah, sometimes he has the odd manner like his father. Oh, yes. The
father is from the North, Angela, and that would account for it. They'd think nothing of dancing with one shoe in the North.
We walk up Patrick Street and O'Connell Street, Paddy Clohessy and Mam and Michael and myself, and Mam sobs all the way. Michael says, Don't cry, Mammy. Frankie won't run away.
She lifts him up and hugs him. Oh, no, Michael, 'tisn't Frankie I'm crying about. 'Tis Dennis Clohessy and the dancing nights at the Wembley Hall and the fish and chips after.
She comes into the school with us. Mr. O'Neill looks cross and tells us sit down he'll be with us in a minute. He talks a long time at the door with my mother and when she leaves he walks between the seats and pats Paddy Clohessy on the head.
I'm very sorry for the Clohessys and all their troubles but I think they saved me from getting into trouble with my mother.
VII
There are Thursdays when Dad gets his dole money at the Labour Exchange and a man might say, Will we go for a pint, Malachy? and Dad will say, One, only one, and the man will say, Oh, God, yes, one, and before the night is over all the money is gone and Dad comes home singing and getting us out of bed to line up and promise to die for Ireland when the
call comes. He even gets Michael up and he's only three but there he is singing and promising to die for Ireland at the first opportunity. That's what Dad calls it, the first opportunity. I'm nine and Malachy is eight and we know all the songs. We sing all the verses of Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley, ""The West's Asleep, ""
""O'Donnell Abu, ""
""The Boys of Wexford. "" We sing and promise to die because you never know when Dad might have a penny or two left over from the drinking and if he gives it to us we can run to Kathleen O'Connell's next day for toffee. Some nights he says Michael is the best singer of all and he gives him the penny. Malachy and I wonder what's the use of being eight and nine and knowing all the songs and ready to die when Michael gets the penny so that he can go to the shop next day and stuff his gob with toffee galore. No one can ask him to die for Ireland at the age of three, not even Padraig Pearse, who was shot by the English in Dublin in 1916 and expected the whole world to die with him. Besides, Mikey Molloy's father said anyone who wants to die for Ireland is a donkey's arse. Men have been dying for Ireland since the beginning of time and look at the state of the country.
It's bad enough that Dad loses jobs in the third week but now he drinks all the dole money once a month. Mam gets desperate and in the morning she has the bitter face and she won't talk to him. He has his tea and leaves the house early for the long walk into the country. When he returns in the evening she still won't talk to him and she won't make his tea. If the fire is dead for the want of coal or turf and there's no way of boiling water for the tea, he says, Och, aye, and drinks water out of a jam jar and smacks his lips the way he would with a pint of porter. He says good water is all a man needs and Mam makes a snorting sound. When she's not talking to him the house is heavy and cold and we know we're not supposed to talk to him either for fear she'll give us the bitter look. We know Dad has done the bad thing and we know you can make anyone suffer by not talking to him. Even little Michael knows that when Dad does the bad thing you don't talk to him from Friday to Monday and when he tries to lift you to his lap you run to Mam.
I'm nine years old and I have a pal, Mickey Spellacy, whose relations are dropping one by one of the galloping consumption. I envy Mickey because every time someone dies in his family he gets a week off from school and his mother stitches a black diamond patch on his sleeve so that he can wander from lane to lane and street to street and people will know he has the grief and pat his head and give him money and sweets for his sorrow.
But this summer Mickey is worried. His sister, Brenda, is wasting away with the consumption and it's only August and if she dies before September he won't get his week off from school because you can't get a week off from school when there's no school. He comes to Billy Campbell and me to ask if we'll go around the corner to St. Joseph's Church and pray for Brenda to hang on till September.
What's in it for us, Mickey, if we go around the corner praying?
Well, if Brenda hangs on and I get me week off ye can come to the wake and have ham and cheese and cake and sherry and lemonade and everything and ye can listen to the songs and stories all night.
Who could say no to that? There's nothing like a wake for having a good time. We trot around to the church where they have statues of St. Joseph himself as well as the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and
St. Thérèse of Lisieux, the Little Flower. I pray to the Little Flower because she died of the consumption herself and she'd understand.
One of our prayers must have been powerful because Brenda stays alive and doesn't die till the second day of school. We tell Mickey we're sorry for his troubles but he's delighted with his week off and he gets the black diamond patch which will bring the money and sweets.
My mouth is watering at the thought of the feast at Brenda's wake. Billy knocks on the door and there's Mickey's aunt. Well?
We came to say a prayer for Brenda and Mickey said we could come to the wake.
She yells, Mickey! What? Come here. Did you tell this gang they could come to your sister's wake?
No.
But, Mickey, you promised...
She slams the door in our faces. We don't know what to do till
Billy Campbell says, We'll go back to St. Joseph's and pray that from now on everyone in Mickey Spellacy's family will die in the middle of the summer and he'll never get a day off from school for the rest of his life.
One of our prayers is surely powerful because next summer Mickey himself is carried off by the galloping consumption and he doesn't get a day off from school and that will surely teach him a lesson.
Proddy Woddy ring the bell,
Not for heaven but for hell.
On Sunday mornings in Limerick I watch them go to church, the Protestants, and I feel sorry for them, especially the girls, who are so lovely, they have such beautiful white teeth. I feel sorry for the beautiful Protestant girls, they're doomed. That's what the priests tell us. Outside the Catholic Church there is no salvation. Outside the Catholic Church there is nothing but doom. And I want to save them. Protestant girl, come with me to the True Church. You'll be saved and you won't have the doom. After Mass on Sunday I go with my friend Billy Campbell to watch them play croquet on the lovely lawn beside their church on Barrington Street. Croquet is a Protestant game. They hit the ball with the mallet, pock and pock again, and laugh. I wonder how they can laugh or don't they even know they're doomed? I feel sorry for them and I say, Billy, what's the use of playing croquet when you're doomed?
He says, Frankie, what's the use of not playing croquet when you're doomed?
Grandma says to Mam, Your brother Pat, bad leg an' all, was selling papers all over Limerick by the time he was eight and that Frank of yours is big and ugly enough to work.
But he's only nine and still in school.
School. 'Tis school that has him the way he is talkin' back an' goin' around with the sour puss an' the odd manner like his father. He could get out an' help poor Pat of a Friday night when the Limerick Leader is a ton weight. He could run up the long garden paths of the quality an' save Pat's poor legs an' earn a few pennies into the bargain.
He has to go to the Confraternity on Friday nights.
Never mind the Confraternity. There's nothin' in the catechism about confraternities.
I meet Uncle Pat at the Limerick Leader on Friday evening at five. The man handing out the papers says my arms are that skinny I'd be lucky to carry two stamps but Uncle Pat sticks eight papers under each arm. He tells me, I'll kill you if you drop 'em for 'tis raining abroad, pelting out of the heavens. He tells me hug the walls going up O'Connell Street to keep the papers dry. I'm to run in where there's a delivery, climb the outside steps, in the door, up the stairs, yell Paper, get the money they owe him for the week, down the stairs, give him the money and on to the next stop. Customers give him tips for his troubles and he keeps them for himself.
We make our way up O'Connell Avenue, out Ballinacurra, in by the South Circular Road, down Henry Street and back to the office for more papers. Uncle Pat wears a cap and a thing like a cowboy poncho to keep his papers dry but he complains his feet are killing him and we stop in a pub for a pint for his poor feet. Uncle Pa Keating is there all black and having a pint and he says to Uncle Pat, Ab, are you going to let that boy stand there with his face hanging out for the want of a lemonade?
Uncle Pat says, Wha? and Uncle Pa Keating gets impatient. Christ, he's dragging your feckin' papers all over Limerick and you can't-Oh, never mind. Timmy, give the child a lemonade. Frankie, don't you have a raincoat at home?
No, Uncle Pa.
You're not supposed to be out in this weather. You're drenched entirely. Who sent you out in this muck?
Grandma said I had to help Uncle Pat because of his bad leg. Course she did, the oul' bitch, but don't tell them I said that. Uncle Pat is struggling off the seat and gathering up his papers.
Come on, 'tis gettin' dark.
He hobbles along the streets calling, Anna Lie Sweets Lie, which
doesn't sound a bit like Limerick Leader and it doesn't matter because everyone knows this is Ab Sheehan that was dropped on his head. Here, Ab, give us a Leader, how's your poor leg, keep the change an' get yourself a fag for 'tis an awful feckin' night to be out sellin' the feckin' papers.
Tanks, says Ab, my uncle. Tanks, tanks, tanks, and it's hard to keep up with him on the streets bad as his leg is. He says, How many Leaders have you under your oxter?
One, Uncle Pat.
Take that Leader in to Mr. Timoney. He owes me for a fortnight now. Get that money an' there's a tip. He's a good man for the tip an' don't be shovin' it in your pocket like your cousin Gerry. Shoved it in his pocket, the little bugger.
I bang on the door with the knocker and there's a great howl from a dog so big he makes the door shake. A man's voice says, Macushla, quit the bloody racket or I'll give you a good fong in the arse for yourself. The racket stops, the door opens and the man is there, white hair, thick glasses, white sweater, a stick in his hand. He says, Who is it? Who do we have?
The paper, Mr. Timoney.
We don't have Ab Sheehan here, do we?
I'm his nephew, sir.
Is it Gerry Sheehan we have here?
No, sir. I'm Frank McCourt.
Another nephew? Does he make them? Is there a little nephew factory
in the backyard? Here's the money for the fortnight and give me the paper
or keep it. What's the use? I can't read anymore and Mrs. Minihan that's supposed to read to me didn't come. Legless with the sherry, that's what she is. What's your name?
Frank, sir.
Can you read?
I can, sir.
Do you want to earn a sixpence?
I do, sir.
Come here tomorrow. Your name is Francis, isn't it? Frank, sir.
Your name is Francis. There was never a St. Frank. That's a name for gangsters and politicians. Come here tomorrow at eleven and read to me.
I will, sir.
Are you sure you can read?
I am, sir.
You can call me Mr. Timoney.
I will, Mr. Timoney.
Uncle Pat is mumbling at the gate, rubbing his leg. Where's me
money an' you're not supposed to be chattin' with the customers an' me here with the leg destroyed be the rain. He has to stop at the pub at Punch's Cross to have a pint for the destroyed leg. After the pint he says he can't walk another inch and we get on a bus. The conductor says, Fares, please, fares, but Uncle Pat says, Go 'way an' don't be botherin' me, can't you see the state o' me leg?
Oh, all right, Ab, all right.
The bus stops at the O'Connell Monument and Uncle Pat goes to the Monument Fish and Chip Café where the smells are so delicious my stomach beats with the hunger. He gets a shilling's worth of fish and chips and my mouth is watering but when we get to Grandma's door he gives me a threepenny bit, tells me meet him again next Friday and go home now to my mother.
The dog Macushla is lying outside Mr. Timoney's door and when I open the little garden gate to go up the path she rushes at me and knocks me back out on the pavement and she'd eat my face if Mr. Timoney didn't come out and flail at her with his stick and yell, Come in out of it, ye hoor, ye overgrown man eatin' bitch. Didn't you have your breakfast, you hoor? Are you all right, Francis? Come in. That dog is a right Hindu, so she is, and that's where I found her mother wandering around Bangalore. If ever you're getting a dog, Francis, make sure it's a Buddhist. Good natured dogs, the Buddhists. Never, never get a Mahommedan. They'll eat you sleeping. Never a Catholic dog. They'll eat you every day including Fridays. Sit down and read to me.
The Limerick Leader, Mr. Timoney?
No, not the bloody Limerick Leader. I wouldn't wipe the hole of my arse with the Limerick Leader. There's a book over there on the table, Gulliver's Travels. That's not what I want you to read. Look in the back for another thing, A Modest Proposal. Read that to me. It begins, It is a melancholy object to those who walk... Do you have that? I have the whole bloody thing in my head but I still want you to read to me.
He stops me after two or three pages. You're a good reader. And what do you think of that, Francis, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled, eh? Macushla would love a dinner of a nice plump Irish infant, wouldn't you, you oul' hoor?
He gives me sixpence, and tells me return next Saturday.
Mam is delighted I earned sixpence for reading to Mr. Timoney and what was it he wanted read, the Limerick Leader? I tell her I had to read A Modest Proposal from the back of Gulliver's Travels and she says, That's all right, 'tis only a children's book. You'd expect him to want something strange for he's a little off in the head after years in the sun in the English army in India and they say he was married to one of them Indian women and she was accidentally shot by a soldier during some class of a disturbance. That's the kind of thing that would drive you to children's books. She knows this Mrs. Minihan who lives next door to Mr. Timoney and used to clean house but couldn't stand it anymore the way he laughed at the Catholic Church and said one man's sin was another man's romp. Mrs. Minihan didn't mind the odd drop of sherry of a Saturday morning but then he tried to turn her into a Buddhist, which he said he was himself and the Irish would be much better off in general if they sat under a tree and watched the Ten Commandments and the Seven Deadly Sins float down the Shannon and far out to sea.
The next Friday Declan Collopy from the Confraternity sees me on the street delivering the papers with my uncle Pat Sheehan. Hoi, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' with Ab Sheehan?
He's my uncle.
You're supposed to be at the Confraternity.
I'm working, Declan.
You're not supposed to be working. You're not even ten and you're
destroyin' the perfect attendance in our section. If you're not there next Friday I'll give you a good thump in the gob, do you hear me?
Uncle Pat says, Go 'way, go 'way, or I'll walk on you.
Ah, shut up, Mr. Stupid that was dropped on your head. He pushes Uncle Pat on the shoulder and knocks him back against the wall. I drop the papers and run at him but he steps aside and punches me on the back of the neck and my forehead is rammed into the wall and it puts me in such a rage I can't see him anymore. I go at him with arms and legs and if I could tear his face off with my teeth I would but he has long arms like a gorilla and he just keeps pushing me away so that I can't touch him. He says, You mad feckin' eejit. I'll destroy you in the Confraternity, and he runs away.
Uncle Pat says, You shouldn't be fightin' like that an' you dropped all me papers an' some o' them is wet an' how am I supposed to sell wet papers, and I wanted to jump on him too and hit him for talking about papers after I stood up to Declan Collopy.
At the end of the night he gives me three chips from his bag and sixpence instead of threepence. He complains it's too much money and it's all my mother's fault for going on to Grandma about the low pay.
Mam is delighted I'm getting sixpence on Fridays from Uncle Pat and sixpence on Saturdays from Mr. Timoney. A shilling a week makes a big difference and she gives me tuppence to see the Dead End Kids at the Lyric after I'm finished the reading.
Next morning Mr. Timoney says, Wait till we get to Gulliver, Francis. You'll know Jonathan Swift is the greatest Irish writer that ever lived, no, the greatest man to put pen to parchment. A giant of a man, Francis. He laughs all through A Modest Proposal and you'd wonder what he's laughing at when it's all about cooking Irish babies. He says, You'll laugh when you grow up, Francis.
You're not supposed to talk back to grown-ups but Mr. Timoney is different and he doesn't mind when I say, Mr. Timoney, big people are
always telling us that. Oh, you'll laugh when you grow up. You'll understand when you grow up. Everything will come when you grow up.
He lets out such a roar of a laugh I think he's going to collapse. Oh, Mother o' God, Francis. You're a treasure. What's up with you? Do you have a bee up your arse? Tell me what's up.
Nothing, Mr. Timoney.
I think you have the long puss, Francis, and I wish I could Go over to the mirror on the wall, Snow White, and tell me if you the long puss. Never mind. Just tell me what's up.
Declan Collopy was at me last night and I got into a fight.
He makes me tell him about the Confraternity and Declan and
uncle Pat Sheehan, who was dropped on his head, and then he tells
knows my uncle Pa Keating, who was gassed in the war and works in
works. He says, Pa Keating is a jewel of a man. And I'll tell you
I'll do, Francis. I'll talk to Pa Keating and we'll go to the crawthumpers at the Confraternity. I'm a Buddhist myself and I don't hold with fighting but I haven't lost it. They're not going to interfere with my little reader, oh, by Jesus, no.
Mr. Timoney is an old man but he talks like a friend and I can say what I feel. Dad would never talk to me like Mr. Timoney. He'd say, Och, aye, and go for a long walk.
Uncle Pat Sheehan tells Grandma he doesn't want me to help with the papers anymore, he can get another boy much cheaper and he thinks I should be giving him some of my Saturday morning sixpence anyway since I'd never have the reading job without him.
A woman next door to Mr. Timoney tells me I'm wasting my time knocking on the door, Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun on the same day and Mr. Timoney couldn't stop laughing though he cried when the dog was taken away to be put down. You can bite postmen and milkmen all you like but the case of the passing nun goes all the way to the bishop and he takes steps especially if the owner of the dog is a known Buddhist and a danger to good Catholics around him. Mr. Timoney was told this and cried and laughed so hard the doctor came and said he was gone beyond recall so they carted him off to the City Home, where they keep old people who are helpless or demented.
That's the end of my Saturday sixpence but I'll read to Mr. Timoney money or no money. I wait down the street till the woman next door goes in, I climb in Mr. Timoney's window for Gulliver'sTravels and walk miles to the City Home so that he won't miss his reading. The man at the gate says, What? You want to come in an' read to an oul' man? Is it coddin' me you are? Get outa here before I call the guards.
Could I leave the book for someone else to read to Mr. Timoney? Leave it. Leave it for Jaysus sake an' don't be botherin' me. I'll send it up to him.
And he laughs.
Mam says, What's up with you? Why are you moping? And I tell her how Uncle Pat doesn't want me anymore and how they put Mr. Timoney in the City Home for laughing just because Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun. She laughs too and I'm sure the world is gone mad. Then she says, Ah, I'm sorry and it's a pity you lost two jobs. You might as well start going to the Confraternity again to keep The Posse away and, worse, the director, Father Gorey.
Declan tells me sit in front of him and if there's any blaguarding he'll break my feckin' neck for he'll be watching me as long as he's
see it. have
my
me he
the gas
what
prefect and no little shit like me is going to keep him from a life in linoleum.
Mam says she has trouble climbing the stairs and she's moving her bed to the kitchen. She laughs, I'll come back up to Sorrento when the walls are damp and the rain runs under the door. School is over and she can stay in bed in the kitchen as long as she likes because she doesn't have to get up for us. Dad lights the fire, makes the tea, cuts the bread, makes sure we wash our faces and tells us go out and play. He lets us stay in bed if we like but you never want to stay in bed when there's no school. We're ready to run out and play in the lane the minute we wake.
Then one day in July he says we can't go downstairs. We have to stay up here and play.
Why, Dad?
Never mind. Play here with Malachy and Michael and you can go down later when I tell you.
He stands at the door in case we might get a notion to wander down the stairs. We push our blanket up in the air with our feet and pretend we're in a tent, Robin Hood and his Merry Men. We hunt fleas and squash them between our thumbnails.
Then there's a baby's cry and Malachy says, Dad, did Mam get a new
baby?
Och, aye, son.
I'm older so I tell Malachy the bed is in the kitchen so that the angel can fly down and leave the baby on the seventh step but Malachy doesn't understand because he's only eight going on nine and I'll be ten next month.
Mam is in the bed with the new baby. He has a big fat face and he's red all over. There's a woman in the kitchen in a nurse's uniform and we know she's there to wash new babies who are always dirty from the long journey with the angel. We want to tickle the baby but she says, No, no, ye can look at him but don't lay a finger.
Don't lay a finger. That's the way nurses talk.
We sit at the table with our tea and bread looking at our new brother but he won't even open his eyes to look back at us so we go out and play.
In a few days Mam is out of the bed holding the baby on her lap by the fire. His eyes are open and when we tickle him he makes a gurgling sound, his belly shakes and that makes us laugh. Dad tickles him and sings a Scottish song, Oh, oh, stop your ticklin', Jock, Stop your ticklin', Jock.
Stop your ticklin',
Ickle ickle icklin
Stop your ticklin', Jock.
Dad has a job so Bridey Hannon is able to visit Mam and the baby any time she likes and for once Mam doesn't tell us go out and play so they can talk about secret things. They sit by the fire smoking and talking about names. Mam says she likes the names Kevin and Sean but Bridey says, Ah, no, there's too many of them in Limerick. Jesus, Angela, if you stuck your head out the door and called, Kevin or Sean, come in for your tea, you'd have half o' Limerick running to your door.
Bridey says if she had a son which please God she will some day she'll call him Ronald because she's mad about Ronald Colman that you see in the Coliseum Cinema. Or Errol, now that's another lovely name, Errol Flynn.
Mam says, Will you go way outa that, Bridey. I'd never be able to stick my head out the door and say, Errol, Errol, come in for your tea. Sure the poor child would be a laughingstock.
Ronald, says Bridey, Ronald. He's gorgeous.
No, says Mam, it has to be Irish. Isn't that what we fought for all these years? What's the use of fighting the English for centuries if we're going to call our children Ronald?
Jesus, Angela, you're starting to talk like himself with his Irish this and his English that.
Still an' all, Bridey, he's right.
Suddenly Bridey is gasping, Jesus, Angela, there's something wrong with that child. Mam is out of the chair, hugging the child, moaning. Oh, Jesus, Bridey, he's choking.
Bridey says, I'll run for my mother, and she's back in a minute with Mrs. Hannon. Castor oil, says Mrs. Hannon. Do you have it? Any oil. Cod liver oil? That'll do.
She pours the oil into the baby's mouth, turns him over, presses on his back, turns him back over, sticks a spoon down his throat and brings up a white ball. That's it now, she says. The milk. It collects and gets hard in their little throats so you have to ease it with any class of an oil.
Mam is crying, Jesus, I nearly lost him. Oh, I'd die so I would.
She's clutching the baby and crying and trying to thank Mrs. Hannon.
Yerra, don't mention it, missus. Take the child and get back into that bed for the two o' ye had a great shock.
While Bridey and Mrs. Hannon are helping Mam to the bed I notice spots of blood on her chair. Is my mother bleeding to death? Is it all right to say, Look, there's blood on Mam's chair? No, you can't say anything because they always have secrets. I know if you say anything the grown-up people will tell you, Never mind, you're always gawking, none of your business, go out and play.
I have to keep it inside or I can talk to the angel. Mrs. Hannon and Bridey leave and I sit on the seventh step. I try to tell the angel Mam is bleeding to death. I want him to tell me, Fear not, but the step is cold and there's no light, no voice. I'm sure he's gone forever and I wonder if that happens when you go from nine to ten.
Mam doesn't bleed to death. She's out of the bed next day getting the baby ready for baptism, telling Bridey she could never forgive herself if the baby died and went to Limbo, a place for unbaptized babies, where it may be nice and warm but, still, dark forever and no hope of escape even on the Judgment Day.
Grandma is there to help and she says, That's right, no hope in heaven for the infant that's not baptized.
Bridey says it would be a hard God that would do the likes of that.
He has to be hard, says Grandma, otherwise you'd have all kinds of babies clamorin' to get into heaven, Protestants an' everything, an' why should they get in after what they did to us for eight hundred years?
The babies didn't do it, says Bridey. They're too small.
They would if they got the chance, says Grandma. They're trained for it.
They dress the baby in the Limerick lace dress we were all baptized in. Mam says we can all go to St. Joseph's and we're excited because there will be lemonade and buns after.
Malachy says, Mam, what's the baby's name?
Alphonsus Joseph.
The words fly out of my mouth, That's a stupid name. It's not even
Irish.
Grandma glares at me with her old red eyes. She says, That fella
needs a good clitther on the gob. Mam slaps me across the face and sends me flying across the kitchen. My heart is pounding and I want to cry but I can't because my father isn't there and I'm the man of the family. Mam says, You go upstairs with your big mouth and don't move from that room.
I stop at the seventh step but it's still cold, no light, no voice.
The house is quiet with everyone gone to the chapel. I sit and wait upstairs, knocking the fleas off my arms and legs, wishing I had Dad here, thinking of my little brother and his foreign name, Alphonsus, an affliction of a name.
In awhile there are voices downstairs and there is talk of tea, sherry, lemonade, buns, and isn't that child the loveliest little fella in the world, little Alphie, foreign name but still an' all still an' all not a sound outa him the whole time he's that good-natured God bless him sure he'll live forever with the sweetness that's in him the little dote spittin' image of his mother his father his grandma his little brothers dead an' gone.
Mam calls from the bottom of the stairs, Frank, come down and have lemonade and a bun.
I don't want it. You can keep it.
I said come down this minute for if I have to climb these stairs I'll warm your behind and you'll rue the day.
Rue? What's rue?
Never mind what's rue. Come down here at once.
Her voice is sharp and rue sounds dangerous. I'll go down.
In the kitchen Grandma says, Look at the long puss on him. You'd
think he'd be happy for his little brother except that a boy that's going from nine to ten is always a right pain in the arse an' I know for didn't I have two of 'em.
The lemonade and bun are delicious and Alphie the new baby is chirping away enjoying his baptism day too innocent to know his name is an affliction.
Grandpa in the North sends a telegram money order for five pounds for the baby Alphie. Mam wants to cash it but she can't go far from the bed. Dad says he'll cash it at the post office. She tells Malachy and me to go with him. He cashes it and tells us, All right, boys, go home and tell your mother I'll be home in a few minutes.
Malachy says, Dad, you're not to go to the pub. Mam said you're to bring home the money. You're not to drink the pint.
Now, now, son. Go home to your mother. Dad, give us the money. That money is for the baby.
Now, Francis, don't be a bad boy. Do what your father tells you.
He walks away from us and into South's pub. Mam is sitting by the fireplace with Alphie in her arms. She shakes her head. He went to the pub, didn't he? He did. I want ye to go back down to that pub and read
him out of it. I want ye to stand in the middle of the pub and tell every man your father is drinking the money for the baby. Ye are to tell the world there isn't a scrap of food in this house, not a lump of coal to start the fire, not a drop of milk for the baby's bottle.
We walk through the streets and Malachy practices his speech at the top of his voice, Dad, Dad, that five pounds is for the new baby. That's not for the drink. The child is above in the bed bawling and roaring for his milk and you're drinking the pint.
He's gone from South's pub. Malachy still wants to stand and make his speech but I tell him we have to hurry and look in other pubs before Dad drinks the whole five pounds. We can't find him in other pubs either. He knows Mam would come for him or send us and there are so many pubs at this end of Limerick and beyond we could be looking for a month. We have to tell Mam there's no sign of him and she tells us we're pure useless. Oh, Jesus, I wish I had my strength and I'd search every pub in Limerick. I'd tear the mouth out of his head, so I would. Go on, go back down and try all the pubs around the railway station and try Naughton's fish and chip shop.
I have to go by myself because Malachy has the runs and can't stray far from the bucket. I search all the pubs on Parnell Street and around. I look into the snugs where the women drink and in all the men's lavatories. I'm hungry but I'm afraid to go home till I find my father. He's not in Naughton's fish and chip shop but there's a drunken man asleep at a table in the corner and his fish and chips are on the floor in their Limerick Leader wrapping and if I don't get them the cat will so I shove them under my jersey and I'm out the door and up the street to sit on the steps at the railway station eat my fish and chips watch the drunken soldiers pass by with the girls that giggle thank the drunken man in my mind for drowning the fish and chips in vinegar and smothering them in salt and then remember that if I die tonight I'm in a state of sin for stealing and I could go straight to hell stuffed with fish and chips but it's Saturday and if the priests are still in the confession boxes I can clear my soul after my feed.
The Dominican church is just up Glentworth Street.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession. I tell him the usual sins and then, I stole fish and chips from a drunken man.
Why, my child?
I was hungry, Father.
And why were you hungry?
There was nothing in my belly, Father.
He says nothing and even though it's dark I know he's shaking his
head. My dear child, why can't you go home and ask your mother for something? Because she sent me out looking for my father in the pubs, Father, and I couldn't find him and she hasn't a scrap in the house because he's drinking the five pounds Grandpa sent from the North for the new baby and she's raging by the fire because I can't find my father.
I wonder if this priest is asleep because he's very quiet till he says, My child, I sit here. I hear the sins of the poor. I assign the penance. I bestow absolution. I should be on my knees washing their feet. Do you understand me, my child?
I tell him I do but I don't.
Go home, child. Pray for me.
No penance, Father?
No, my child.
I stole the fish and chips. I'm doomed.
You're forgiven. Go. Pray for me. He blesses me in Latin, talks to
himself in English and I wonder what I did to him. I wish I could find my father so I could say to Mam, Here he is and he has three pounds left in his pocket. I'm not hungry now so I can go up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and search pubs on the side streets and there he is in Gleeson's, how could I miss him with his singing, 'Tis alone my concern if the grandest surprise Would be shining at me out of somebody's eyes.
'Tis my private affair what my feelings would be While the Green Glens of Antrim were welcoming me.
My heart is banging away in my chest and I don't know what to do because I know I'm raging inside like my mother by the fire and all I can think of doing is running in and giving him a good kick in the leg and running out again but I don't because we have the mornings by the fire when he tells me about Cuchulain and De Valera and Roosevelt and if he's there drunk and buying pints with the baby's money he has that look in his eyes Eugene had when he searched for Oliver and I might as well go home and tell my mother a lie that I never saw him couldn't find him.
She's in the bed with the baby. Malachy and Michael are up in Italy asleep. I know I don't have to tell Mam anything, that soon when the pubs close he'll be home singing and offering us a penny to die for Ireland and it will be different now because it's bad enough to drink the dole or the wages but a man that drinks the money for a new baby is gone beyond the beyonds as my mother would say.
VIII
I'm ten years old and ready to go to St. Joseph's Church for my Confirmation. In school the master, Mr. O'Dea, prepares us. We have to know all about Sanctifying Grace, a pearl of great price, bought for us by Jesus in His dying. Mr. O'Dea's eyes roll in his head when he tells us that with Confirmation we will become part of Divinity. We will have the Gifts of the Holy Ghost: Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, the Fear of the Lord. Priests and masters tell us Confirmation means you're a true soldier of the Church and that entitles you to die and be a martyr in case we're invaded by Protestants or Mahommedans or any other class of a heathen. More dying. I want to tell them I won't be able to die for the Faith because I'm already booked to die for Ireland.
Mikey Molloy says, Is it jokin' you are? That thing about dying for the Faith is all a cod. 'Tis only a saying they made up to frighten you. Ireland too. No one dies for anything anymore. All the dying is done. I wouldn't die for Ireland or the Faith. I might die for my mother but that's all.
Mikey knows everything. He's going on fourteen. He gets the fits. He has visions.
The grown-ups tell us it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith, only we're not ready for that yet because Confirmation day is like First Communion day, you make the rounds of lanes and back streets and you get cakes and sweets and money, The Collection.
That's where poor Peter Dooley comes in. We call him Quasimodo because he has a hump on his back like the one on the hunchback of Notre Dame, whose real name we know is Charles Laughton.
Quasimodo has nine sisters and it is said his mother never wanted him but that was what the angel brought her and it's a sin to question what's sent. Quasimodo is old, he's fifteen. His red hair sticks up in all directions. He has green eyes and one rolls around in his head so much he's constantly tapping his temple to keep it where it's supposed to be. His right leg is short and twisted and when he walks he does a little twirly dance and you never know when he'll fall. That's when you're surprised. He curses his leg, he curses the world, but he curses in a lovely English accent which he got from the radio, the BBC. Before he leaves his house he always sticks his head out the door and tells the lane, Here's me head, me arse is coming. When he was twelve Quasimodo decided that with the way he looked and the way the world looked at him the best thing would be to prepare for a job where he could be heard and not seen and what better than sitting behind a microphone at the BBC in London reading the news?
But you can't get to London without money and that's why he hobbles up to us that Friday, the day before Confirmation. He has an idea for Billy and me. He knows the next day we'll be getting Confirmation money and if we promise to pay him a shilling each he'll let us climb up the rainspout behind his house this very night to look in the window and see his sisters' naked bodies when they take their weekly wash. I sign right away. Billy says, I have my own sister. Why should I pay to see your naked sisters?
Quasimodo says that looking at your own sister's naked body is the worst sin of all and he's not sure if there's a priest in the world can forgive you, that you might have to go to the bishop, who everyone knows is a holy terror.
Billy signs.
Friday night we climb the wall of Quasimodo's backyard. It's a lovely night with the June moon floating high over Limerick and you can feel a warm breeze off the Shannon River. Quasimodo is about to let Billy up the spout and who comes clambering over the wall but Mikey Molloy the Fit himself hissing at Quasimodo, Here's a shilling, Quasimodo. Let me up the spout. Mikey is fourteen now, bigger than any of us and strong from his job delivering coal. He's black from the coal like Uncle Pa Keating and all you can see are the whites of his eyes and the white froth on his lower lip, which means he could have the fit anytime.
Quasimodo says, Wait, Mikey. They're first. Wait, my arse, says Mikey, and he's away up the spout. Billy complains but Quasimodo shakes his head, I can't help it. He comes every week with the shilling. I have to let him up the spout or he'll beat me up and tell my mother and the next thing she locks me in the coal hole all day with the rats. The Fit is up hanging on to the spout with one hand. The other hand is in his pocket moving, moving and when the spout itself starts to move and creak Quasimodo hisses, Molloy, there's to be no whankin' up the spout. He hops around the yard cackling. His BBC accent is gone and he's pure Limerick. Jaysus, Molloy, come down off that spout or I'll tell me mother. Mikey's hand goes faster in his pocket, so fast the spout gives a lurch and collapses and Mikey is rolling on the ground yelping, I'm dead. I'm destroyed. Oh, God. You can see the froth on his lips and the blood that comes from biting his tongue.
Quasimodo's mother comes screaming through the door, What in the name of Jesus! and the kitchen light fills the yard. The sisters are squawking from the window above. Billy tries to escape and she drags him off the wall. She tells him run to O'Connor the chemist around the corner to ring up an ambulance or a doctor or something for Mikey. She screams at us to get into the kitchen. She kicks Quasimodo into the hall. He's on his hands and knees and she drags him to the coal hole under the stairs and locks him in. Stay there till you come to your senses.
He's crying and calling to her in a pure Limerick accent. Ah, Mamma, Mamma, let me out. The rats is here. I only want to go to the BBC, Mamma. Aw, Jasus, Mamma, Jasus. I'll never let anyone up the spout again. I'll send money from London, Mamma. Mamma!
Mikey is still on his back, jerking and twisting around the yard. The ambulance takes him off to the hospital with a broken shoulder and his tongue in ribbons.
Our mothers are there in no time. Mrs. Dooley says, I'm disgraced, so I am, disgraced. My daughters can't wash theirselves of a Friday night without the whole world gawking in the window and them boys there are in a state of sin and should be taken to the priest for confession before their Confirmation tomorrow.
But Mam says, I don't know about the rest of the world but I saved a whole year for Frank's Confirmation suit and I'm not going to the priest to have him tell me my son is not fit for Confirmation so that I'll have to wait another year when he grows out of this suit and all because he climbed a spout for an innocent gawk at the scrawny arse of Mona Dooley.
She drags me home by the ear and makes me kneel before the Pope. Swear, she says, swear to that Pope that you didn't look at Mona Dooley in her pelt.
I swear.
If you're lying you won't be in a state of grace for Confirmation tomorrow and that's the worst kind of sacrilege.
I swear.
Only the bishop himself could forgive a sacrilege like that.
I swear.
All right. Go to bed and from this day out stay far away from that
misfortunate Quasimodo Dooley.
We are all confirmed the next day. The bishop asks me a catechism
question, What is the Fourth Commandment? and I tell him, Honor thy father and thy mother. He pats my cheek and that makes me a soldier of the True Church. I kneel in the pew and think of Quasimodo locked in the coal hole under the stairs and I wonder, Should I give him the shilling anyway for his career at the BBC?
But I forget all about Quasimodo because my nose starts bleeding and I feel dizzy. Confirmation boys and girls are outside St. Joseph's with their parents and there is hugging and kissing in the bright sun and I don't care. My father is working and I don't care. My mother kisses me and I don't care. The boys talk about The Collection and I don't care. My nose won't stop and Mam is worried I'll ruin my suit. She runs into the church to see if Stephen Carey, the sacristan, would spare her a rag and he gives her some kind of canvas cloth that makes my nose sore. She says, Do you want to make your collection? and I tell her I don't care. Malachy says, Do, do, Frankie, and he's sad because I promised I'd take him to the Lyric Cinema to see the film and stuff ourselves with sweets. I want
to lie down. I could lie down there on the steps of St. Joseph's and sleep forever. Mam says, Grandma is making a nice breakfast, and the mention of food makes me so sick I run to the edge of the pavement to throw up and the whole world is looking at me and I don't care. Mam says she'd better take me home and put me to bed and my pals look surprised that anyone can go to bed when there's a collection to be made.
She helps me take off my Confirmation suit and puts me to bed. She wets a rag and places it under my neck and after awhile the bleeding stops. She brings tea but the look of it makes me sick and I have to throw up in the bucket. Mrs. Hannon comes in from next door and I can hear her say that's a very sick child and he should have a doctor. Mam says it's Saturday, the Dispensary is closed and where would you get a doctor?
Dad comes home from his job at Rank's Flour Mills and tells Mam I'm going through a stage, growing pains. Grandma comes up and says the same thing. She says when boys go from the one number year, which is nine, to the two number year, which is ten, they're changing and prone to the nosebleed. She says I might have too much blood in me anyway and a good cleaning out wouldn't do me one bit of harm.
The day passes and I'm in and out of sleep. Malachy and Michael come into the bed at night and I can hear Malachy say, Frankie is very hot. Michael says, He's bleeding on my leg. Mam puts the wet rag on my nose and a key on my neck but it won't stop the bleeding. On Sunday morning there's blood on my chest and all around me. Mam tells Dad I'm bleeding through my bottom and he says I might have a case of the runs, which is common with the growing pains.
Dr. Troy is our doctor but he's away on holiday and the man that comes to see me on Monday has a smell of whiskey on him. He examines me and tells my mother I have a bad cold and keep me in bed. Days pass and I sleep and bleed. Mam makes tea and beef tea and I don't want it. She even brings ice cream and the look of it makes me sick. Mrs. Hannon comes in again and says that doctor doesn't know what he's talking about, see if Dr. Troy is back.
Mam comes with Dr. Troy. He feels my forehead, rolls up my eyelids, turns me over to see my back, picks me up and runs to his motor car. Mam runs after him and he tells her I have typhoid fever. Mam cries, Oh, God, oh, God, am I to lose the whole family? Will it ever end? She gets into the car, holds me in her lap and moans all the way to the Fever Hospital at the City Home.
The bed has cool white sheets. The nurses have clean white uniforms and the nun, Sister Rita, is all in white. Dr. Humphrey and Dr. Campbell have white coats and things hanging from their necks which they stick against my chest and all over. I sleep and sleep but I'm awake when they bring in jars of bright red stuff that hang from tall poles above my bed and they stick tubes into my ankles and the back of my right hand. Sister Rita says, You're getting blood, Francis. Soldier's blood from the Sarsfield Barracks.
Mam is sitting by the bed and the nurse is saying, You know, missus, this is very unusual. No one is ever allowed into the Fever Hospital for fear they'd catch something but they made an exception for you with his crisis coming. If he gets over this he'll surely recover.
I fall asleep. Mam is gone when I wake but there's movement in the room and it's the priest, Father Gorey, from the Confraternity saying Mass at a table in the corner. I drift off again and now they're waking
me and pulling down the bedclothes. Father Gorey is touching me with oil and praying in Latin. I know it's Extreme Unction and that means I'm going to die and I don't care. They wake me again to receive Communion. I don't want it, I'm afraid I might get sick. I keep the wafer on my tongue and fall asleep and when I wake up again it's gone.
It's dark and Dr. Campbell is sitting by my bed. He's holding my wrist and looking at his watch. He has red hair and glasses and he always smiles when he talks to me. He sits now and hums and looks out the window. His eyes close and he snores a little. He tilts over on the chair and farts and smiles to himself and I know now I'm going to get better because a doctor would never fart in the presence of a dying boy.
Sister Rita's white habit is bright in the sun that comes in the window. She's holding my wrist, looking at her watch, smiling. Oh, she says, we're awake, are we? Well, Francis, I think we've come through the worst. Our prayers are answered and all the prayers of those hundreds of little boys at the Confraternity. Can you imagine that? Hundreds of boys saying the rosary for you and offering up their communion.
My ankles and the back of my hand are throbbing from the tubes bringing in the blood and I don't care about boys praying for me. I can hear the swish of Sister Rita's habit and the click of her rosary beads when she leaves the room. I fall asleep and when I wake it's dark and Dad is sitting by the bed with his hand on mine.
Son, are you awake?
I try to talk but I'm dry, nothing will come out and I point to my mouth. He holds a glass of water to my lips and it's sweet and cool. He presses my hand and says I'm a great old soldier and why wouldn't I? Don't I have the soldier's blood in me?
The tubes are not in me anymore and the glass jars are gone.
Sister Rita comes in and tells Dad he has to go. I don't want him to go because he looks sad. He's like Paddy Clohessy the day I gave him the raisin. When he looks sad it's the worst thing in the world and I start crying. Now what's this? says Sister Rita. Crying with all that soldier blood in you? There's a big surprise for you tomorrow, Francis. You'll never guess. Well, I'll tell you, we're bringing you a nice biscuit with your tea in the morning. Isn't that a treat? And your father will be back in a day or two, won't you, Mr. McCourt?
Dad nods and puts his hand on mine again. He looks at me, steps away, stops, comes back, kisses me on the forehead for the first time in my life and I'm so happy I feel like floating out of the bed.
The other two beds in my room are empty. The nurse says I'm the only typhoid patient and I'm a miracle for getting over the crisis.
The room next to me is empty till one morning a girl's voice says, Yoo hoo, who's there?
I'm not sure if she's talking to me or someone in the room beyond. Yoo hoo, boy with the typhoid, are you awake?
I am.
Are you better?
I am.
Well, why are you here?
I don't know. I'm still in the bed. They stick needles in me and
give me medicine.
What do you look like?
I wonder, What kind of a question is that? I don't know what to tell her.
Yoo hoo, are you there, typhoid boy?
I am.
What's your name?
Frank.
That's a good name. My name is Patricia Madigan. How old are you? Ten. Oh. She sounds disappointed.
But I'll be eleven in August, next month.
Well, that's better than ten. I'll be fourteen in September. Do you
want to know why I'm in the Fever Hospital? I do.
I have diphtheria and something else.
What's something else?
They don't know. They think I have a disease from foreign parts
because my father used to be in Africa. I nearly died. Are you going to tell me what you look like?
I have black hair.
You and millions.
I have brown eyes with bits of green that's called hazel.
You and thousands.
I have stitches on the back of my right hand and my two feet where
they put in the soldier's blood.
Oh, God, did they?
They did.
You won't be able to stop marching and saluting.
There's a swish of habit and click of beads and then Sister Rita's
voice. Now, now, what's this? There's to be no talking between two rooms especially when it's a boy and a girl. Do you hear me, Patricia?
I do, Sister.
Do you hear me, Francis?
I do, Sister.
You could be giving thanks for your two remarkable recoveries. You
could be saying the rosary. You could be reading The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart that's beside your beds. Don't let me come back and find you talking.
She comes into my room and wags her finger at me. Especially you, Francis, after thousands of boys prayed for you at the Confraternity. Give thanks, Francis, give thanks.
She leaves and there's silence for awhile. Then Patricia whispers, Give thanks, Francis, give thanks, and say your rosary, Francis, and I laugh so hard a nurse runs in to see if I'm all right. She's a very stern nurse from the County Kerry and she frightens me. What's this, Francis? Laughing? What is there to laugh about? Are you and that Madigan girl talking? I'll report you to Sister Rita. There's to be no laughing for you could be doing serious damage to your internal apparatus.
She plods out and Patricia whispers again in a heavy Kerry accent, No laughing, Francis, you could be doin' serious damage to your internal apparatus. Say your rosary, Francis, and pray for your internal apparatus.
Mam visits me on Thursdays. I'd like to see my father, too, but I'm out of danger, crisis time is over, and I'm allowed only one visitor. Besides, she says, he's back at work at Rank's Flour Mills and please God this job will last a while with the war on and the English desperate for flour. She brings me a chocolate bar and that proves Dad is working. She could never afford it on the dole. He sends me notes. He tells me my
brothers are all praying for me, that I should be a good boy, obey the doctors, the nuns, the nurses, and don't forget to say my prayers. He's sure St. Jude pulled me through the crisis because he's the patron saint of desperate cases and I was indeed a desperate case.
Patricia says she has two books by her bed. One is a poetry book and that's the one she loves. The other is a short history of England and do I want it? She gives it to Seamus, the man who mops the floors every day, and he brings it to me. He says, I'm not supposed to be bringing anything from a dipteria room to a typhoid room with all the germs flying around and hiding between the pages and if you ever catch dipteria on top of the typhoid they'll know and I'll lose my good job and be out on the street singing patriotic songs with a tin cup in my hand, which I could easily do because there isn't a song ever written about Ireland's sufferings I don't know and a few songs about the joy of whiskey too.
Oh, yes, he knows Roddy McCorley. He'll sing it for me right enough but he's barely into the first verse when the Kerry nurse rushes in. What's this, Seamus? Singing? Of all the people in this hospital you should know the rules against singing. I have a good mind to report you to Sister Rita.
Ah, God, don't do that, nurse.
Very well, Seamus. I'll let it go this one time. You know the singing could lead to a relapse in these patients.
When she leaves he whispers he'll teach me a few songs because singing is good for passing the time when you're by yourself in a typhoid room. He says Patricia is a lovely girl the way she often gives him sweets from the parcel her mother sends every fortnight. He stops mopping the floor and calls to Patricia in the next room, I was telling Frankie you're a lovely girl, Patricia, and she says, You're a lovely man, Seamus. He smiles because he's an old man of forty and he never had children but the ones he can talk to here in the Fever Hospital. He says, Here's the book, Frankie. Isn't it a great pity you have to be reading all about England after all they did to us, that there isn't a history of Ireland to be had in this hospital.
The book tells me all about King Alfred and William the Conqueror and all the kings and queens down to Edward, who had to wait forever for his mother, Victoria, to die before he could be king. The book has the first bit of Shakespeare I ever read.
I do believe, induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy.
The history writer says this is what Catherine, who is a wife of Henry the Eighth, says to Cardinal Wolsey, who is trying to have her head cut off. I don't know what it means and I don't care because it's Shakespeare and it's like having jewels in my mouth when I say the words. If I had a whole book of Shakespeare they could keep me in the hospital for a year.
Patricia says she doesn't know what induced means or potent circumstances and she doesn't care about Shakespeare, she has her poetry book and she reads to me from beyond the wall a poem about an owl and a pussycat that went to sea in a green boat with honey and money and it makes no sense and when I say that Patricia gets huffy and says that's the last poem she'll ever read to me. She says I'm always reciting the lines from Shakespeare and they make no sense either. Seamus stops mopping again and tells us we shouldn't be fighting over poetry because we'll have enough to fight about when we grow up and get married.
Patricia says she's sorry and I'm sorry too so she reads me part of another poem which I have to remember so I can say it back to her early in the morning or late at night when there are no nuns or nurses about, The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees, The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, And the highwayman came riding Riding riding The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn door.
He'd a French cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,
A coat of the claret velvet,
and breeches of brown doe skin,
They fitted with never a wrinkle,
his boots were up to the thigh.
And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,
His pistol butts a-twinkle,
His rapier hilt a-twinkle,
under the jewelled sky.
Every day I can't wait for the doctors and nurses to leave me alone so I can learn a new verse from Patricia and find out what's happening to the highwayman and the landlord's red lipped daughter. I love the poem because it's exciting and almost as good as my two lines of Shakespeare. The redcoats are after the highwayman because they know he told her, I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.
I'd love to do that myself, come by moonlight for Patricia in the next room not giving a fiddler's fart though hell should bar the way. She's ready to read the last few verses when in comes the nurse from Kerry shouting at her, shouting at me, I told ye there was to be no talking between rooms. Dipthteria is never allowed to talk to typhoid and visa versa. I warned ye. And she calls out, Seamus, take this one. Take the by. Sister Rita said one more word out of him and upstairs with him. We gave ye a warning to stop the blathering but ye wouldn't. Take the by, Seamus, take him.
Ah, now, nurse, sure isn't he harmless. 'Tis only a bit o' poetry. Take that by, Seamus, take him at once.
He bends over me and whispers, Ah, God, I'm sorry, Frankie. Here's
your English history book. He slips the book under my shirt and lifts me from the bed. He whispers that I'm a feather. I try to see Patricia when we pass through her room but all I can make out is a blur of dark head on a pillow.
Sister Rita stops us in the hall to tell me I'm a great disappointment to her, that she expected me to be a good boy after what God had done for me, after all the prayers said by hundreds of boys at the Confraternity, after all the care from the nuns and nurses of the Fever Hospital, after the way they let my mother and father in to see me, a thing rarely allowed, and this is how I repaid them lying in the bed reciting silly poetry back and forth with Patricia Madigan knowing very well there was a ban on all talk between typhoid and diphtheria. She says I'll have plenty of time to reflect on my sins in the big ward upstairs and I should beg God's forgiveness for my disobedience reciting a pagan English poem about a thief on a horse and a maiden with red lips who commits a terrible sin when I could have been praying or reading the life
of a saint. She made it her business to read that poem so she did and I'd be well advised to tell the priest in confession.
The Kerry nurse follows us upstairs gasping and holding on to the banister. She tells me I better not get the notion she'll be running up to this part of the world every time I have a little pain or a twinge.
There are twenty beds in the ward, all white, all empty. The nurse tells Seamus put me at the far end of the ward against the wall to make sure I don't talk to anyone who might be passing the door, which is very unlikely since there isn't another soul on this whole floor. She tells Seamus this was the fever ward during the Great Famine long ago and only God knows how many died here brought in too late for anything but a wash before they were buried and there are stories of cries and moans in the far reaches of the night. She says 'twould break your heart to think of what the English did to us, that if they didn't put the blight on the potato they didn't do much to take it off. No pity. No feeling at all for the people that died in this very ward, children suffering and dying here while the English feasted on roast beef and guzzled the best of wine in their big houses, little children with their mouths all green from trying to eat the grass in the fields beyond, God bless us and save us and guard us from future famines.
Seamus says 'twas a terrible thing indeed and he wouldn't want to be walking these halls in the dark with all the little green mouths gaping at him. The nurse takes my temperature, 'Tis up a bit, have a good sleep for yourself now that you're away from the chatter with Patricia Madigan below who will never know a gray hair.
She shakes her head at Seamus and he gives her a sad shake back.
Nurses and nuns never think you know what they're talking about. If you're ten going on eleven you're supposed to be simple like my uncle Pat Sheehan who was dropped on his head. You can't ask questions. You can't show you understand what the nurse said about Patricia Madigan, that she's going to die, and you can't show you want to cry over this girl who taught you a lovely poem which the nun says is bad.
The nurse tells Seamus she has to go and he's to sweep the lint from under my bed and mop up a bit around the ward. Seamus tells me she's a right oul' bitch for running to Sister Rita and complaining about the poem going between the two rooms, that you can't catch a disease from a poem unless it's love ha ha and that's not bloody likely when you're what? ten going on eleven? He never heard the likes of it, a little fella shifted upstairs for saying a poem and he has a good mind to go to the Limerick Leader and tell them print the whole thing except he has this job and he'd lose it if ever Sister Rita found out. Anyway, Frankie, you'll be outa here one of these fine days and you can read all the poetry you want though I don't know about Patricia below, I don't know about Patricia, God help us.
He knows about Patricia in two days because she got out of the bed to go to the lavatory when she was supposed to use a bedpan and collapsed and died in the lavatory. Seamus is mopping the floor and there are tears on his cheeks and he's saying, 'Tis a dirty rotten thing to die in a lavatory when you're lovely in yourself. She told me she was sorry she had you reciting that poem and getting you shifted from the room, Frankie. She said 'twas all her fault.
It wasn't, Seamus.
I know and didn't I tell her that.
Patricia is gone and I'll never know what happened to the highwayman and Bess, the landlord's daughter. I ask Seamus but he doesn't know any poetry at all especially English poetry. He knew an Irish poem once but it was about fairies and had no sign of a highwayman in it. Still he'll ask the men in his local pub where there's always someone reciting something and he'll bring it back to me. Won't I be busy meanwhile reading my short history of England and finding out all
their perfidy. That's what Seamus says, perfidy, and I don't know
means and he doesn't know what it means but if it's something the
do it must be terrible.
He comes three times a week to mop the floor and the nurse is there every morning to take my temperature and pulse. The doctor listens to my chest with the thing hanging from his neck. They all say, And how's our little soldier today? A girl with a blue dress brings meals three times a day and never talks to me. Seamus says she's not right in the head so don't say a word to her.
The July days are long and I fear the dark. There are only two ceiling lights in the ward and they're switched off when the tea tray is taken away and the nurse gives me pills. The nurse tells me go to sleep but I can't because I see people in the nineteen beds in the ward all dying and green around their mouths where they tried to eat grass and moaning for soup Protestant soup any soup and I cover my face with the pillow hoping they won't come and stand around the bed clawing at me and howling for bits of the chocolate bar my mother brought last week.
No, she didn't bring it. She had to send it in because I can't have any more visitors. Sister Rita tells me a visit to the Fever Hospital is a privilege and after my bad behavior with Patricia Madigan and that poem I can't have the privilege anymore. She says I'll be going home in a few weeks and my job is to concentrate on getting better and learn to walk again after being in bed for six weeks and I can get out of bed tomorrow after breakfast. I don't know why she says I have to learn how to walk when I've been walking since I was a baby but when the nurse stands me by the side of the bed I fall to the floor and the nurse laughs, See, you're a baby again.
I practice walking from bed to bed back and forth back and forth. I don't want to be a baby. I don't want to be in this empty ward with no Patricia and no highwayman and no red lipped landlord's daughter. I don't want the ghosts of children with green mouths pointing bony fingers at me and clamoring for bits of my chocolate bar.
Seamus says a man in his pub knew all the verses of the highwayman poem and it has a very sad end. Would I like him to say it because he never learned how to read and he had to carry the poem in his head? He stands in the middle of the ward leaning on his mop and recites, Tlot- tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot in the echoing night!
Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!
Her eyes grew wide for a moment, she drew one last deep breath, Then her finger moved in the moonlight, Her musket shattered the moonlight, Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him-with her death.
He hears the shot and escapes but when he learns at dawn how Bess died he goes into a rage and returns for revenge only to be shot down by the redcoats.
Blood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine red was his velvet coat, When they shot him down on the highway, Down like a dog on
about
what it
English
the highway, And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.
Seamus wipes his sleeve across his face and sniffles. He says, There was no call at all to shift you up here away from Patricia when you didn't even know what happened to the highwayman and Bess. 'Tis a very sad story and when I said it to my wife she wouldn't stop crying the whole night till we went to bed. She said there was no call for them redcoats to shoot that highwayman, they are responsible for half the troubles of the world and they never had any pity on the Irish, either. Now if you want to know any more poems, Frankie, tell me and I'll get them from the pub and bring 'em back in my head.
The girl with the blue dress who's not right in the head suddenly says one day, Would you like a book for to read? and she brings me The Amazing Quest of Mr. Ernest Bliss by E. Phillips Oppenheim, which is all about an Englishman who is fed up and doesn't know what to do with himself every day even though he's so rich he can't count his money. His manservant brings him the morning paper the tea the egg the toast and marmalade and he says, Take it away, life is empty. He can't read his paper, he can't eat his egg, and he pines away. His doctor tells him go and live among the poor in the East End of London and he'll learn to love life, which he does and falls in love with a girl who is poor but honest and very intelligent and they get married and move into his house in the West End which is the rich part because it's easier to help the poor and not be fed up when you're nice and comfortable.
Seamus likes me to tell him what I'm reading. He says that story about Mr. Ernest Bliss is a made-up story because no one in his right mind would have to go to a doctor over having too much money and not eating his egg though you never know. It might be like that in England. You'd never find the likes of that in Ireland. If you didn't eat your egg here you'd be carted off to the lunatic asylum or reported to the bishop.
I can't wait to go home and tell Malachy about this man who won't eat his egg. Malachy will fall down on the floor laughing because such a thing could never happen. He'll say I'm making it up but when I tell him this story is about an Englishman he'll understand.
I can't tell the girl in the blue dress that this story was silly because she might have a fit. She says if you're finished with that book I'll bring you another one because there's a whole box of books left behind by patients from the old days. She brings me a book called Tom Brown's School-Days, which is hard to read, and no end of books by P. G. Wodehouse, who makes me laugh over Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and Jeeves and all the Mulliners. Bertie Wooster is rich but he eats his egg every morning for fear of what Jeeves might say. I wish I could talk to the girl in the blue dress or anyone about the books but I'm afraid the Kerry nurse or Sister Rita might find out and they'd move me to a bigger ward upstairs with fifty empty beds and Famine ghosts galore with green mouths and bony fingers pointing. At night I lie in bed thinking about Tom Brown and his adventures at Rugby School and all the characters in P. G. Wodehouse. I can dream about the red lipped landlord's daughter and the highwayman, and the nurses and nuns can do nothing about it. It's lovely to know the world can't interfere with the inside of your head.
It's August and I'm eleven. I've been in this hospital for two months and I wonder if they'll let me out for Christmas. The Kerry nurse tells me I should get down on my two knees and thank God I'm alive at all at all and not be complaining.
I'm not complaining, nurse, I'm only wondering if I'll be home for Christmas.
She won't answer me. She tells me behave myself or she'll send Sister Rita up to me and then I'll behave myself.
Mam comes to the hospital on my birthday and sends up a package with two chocolate bars and a note with names of people in the lane telling me get better and come home and you're a great soldier, Frankie. The nurse lets me talk to her through the window and it's hard because the windows are high and I have to stand on Seamus's shoulders. I tell Mam I want to go home but she says I'm a bit too weak and surely I'll be out in no time. Seamus says, 'Tis a grand thing to be eleven because any day now you'll be a man shaving and all and ready to get out and get a job and drink your pint good as any man.
After fourteen weeks Sister Rita tells me I can go home and aren't I a lucky boy that the day will be the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. She tells me I was a very good patient, except for that little problem with the poem and Patricia Madigan, God rest her, and I'm invited to come back and have a big Christmas dinner in the hospital. Mam comes for me and with my weak legs it takes us a long time to walk to the bus at Union Cross. She says, Take your time. After three and a half months we can spare an hour.
People are at their doors on Barrack Road and Roden Lane telling me it's grand to see me back, that I'm a great soldier, a credit to my father and mother. Malachy and Michael run up to me in the lane and say, God, you're walking very slow. Can't you run anymore?
It's a bright day and I'm happy till I see Dad sitting in the kitchen with Alphie on his lap and there's an empty feeling in my heart because I know he's out of work again. All along I was sure he had a job, Mam told me he did, and I thought there would be no shortage of food and shoes. He smiles at me and tells Alphie, Och, there's your big brother home from the hospital.
Mam tells him what the doctor said, that I'm to have plenty of nourishing food and rest. The doctor said beef would be the right thing for building me up again. Dad nods. Mam makes beef tea from a cube and Malachy and Mike watch me drink it. They say they'd like some too but Mam says go away, ye didn't have the typhoid. She says the doctor wants me to go to bed early. She tried to get rid of the fleas but they're worse than ever with the warm weather we're having. Besides, she says, they won't get much out of you all bones and little skin.
I lie in bed and think of the hospital where the white sheets were changed every day and there wasn't a sign of a flea. There was a lavatory where you could sit and read your book till someone asked if you were dead. There was a bath where you could sit in hot water as long as you liked and say, I do believe, Induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy, And saying that helps me fall asleep.
When Malachy and Michael get up for school in the morning Mam tells me I can stay in bed. Malachy is in fifth class now with Mr. O'Dea and he likes to tell everyone he's learning the big red catechism for Confirmation and Mr. O'Dea is telling them all about state of grace and Euclid and how the English tormented the Irish for eight hundred long years.
I don't want to stay in bed anymore. The October days are lovely and I want to sit outside looking up the lane at the way the sun slants along the wall opposite our house. Mikey Moloney brings me P. G.
Wodehouse books his father gets from the library and I have great days with Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and all the Mulliners. Dad lets me read his favorite book, John Mitchel's Jail Journal, which is all about a great Irish rebel the English condemned to exile in Van Diemen's land in Australia. The English tell John Mitchel he's free to come and go as he pleases all over Van Diemen's land if he gives his word of honor as a gentleman he won't try to escape. He gives his word till a ship comes to help him escape and he goes to the office of the English magistrate and says, I'm escaping, jumps on his horse and winds up in New York. Dad says he doesn't mind if I read silly English books by P. G. Wodehouse as long as I don't forget the men who did their bit and gave their lives for Ireland.
I can't stay at home forever and Mam takes me back to Leamy's School in November. The new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, says he's sorry, I've missed over two months of school and I have to be put back in fifth class. Mam says surely I'm ready for sixth class. After all, she says, he's missed only a few weeks. Mr. O'Halloran says he's sorry, take the boy next door to Mr. O'Dea.
We walk along the hallway and I tell Mam I don't want to be in fifth class. Malachy is in that class and I don't want to be in a class with my brother who is a year younger. I made my Confirmation last year. He didn't. I'm older. I'm not bigger anymore because of the typhoid but I'm older.
Mam says, It won't kill you.
She doesn't care and I'm put into that class with Malachy and I know all his friends are there sneering at me because I was put back. Mr. O'Dea makes me sit in the front and tells me get that sour look off my puss or I'll feel the end of his ash plant.
Then a miracle happens and it's all because of St. Francis of Assisi, my favorite saint, and Our Lord Himself. I find a penny in the street that first day back at school and I want to run to Kathleen O'Connell's for a big square of Cleeves' toffee but I can't run because my legs are still weak from the typhoid and sometimes I have to hold on to a wall. I'm desperate for the Cleeves'toffee but I'm also desperate to get out of fifth class.
I know I have to go to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi. He's the only one who will listen but he's at the other end of Limerick and it takes me an hour to walk there, sitting on steps, holding on to walls. It's a penny to light a candle and I wonder if I should just light the candle and keep the penny. No, St. Francis would know. He loves the bird in the air and the fish in the stream but he's not a fool. I light the candle, I kneel at his statue and beg him to get me out of fifth class where I'm stuck with my brother, who is probably going around the lane now bragging that his big brother was kept back. St. Francis doesn't say a word but I know he's listening and I know he'll get me out of that class. It's the least he could do after all my trouble coming to his statue, sitting on steps, holding on to walls, when I could have gone to St. Joseph's Church and lit a candle to the Little Flower or the Sacred Heart of Jesus Himself. What's the use of being named after him if he's going to desert me in my hour of need?
I have to sit in Mr. O'Dea's class listening to the catechism and all the other stuff he taught last year. I'd like to raise my hand and give the answers but he says, Be quiet, let your brother answer. He gives them tests in arithmetic and makes me sit there and correct them. He
dictates to them in Irish and makes me correct what they've written. Then he gives me special compositions to write and makes me read them to the class because of all I learned from him last year. He tells the class, Frank McCourt is going to show you how well he learned to write in this class last year. He's going to write a composition on Our Lord, aren't you, McCourt? He's going to tell us what it would be like if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick which has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family and is the holiest city in Ireland. We know that if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick He would never have been crucified because the people of Limerick were always good Catholics and not given to crucifixion. So, McCourt, you are to go home and write that composition and bring it in tomorrow.
Dad says Mr. O'Dea has a great imagination but didn't Our Lord suffer enough on the cross without sticking Him in Limerick on top of it with the damp from the River Shannon. He puts on his cap and goes for a long walk and I have to think about Our Lord by myself and wonder what I'm going to write tomorrow.
The next day Mr. O'Dea says, All right, McCourt, read your composition to the class.
The name of my composition is-
The title, McCourt, the title.
The title of my composition is, ""Jesus and the Weather. ""
What?
""Jesus and the Weather. ""
All right, read it.
This is my composition. I don't think Jesus Who is Our Lord would
have liked the weather in Limerick because it's always raining and the Shannon keeps the whole city damp. My father says the Shannon is a killer river because it killed my two brothers. When you look at pictures of Jesus He's always wandering around ancient Israel in a sheet. It never rains there and you never hear of anyone coughing or getting consumption or anything like that and no one has a job there because all they do is stand around and eat manna and shake their fists and go to crucifixions.
Anytime Jesus got hungry all He had to do was walk up the road to a fig tree or an orange tree and have His fill. If He wanted a pint He could wave His hand over a big glass and there was the pint. Or He could visit Mary Magdalene and her sister, Martha, and they'd give Him His dinner no questions asked and He'd get his feet washed and dried with Mary Magdalene's hair while Martha washed the dishes, which I don't think is fair. Why should she have to wash the dishes while her sister sits out there chatting away with Our Lord? It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place because if he was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have to learn the catechism and write compositions about Him. The End.
Mr. O'Dea is quiet and gives me a strange look and I'm worried because when he's quiet like that it means someone is going to suffer. He says, McCourt, who wrote that composition?
I did, sir.
Did your father write that composition? He didn't, sir.
Come here, McCourt.
I follow him out the door, along the hall to the headmaster's room. Mr. O'Dea shows him my composition and Mr. O'Halloran gives me the strange look, too. Did you write this composition?
I did, sir.
I'm taken out of the fifth class and put into Mr. O'Halloran's sixth class with all the boys I know, Paddy Clohessy, Fintan Slattery, The Question Quigley, and when school is over that day I have to go back down to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi to thank him even if my legs are still weak from the typhoid and I have to sit on steps and hold on to walls and I wonder was it something good I said in that composition or something bad.
Mr. Thomas L. O'Halloran teaches three classes in one room, sixth, seventh, eighth. He has a head like President Roosevelt and he wears gold glasses. He wears suits, navy blue or gray, and there's a gold watch chain that hangs across his belly from pocket to pocket in his waistcoat. We call him Hoppy because he has a short leg and hops when he walks. He knows what we call him and he says, Yes, I'm Hoppy and I'll hop on you. He carries a long stick, a pointer, and if you don't pay attention or give a stupid answer he gives you three slaps on each hand or whacks you across the backs of your legs. He makes you learn everything by heart, everything, and that makes him the hardest master in the school. He loves America and makes us know all the American states in alphabetical order. He makes charts of Irish grammar, Irish history and algebra at home, hangs them on an easel and we have to chant our way through the cases, conjugations and declensions of Irish, famous names and battles, proportions, ratios, equations. We have to know all the important dates in Irish history. He tells us what is important and why. No master ever told us why before. If you asked why you'd be hit on the head. Hoppy doesn't call us idiots and if you ask a question he doesn't go into a rage. He's the only master who stops and says, Do ye understand what I'm talking about? Do ye want to ask a question?
It's a shock to everyone when he says, the Battle of Kinsale in sixteen nought one was the saddest moment in Irish history, a close battle with cruelty and atrocities on both sides.
Cruelty on both sides? The Irish side? How could that be? All the other masters told us the Irish always fought nobly, they always fought the fair fight. He recites and makes us remember, They went forth to battle, but they always fell, Their eyes were fixed above the sullen shields.
Nobly they fought and bravely, but not well, And sank heart wounded by a subtle spell.
If they lost it was because of traitors and informers. But I want to know about these Irish atrocities.
Sir, did the Irish commit atrocities at the Battle of Kinsale?
They did, indeed. It is recorded that they killed prisoners but they were no better nor worse than the English.
Mr. O'Halloran can't lie. He's the headmaster. All these years we were told the Irish were always noble and they made brave speeches before the English hanged them. Now Hoppy O'Halloran is saying the Irish did bad things. Next thing he'll be saying the English did good things. He says, You have to study and learn so that you can make up your own mind about history and everything else but you can't make up an empty mind. Stock your mind, stock your mind. It is your house of treasure and no one in the world can interfere with it. If you won the Irish Sweepstakes and
bought a house that needed furniture would you fill it with bits and pieces of rubbish? Your mind is your house and if you fill it with rubbish from the cinemas it will rot in your head. You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace.
He calls us one by one to the front of the room and looks at our shoes. He wants to know why they're broken or why we have no shoes at all. He tells us this is a disgrace and he's going to have a raffle to raise money so that we can have strong warm boots for the winter. He gives us books of tickets and we swarm all over Limerick for Leamy's School boot fund, first prize five pounds, five prizes of a pound each. Eleven boys with no boots get new boots. Malachy and I don't get any because we have shoes on our feet even if the soles are worn away and we wonder why we ran all over Limerick selling tickets so that other boys could get boots. Fintan Slattery says we gain plenary Indulgences for works of charity and Paddy Clohessy says, Fintan, would you ever go and have a good shit for yourself.
I know when Dad does the bad thing. I know when he drinks the dole money and Mam is desperate and has to beg at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and ask for credit at Kathleen O'Connell's shop but I don't want to back away from him and run to Mam. How can I do that when I'm up with him early every morning with the whole world asleep? He lights the fire and makes the tea and sings to himself or reads the paper to me in a whisper that won't wake up the rest of the family. Mikey Molloy stole Cuchulain, the Angel on the Seventh Step is gone someplace else, but my father in the morning is still mine. He gets the Irish Press early and tells me about the world, Hitler, Mussolini, Franco. He says this war is none of our business because the English are up to their tricks again. He tells me about the great Roosevelt in Washington and the great De Valera in Dublin. In the morning we have the world to ourselves and he never tells me I should die for Ireland. He tells me about the old days in Ireland when the English wouldn't let the Catholics have schools because they wanted to keep the people ignorant, that the Catholic children met in hedge schools in the depths of the country and learned English, Irish, Latin and Greek. The people loved learning. They loved stories and poetry even if none of this was any good for getting a job. Men, women and children would gather in ditches to hear those great masters and everyone wondered at how much a man could carry in his head. The masters risked their lives going from ditch to ditch and hedge to hedge because if the English caught them teaching they might be transported to foreign parts or worse. He tells me school is easy now, you don't have to sit in a ditch learning your sums or the glorious history of Ireland. I should be good in school and some day I'll go back to America and get an inside job where I'll be sitting at a desk with two fountain pens in my pocket, one red and one blue, making decisions. I'll be in out of the rain and I'll have a suit and shoes and a warm place to live and what more could a man want? He says you can do anything in America, it's the land of opportunity. You can be a fisherman in Maine or a farmer in California. America is not like Limerick, a gray place with a river that kills.
When you have your father to yourself by the fire in the morning you don't need Cuchulain or the Angel on the Seventh Step or anything.
At night he helps us with our exercises. Mam says they call it homework in America but here it's exercises, the sums, the English, the Irish, the history. He can't help us with Irish because he's from the North and lacking in the native tongue. Malachy offers to teach him all
the Irish words he knows but Dad says it's too late, you can't teach an old dog a new bark. Before bed we sit around the fire and if we say, Dad, tell us a story, he makes up one about someone in the lane and the story will take us all over the world, up in the air, under the sea and back to the lane. Everyone in the story is a different color and everything is upside down and backward. Motor cars and planes go under water and submarines fly through the air. Sharks sit in trees and giant salmon sport with kangaroos on the moon. Polar bears wrestle with elephants in Australia and penguins teach Zulus how to play bagpipes. After the story he takes us upstairs and kneels with us while we say our prayers. We say the Our Father, three Hail Marys, God bless the Pope. God bless Mam, God bless our dead sister and brothers, God bless Ireland, God bless De Valera, and God bless anyone who gives Dad a job. He says, Go to sleep, boys, because holy God is watching you and He always knows if you're not good.
I think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, the one in the morning with the paper, the one at night with the stories and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland.
I feel sad over the bad thing but I can't back away from him because the one in the morning is my real father and if I were in America I could say, I love you, Dad, the way they do in the films, but you can't say that in Limerick for fear you might be laughed at. You're allowed to say you love God and babies and horses that win but anything else is a softness in the head.
Day and night we're tormented in that kitchen with people emptying their buckets. Mam says it's not the River Shannon that will kill us but the stink from that lavatory outside our door. It's bad enough in the winter when everything flows over and seeps under our door but worse in the warm weather when there are flies and bluebottles and rats.
There is a stable next to the lavatory where they keep the big horse from Gabbett's coal yard. His name is Finn the Horse and we all love him but the stable man from the coal yard doesn't take proper care of the stable and the stink travels to our house. The stink from the lavatory and the stable attracts rats and we have to chase them with our new dog, Lucky. He loves to corner the rats and then we smash them to bits with rocks or sticks or stab them with the hay fork in the stable. The horse himself is frightened by the rats and we have to be careful when he rears up. He knows we're not rats because we bring him apples when we rob an orchard out the country.
Sometimes the rats escape and run into our house and into the coal hole under the stairs where it's pitch dark and you can't see them. Even when we bring in a candle we can't find them because they dig holes everywhere and we don't know where to look. If we have a fire we can boil water and pour it slowly in from the kettle spot and that will drive them out of the hole between our legs and out the door again unless Lucky is there to catch them in his teeth and shake the life out of them. We expect him to eat the rats but he'll leave them in the lane with their guts hanging out and run to my father for a piece of bread dipped in tea. People in the lane say that's a peculiar way for a dog to behave but then what would you expect from a dog of the McCourts.
The minute there's a sign of a rat or a mention of one Mam is out the door and up the lane. She'd rather walk the streets of Limerick forever than stay one minute in a house that has a rat in it and she can
never rest because she knows that with the stable and the lavatory there's always a rat nearby with his family waiting for their dinner.
We fight the rats and we fight the stink from that lavatory. We'd like to keep our door open in the warm weather but you can't when people are trotting down the lane to empty their brimming buckets. Some families are worse than others and Dad hates all of them even though Mam tells him it's not their fault if the builders a hundred years ago put up houses with no lavatories but this one outside our door. Dad says the people should empty their buckets in the middle of the night when we are asleep so that we won't be disturbed by the stink.
The flies are nearly as bad as the rats. On warm days they swarm to the stable and when a bucket is emptied they swarm to the lavatory. If Mam cooks anything they swarm into the kitchen and Dad says it's disgusting to think the fly sitting there on the sugar bowl was on the toilet bowl, or what's left of it, a minute ago. If you have an open sore they find it and torment you. By day you have the flies, by night you have the fleas. Mam says there's one good thing about fleas, they're clean, but flies are filthy, you never know where they came from and they carry diseases galore. We can chase the rats and kill them.
We can slap at the flies and the fleas and kill them but there's nothing we can do about the neighbors and their buckets. If we're out in the lane playing and we see someone with a bucket we call to our own house, Bucket coming, close the door, close the door, and whoever is inside runs to the door. In warm weather we run to close the door all day because we know which families have the worst buckets. There are families whose fathers have jobs and if they get into the habit of cooking with curry we know their buckets will stink to the heavens and make us sick. Now with the war on and men sending money from England more and more families are cooking with curry and our house is filled with the stink day and night. We know the families with the curry, we know the ones with the cabbage. Mam is sick all the time, Dad takes longer and longer walks into the country, and we play outside as much as we can and far from the lavatory. Dad doesn't complain about the River Shannon anymore. He knows now the lavatory is worse and he takes me with him to the Town Hall to complain. The man there says, Mister, all I can tell you is you can move. Dad says we can't afford to move and the man says there's nothing he can do. Dad says, This is not India. This is a Christian country. The lane needs more lavatories. The man says, Do you expect Limerick to start building lavatories in houses that are falling down anyway, that will be demolished after the war? Dad says that lavatory could kill us all. The man says we live in dangerous times.
Mam says it's hard enough keeping a fire going to cook the Christmas dinner but if I'm going to Christmas dinner at the hospital I'll have to wash myself from top to bottom. She wouldn't give it to Sister Rita to say I was neglected or ripe for another disease. She boils a pot of water early in the morning before Mass and nearly scalds the scalp off me. She scours my ears and scrubs my skin so hard it tingles. She can afford tuppence for the bus out to the hospital but I'll have to walk back and that will be good for me because I'll be stuffed with food and now she has to get the fire going again for the pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes which she got once again through the kindness of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and she's determined this will be the last time we celebrate the birth of Our Lord with pig's head.
Next year we'll have a goose or a nice ham and why wouldn't we, isn't Limerick famous the world over for the ham?
Sister Rita says, Now would you look at this, our little soldier looking so healthy. No meat on the bones but still. Now tell me, did you go to Mass this morning?
I did, Sister.
And did you receive?
I did, Sister.
She takes me into an empty ward and tells me sit there on that
chair it won't be long now till I get my dinner. She leaves and I wonder if I'll be eating with nuns and nurses or will I be in a ward with children having their Christmas dinner. In awhile my dinner is brought in by the girl in the blue dress who brought me the books. She places the tray on the side of a bed and I pull up a chair. She frowns at me and screws up her face. You, she says, that's your dinner an' I'm not bringin' you any books.
The dinner is delicious, turkey, mashed potatoes, peas, jelly and custard, and a pot of tea. The jelly and custard dish looks delicious and I can't resist it so I'll have it first there's no one there to notice but when I'm eating it the girl in the blue dress comes in with bread and says, What are you doin'?
Nothing.
Yes, you are. You're atin' the sweet before the dinner, and she runs out calling, Sister Rita, Sister Rita, come in quick, and the nun rushes in, Francis, are you all right?
I am, Sister.
He's not all right, Sister. He do be atin' his jelly an custard before his dinner. That's a sin, Sister.
Ah, now, dear, you run along and I'll talk to Francis about that.
Do, Sister, talk to him or all the childer in the hospital will be atin' their sweet before their dinner an' then where will we be?
Indeed, indeed, where will we be? Run along now.
The girl leaves and Sister Rita smiles at me. God love her, she doesn't miss a thing even in her confusion. We have to be patient with her, Francis, the way she's touched.
She leaves and it's quiet in that empty ward and when I'm finished I don't know what to do because you're not supposed to do anything till they tell you. Hospitals and schools always tell you what to do. I wait a long time till the girl in the blue dress comes in for the tray. Are you finished? she says.
and I tells
I am.
Well, that's all you're gettin' an' now you can go home.
Surely girls who are not right in the head can't tell you go home
wonder if I should wait for Sister Rita. A nurse in the hallway
me Sister Rita is having her dinner and is not to be bothered. It's a long walk from Union Cross to Barrack Hill and when I get
home my family are up in Italy and well into their pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes. I tell them about my Christmas dinner. Mam wants to know if I had it with the nurses and nuns and she gets a bit angry when I tell her I ate alone in a ward and that's no way to treat a child. She tells me sit down and have some pig's head and I force it into my mouth and I'm so stuffed I have to lie on the bed with my belly sticking out a mile.
It's early in the morning and there's a motor car outside our door, the first one we've ever seen in the lane. There are men in suits looking in the door of the stable of Finn the Horse and there must be something wrong because you never see men with suits in the lane.
It's Finn the Horse. He's lying on the floor of the stable looking up the lane and there's white stuff like milk around his mouth. The stable man who takes care of Finn the Horse says he found him like that this morning and it's strange because he's always up and ready for his feed. The men are shaking their heads. My brother Michael says to one of the men, Mister, what's up with Finn?
Sick horse, son. Go home.
The stable man who takes care of Finn has the whiskey smell on him. He says to Michael, That horse is a goner. We have to shoot him.
Michael pulls at my hand. Frank, they're not to shoot him. Tell them. You're big.
The stable man says, Go home, boy. Go home.
Michael attacks him, kicks him, scrawbs the back of his hand, and the man sends Michael flying. Hould that brother of yours, he tells me, hould him.
One of the other men takes something yellow and brown from a bag, goes to Finn, puts it to his head and there's a sharp crack. Finn shivers. Michael screams at the man and attacks him too but the man says, The horse was sick, son. He's better off.
The men in suits drive away and the stable man says he has to wait for the lorry to take Finn away, he can't leave him alone or the rats will be at him. He wants to know if we'd keep an eye on the horse with our dog Lucky while he goes to the pub, he's blue mouldy for a pint.
No rat has a chance to get near Finn the Horse the way Michael is there with a stick small as he is. The man comes back smelling of porter and then there's the big lorry to take the horse away, a big lorry with three men and two great planks that slope from the back of the lorry to Finn's head. The three men and the stable man tie ropes around Finn and pull him up the planks and the people in the lane yell at the men because of the nails and broken wood in the planks that catch at Finn and tear out bits of his hide and streak the planks with bright pink horse blood.
Ye are destroyin' that horse.
Can't ye have respect for the dead?
Go easy with that poor horse.
The stable man says, For the love o' Jaysus what are ye squawkin'
about? 'Tis only a dead horse, and Michael runs at him again with his head down and his small fists flying till the stable man gives him a shove that sends him on his back and Mam goes at the stable man in such a rage he runs up the planks and over Finn's body to escape. He comes back drunk in the evening to sleep it off and after he leaves there's a smoldering in the hay and the stable burns down the rats running up the lane with every boy and dog chasing them till they escape into the streets of respectable people.
IX
Mam says, Alphie is enough. I'm worn out. That's the end of it. No more children.
Dad says, The good Catholic woman must perform her wifely duties and submit to her husband or face eternal damnation.
Mam says, As long as there are no more children eternal damnation sounds attractive enough to me.
What is Dad to do? There's a war on. English agents are recruiting Irishmen to work in their munitions factories, the pay is good, there are no jobs in Ireland, and if the wife turns her back to you there's no shortage of women in England where the able men are off fighting Hitler and Mussolini and you can do anything you like as long as you remember you're Irish and lower class and don't try to rise above your station.
Families up and down the lane are getting telegram money orders from their fathers in England. They rush to the post office to cash the money orders so they can shop and show the world their good fortune on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The boys get their hair cut on Saturdays, the women curl their hair with iron tongs hot from the fire. They're very grand now the way they pay sixpence or even a shilling for seats at the Savoy Cinema where you'll meet a better class of people than the lower classes who fill the tuppenny seats in the gods at the Lyric Cinema and are never done shouting at the screen, the kind of people if you don't mind who are liable to cheer on the Africans when they throw spears at Tarzan or the Indians when they're scalping the United States Cavalry. The new rich people go home after Mass on Sundays all airs and stuff themselves with meat and potatoes, sweets and cakes galore, and they think nothing of drinking their tea from delicate little cups which stand in saucers to catch the tea that overflows and when they lift the cups they stick out their little fingers to show how refined they are. Some stop going to fish and chip shops altogether because you see nothing in those places but drunken soldiers and night girls and men that drank their dole and their wives screeching at them to come home. The brave new rich will be seen at the Savoy Restaurant or the Stella drinking tea, eating little buns, patting their lips with serviettes if you don't mind, coming home on the bus and complaining the service is not what it used to be. They have electricity now so they can see things they never saw before and when darkness falls they turn on the new wireless to hear how the war is going. They thank God for Hitler because if he hadn't marched all over Europe the men of Ireland would still be at home scratching their arses on the queue at the Labour Exchange.
Some families sing,
Yip aye aidy aye ay aye oh
Yip aye aidy aye ay,
We don't care about England or France, All we want is the German advance.
If there's a chill in the air they'll turn on the electric fire for the comfort that's in it and sit in their kitchens listening to the news declaring how sorry they are for the English women and children dying under the German bombs but look what England did to us for eight hundred years.
The families with fathers in England are able to lord it over the families that don't. At dinnertime and teatime the new rich mothers stand at their doors and call to their children, Mikey, Kathleen, Paddy, come in for yeer dinner. Come in for the lovely leg o'lamb and the gorgeous green peas and the floury white potatoes.
Sean, Josie, Peggy, come in for yeer tea, come in at wanst for the fresh bread and butter and the gorgeous blue duck egg what no one else in the lane have.
Brendan, Annie, Patsy, come in for the fried black puddin', the sizzlin' sausages and the lovely trifle soaked in the best of Spanish sherry.
At times like this Mam tells us to stay inside. We have nothing but bread and tea and she doesn't want the tormenting neighbors to see us with our tongues hanging out, suffering over the lovely smells floating up and down the lane. She says 'tis easy to see they're not used to having anything the way they brag about everything. 'Tis a real low-class mind that will call out the door and tell the world what they're having for the supper. She says 'tis their way of getting a rise out of us because Dad is a foreigner from the North and he won't have anything to do with any of them. Dad says all that food comes from English money and no luck will come to those who took it but what could you expect from Limerick anyway, people who profit from Hitler's war, people who will work and fight for the English. He says he'll never go over there and help England win a war. Mam says, No, you'll stay here where there's no work and hardly a lump of coal to boil water for the tea. No, you'll stay here and drink the dole when the humor is on you. You'll watch your sons going around with broken shoes and their arses hanging out of their trousers. Every house in the lane has electricity and we're lucky if we have a candle. God above, if I had the fare I'd be off to England myself for I'm sure they need women in the factories.
Dad says a factory is no place for a woman.
Mam says, Sitting on your arse by the fire is no place for a man. I say to him, Why can't you go to England, Dad, so we can have
electricity and a wireless and Mam can stand at the door and tell the world what we're having at dinnertime?
He says, Don't you want to have your father here at home with you?
I do but you can come back at the end of the war and we can all go to America.
He sighs, Och, aye, och, aye. All right he'll go to England after Christmas because America is in the war now and the cause must be just. He'd never go if the Americans hadn't gone in. He tells me I'll have to be the man of the house, and he signs up with an agent to work in a factory in Coventry which, everyone says, is the most bombed city in England. The agent says, There's plenty of work for willing men. You can work overtime till you drop and if you save it up, mate, you'll be Rockefeller at the end of the war.
We're up early to see Dad off at the railway station. Kathleen O'Connell at the shop knows Dad is off to England and money will be flowing back so she's happy to let Mam have credit for tea, milk, sugar, bread, butter and an egg.
An egg.
Mam says, This egg is for your father. He needs the nourishment for the long journey before him.
It's a hard-boiled egg and Dad peels off the shell. He slices the egg five ways and gives each of us a bit to put on our bread. Mam says, Don't be such a fool. Dad says, What would a man be doing with a whole egg to himself? Mam has tears on her eyelashes. She pulls her chair over to the fireplace. We all eat our bread and egg and watch her cry till she says, What are ye gawkin' at? and turns away to look into the ashes. Her
bread and egg are still on the table and I wonder if she has any plans for them. They look delicious and I'm still hungry but Dad gets up and brings them to her with the tea. She shakes her head but he presses them on her and she eats and drinks, snuffling and crying. He sits opposite her a while, silent, till she looks up at the clock and says, 'Tis time to go. He puts on his cap and picks up his bag. Mam wraps Alphie in an old blanket and we set off through the streets of Limerick.
There are other families in the streets. The going away fathers walk ahead, the mothers carry babies or push prams. A mother with a pram will say to other mothers, God above, missus, you must be fagged out carrying that child. Sure, why don't you stick him into the pram here and rest your poor arms.
Prams might be packed with four or five babies squalling away because the prams are old and the wheels bockety and the babies are rocked till they get sick and throw up their goody.
The men call to each other. Grand day, Mick. Lovely day for the journey, Joe. 'Tis, indeed, Mick. Arrah, we might as well have a pint before we go, Joe. We might as well, Mick. Might as well be drunk as the way we are, Joe.
They laugh and the women behind them are teary eyed and red nosed.
In the pubs around the railway station the men are packed in drinking the money the agents gave them for travel food. They're having the last pint, the last drop of whiskey on Irish soil, For God knows it might be the last we'll ever have, Mick, the way the Jerries are bombing the bejesus outa England and not a minute too soon after what they did to us and isn't it a tragic thing entirely the way we have to go over there and save the arse of the ancient foe.
The women stay outside the pubs talking. Mam tells Mrs. Meehan, The first telegram money order I get I'll be in the shop buying a big breakfast so that we can all have our own egg of a Sunday morning.
I look at my brother Malachy. Did you hear that? Our own egg of a Sunday morning. Oh, God, I already had plans for my egg. Tap it around the top, gently crack the shell, lift with a spoon, a dab of butter down into the yolk, salt, take my time, a dip of the spoon, scoop, more salt, more butter, into the mouth, oh, God above, if heaven has a taste it must be an egg with butter and salt, and after the egg is there anything in the world lovelier than fresh warm bread and a mug of sweet golden tea?
Some men are already too drunk to walk and the English agents are paying sober men to drag them out of the pubs and throw them on a great horse drawn float to be hauled to the station and dumped into the train. The agents are desperate to get everyone out of the pubs. Come on, men. Miss this train and you'll miss a good job. Come on, men, we have the Guinness in England. We have the Jameson. Now, men, please, men. You're drinking your food money and you'll get no more.
The men tell the agents to kiss their Irish arses, that the agents are lucky they're alive, lucky they're not hanging from the nearest lamppost after what they did to Ireland. And the men sing, On Mountjoy one Monday morning High upon the gallows tree, Kevin Barry gave his young life For the cause of liberty.
The train wails in the station and the agents beg the women to get their men out of the pubs and the men stumble out singing and crying and hugging their wives and children and promising to send so much money Limerick will be turned into another New York. The men climb the station
steps and the women and children call after them, Kevin, love, mind yourself and don't be wearing damp shirts.
Dry your socks, Michael, or the bunions will destroy you entirely. Paddy, go easy on the drink, are you listenin', Paddy?
Dad, Dad, don't go, Dad.
Tommy, don't forget to send the money. The children are skin and
bones.
Peter, don't forget to be takin' the medicine for your weak chest,
God help us.
Larry, mind them bloody bombs.
Christy, don't be talkin' to them Englishwomen. They're full of
diseases.
Jackie, come back. Sure we'll manage somehow. Don't go, Jack-e-e,
Jack-e-e, oh, Jesus, don't go.
Dad pats our heads. He tells us remember our religious duties but,
above all, obey our mother. He stands before her. She has the baby Alphie in her arms. She says, Mind yourself. He drops the bag and puts his arms around her. They stay that way a moment till the baby yelps between them. He nods, picks up his bag, climbs the steps to the station, turns to wave and he's gone.
Back at home Mam says, I don't care. I know it sounds extravagant but I'm going to light the fire and make more tea for it isn't every day your father goes to England.
We sit around the fire and drink our tea and cry because we have no father, till Mam says, Don't cry, don't cry. Now that your father is gone to England surely our troubles will be over.
Surely.
Mam and Bridey Hannon sit by the fire upstairs in Italy smoking Woodbines, drinking tea, and I sit on the stairs listening. We have a father in England so that we can get all we want from Kathleen O'Connell's shop and pay when he starts sending the money in a fortnight. Mam tells Bridey she can't wait to get out of this bloody lane to a place with a decent lavatory that we don't have to share with half the world. We'll all have new boots and coats to keep off the rain so we won't be coming home from school famished. We'll have eggs and rashers on Sunday for breakfast and ham and cabbage and potatoes for dinner. We'll have electric light and why shouldn't we? Weren't Frank and Malachy born to it in America where everyone has it?
All we have to do now is wait for two weeks till the telegram boy knocks at the door. Dad will have to settle into his job in England, buy work clothes and get a place to stay, so the first money order won't be big, three pounds or three pounds ten, but soon we'll be like other families in the lane, five pounds a week, paying off debts, buying new clothes, putting something in the savings against the time we'll pack up and move to England entirely and save there to go to America. Mam herself could get a job in an English factory making bombs or something and God knows we wouldn't know ourselves with the money pouring in. She wouldn't be happy if we grew up with English accents but better an English accent than an empty belly.
Bridey says it doesn't matter what class of an accent an Irishman has for he'll never forget what the English did to us for eight hundred long years.
We know what Saturdays are in the lane. We know some families like the Downeses across from us get their telegram early because Mr. Downes
is a steady man who knows how to have a pint or two on a Friday and go home to his bed. We know men like him run to the post office the minute they're paid so their families won't know a minute of waiting or worry. Men like Mr. Downes send their sons RAF wings to wear on their coats. That's what we want and that's what we told Dad before he left, Don't forget the RAF badges, Dad.
We see the telegram boys on their bicycles swing into the lane. They're happy telegram boys because the tips they get in the lanes are bigger than anything they get in the grand streets and avenues where rich people will begrudge you the steam of their piss.
The families that get the early telegrams have that contented look. They'll have all day Saturday to enjoy the money. They'll shop, they'll eat, they'll have all day to think about what they'll do that night and that's almost as good as the thing itself because Saturday night when you have a few shillings in your pocket is the most delicious night of the week.
There are families don't get the telegram every week and you know them by the anxious look. Mrs. Meagher has waited at her door every Saturday for two months. My mother says she'd be ashamed of her life to wait at the door like that. All the children play in the lane and keep an eye out for the telegram boy. Hoi, telegram boy, do you have anything for Meagher? and when he says no they say, Are you sure? and he'll say, Course I'm sure. I know what I have in my feckin' pouch.
Everyone knows the telegram boys stop coming when the Angelus rings at six and darkness brings desperation to the women and children.
Telegram boy, will you look in your pouch again? Please. Aw, God. I did. I have nothing for ye.
Aw, God, please look. Our name is Meagher. Will you look?
I know bloody well yeer name is Meagher and I looked.
The children claw at him up on his bicycle and he kicks at them, Jesus, will ye get away from me.
Once the Angelus rings at six in the evening the day is over. The ones with the telegrams are having their supper with the electric light blazing away and the ones that didn't get the telegrams have to light candles and see if Kathleen O'Connell might let them have tea and bread till this time next week when surely with the help of God and His Blessed Mother the telegram will come.
Mr. Meehan at the top of the lane went to England with Dad and when the telegram boy stops at Meehan's we know we'll be next. Mam has her coat ready to go to the post office but she won't leave the chair by the fire in Italy till she has the telegram in her hand. The telegram boy rides down the lane and swings over to Downeses'. He hands them their telegram, takes the tip and turns his bicycle around to head back up the lane. Malachy calls, Telegram boy, do you have something for McCourt? Ours is coming today. The telegram boy shakes his head and rides away.
Mam puffs on her Woodbine. Well, we have all day though I'd like to do a bit of shopping early before the best hams are gone at Barry the butcher. She can't leave the fire and we can't leave the lane for fear the telegram boy might come and find no one at home. Then we'd have to wait till Monday to cash the money order and that would destroy the weekend entirely. We'd have to watch the Meehans and everyone else parading around in their new clothes and staggering home with eggs and potatoes and sausages for Sunday and sailing off to the films on Saturday night. No, we can't move an inch till that telegram boy comes. Mam says
don't be too worried between noon and two because so many telegram boys go for their dinner and there will surely be a big rush between two and the Angelus. We don't have a thing to worry about till six. We stop every telegram boy. We tell them our name is McCourt, that this is our first telegram, it should be three pounds or more, they might have forgotten to put our name on it or our address, is he sure? is he sure? One boy tells us he'll inquire at the post office. He says he knows what 'tis like to wait for the telegram because his own father is a drunken oul' shit over in England that never sent a penny. Mam hears him inside and tells us you should never talk about your father like that. The same telegram boy comes back just before the Angelus at six and tells us he asked Mrs. O'Connell at the post office if they had anything for McCourt all day and they didn't. Mam turns toward the dead ashes in the fire and sucks at the last bit of goodness in the Woodbine butt caught between the brown thumb and the burnt middle finger. Michael who is only five and won't understand anything till he's eleven like me wants to know if we're having fish and chips tonight because he's hungry. Mam says, Next week, love, and he goes back out to play in the lane.
You don't know what to do with yourself when the first telegram doesn't come. You can't stay out in the lane playing with your brothers all night because everyone else is gone in and you'd be ashamed to stay out in the lane to be tormented with smells of sausages and rashers and fried bread. You don't want to look at electric light coming through the windows after dark and you don't want to hear the news from the BBC or Radio Eireann from other people's wirelesses. Mrs. Meagher and her children are gone in and there's only the dim light of a candle from their kitchen. They're ashamed too. They stay inside on Saturday nights and they don't even go to Mass on Sunday mornings. Bridey Hannon told Mam that Mrs. Meagher is in a constant state of shame over the rags they wear and so desperate she goes down to the Dispensary for the public assistance. Mam says that's the worst thing that could happen to any family. It's worse than going on the dole, it's worse than going to the St. Vincent de Paul Society, it's worse than begging on the streets with the tinkers and the knackers. It's the last thing you'd do to keep yourself out of the poor house and the children from the orphanage.
There's a sore at the top of my nose between my eyebrows, gray and red and itching. Grandma says, Don't touch that sore and don't put water near it or it'll spread. If you broke your arm she'd say don't touch that with water it'll spread. The sore spreads into my eyes anyway and now they're red and yellow from the stuff that oozes and makes them stick in the morning. They stick so hard I have to force my eyelids open with my fingers and Mam has to scrub off that yellow stuff with a damp rag and boric powder. The eyelashes fall off and every bit of dust in Limerick blows into my eyes on windy days. Grandma tells me I have naked eyes and she says it's my own fault, all that eye trouble comes from sitting up there at the top of the lane under the light pole in all kinds of weather with my nose stuck in books and the same thing will happen to Malachy if he doesn't give over with the reading. You can see little Michael is getting just as bad sticking his nose in books when he should be out playing like a healthy child. Books, books, books, says Grandma, ye will ruin yeer eyes entirely.
She's having tea with Mam and I hear her whisper, The thing to do is give him St. Anthony's spit.
What's that? says Mam.
Your fasting spit in the morning. Go to him before he wakes and spit on his eyes for the spit of a fasting mother has powerful cures in
it.
But I'm always awake before Mam. I force my eyes open long before
she stirs. I can hear her coming across the floor and when she stands over me for the spit I open my eyes. God, she says, your eyes are open.
I think they're getting better.
That's good, and she goes back to bed.
The eyes don't heal and she takes me to the Dispensary where the
poor people see doctors and get their medicines. It's the place to apply for public assistance when a father is dead or disappeared and there's no dole money, no wages.
There are benches along the walls by the doctors' offices. The benches are always packed with people talking about their ailments. Old men and women sit and groan and babies scream and mothers say hush, love, hush. There's a high platform in the middle of the Dispensary with a counter circling it chest high. When you want anything you stand in a queue before that platform to see Mr. Coffey or Mr. Kane. The women in the queue are like the women at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. They wear shawls and they're respectful to Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane because if they're not they might be told go away and come back next week when it's this minute you need the public assistance or a docket to see the doctor. Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane love to have a good laugh with the women. They'll decide if you're desperate enough for the public assistance or if you're sick enough to see a doctor. You have to tell them in front of everyone what's wrong with you and they often have a good laugh with that. They'll say, And what is it you want, Mrs. O'Shea? A docket for the doctor, is it? And what is your trouble, Mrs. O'Shea? A pain, is it? A touch of the wind, maybe. Or maybe too much cabbage. Oh, the cabbage will do it right enough. They laugh and Mrs. O'Shea laughs and all the women laugh and say Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane are funny men, they'd give Laurel and Hardy a run for their money.
Mr. Coffey says, Now, woman, what's your name? Angela McCourt, sir.
And what's up with you?
'Tis my son, sir. He has two bad eyes.
Oh, by God, he does, woman. They're desperate looking eyes altogether. They look like two rising suns. The Japs could use him on their flag, ha ha ha. Did he pour acid on his face or what?
'Tis some class of infection, sir. He had the typhoid last year and then this came.
All right, all right, we don't need the life story. Here's your docket to Dr. Troy.
Two long benches are filled with patients for Dr. Troy. Mam sits next to a woman who has a big sore on her nose that won't go away. I tried everything, missus, every known cure on God's lovely earth. I'm eighty-three years of age and I'd like to go to my grave healthy. Is it too much to ask that I meet my Redeemer with a healthy nose? And what's up with yourself, missus?
My son. The eyes.
Ah, God bless us and save us, look at them eyes. They're the sorest two eyes I ever seen in me life. I never seen that color red before.
'Tis an infection, missus.
Sure there's a cure for that. You need the caul.
What's that now?
Babies are born with this thing on their heads, a class of a hood, rare and magical. Get a caul and put that on his head any day that has a three in it, make him hold his breath for three minutes even if you have to clap your hand over his face, sprinkle him with holy water three times head to toenail and his two eyes will shine in the dawn.
And where would I get a caul?
Don't all the midwives have cauls, missus. What's a midwife without a caul? It cures all classes of disease and keeps off more.
Mam says she'll talk to Nurse O'Halloran and see if she has a spare caul.
Dr. Troy looks at my eyes. Into the hospital with this boy at once. Take him to the eye ward at the City Home. Here's the docket to get him
in.
What does he have, Doctor?
The worst case of conjunctivitis I've ever seen in my life and
something else in there I can't make out. He needs the eye man.
How long will he be in, Doctor?
Only God knows that. I should have seen this child weeks ago. There are twenty beds in the ward and there are men and boys with
bandages around their heads, black patches on their eyes, thick glasses. Some walk around tapping at beds with sticks. A man cries all the time that he'll never see again, he's too young, his children are babies, he'll never see them again. Jesus Christ, oh, Jesus Christ, and the nuns are shocked at the way he takes the name of the Lord in vain. Stop that, Maurice, stop the blasphemy. You have your health. You're alive. We all have our problems. Offer it up and think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the nails in His poor hands and feet, the wound in His side. Maurice says, Oh, Jesus, look down and have pity on me. Sister Bernadette warns him if he doesn't mind his language they'll put him in a ward alone and he says, Heavenly God, and that isn't as bad as Jesus Christ so she's satisfied.
In the morning I have to go downstairs for drops. The nurse says, Sit in this high chair and here's a nice sweet. The doctor has a bottle with brown stuff in it. He tells me put my head back, that's right, now open up, open your eyes and he pours the stuff into my right eye and it's a flame going through my skull. The nurse says, Open the other eye, come on be a good boy, and she has to force the eyelids open so the doctor can set fire to the other side of my skull. She wipes my cheeks and tells me run along upstairs but I can barely see and I want to stick my face into an icy stream. The doctor says, Run along, be a man, be a good trooper.
The whole world is brown and blurry on the stairs. The other patients are sitting by their beds with dinner trays and mine is there too but I don't want it with the way my skull is raging. I sit by my bed and a boy across the way says, Hoi, don't you want your dinner? I'll take it, and he comes for it.
I try to lie on the bed but a nurse says, Now, now, no lying on the bed in the middle of the day. Your case isn't that serious.
I have to sit with my eyes closed and everything going brown and black, black and brown and I'm sure I must be having a dream because Lord God above, is that the little fella with the typhoid, little Frankie, the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, is that yourself, Frankie, for wasn't I promoted out of the Fever Hospital, thank God, where there's every class of disease and you never know what germs you
might be bringing home to the wife in your clothes and what's up with you, Frankie, and the two eyes in your head all gone brown?
I have an infection, Seamus.
Yerra, you'll be over that before you're married, Frankie. The eyes need exercise. The blink is great value for the eyes. I had an uncle with bad eyes and the blink saved him. He sat an hour ever day and blinked and it stood to him in the end. Wound up with powerful eyes, so he did.
I want to ask him more about the blink and the powerful eyes but he says, Now do you remember the poem, Frankie, the lovely poem of Patricia? He stands in the aisle between the beds with his mop and his bucket
and says the highwayman poem and all the patients stop their moaning and the nuns and nurses stand and listen and on and on goes Seamus till he comes to the end and everyone goes mad clapping and cheering him and he tells the world he loves that poem he'll have it in his head forever no matter where he goes and if it wasn't for Frankie McCourt and his typhoid there and poor Patricia Madigan with the dipteria that's gone God rest her he'd never know the poem and there I am famous in the eye ward of the City Home Hospital and all because of Seamus.
Mam can't come to visit every day, it's a long way out, she doesn't always have the money for the bus and the walk is hard on her corns. She thinks my eyes look better though you can't tell with all that brown stuff, which looks and smells like iodine and if it's anything like iodine it must burn. Still, they say the bitterer the medicine the quicker the cure. She gets permission to take me for a walk around the grounds when the weather clears and there's a strange sight, Mr. Timoney standing against the wall where the old people are with his eyes raised to the sky. I want to talk to him and I have to ask Mam because you never know what's right or wrong in a hospital.
Mr. Timoney.
Who is it? Who do we have?
Frank McCourt, sir.
Francis, ah, Francis.
Mam says, I'm his mother, Mr. Timoney.
Well, then, the two of ye are blessed. I have neither kith nor kin
nor Macushla my dog. And what are you doing in this place, Francis?
I have an infection in my eyes.
Ah, Jesus, Francis, not the eyes, not the eyes. Mother of Christ,
you're too young for that.
Mr. Timoney, would you like me to read to you?
With them eyes, Francis? Ah, no, son, Save the eyes. I'm beyond
reading. In my head I have everything I need. I was smart enough to put things in my head in my youth and now I have a library in my head. The English shot my wife. The Irish put down my poor innocent Macushla. Isn't it a joke of a world?
Mam says, Terrible world but God is good.
Indeed, missus. God made the world, it's a terrible world, but God is good. Good-bye, Francis. Rest your eyes and then read till they fall out of your head. We had good times with old Jonathan Swift, didn't we, Francis?
We did, Mr. Timoney.
Mam takes me back to the eye ward. She tells me, Don't be crying over Mr. Timoney, he's not even your father. Besides you'll be ruining your eyes.
Seamus comes to the ward three times a week and brings new poems in his head. He says, You made Patricia sad, Frankie, when you didn't like the one about the owl and the pussycat.
I'm sorry, Seamus.
I have it in my head, Frankie, and I'll say it for you if you don't say 'tis foolish.
I won't, Seamus.
He says the poem and everyone in the ward loves it. They want the words and he says it three more times till the whole ward is saying, The Owl and the Pussy cat went to sea In a beautiful pea-green boat.
They took some honey, and plenty of money Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
The Owl looked up to the stars above,
And sang to a small guitar,
O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,
What a beautiful Pussy you are,
You are,
You are.
What a beautiful Pussy you are.
They say it along with Seamus now and when it's finished they cheer and clap and Seamus laughs, delighted with himself. When he's gone with his mop and bucket you can hear them at all hours of the day and night O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love, What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are.
What a beautiful Pussy you are.
Then Seamus comes with no mop and no bucket and I'm afraid he's sacked over the poetry but he's smiling and telling me he's off to England to work in a factory and earn decent wages for a change. He'll work for two months and bring the wife over and God might be pleased to send them children for he has to do something with all the poems in his head and what better than saying them to small ones in memory of that sweet Patricia Madigan dead of the dipteria.
Good-bye, Francis. If I had the right fist I'd write to you but I'll get the wife to write when she comes over. I might even learn to read and write myself so that the child that comes won't have a fool for a father.
I want to cry but you can't cry in the eye ward with brown stuff in your eyes and nurses saying, What's this what's this be a man, and nuns going on, Offer it up, think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the lance in the side, the hands and feet torn to bits with nails.
I'm a month in the hospital and the doctor says I can go home even if there's still a bit of infection but if I keep the eyes clean with soap and clean towels and build up my health with nourishing food plenty of beef and eggs I'll have a pair of sparkling eyes in no time ha ha.
Mr. Downes across the way comes back from England for his mother's funeral. He tells Mrs. Downes about my father. She tells Bridey Hannon and Bridey tells my mother. Mr. Downes says that Malachy McCourt is gone pure mad with the drink, that he squanders his wages in pubs all over Coventry, that he sings Irish rebel songs which the English don't mind because they're used to the way the Irish carry on about the hundreds of years of suffering, but they won't put up with any man that stands up in
a pub and insults the King and Queen of England, their two lovely daughters and the Queen Mother herself. Insulting the Queen Mother is going beyond the beyonds. What did she ever do to anyone, that poor old lady? Time after time Malachy drinks away his rent money and winds up sleeping in parks when the landlord throws him out. He's a regular disgrace, so he is, and Mr. Downes is glad McCourt is not a Limerickman bringing shame to this ancient city. The magistrates in Coventry are losing their patience and if Malachy McCourt doesn't stop the bloody nonsense he'll be kicked out of the country entirely.
Mam tells Bridey she doesn't know what she's going to do with these stories from England, she never felt so desperate in her life. She can see Kathleen O'Connell doesn't want to give any more credit at the shop and her own mother barks at her if she asks for the loan of a shilling and the St. Vincent de Paul Society want to know when she'll stop asking for charity especially with a husband in England. She's ashamed of the way we look with the dirty old torn shirts, raggedy ganseys, broken shoes, holes in our stockings. She lies awake at night thinking the most merciful thing of all would be to put the four boys in an orphanage so that she could go to England herself and find some type of work where she could bring us all over in a year for the better life. There might be bombs but she'd prefer bombs anytime to the shame of begging from this one and that one.
No, no matter what she can't bear the thought of putting us in the orphanage. That might be all right if you had the likes of Boys' Town in America with a nice priest like Spencer Tracy but you could never trust the Christian Brothers out in Glin who get their exercise beating boys and starving the life out of them.
Mam says there's nothing left but the Dispensary and the public assistance, the relief, and she's ashamed of her life to go and ask for it. It means you're at the end of your rope and maybe one level above tinkers, knackers and street beggars in general. It means you have to crawl before Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane and thank God the Dispensary is at the other end of Limerick so that people in our lane won't know we're getting the relief.
She knows from other women it's wise to be there early in the morning when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane might be in a good mood. If you go late in the morning they're liable to be cranky after seeing hundreds of men women and children sick and asking for help. She will take us with her to prove she has four children to feed. She gets us up early and tells us for once in our lives don't wash our faces, don't comb our hair, dress in any old rag. She tells me give my sore eyes a good rub and make them as red as I can for the worse you look at the Dispensary the more pity you get and the better your chances of getting the public assistance. She complains that Malachy Michael and Alphie look too healthy and you'd wonder why on this day of days they couldn't have their usual scabby knees or the odd cut bruise or black eye. If we meet anyone in the lane or the streets of Limerick we are not to tell them where we're going. She feels ashamed enough without telling the whole world and wait till her own mother hears.
There is a queue already outside the Dispensary. There are women like Mam with children in their arms, babies like Alphie, and children playing on the pavement. The women comfort the babies against the cold and scream at the ones playing in case they run into the street and get hit by a motor car or a bicycle. There are old men and women huddled
against the wall talking to themselves or not talking at all. Mam warns us not to wander from her and we wait half an hour for the big door to open. A man tells us move inside in proper order and queue up before the platform, that Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane will be there in a minute when they finish their tea in the room beyond. A woman complains her children are freezing with the cold and couldn't Coffey and Kane bloody well hurry up with their tea. The man says she's a troublemaker but he won't take her name this time with the cold that's in the morning but if there's another word she'll be a sorry woman.
Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane get up on the platform and pay no attention to the people. Mr. Kane puts on his glasses, takes them off, polishes them, puts them on, looks at the ceiling. Mr. Coffey reads papers, writes something, passes papers to Mr. Kane. They whisper to each other. They take their time. They don't look at us.
Then Mr. Kane calls the first old man to the platform. What's your
name?
Timothy Creagh, sir.
Creagh, hah? A fine old Limerick name you have there.
I do, sir. Indeed I do.
And what do you want, Creagh?
Ah, sure, I do be havin' them pains in me stomach again an' I'd
like to see Dr. Feeley.
Well, now, Creagh, are you sure it's not the pints of porter that
are going against your stomach.
Ah, no, indeed, sir. Sure I hardly touch the pint at all with the
pains. My wife is home in the bed and I have to take care of her too. There's great laziness in the world, Creagh. And Mr. Kane says to
the people on the queue, Did ye hear that, ladies? Great laziness, isn't there?
And the women say, Oh, there is, indeed, Mr. Kane, great laziness. Mr. Creagh gets his docket to see the doctor, the queue moves ahead
and Mr. Kane is ready for Mam.
The public assistance, is
'Tis, Mr. Kane.
And where's your husband?
Oh, he's in England, but-
England, is it? And where
that what you want, woman, the relief?
is the weekly telegram, the big five
pounds?
He didn't send us a penny in months, Mr. Kane.
Is that a fact? Well, we know why, don't we? We know what the men
of Ireland are up to in England. We know there's the occasional Limerickman seen trotting around with a Piccadilly tart, don't we?
He looks out at the people on the queue and they know they're supposed to say, We do, Mr. Kane, and they know they're supposed to smile and laugh or things will go hard with them when they reach the platform. They know he might turn them over to Mr. Coffey and he's notorious for saying no to everything.
Mam tells Mr. Kane that Dad is in Coventry and nowhere near Piccadilly and Mr. Kane takes off his glasses and stares at her. What's this? Are we having a little contradiction here?
Oh, no, Mr. Kane, God no.
I want you to know, woman, that it is the policy here to give no relief to women with husbands in England. I want you to know you're
taking the bread from the mouths of more deserving people who stayed in this country to do their bit.
Oh, yes, Mr. Kane.
And what's your name?
McCourt, sir.
That's not a Limerick name. Where did you get a name like that? My husband, sir. He's from the North.
He's from the North and he leaves you here to get the relief from
the Irish Free State. Is this what we fought for, is it? I don't know, sir.
Why don't you go up to Belfast and see what the Orangemen will do for you, ah?
I don't know, sir.
You don't know. Of course you don't know. There's great ignorance in the world.
He looks out at the people, I said there's great ignorance in the world, and the people nod their heads and agree there's great ignorance in the world.
He whispers to Mr. Coffey and they look at Mam, they look at us. He tells Mam at last that she can have the public assistance but if she gets a single penny from her husband she's to drop all claims and give the money back to the Dispensary. She promises she will and we leave.
We follow her to Kathleen O'Connell's shop to get tea and bread and a few sods of turf for the fire. We climb the stairs to Italy and get the fire going and it's cozy when we have our tea. We're all very quiet, even the baby Alphie, because we know what Mr. Kane did to our mother.
X
It's cold and wet down in Ireland but we're up in Italy. Mam says we should bring the poor Pope up to hang on the wall opposite the window. After all he's a friend of the workingman, he's Italian, and they're a warm weather people. Mam sits by the fire, shivering, and we know something is wrong when she makes no move for a cigarette. She says she feels a cold coming and she'd love to have a tarty drink, a lemonade. But there's no money in the house, not even for bread in the morning. She drinks tea and goes to bed.
The bed creaks all night with her twistings and turnings and she keeps us awake with her moaning for water. In the morning, she stays in bed, still shivering, and we keep quiet. If she sleeps long enough Malachy and I will be too late for school. Hours pass and still she makes no move and when I know it's well past school time I start the fire for the kettle. She stirs and calls for lemonade but I give her a jam jar of water. I ask her if she'd like some tea and she acts like a woman gone deaf. She looks flushed and it's odd she doesn't even mention cigarettes.
We sit quietly by the fire, Malachy, Michael, Alphie, myself. We drink our tea while Alphie chews the last bit of bread covered with sugar. He makes us laugh the way he smears the sugar all over his face and grins at us with his fat sticky cheeks. But we can't laugh too much or Mam will jump out of the bed and order Malachy and me off to school where we'll be killed for being late. We don't laugh long, there is no more bread and we're hungry, the four of us. We can get no more credit at
O'Connell's shop. We can't go near Grandma, either. She yells at us all the time because Dad is from the North and he never sends money home from England where he is working in a munitions factory. Grandma says we could starve to death for all he cares. That would teach Mam a lesson for marrying a man from the North with sallow skin, an odd manner and a look of the Presbyterian about him.
Still, I'll have to try Kathleen O'Connell once more. I'll tell her my mother is sick above in the bed, my brothers are starving and we'll all be dead for the want of bread.
I put on my shoes and run quickly through the streets of Limerick to keep myself warm against the February frost. You can look in people's windows and see how cozy it is in their kitchens with fires glowing or ranges black and hot everything bright in the electric light cups and saucers on the tables with plates of sliced bread pounds of butter jars of jam smells of fried eggs and rashers coming through the windows enough to make the water run in your mouth and families sitting there digging in all smiling the mother crisp and clean in her apron everyone washed and the Sacred Heart of Jesus looking down on them from the wall suffering and sad but still happy with all that food and light and good Catholics at their breakfast.
I try to find music in my own head but all I can find is my mother moaning for lemonade.
Lemonade. There's a van pulling away from South's pub leaving crates of beer and lemonade outside and there isn't a soul on the street. In a second I have two bottles of lemonade up under my jersey and I saunter away trying to look innocent.
There's a bread van outside Kathleen O'Connell's shop. The back door is open on shelves of steaming newly baked bread. The van driver is inside the shop having tea and a bun with Kathleen and it's no trouble for me to help myself to a loaf of bread. It's wrong to steal from Kathleen with the way she's always good to us but if I go in and ask her for bread she'll be annoyed and tell me I'm ruining her morning cup of tea, which she'd like to have in peace ease and comfort thank you. It's easier to stick the bread up under my jersey with the lemonade and promise to tell everything in confession.
My brothers are back in bed playing games under the overcoats but they jump when they see the bread. We tear at the loaf because we're too hungry to slice it and we make tea from this morning's leaves. When my mother stirs Malachy holds the lemonade bottle to her lips and she gasps till she finishes it. If she likes it that much I'll have to find more lemonade.
We put the last of the coal on the fire and sit around telling stories which we make up the way Dad did. I tell my brothers about my adventures with the lemonade and bread and I make up stories about how I was chased by pub owners and shopkeepers and how I ran into St. Joseph's Church where no one can follow you if you're a criminal, not even if you killed your own mother. Malachy and Michael look shocked over the way I got the bread and lemonade but then Malachy says it was only what Robin Hood would have done, rob the rich and give to the poor. Michael says I'm an outlaw and if they catch me they'll hang me from the highest tree in the People's Park the way outlaws are hanged in films at the Lyric Cinema. Malachy says I should make sure I'm in a state of grace because it might be hard to find a priest to come to my hanging. I tell him a priest would have to come to the hanging. That's what priests are for.
Roddy McCorley had a priest and so did Kevin Barry. Malachy says there were no priests at the hanging of Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry because they're not mentioned in the songs and he starts singing the songs to prove it till my mother groans in the bed and says shut up.
Alphie the baby is asleep on the floor by the fire. We put him into the bed with Mam so that he'll be warm though we don't want him to catch her disease and die. If she wakes up and finds him dead in the bed beside her there will be no end to the lamentations and she'll blame me on top of it.
The three of us get back into our own bed, huddling under the overcoats and trying not to roll into the hole in the mattress. It's pleasant there till Michael starts to worry over Alphie getting Mam's disease and me getting hanged for an outlaw. He says it isn't fair because that would leave him with only one brother and everyone in the world has brothers galore. He falls asleep from the worry and soon Malachy drifts off and I lie there thinking of jam. Wouldn't it be lovely to have another loaf of bread and a jar of strawberry jam or any kind of jam. I can't remember ever seeing a jam van making a delivery and I wouldn't want to be like Jesse James blasting my way into a shop demanding jam. That would surely lead to a hanging.
There's a cold sun coming through the window and I'm sure it must be warmer outside and wouldn't my brothers be surprised if they woke and found me there with more bread and jam. They'd gobble everything and then go on about my sins and the hanging.
Mam is still asleep though her face is red and there's a strangling sound when she snores.
I have to be careful going through the street because it's a school day and if Guard Dennehy sees me he'll drag me off to school and Mr. O'Halloran will knock me all over the classroom. The guard is in charge of school attendance and he loves chasing you on his bicycle and dragging you off to school by the ear.
There's a box sitting outside the door of one of the big houses on Barrington Street. I pretend to knock on the door so that I can see what's in the box, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, cheese, tomatoes and, oh, God, a jar of marmalade. I can't shove all that under my jersey. Oh, God. Should I take the whole box? The people passing by pay me no attention. I might as well take the whole box. My mother would say you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I lift the box and try to look like a messenger boy making a delivery and no one says a word.
Malachy and Michael are beside themselves when they see what's in the box and they're soon gobbling thick cuts of bread slathered with golden marmalade. Alphie has the marmalade all over his face and hair and a good bit on his legs and belly. We wash down the food with cold tea because we have no fire to heat it.
Mam mumbles again for lemonade and I give her half the second bottle to keep her quiet. She calls for more and I mix it with water to stretch it because I can't be spending my life running around lifting lemonade from pubs. We're having a fine time of it till Mam begins to rave in the bed about her lovely little daughter taken from her and her twin boys gone before they were three and why couldn't God take the rich for a change and is there any lemonade in the house? Michael wants to know if Mam will die and Malachy tells him you can't die till a priest comes. Then Michael wonders if we'll ever have a fire and hot tea again because he's freezing in the bed even with the overcoats left over from
olden times. Malachy says we should go from house to house asking for turf and coal and wood and we could use Alphie's pram to carry the load. We should take Alphie with us because he's small and he smiles and people will see him and feel sorry for him and us. We try to wash all the dirt and lint and feathers and sticky marmalade but when we touch him with water he howls. Michael says he'll only get dirty again in the pram so what's the use of washing him. Michael is small but he's always saying remarkable things like that.
We push the pram out to the rich avenues and roads but when we knock on the doors the maids tell us go away or they'll call the proper authorities and it's a disgrace to be dragging a baby around in a wreck of a pram that smells to the heavens a filthy contraption that you wouldn't use to haul a pig to the slaughterhouse and this is a Catholic country where babies should be cherished and kept alive to hand down the faith from generation to generation. Malachy tells one maid to kiss his arse and she gives him such a clout the tears leap to his eyes and he says he'll never in his life ask the rich for anything again. He says there's no use asking anymore, that we should go around the backs of the houses and climb over the walls and take what we want. Michael can ring the front doorbells to keep the maids busy and Malachy and I can throw coal and turf over the walls and fill the pram all around Alphie.
We collect that way from three houses but then Malachy throws a piece of coal over a wall and hits Alphie and he starts screaming and we have to run forgetting Michael, still ringing doorbells and getting abuse from maids. Malachy says we should take the pram home first and then go back for Michael. We can't stop now with Alphie bawling and people giving us dirty looks and telling us we're a disgrace to our mother and Ireland in general.
When we're back home it takes a while to dig Alphie out from under the load of coal and turf and he won't stop screaming till I give him bread and marmalade. I'm afraid Mam will leap from her bed but she only mumbles on about Dad and drink and babies dead.
Malachy is back with Michael, with stories of his adventures ringing doorbells. One rich woman answered the door herself and invited him into the kitchen for cake and milk and bread and jam. She asked him all about his family and he told her his father had a big job in England but his mother is in the bed with a desperate disease and calling for lemonade morning noon and night. The rich woman wanted to know who was taking care of us and Michael bragged we were taking care of ourselves, that there was no shortage of bread and marmalade. The rich woman wrote down Michael's name and address and told him be a good boy and go home to his brothers and his mother in the bed.
Malachy barks at Michael for being such a fool as to tell a rich woman anything. She'll go now and tell on us and before we know it we'll have the priests of the world banging on the door and disturbing us.
There's the banging on the door already. But it isn't a priest, it's Guard Dennehy. He calls up, Hello, hello, is anybody home? Are you there, Mrs. McCourt?
Michael knocks on the window and waves at the guard. I give him a good kick for himself and Malachy thumps him on the head and he yells, I'll tell the guard. I'll tell the guard. They're killing me, guard. They're thumping and kicking.
He won't shut up and Guard Dennehy shouts at us to open the door. I call out the window and tell him I can't open the door because my mother is in bed with a terrible disease.
Where's your father?
He's in England.
Well, I'm coming in to talk to your mother.
You can't. You can't. She has the disease. We all have the disease.
It might be the typhoid. It might be the galloping consumption. We're getting spots already. The baby has a lump. It could kill.
He pushes in the door and climbs the stairs to Italy just as Alphie crawls out from under the bed covered with marmalade and dirt. He looks at him and my mother and us, takes off his cap and scratches his head. He says, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, this is a desperate situation. How did your mother get sick like that?
I tell him he shouldn't go near her and when Malachy says we might not be able to go to school for ages the guard says we'll go to school no matter what, that we're on the earth to go to school the way he's on the earth to make sure we go to school. He wants to know if we have any relations and he sends me off to tell Grandma and Aunt Aggie to come to our house.
They scream at me and tell me I'm filthy. I try to explain that Mam has the disease and I'm worn out trying to make ends meet, keeping the home fires burning, getting lemonade for Mam and bread for my brothers. There's no use telling them about the marmalade for they'll only scream again. There's no use telling them about the nastiness of rich people and their maids.
They push me all the way back to the lane, barking at me and disgracing me on the streets of Limerick. Guard Dennehy is still scratching his poll. He says, Look at this, a disgrace. You wouldn't see the likes of this in Bombay or the Bowery of New York itself.
Grandma is wailing at my mother, Mother o' God, Angela, what's up with you in the bed? What did they do to you?
My mother runs her tongue over her dry lips and gasps for more lemonade.
She wants lemonade, says Michael, and we got it for her and bread and marmalade and we're all outlaws now. Frankie was the first outlaw till we went raiding for coal all over Limerick.
Guard Dennehy looks interested and takes Michael downstairs by the hand and in a few minutes we hear him laughing. Aunt Aggie says that's a disgraceful way to behave with my mother sick in the bed. The guard comes back and tells her go for a doctor. He keeps covering his face with his cap whenever he looks at me or my brothers. Desperadoes, he says, desperadoes.
The doctor comes with Aunt Aggie in his motor car and he has to rush my mother to the hospital with her pneumonia. We'd all like to go riding in the doctor's car but Aunt Aggie says, No, ye are all coming to my house till yeer mother comes home from the hospital.
I tell her not to bother. I'm eleven and I can easily look after my brothers. I'd be glad to stay at home from school and make sure everyone is fed and washed. But Grandma screams I will do no such a thing and Aunt Aggie gives me a thump for myself. Guard Dennehy says I'm too young yet to be an outlaw and a father but I have a promising future in both departments.
Get your clothes, says Aunt Aggie, ye are coming to my house till yeer mother is out of the hospital. Jesus above, that baby is a disgrace.
She finds a rag and ties it around Alphie's bottom for fear he might shit all over the pram. Then she looks at us and wants to know why we're standing there with our faces hanging out after she told us get our clothes. I'm afraid she'll hit me or yell at me when I tell her it's all right, we have our clothes, they're on us. She stares at me and shakes her head. Here, she says, put some sugar and water in the child's bottle. She tells me I have to push Alphie through the streets, she can't manage the pram with that bockety wheel that makes it rock back and forth and besides 'tis a disgraceful looking object she'd be ashamed to put a mangy dog in. She takes the three old coats from our bed and piles them on the pram till you can hardly see Alphie at all.
Grandma comes with us and barks at me all the way from Roden Lane to Aunt Aggie's flat in Windmill Street. Can't you push that pram properly? Jesus, you're going to kill that child. Stop goin' from side to side or I'll give you a good clitther on the gob. She won't come into Aunt Aggie's flat. She can't stand the sight of us one more minute. She's fed up with the whole McCourt clan from the days when she had to send six fares to bring us all back from America, dishing out more money for funerals for dead children, giving us food every time our father drank the dole or the wages, helping Angela carry on while that blaguard from the North drinks his wages all over England. Oh, she's fed up, so she is, and off she goes across Henry Street with her black shawl pulled up around her white head, limping along in her black high laced boots.
When you're eleven and your brothers are ten, five and one, you don't know what to do when you go to someone's house even if she's your mother's sister. You're told to leave the pram in the hall and bring the baby into the kitchen but if it's not your house you don't know what to do once you get into the kitchen for fear the aunt will yell at you or hit you on the skull. She takes off her coat and takes it to the bedroom and you stand with the baby in your arms waiting to be told. If you take one step forward or one step to the side she might come out and say where are you going and you don't know what to answer because you don't know yourself. If you say anything to your brothers she might say who do you think you're talking to in my kitchen? We have to stand and be quiet and that's hard when there's a tinkling sound from the bedroom and we know she's on the chamber pot peeing away. I don't want to look at Malachy. If I do I'll smile and he'll smile and Michael will smile and there's danger we'll start laughing and if we do we won't be able to stop for days at the picture in our heads of Aunt Aggie's big white bum perched on a flowery little chamber pot. I'm able to control myself. I won't laugh. Malachy and Michael won't laugh and it's easy to see we're all proud of ourselves for not laughing and getting into trouble with Aunt Aggie till Alphie in my arms smiles and says Goo goo and that sets us off. The three of us burst out laughing and Alphie grins with his dirty face and says Goo goo again till we're helpless and Aunt Aggie roars out of the room pulling her dress down and gives me a thump on the head that sends me against the wall baby and all. She hits Malachy too and she tries to hit Michael but he runs to the other side of her round table and she can't get at him. Come over here, she says, and I'll wipe that grin off your puss, but Michael keeps running around the table and she's too fat to catch him. I'll get you later, she says, I'll warm your arse, and you, Lord Muck, she says to me, put that child down on the floor over there by
the range. She puts the old coats from the pram on the floor and Alphie lies there with his sugary water and says Goo goo and smiles. She tells us take off every scrap of our clothes, get out to the tap in the backyard and scrub every inch of our bodies. We are not to come back into this house till we're spotless. I want to tell her it's the middle of February, it's freezing outside, we could all die, but I know if I open my mouth I might die right here on the kitchen floor.
We're out in the yard naked dousing ourselves with icy water from the tap. She opens the kitchen window and throws out a scrub brush and a big bar of brown soap like the one they used on Finn the Horse. She orders us to scrub each other's backs and don't stop till she tells us. Michael says his hands and feet are falling off with the cold but she doesn't care. She keeps telling us we're still dirty and if she has to come out to scrub us we'll rue the day. Another rue. I scrub myself harder. We all scrub till we're pink and our jaws chatter. It's not enough for Aunt Aggie. She comes out with a bucket and sloshes cold water all over us. Now, she says, get inside and dry yeerselves. We stand in the little shed next to her kitchen drying ourselves with one towel. We stand and shiver and wait because you can't go marching into her kitchen till she tells you. We hear her inside starting the fire, rattling the poker in the range, then yelling at us, Are ye goin' to stand in there all day? Come in here and put on yeer clothes.
She gives us mugs of tea and cuts of fried bread and we sit at the table eating quietly because you're not supposed to say a word unless she tells you. Michael asks her for a second cut of fried bread and we expect her to knock him off the chair for his cheek but she just grumbles, 'Tis far from two cuts of fried bread ye were brought up, and gives each of us another cut. She tries to feed Alphie bread soaked in tea but he won't eat it till she sprinkles it with sugar and when he's finished he smiles and pees all over her lap and we're delighted. She runs out to the shed to dab at herself with a towel and we're able to grin at each other at the table and tell Alphie he's the champion baby in the world. Uncle Pa Keating comes in the door all black from his job at the gas works. Oh, bejay, he says, what's this?
Michael says, My mother is in the hospital, Uncle Pa. Is that so? What's up with her?
Pneumonia, says Malachy.
Well, now, that's better than oldmonia.
We don't know what he's laughing at and Aunt Aggie comes in from the shed and tells him how Mam is in the hospital and we're to stay with them till she gets out. He says, Grand, grand, and goes to the shed to wash himself though when he comes back you'd never know he touched himself with water at all he's that black.
He sits at the table and Aunt Aggie gives him his supper, which is fried bread and ham and sliced tomatoes. She tells us get away from the table and stop gawking at him having his tea and tells him to stop giving us bits of ham and tomato. He says, Arrah, for Jaysus sake, Aggie, the children are hungry, and she says, 'Tis none of your business. They're not yours. She tells us go out and play and be home for bed by half-past eight. We know it's freezing outside and we'd like to stay in by that warm range but it's easier to be in the streets playing than inside with Aunt Aggie and her nagging.
She calls me in later and sends me upstairs to borrow a rubber sheet from a woman who had a child that died. The woman says tell your
aunt I'd like that rubber sheet back for the next child. Aunt Aggie says, Twelve years ago that child died and she still keeps the rubber sheet. Forty-five she is now and if there's another child we'll have to look for a star in the East. Malachy says, What's that? and she tells him mind his own business, he's too young.
Aunt Aggie places the rubber sheet on her bed and puts Alphie on it between herself and Uncle Pa. She sleeps inside against the wall and Uncle Pa outside because he has to get up in the morning for work. We are to sleep on the floor against the opposite wall with one coat under us and two over. She says if she hears a word out of us during the night she'll warm our arses and we're to be up early in the morning because it's Ash Wednesday and it wouldn't do us any harm to go to Mass and pray for our poor mother and her pneumonia.
The alarm clock shocks us out of our sleep. Aunt Aggie calls from her bed, The three of ye are to get up and go to Mass. Do ye hear me? Up. Wash yeer faces and go to the Jesuits.
Her backyard is all frost and ice and our hands sting from the tap water. We throw a little on our faces and dry with the towel that's still damp from yesterday. Malachy whispers our wash was a lick and a promise, that's what Mam would say.
The streets are frosty and icy, too, but the Jesuit church is warm. It must be grand to be a Jesuit, sleeping in a bed with sheets blankets pillows and getting up to a nice warm house and a warm church with nothing to do but say Mass hear confessions and yell at people for their sins have your meals served up to you and read your Latin office before you go to sleep. I'd like to be a Jesuit some day but there's no hope of that when you grow up in a lane. Jesuits are very particular. They don't like poor people. They like people with motor cars who stick out their little fingers when they pick up their teacups.
The church is crowded with people at seven o'clock Mass getting the ashes on their foreheads. Malachy whispers that Michael shouldn't get the ashes because he won't be making his First Communion till May and it would be a sin. Michael starts to cry, I want the ashes, I want the ashes. An old woman behind us says, What are ye doin' to that lovely child? Malachy explains the lovely child never made his First Communion and he's not in a state of grace. Malachy is getting ready for Confirmation himself, always showing off his knowledge of the catechism, always going on about state of grace. He won't admit I knew all about the state of grace a year ago, so long ago I'm starting to forget it. The old woman says you don't have to be in a state of grace to get a few ashes on your forehead and tells Malachy stop tormenting his poor little brother. She pats Michael on the head and tells him he's a lovely child and go up there and get your ashes. He runs to the altar and when he comes back the woman gives him a penny to go with his ashes.
Aunt Aggie is still in the bed with Alphie. She tells Malachy to fill Alphie's bottle with milk and bring it to him. She tells me to start the fire in the range, that there's paper and wood in a box and coal in the coal scuttle. If the fire won't start sprinkle it with a little paraffin oil. The fire is slow and smoky and I sprinkle it with the paraffin oil, it flares up, whoosh, and nearly takes my eyebrows off. There is smoke everywhere and Aunt Aggie rushes into the kitchen. She shoves me away from the range. Jesus above, can't you do anything right? You're supposed to open the damper, you eejit.
I don't know anything about dampers. In our house we have a fireplace in Ireland downstairs and a fireplace in Italy upstairs and no sign of a damper. Then you go to your aunt's house and you're supposed to know all about dampers. There's no use telling her this is the first time you ever lit a fire in a range. She'll just give you another thump on the skull and send you flying. It's hard to know why grown people get so angry over little things like dampers. When I'm a man I won't go around thumping small children over dampers or anything else. Now she yells at me, Look at Lord Muck standing there. Would you ever think of opening the window and letting out the smoke? Of course you wouldn't. You have a puss on you like your father from the North. Do you think now you can boil the water for the tea without burning the house down?
She cuts three slices from a loaf, smears them with margarine for us and goes back to bed. We have the tea and bread and it's one morning we're glad to go to school where it's warm and there are no yelling aunts.
After school she tells me sit at the table and write my father a letter about Mam in the hospital and how we're all at Aunt Aggie's till Mam comes home. I'm to tell him we're all happy and in the best of health, send money, food is very dear, growing boys eat a lot, ha ha, Alphie the baby needs clothes and nappies.
I don't know why she's always angry. Her flat is warm and dry. She has electric light in the house and her own lavatory in the backyard. Uncle Pa has a steady job and he brings home his wages every Friday. He drinks his pints at South's pub but never comes home singing songs of Ireland's long woeful history. He says, A pox on all their houses, and he says the funniest thing in the world is that we all have arses that have to be wiped and no man escapes that. The minute a politician or a Pope starts his blather Uncle Pa thinks of him wiping his arse. Hitler and Roosevelt and Churchill all wipe their arses. De Valera, too. He says the only people you can trust in that department are the Mahommedans for they eat with one hand and wipe with the other. The human hand itself is a sneaky bugger and you never know what it's been up to.
There are good times with Uncle Pa when Aunt Aggie goes to the Mechanics' Institute to play cards, forty-five. He says, To hell with the begrudgers. He gets himself two bottles of stout from South's, six buns and a half pound of ham from the shop on the corner. He makes tea and we sit by the range drinking it, eating our ham sandwiches and buns and laughing over Uncle Pa and the way he goes on about the world. He says, I swallowed the gas, I drink the pint, I don't give a fiddler's fart about the world and its cousin. If little Alphie gets tired and cranky and cries Uncle Pa pulls his shirt back from his chest and tells him, Here, have a suck of diddy momma. The sight of that flat chest and the nipple shocks Alphie and makes him good again.
Before Aunt Aggie comes home we have to wash the mugs and clean up so she won't know we were stuffing ourselves with buns and ham sandwiches. She'd nag Uncle Pa for a month if she ever found out and that's what I don't understand. Why does he let her nag him like that? He went to the Great War, he was gassed, he's big, he has a job, he makes the world laugh. It's a mystery. That's what the priests and the masters tell you, everything is a mystery and you have to believe what you're told.
I could easily have Uncle Pa for a father. We'd have great times sitting by the fire in the range drinking tea and laughing over the way he farts and says, Light a match. That's a present from the Germans.
Aunt Aggie torments me all the time. She calls me scabby eyes. She says I'm the spitting image of my father, I have the odd manner, I have the sneaky air of a northern Presbyterian, I'll probably grow up and build an altar to Oliver Cromwell himself, I'll run off and marry an English tart and cover my house with pictures of the royal family.
I want to get away from her and I can think of only one way, to make myself sick and go to the hospital. I get up in the middle of the night and go to her backyard. I can pretend I'm going to the lavatory. I stand out in the open in the freezing weather and hope I'll catch pneumonia or the galloping consumption so that I'll go to the hospital with the nice clean sheets and the meals in the bed and books brought by the girl in the blue dress. I might meet another Patricia Madigan and learn a long poem. I stand in the backyard for ages in my shirt and bare feet looking up at the moon which is a ghostly galleon riding upon cloudy seas and go back to bed shivering hoping I'll wake up in the morning with a terrible cough and flushed cheeks. But I don't. I feel fresh and lively and I'd be in great form if I could be at home with my mother and brothers.
There are days when Aunt Aggie tells us she can't stand the sight of us another minute, Get away from me. Here, scabby eyes, take Alphie out in his pram, take your brothers, go to the park and play, do anything ye like and don't come back till teatime when the Angelus is ringing, not a minute later, do ye hear me, not a minute later. It's cold but we don't care. We push the pram up O'Connell Avenue out to Ballinacurra or the Rosbrien Road. We let Alphie crawl around in fields to look at cows and sheep and we laugh when the cows nuzzle him. I get under the cows and squirt the milk into Alphie's mouth till he's full and throws it up. Farmers chase us till they see how small Michael and Alphie are. Malachy laughs at the farmers. He says, Hit me now with the child in me arms. Then he has a great notion, Why can't we go to our own house and play a while? We find twigs and bits of wood in the fields and rush to Roden Lane. There are matches by the fireplace in Italy and we have a good fire going in no time. Alphie falls asleep and soon the rest of us drift off till the Angelus booms out of the Redemptorist church and we know we're in trouble with Aunt Aggie for being late.
We don't care. She can yell at us all she wants but we had a grand time out the country with the cows and the sheep and then the lovely fire above in Italy.
You can tell she never has grand times like that. Electric light and a lavatory but no grand times.
Grandma comes for her on Thursdays and Sundays and they take the bus to the hospital to see Mam. We can't go because children are not allowed and if we say, How's Mam? they look cranky and tell us she's all right, she'll live. We'd like to know when she's getting out of hospital so that we can all go back home but we're afraid to open our mouths.
Malachy tells Aunt Aggie one day he's hungry and could he have a piece of bread. She hits him with a rolled up Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart and there are tears on his eyelashes. He doesn't come home from school the next day and he's still gone at bedtime. Aunt Aggie says, Well, I suppose he ran away. Good riddance. If he was hungry he'd be here. Let him find comfort in a ditch.
Next day Michael runs in from the street, Dad's here, Dad's here, and runs back out and there's Dad sitting on the hall floor hugging Michael, crying, Your poor mother, your poor mother, and there's a smell of drink on him. Aunt Aggie is smiling, Oh, you're here, and she makes tea and eggs and sausages. She sends me out for a bottle of stout for Dad and I wonder why she's so pleasant and generous all of a sudden. Michael says, Are we going to our own house, Dad?
We are, son.
Alphie is back in the pram with the three old coats and coal and wood for the fire. Aunt Aggie stands at her door and tells us be good boys, come back for tea anytime, and there's a bad word for her in my head, Oul' bitch. It's in my head and I can't help it and I'll have to tell the priest in confession.
Malachy isn't in a ditch, he's there in our own house eating fish and chips a drunken soldier dropped at the gate of the Sarsfield Barracks.
Mam comes home in two days. She's weak and white and walks slowly. She says, The doctor told me keep warm, have plenty of rest and nourishing food, meat and eggs three times a week. God help us, those poor doctors don't have a notion of not having. Dad makes tea and toasts bread for her on the fire. He fries bread for the rest of us and we have a lovely night up in Italy where it's warm. He says he can't stay forever, he has to go back to work in Coventry. Mam wonders how he'll get to Coventry without a penny in his pocket. He's up early on Holy Saturday and I have tea with him by the fire. He fries four cuts of bread and wraps them in pages of the Limerick Chronicle, two cuts in each coat pocket. Mam is still in bed and he calls to her from the bottom of the stairs, I'm going now. She says, All right. Write when you land. My father is going to England and she won't even get out of the bed. I ask if I can go with him to the railway station. No, he's not going there. He's going to the Dublin road to see if he can get a lift. He pats my head, tells me take care of my mother and brothers and goes out the door. I watch him go up the lane till he turns the corner. I run up the lane to see him go down Barrack Hill and down St. Joseph's Street. I run down the hill and follow him as far as I can. He must know I'm following him because he turns and calls to me, Go home, Francis. Go home to your mother.
In a week there's a letter to say he arrived safely, that we are to be good boys, attend to our religious duties and above all obey our mother. In another week there's a telegram money order for three pounds and we're in heaven. We'll be rich, there will be fish and chips, jelly and custard, films every Saturday at the Lyric, the Coliseum, the Carlton, the Atheneum, the Central and the fanciest of all, the Savoy. We might even wind up having tea and cakes at the Savoy Café with the nobs and toffs of Limerick. We'll be sure to hold our teacups with our little fingers sticking out.
The next Saturday there's no telegram nor the Saturday after nor any Saturday forever. Mam begs again at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and smiles at the Dispensary when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane have their bit of a joke about Dad having a tart in Piccadilly. Michael wants to know what a tart is and she tells him it's something you have with tea. She spends most of the day by the fire with Bridey Hannon puffing on her Woodlbines, drinking weak tea. The bread crumbs from the morning are always on the table when we come home from school. She never washes the
jam jars or mugs and there are flies in the sugar and wherever there is sweetness.
She says Malachy and I have to take turns looking after Alphie, taking him out in the pram for a bit of fresh air. The child can't be kept in Italy from October to April. If we tell her we want to play with our pals she might let fly with a right cross to the head that stings the ears.
We play games with Alphie and the pram. I stand at the top of Barrack Hill and Malachy is at the bottom. When I give the pram a push down the hill Malachy is supposed to stop it but he's looking at a pal on roller skates and it speeds by him across the street and through the doors of Leniston's pub where men are having a peaceful pint and not expecting a pram with a dirty faced child saying Goo goo goo goo. The barman shouts this is a disgrace, there must be a law against this class of behavior, babies roaring through the door in bockety prams, he'll call the guards on us, and Alphie waves at him and smiles and he says, all right, all right, the child can have a sweet and a lemonade, the brothers can have lemonade too, that raggedy pair, and God above, 'tis a hard world, the minute you think you're getting ahead a pram comes crashing through the door and you're dishing out sweets and lemonade right and left, the two of ye take that child and go home to yeer mother.
Malachy has another powerful idea, that we could go around Limerick like tinkers pushing Alphie in his pram into pubs for the sweets and lemonade, but I don't want Mam finding out and hitting me with her right cross. Malachy says I'm not a sport and runs off. I push the pram over to Henry Street and up by the Redemptorist church. It's a gray day, the church is gray and the small crowd of people outside the door of the priests' house is gray. They're waiting to beg for any food left over from the priests' dinner.
There in the middle of the crowd in her dirty gray coat is my mother.
This is my own mother, begging. This is worse than the dole, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Dispensary. It's the worst kind of shame, almost as bad as begging on the streets where the tinkers hold up their scabby children, Give us a penny for the poor child, mister, the poor child is hungry, missus.
My mother is a beggar now and if anyone from the lane or my school sees her the family will be disgraced entirely. My pals will make up new names and torment me in the schoolyard and I know what they'll say, Frankie McCourt beggar woman's boy scabby-eyed dancing blubber-gob Jap.
The door of the priests' house swings open and the people rush with their hands out. I can hear them, Brother, brother, here, brother, ah, for the love o' God, brother. Five children at home, brother. I can see my own mother pushed along. I can see the tightness of her mouth when she snatches at a bag and turns from the door and I push the pram up the street before she can see me.
I don't want to go home anymore. I push the pram down to the Dock Road, out to Corkanree where all the dust and garbage of Limerick is dumped and burned. I stand a while and look at boys chase rats. I don't know why they have to torture rats that are not in their houses. I'd keep going on into the country forever if I didn't have Alphie bawling with the hunger, kicking his chubby legs, waving his empty bottle.
Mam has the fire going and something boiling in a pot. Malachy smiles and says she brought home corned beef and a few spuds from
Kathleen O'Connell's shop. He wouldn't be so happy if he knew he was the son of a beggar. She calls us in from the lane and when we sit at the table it's hard for me to look at my mother the beggar. She lifts the pot to the table, spoons out the potatoes one each and uses a fork to lift out the corned beef.
It isn't corned beef at all. It's a great lump of quivering gray fat and the only sign of corned beef is a little nipple of red meat on top. We stare at that bit of meat and wonder who will get it. Mam says, That's for Alphie. He's a baby, he's growing fast, he needs it. She puts it on a saucer in front of him. He pushes it away with his finger, then pulls it back. He lifts it to his mouth, looks around the kitchen, sees Lucky the dog and throws it to him.
There's no use saying anything. The meat is gone. We eat our potatoes with plenty of salt and I eat my fat and pretend it's that nipple of red meat.
XI
Mam warns us, Ye are to keep yeer paws out of that trunk for there's nothing in there that's of the slightest interest or any of yeer business.
All she has in that trunk is a lot of papers, certificates of birth and baptism, her Irish passport, Dad's English passport from Belfast, our American passports and her bright red flapper dress with spangles and black frills she brought all the way from America. She wants to keep that dress forever to remind herself she was young and dancing.
I don't care what she has in the trunk till I start a football team with Billy Campbell and Malachy. We can't afford uniforms or boots and Billy says, How will the world know who we are? We don't even have a name.
I remember the red dress and a name comes to me, The Red Hearts of Limerick. Mam never opens the trunk so what does it matter if I cut off a piece of the dress to make seven red hearts we can stick on our chests? What you don't know won't bother you, she always says herself.
The dress is buried under the papers. I look at my passport picture when I was small and I can see why they call me Jap. There's a paper that says Marriage Certificate, that Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan were joined in Holy Matrimony on the twenty-eighth of March, 1930. How could that be? I was born on the nineteenth of August and Billy Campbell told me the father and mother have to be married nine months before there's a sign of a child. Here I am born into the world in half the time. That means I must be a miracle and I might grow up to be a saint with people celebrating the feast of St. Francis of Limerick.
I'll have to ask Mikey Molloy, still the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.
Billy says if we're to be great soccer players we have to practice and we're to meet over in the park. The boys complain when I hand out the hearts and I tell them if they don't like it they can go home and cut up their own mother's dresses and blouses.
We have no money for a proper ball so one of the boys brings a sheep's bladder stuffed with rags. We kick the bladder up and down the meadow till there are holes and rags start falling out and we get fed up
kicking a bladder that's hardly there anymore. Billy says we're to meet tomorrow morning which is Saturday and go out Ballinacurra to see if we can challenge rich Crescent College boys to a proper game, seven a side. He says we're to pin our red hearts to our shirts even if they're red rags.
Malachy is going home for tea but I can't go because I have to see Mikey Molloy and find out why I was born in half the time. Mikey is coming out of his house with his father, Peter. It's Mikey's sixteenth birthday and his father is taking him to Bowles's pub for his first pint. Nora Molloy is inside screeching after Peter that if they go they can stay gone, she's done baking bread, she's never going to the lunatic asylum again, if he brings that child home drunk she'll go to Scotland and disappear from the face of the earth.
Peter tells Mikey, Pay no attention to her, Cyclops. The mothers of Ireland are always enemies of the first pint. My own mother tried to kill my father with a frying pan when he took me for the first pint.
Mikey asks Peter if I can come with them and have a lemonade.
Peter tells everyone in the pub that Mikey is there for his first pint and when all the men want to stand Mikey a pint Peter says, Ah, no, 'twould be a terrible thing if he had too much and turned against it entirely.
The pints are drawn and we sit against the wall, the Molloys with their pints and I with my lemonade. The men wish Mikey all the best in the life to come and wasn't it a gift from God that he fell off that spout years ago and never had the fit since and wasn't it a great pity about that poor little bugger, Quasimodo Dooley, carried off with the consumption after all his trouble talking for years like an Englishman so he could be on the BBC which is no fit place for an Irishman anyway.
Peter is talking to the men and Mikey, sipping his first pint, whispers to me, I don't think I like it, but don't tell my father. Then he tells me how he practices the English accent in secret so that he can be a BBC announcer, Quasimodo's dream. He tells me I can have Cuchulain back, that he's no use to you when you're reading the news on the BBC. Now that he's sixteen he wants to go to England and if ever I get a wireless that will be him on the BBC Home Service.
I tell him about the marriage certificate, how Billy Campbell said it has to be nine months but I was born in half the time and would he know if I was some class of a miracle.
Naw, he says, naw. You're a bastard. You're doomed.
You don't have to be cursing me, Mikey.
I'm not. That's what they call people who aren't born inside the
nine months of the marriage, people conceived beyond the blanket. What's that?
What's what?
Conceived.
That's when the sperm hits the egg and it grows and there you are
nine months later.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He whispers, The thing between your legs is the excitement. I don't
like the other names, the dong, the prick, the dick, the langer. So your father shoves his excitement into your mother and there's a spurt and these little germs go up into your mother where there's an egg and that grows into you.
I'm not an egg.
You are an egg. Everyone was an egg once.
Why am I doomed? 'Tisn't my fault I'm a bastard.
All bastards are doomed. They're like babies that weren't baptized.
They're sent to Limbo for eternity and there's no way out and it's not their fault. It makes you wonder about God up there on His throne with no mercy for the little unbaptized babies. That's why I don't go near the chapel anymore. Anyway, you're doomed. Your father and mother had the excitement and they weren't married so you're not in a state of grace.
What am I going to do?
Nothing. You're doomed.
Can't I light a candle or something.
You could try the Blessed Virgin. She's in charge of the doom.
But I don't have a penny for the candle.
All right, all right, here's a penny. You can give it back when you
get a job a million years from now. 'Tis costing me a fortune to be the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.
The barman is doing a crossword puzzle and he says to Peter, What's the opposite of advance?
Retreat, says Peter.
That's it, says the barman. Everything has an opposite. Mother o' God, says Peter.
What's up with you, Peter? says the barman.
What was that you said before, Tommy?
Everything has an opposite.
Mother o' God.
Are you all right, Peter? Is the pint all right?
The pint is grand, Tommy, and I'm the champion of all pint
drinkers, amn't I?
Begod an' you are, Peter. No denyin' that to you.
That means I could be the champion in the opposite department. What are you talking about, Peter?
I could be the champion of no pints at all.
Ah, now, Peter, I think you're going a bit far. Is the wife all
right at home?
Tommy, take this pint away from me. I'm the champion of no pints at
all.
Peter turns and takes the glass from Mikey. We're going home to
your mother, Mikey.
You didn't call me Cyclops, Dad.
You're Mikey. You're Michael. We're going to England. No more pints
for me, no pints for you, no more bread baking for your mother. Come on. We're leaving the pub and Tommy the barman calls after us, You know
what 'tis, Peter. 'Tis all them bloody books you're reading. They have your head destroyed.
Peter and Mikey turn to go home. I have to go to St. Joseph's to light the candle that will save me from the doom but I look in the window of Counihan's shop and there in the middle is a great slab of Cleeves' toffee and a sign, TWO PIECES FOR A PENNY. I know I'm doomed but the water is running along the sides of my tongue and when I put my penny on the counter for Miss Counihan I promise the Virgin Mary the next penny I get I'll be lighting a candle and would she please talk to her Son and delay the doom for awhile.
A penn'orth of Cleeves' toffee doesn't last forever and when it's gone I have to think of going home to a mother who let my father push his
excitement into her so that I could be born in half the time and grow up to be a bastard. If she ever says a word about the red dress or anything I'll tell her I know all about the excitement and she'll be shocked.
Saturday morning I meet The Red Hearts of Limerick and we wander out the road looking for a football challenge. The boys are still grousing that the bits of red dress don't look like hearts till Billy tells them if they don't want to play football go home and play with their sisters' dolls.
There are boys playing football in a field in Ballinacurra and Billy challenges them. They have eight players and we have only seven but we don't mind because one of them has one eye and Billy tells us stay on his blind side. Besides, he says, Frankie McCourt is nearly blind with his two bad eyes and that's worse. They're all togged out in blue and white jerseys and white shorts and proper football boots. One of them says we look like something the cat brought in and Malachy has to be held back from fighting them. We agree to play half an hour because the Ballinacurra boys say they have to go to lunch. Lunch. The whole world has dinner in the middle of the day but they have lunch. If no one scores in half an hour it's a draw. We play back and forth till Billy gets the ball and goes speeding and dancing up the sideline so fast no one can catch him and in goes the ball for a goal. The half hour is nearly up but the Ballinacurra boys want another half hour and they manage to score well into the second half hour. Then the ball goes over the line for touch. It's our ball. Billy stands on the touch line with the ball over his head. He pretends to look at Malachy but throws the ball to me. It comes to me as if it's the only thing that exists in the whole world. It comes straight to my foot and all I have to do is swivel to the left and swing that ball straight into the goal. There's a whiteness in my head and I feel like a boy in heaven. I'm floating over the whole field till The Red Hearts of Limerick clap me on the back and tell me that was a great goal, Frankie, you too, Billy.
We walk back along O'Connell Avenue and I keep thinking of the way the ball came to my foot and surely it was sent by God or the Blessed Virgin Mary who would never send such a blessing to one doomed for being born in half the time and I know as long as I live I'll never forget that ball coming from Billy Campbell, that goal.
Mam meets Bridey Hannon and her mother going up the lane and they tell her about Mr. Hannon's poor legs. Poor John, it's a trial for him to cycle home every night after delivering coal and turf all day on the great float for the coal merchants on the Dock Road. He's paid from eight in the morning till half five in the evening though he has to get the horse ready well before eight and settle him for the night well after half five. He's up and down on that float all day hoisting bags of coal and turf, desperate to keep the bandages in place on his legs so the dirt won't get into the open sores. The bandages are forever sticking and have to be ripped away and when he comes home she washes the sores with warm water and soap, covers them with ointment and wraps them in clean bandages. They can't afford new bandages every day so she keeps washing the old ones over and over till they're gray.
Mam says Mr. Hannon should see the doctor and Mrs. Hannon says, Sure, he seen the doctor a dozen times and the doctor says he has to stay off them legs. That's all. Stay off them legs. Sure how can he stay off them legs? He has to work. What would we live on if he didn't work?
Mam says maybe Bridey could get some kind of a job herself and Bridey is offended. Don't you know I have a weak chest, Angela? Don't you know I had rheumatic fever an' I could go at any time? I have to be careful.
Mam often talks about Bridey and her rheumatic fever and weak chest. She says, That one is able to sit here by the hour and complain about her ailments but it doesn't stop her from puffing away on the Woodbines.
Mam tells Bridey she's very sorry over the weak chest and it's terrible the way her father suffers. Mrs. Hannon tells my mother that John is getting worse every day, And what would you think, Mrs. McCourt, if your boy Frankie went on the float with him a few hours a week and helped him with the bags? We can barely afford it but Frankie could earn a shilling or two and John could rest his poor legs.
Mam says, I don't know, he's only eleven and he had that typhoid and the coal dust wouldn't be good for his eyes.
Bridey says, He'd be out in the air and there's nothing like fresh air for someone with bad eyes or getting over the typhoid, isn't that right, Frankie?
'Tis, Bridey.
I'm dying to go around with Mr. Hannon on the great float like a real workingman. If I'm good at it they might let me stay at home from school forever but Mam says, He can do it as long as it doesn't interfere with school and he can start on a Saturday morning.
I'm a man now so I light the fire early on Saturday morning and make my own tea and fried bread. I wait next door for Mr. Hannon to come out with his bicycle and there's a lovely smell of rashers and eggs coming through the window. Mam says Mr. Hannon gets the best of food because Mrs. Hannon is as mad about him as she was the day she married him. They're like two lovers out of an American film the way they go on. Here he is pushing the bicycle and puffing away on the pipe in his mouth. He tells me climb up on the bar of his bike and off we go to my first job as a man. His head is over mine on the bike and the smell of the pipe is lovely. There's a coal smell on his clothes and that makes me sneeze.
Men are walking or cycling toward the coal yards and Rank's Flour Mills and the Limerick Steamship Company on the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon takes his pipe from his mouth and tells me this is the best morning of all, Saturday, half day. We'll start at eight and be finished by the time the Angelus rings at twelve.
First we get the horse ready, give him a bit of a rub, fill the wooden tub with oats and the bucket with water. Mr. Hannon shows me how to put on the harness and lets me back the horse into the shafts of the float. He says, Jaysus, Frankie, you have the knack of it.
That makes me so happy I want to jump up and down and drive a float the rest of my life.
There are two men filling bags with coal and turf and weighing them on the great iron scale, a hundredweight in each bag. It's their job to stack the bags on the float while Mr. Hannon goes to the office for the delivery dockets. The bag men are fast and we're ready for our rounds. Mr. Hannon sits up on the left side of the float and flicks the whip to show where I'm to sit on the right side. It's hard to climb up the way the float is so high and packed with bags and I try to get up by climbing the wheel. Mr. Hannon says I should never do the likes of that again. Never put your leg or hand near a wheel when the horse is harnessed in
the shafts. A horse might take a notion to go for a walk for himself and there you are with the leg or the arm caught in the wheel and twisted off your body and you looking at it. He says to the horse, G'up ower that, and the horse shakes his head and rattles the harness and Mr. Hannon laughs. That fool of a horse loves to work, he says. He won't be rattling his harness in a few hours.
When the rain starts we cover ourselves with old coal bags and Mr. Hannon turns his pipe upside down in his mouth to keep the tobacco dry. He says the rain makes everything heavier but what's the use of complaining. You might as well complain about the sun in Africa.
We cross the Sarsfield Bridge for deliveries to the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road. Rich people, says Mr. Hannon, and very slow to put their hands in their pockets for a tip.
We have sixteen bags to deliver. Mr. Hannon says we're lucky today because some houses get more than one and he doesn't have to be climbing on and off that float destroying his legs. When we stop he gets down and I pull the bag to the edge and lay it on his shoulders. Some houses have areas outside where you pull up a trap door and tip the bag till it empties and that's easy. There are other houses with long backyards and you can see Mr. Hannon suffering with his legs when he has to carry the bags from the float to the sheds near the back doors. Ah, Jaysus, Frankie, ah, Jaysus, is the only complaint out of him and he asks me to give him a hand to climb back on the float. He says if he had a handcart he could wheel the bags from float to house and that would be a blessing but a handcart would cost two weeks' wages and who could afford that?
The bags are delivered and the sun is out, the float is empty, and the horse knows his workday is over. It's lovely to sit on the float looking along the length of the horse from his tail to his head rocking along the Ennis Road over the Shannon and up the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon says the man who delivered sixteen hundredweights of coal and turf deserves a pint and the boy who helped him deserves a lemonade. He tells me I should go to school and not be like him working away with the two legs rotting under him. Go to school, Frankie, and get out of Limerick and Ireland itself. This war will be over some day and you can go to America or Australia or any big open country where you can look up and see no end to the land. The world is wide and you can have great adventures. If I didn't have these two legs I'd be over in England making a fortune in the factories like the rest of the Irishmen, like your father. No, not like your father. I hear he left you high and dry, eh? I don't know how a man in his right mind can go off and leave a wife and family to starve and shiver in a Limerick winter. School, Frankie, school. The books, the books, the books. Get out of Limerick before your legs rot and your mind collapses entirely.
The horse clops along and when we get to the coal yard we feed and water him and give him a rubdown. Mr. Hannon talks to him all the time and calls him Me oul' segosha, and the horse snuffles and pushes his nose against Mr. Hannon's chest. I'd love to bring this horse home and let him stay downstairs when we're up in Italy but even if I could get him in the door my mother would yell at me that the last thing we need in this house is a horse.
The streets going up from the Dock Road are too hilly for Mr. Hannon to ride the bicycle and carry me, so we walk. His legs are sore from the day and it takes a long time to get up to Henry Street. He leans
on the bicycle or sits on the steps outside houses, grinding down on the pipe in his mouth.
I'm wondering when I'll get the money for the day's work because Mam might let me go to the Lyric Cinema if I get home in time with my shilling or whatever Mr. Hannon gives me. Now we're at the door of South's pub and he tells me come in, didn't he promise me a lemonade?
Uncle Pa Keating is sitting in the pub. He's all black as usual and he's sitting next to Bill Galvin, all white as usual, snuffling and taking great slugs out of his black pint. Mr. Hannon says, How're you? and sits on the other side of Bill Galvin and everyone in the pub laughs. Jaysus, says the barman, look at that, two lumps of coal and a snowball. Men come in from other parts of the pub to see the two coal black men with the lime white man in the middle and they want to send down to the Limerick Leader for a man with a camera.
Uncle Pa says, What are you doing all black yourself, Frankie? Did you fall down a coal mine?
I was helping Mr. Hannon on the float.
Your eyes look atrocious, Frankie. Piss holes in the snow. 'Tis the coal dust, Uncle Pa.
Wash them when you go home.
I will, Uncle Pa.
Mr. Hannon buys me a lemonade, gives me the shilling for my
morning's work and tells me I can go home now, I'm a great worker and I can help him again next week after school.
On the way home I see myself in the glass of a shop window all black from the coal, and I feel like a man, a man with a shilling in his pocket, a man who had a lemonade in a pub with two coal men and a lime man. I'm not a child anymore and I could easily leave Leamy's School forever. I could work with Mr. Hannon every day and when his legs got too bad I could take over the float and deliver coal to the rich people the rest of my life and my mother wouldn't have to be a beggar at the Redemptorist priests' house.
People on the streets and lanes give me curious looks. Boys and girls laugh and call out, Here's the chimney sweep. How much do you want for cleaning our chimney? Did you fall into a coal hole? Were you burned by the darkness?
They're ignorant. They don't know I spent the day delivering hundredweights of coal and turf. They don't know I'm a man.
Mam is sleeping up in Italy with Alphie and there's a coat over the window to keep the room dark. I tell her I earned a shilling and she says I can go to the Lyric, I deserve it. Take tuppence and leave the rest of the shilling on the mantelpiece downstairs so that she can send out for a loaf of bread for the tea. The coat suddenly drops from the window and the room is bright. Mam looks at me, God above, look at your eyes. Go downstairs and I'll be down in a minute to wash them.
She heats water in the kettle and dabs at my eyes with boric acid powder and tells me I can't go to the Lyric Cinema today or any day till my eyes clear up though God knows when that will be. She says, You can't be delivering coal with the state of your eyes. The dust will surely destroy them.
I want the job. I want to bring home the shilling. I want to be a man.
You can be a man without bringing home a shilling. Go upstairs and lie down and rest your two eyes or it's a blind man you'll be.
I want that job. I wash my eyes three times a day with the boric acid powder. I remember Seamus in the hospital and how his uncle's eyes were cured with the blink exercise and I make sure to sit and blink for an hour every day. You can't beat the blink for the strong eye, he said. And now I blink and blink till Malachy runs to my mother, talking out in the lane with Mrs. Hannon, Mam, something is up with Frankie, he's upstairs blinking and blinking.
She comes running up. What's wrong with you? I'm making my eyes strong with the exercise. What exercise?
The blinking.
Blinking is not exercise.
Seamus in the hospital says you can't beat the blink for the strong eye. His uncle had powerful eyes from the blinking. She says I'm getting odd and goes back to the lane and her chat with Mrs. Hannon and I blink and bathe my eyes with the boric acid powder in warm water. I can hear Mrs. Hannon through the window, Your little Frankie is a godsend to John for 'tis the climbing up and down on that float that was ruining his legs entirely.
Mam doesn't say anything and that means she feels so sorry for Mr. Hannon she'll let me help him again on his heavy delivery day, Thursday. I wash my eyes three times a day and I blink till I get a pain in my eyebrows. I blink in school when the master isn't looking and all the boys in my class are calling me Blinky and adding that to the list of names.
Blinky McCourt beggar woman's son scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing
Jap.
I don't care what they call me anymore as long as my eyes are
clearing up and I have a regular job lifting hundredweights of coal on a float. I wish they could see me on Thursday after school when I'm on the float and Mr. Hannon hands me the reins so that he can smoke his pipe in comfort. Here you are, Frankie, nice and gentle for this is a good horse and he doesn't need to be pulled at.
He hands me the whip too but you never need the whip with this horse. It's all for show and I just flick it at the air like Mr. Hannon or I might knock a fly off the horse's great golden rump swinging between the shafts.
Surely the world is looking at me and admiring the way I rock with the float, the cool way I have with the reins and the whip. I wish I had a pipe like Mr. Hannon and a tweed cap. I wish I could be a real coal man with black skin like Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa Keating so that people would say, There goes Frankie McCourt that delivers all the coal in Limerick and drinks his pint in South's pub. I'd never wash my face. I'd be black every day of the year even Christmas when you're supposed to give yourself a good wash for the coming of the Infant Jesus. I know He wouldn't mind because I saw the Three Wise Men in the Christmas crib at the Redemptorist church and one of them was blacker than Uncle Pa Keating, the blackest man in Limerick, and if a Wise Man is black it means that everywhere you go in the world someone is delivering coal.
The horse lifts his tail and great lumps of steaming yellow shit drop from his behind. I start to pull on the reins so that he can stop and have a bit of comfort for himself but Mr. Hannon says, No, Frankie, let him trot. They always shit on the trot. That's one of the blessings horses have, they shit on the trot, and they're not dirty and stinking
like the human race, not at all, Frankie. The worst thing in the world is to go into a lavatory after a man that had a feed of pig's feet and a night of pints. The stink from that could twist the nostrils of a strong man. Horses are different. All they have is oats and hay and what they drop is clean and natural.
I work with Mr. Hannon after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the half day on Saturday morning and that means three shillings for my mother though she worries all the time over my eyes. The minute I get home she washes them and makes me rest them for half an hour.
Mr. Hannon says he'll wait near Leamy's School for me on Thursdays after his deliveries on Barrington Street. Now the boys will see me. Now they'll know I'm a workingman and more than a scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing Jap. Mr. Hannon says, Up you get, and I climb up on the float like any workingman. I look at the boys gawking at me. Gawking. I tell Mr. Hannon if he wants to smoke his pipe in comfort I'll take the reins and when he hands them over I'm sure I hear the boys gasping. I tell the horse, G'up ower that, like Mr. Hannon. We trot away and I know dozens of Leamy's boys are committing the deadly sin of envy. I tell the horse again, G'up ower that, to make sure everyone heard, to make sure they know I'm driving that float and no one else, to make sure they'll never forget it was me they saw on that float with the reins and the whip. It's the best day of my life, better than my First Communion day, which Grandma ruined, better than my Confirmation day when I had the typhoid.
They don't call me names anymore. They don't laugh at my scabby eyes. They want to know how I got such a good job at eleven years of age and what I'm paid and if I'll have that job forever. They want to know if there are any other good jobs going in the coal yards and would I put in a good word for them.
Then there are big boys of thirteen who stick their faces in mine and say they should have that job because they're bigger and I'm nothing but a scrawny little runt with no shoulders. They can talk as much as they like. I have the job and Mr. Hannon tells me I'm powerful.
There are days his legs are so bad he can hardly walk at all and you can see Mrs. Hannon worries. She gives me a mug of tea and I watch her roll up his trouser legs and peel away the dirty bandages. The sores are red and yellow and clogged with coal dust. She washes them with soapy water and smears them with a yellow ointment. She props the legs up on a chair and that's where he stays the rest of the night reading the paper or a book from the shelf above his head.
The legs are getting so bad he has to get up an hour earlier in the morning to get the stiffness out, to put on another dressing. It's still dark one Saturday morning when Mrs. Hannon knocks at our door and asks me if I'd go to a neighbor and borrow their handcart to take on the float for Mr. Hannon will never be able to carry the bags today and maybe I'd just roll them on the handcart for him. He won't be able to carry me on his bicycle so I can meet him at the yard with the handcart.
The neighbor says, Anything for Mr. Hannon, God bless him.
I wait at the gate of the coal yard and watch him cycle toward me, slower than ever. He's so stiff he can hardly get off the bike and he says, You're a great man, Frankie. He lets me get the horse ready though I still have trouble getting on the harness. He lets me handle the float out of the yard and into the frosty streets and I wish I could drive forever and never go home. Mr. Hannon shows me how to pull the bags to the edge of the float and drop them on the ground so that I can pull them
on to the handcart and push them to the houses. He tells me how to lift and push the bags without straining myself and we have the sixteen bags delivered by noon.
I wish the boys at Leamy's could see me now, the way I drive the horse and handle the bags, the way I do everything while Mr. Hannon rests his legs. I wish they could see me pushing the handcart to South's pub and having my lemonade with Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa and me all black and Bill Galvin all white. I'd like to show the world the tips Mr. Hannon lets me keep, four shillings, and the shilling he gives me for the morning's work, five shillings altogether.
Mam is sitting by the fire and when I hand her the money she looks at me, drops it in her lap and cries. I'm puzzled because money is supposed to make you happy. Look at your eyes, she says. Go to that glass and look at your eyes.
My face is black and the eyes are worse than ever. The whites and the eyelids are red, and the yellow stuff oozes to the corners and out over the lower lids. If the ooze sits a while it forms a crust that has to be picked off or washed away.
Mam says that's the end of it. No more Mr. Hannon. I try to explain that Mr. Hannon needs me. He can barely walk anymore. I had to do everything this morning, drive the float, wheel the handcart with the bags, sit in the pub, drink lemonade, listen to the men discussing who is the best, Rommel or Montgomery.
She says she's sorry for Mr. Hannon's troubles but we have troubles of our own and the last thing she needs now is a blind son stumbling through the streets of Limerick. Bad enough you nearly died of typhoid, now you want to go blind on top of it.
And I can't stop crying now because this was my one chance to be a man and bring home the money the telegram boy never brought from my father. I can't stop crying because I don't know what Mr. Hannon is going to do on Monday morning when he has no one to help him pull the bags to the edge of the float, to push the bags into the houses. I can't stop crying because of the way he is with that horse he calls sweet because he's so gentle himself and what will the horse do if Mr. Hannon isn't there to take him out, if I'm not there to take him out? Will that horse fall down hungry for the want of oats and hay and the odd apple?
Mam says I shouldn't be crying, it's bad for the eyes. She says, We'll see. That's all I can tell you now. We'll see.
She washes my eyes and gives me sixpence to take Malachy to the Lyric to see Boris Karloff in The Man They Could Not Hang and have two pieces of Cleeves' toffee. It's hard to see the screen with the yellow stuff oozing from my eyes and Malachy has to tell me what's happening. People around us tell him shut up, they'd like to hear what Boris Karloff is saying, and when Malachy talks back to them and tells them he's only helping his blind brother they call the man in charge, Frank Goggin, and he says if he hears another word out of Malachy he'll throw the two of us out.
I don't mind. I have a way of squeezing the stuff out of one eye and clearing it so that I can see the screen while the other eye fills up and I go back and forth, squeeze, look, squeeze, look, and everything I see is yellow.
Monday morning Mrs. Hannon is knocking on our door again. She asks Mam if Frank would ever go down to the coal yard and tell the man in the office that Mr. Hannon can't come in today, that he has to see a doctor
about his legs, that he'll surely be in tomorrow and what he can't deliver today he will tomorrow. Mrs. Hannon always calls me Frank now. Anyone that delivers hundredweights of coal is not a Frankie.
The man in the office says, Humph. I think we're very tolerant with Hannon. You, what's your name?
McCourt, sir.
Tell Hannon we'll need a note from the doctor. Do you understand
that?
I do, sir.
The doctor tells Mr. Hannon he has to go to the hospital or it's a case of gangrene he'll have and the doctor won't be responsible. The ambulance takes Mr. Hannon away and my big job is gone. Now I'll be white like everyone else in Leamy's, no float, no horse, no shillings to bring home to my mother.
In a few days Bridey Hannon comes to our door. She says her mother would like me to come and see her, have a cup of tea with her. Mrs. Hannon is sitting by the fire with her hand on the seat of Mr. Hannon's chair. Sit down, Frank, she says, and when I go to sit on one of the ordinary kitchen chairs she says, No, sit here. Sit here on the chair of himself. Do you know how old he is, Frank?
Oh, he must be very old, Mrs. Hannon. He must be thirty-five.
She smiles. She has lovely teeth. He's forty-nine, Frank, and a man that age shouldn't have legs like that.
He shouldn't, Mrs. Hannon.
Did you know you were a joy to him going around on that float?
I didn't, Mrs. Hannon.
You were. We had two daughters, Bridey that you know, and Kathleen,
the nurse above in Dublin. But no son and he said you gave him the feeling of a son.
I feel my eyes burning and I don't want her to see me crying especially when I don't know why I'm crying. That's all I do lately. Is it the job? Is it Mr. Hannon? My mother says, Oh, your bladder is near your eye.
I think I'm crying because of the quiet way Mrs. Hannon is talking and she's talking like that because of Mr. Hannon.
Like a son, she says, and I'm glad he had that feeling. His working days are over, you know. He has to stay at home from this out. There might be a cure and if there is sure he might be able to get a job as a watchman where he doesn't have to be lifting and hauling.
I won't have a job anymore, Mrs. Hannon.
You have a job, Frank. School. That's your job.
That's not a job, Mrs. Hannon.
You'll never have another job like it, Frank. It breaks Mr.
Hannon's heart to think of you dragging bags of coal off a float and it breaks your mother's heart and 'twill destroy your eyes. God knows I'm sorry I ever got you into this for it had your poor mother caught between your eyes and Mr. Hannon's legs.
Can I go to the hospital to see Mr. Hannon?
They might not let you in but surely you can come here to see him. God knows he won't be doing much but reading and looking out the window.
Mam tells me at home, You shouldn't cry but then again tears are salty and they'll wash the bad stuff from your eyes.

There's a letter from Dad. He's coming home two days before Christmas. He says everything will be different, he's a new man, he hopes we're good boys, obeying our mother, attending to our religious duties, and he's bringing us all something for Christmas.
Mam takes me to the railway station to meet him. The station is always exciting with all the coming and going, people leaning from carriages, crying, smiling, waving good-bye, the train hooting and calling, chugging away in clouds of steam, people sniffling on the platform, the railway tracks silvering into the distance, on to Dublin and the world beyond.
Now it's near midnight and cold on the empty platform. A man in a railway cap asks us if we'd like to wait in a warm place. Mam says, Thank you very much, and laughs when he leads us to the end of the platform where we have to climb a ladder to the signal tower. It takes her a while because she's heavy and she keeps saying, Oh, God, oh, God.
We're above the world and it's dark in the signal tower except for the lights that blink red and green and yellow when the man bends over the board. He says, I'm just having a bit of supper and you're welcome.
Mam says, Ah, no, thanks, we couldn't take your supper from you.
He says, The wife always makes too much for me and if I was up in this tower for a week I wouldn't be able to eat it. Sure it's not hard work looking at lights and pulling on the odd lever.
He takes the top off a flask and pours cocoa into a mug. Here, he says to me, put yourself outside that cocoa.
He hands Mam half a sandwich. Ah, no, she says, surely you could take that home to your children.
I have two sons, missus, and they're off there fighting in the forces of His Majesty, the King of England. One did his bit with Montgomery in Africa and the other is over in Burma or some other bloody place, excuse the language. We get our freedom from England and then we fight her wars. So here, missus, take the bit of sandwich.
Lights on the board are clicking and the man says, Your train is coming, missus.
Thank you very much and Happy Christmas.
Happy Christmas to yourself, missus, and a Happy New Year, too. Mind yourself on that ladder, young fella. Help your mother.
Thank you very much, sir.
We wait again on the platform while the train rumbles into the station. Carriage doors open and a few men with suitcases step to the platform and hurry toward the gate. There is a clanking of milk cans dropped to the platform. A man and two boys are unloading newspapers and magazines.
There is no sign of my father. Mam says he might be asleep in one of the carriages but we know he hardly sleeps even in his own bed. She says the boat from Holyhead might have been late and that would make him miss the train. The Irish Sea is desperate at this time of the year.
He's not coming, Mam. He doesn't care about us. He's just drunk over there in England.
Don't talk about your father like that.
I say no more to her. I don't tell her I wish I had a father like the man in the signal tower who gives you sandwiches and cocoa.
Next day Dad walks in the door. His top teeth are missing and there's a bruise under his left eye. He says the Irish Sea was rough and when he leaned over the side his teeth dropped out. Mam says, It wouldn't be the drink, would it? It wouldn't be a fight?
Och, no, Angela.
Michael says, You said you'd have something for us, Dad.
Oh, I do.
He takes a box of chocolates from his suitcase and hands it to Mam.
She opens the box and shows us the inside where half the chocolates are
gone.
Could you spare it? she says.
She shuts the box and puts it on the mantelpiece. We'll have
chocolates after our Christmas dinner tomorrow.
Mam asks him if he brought any money. He tells her times are hard,
jobs are scarce, and she says, Is it coddin' me you are? There's a war on and there's nothing but jobs in England. You drank the money, didn't you?
You drank the money, Dad.
You drank the money, Dad.
You drank the money, Dad.
We're shouting so loud Alphie begins to cry. Dad says, Och, boys,
now boys. Respect for your father.
He puts on his cap. He has to see a man. Mam says, Go see your man
but don't come drunk to this house tonight singing Roddy McCorley or anything else.
He comes home drunk but he's quiet and passes out on the floor next to Mam's bed.
We have a Christmas dinner next day because of the food voucher Mam got from the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We have sheep's head, cabbage, floury white potatoes, and a bottle of cider because it's Christmas.
Dad says he's not hungry, he'll have tea, borrows a cigarette from Mam. She says, Eat something. It's Christmas.
He tells her again he's not hungry but if no one else wants them he'll eat the sheep's eyes. He says there's great nourishment in the eye and we all make sounds of disgust. He washes them down with his tea and smokes the rest of his Woodbine. He puts on his cap and goes upstairs for his suitcase.
Mam says, Where are you going?
London.
On this day of Our Lord? Christmas Day?
It's the best day for travel. People in motor cars will always give
the workingman a lift to Dublin. They think of the hard times of the Holy Family.
And how will you get on the boat to Holyhead without a penny in your pocket?
The way I came. There's always a time when they're not looking.
He kisses each of us on the forehead, tells us be good boys, obey Mam, say our prayers. He tells Mam he'll write and she says, Oh, yes, the way you always did. He stands before her with his suitcase. She gets up, takes down the box of chocolates and hands them around. She puts a chocolate in her mouth and takes it out again because it's too hard and she can't chew it. I have a soft one and I offer it for the hard one, which will last longer. It's creamy and rich and there's a nut in the middle. Malachy and Michael complain they didn't get a nut and why is it
Frank always gets the nut? Mam says, What do you mean, always? This is the first time we ever had a box of chocolates.
Malachy says, He got the raisin in the bun at school and all the boys said he gave it to Paddy Clohessy, so why couldn't he give us the nut?
Mam says, Because 'tis Christmas and he has sore eyes and the nut is good for the sore eyes.
Michael says, Will the nut make his eyes better?
'Twill.
Will it make one eye better or will it make two eyes better?
The two eyes, I think.
Malachy says, If I had another nut I'd give it to him for his eyes. Mam says, I know you would.
Dad watches us a moment eating our chocolates. He lifts the latch,
goes out the door and pulls it shut.
Mam tells Bridey Hannon, Days are bad but nights are worse and will
this rain ever stop? She tries to ease the bad days by staying in bed and letting Malachy and me light the fire in the morning while she sits up in the bed passing Alphie bits of bread and holding the mug to his mouth for the tea that's in it. We have to go downstairs to Ireland to wash our faces in the basin under the tap and try to dry ourselves in the old damp shirt that hangs over the back of a chair. She makes us stand by the bed to see if we left rings of dirt around our necks and if we did it's back down to the tap and the damp shirt. When there's a hole in a pair of pants she sits up and patches it with any rag she can find. We wear short pants till we're thirteen or fourteen and our long stockings always have holes to be darned. If she has no wool for the darning and the stockings are dark we can blacken our ankles with shoe polish for the respectability that's in it. It's a terrible thing to walk the world with skin showing through the holes of our stockings. When we wear them week after week the holes grow so big we have to pull the stocking forward under the toes so that the hole in the back is hidden in the shoe. On rainy days the stockings are soggy and we have to hang them before the fire at night and hope they'll dry by morning. Then they're hard with dirt cake and we're afraid to pull them on our feet for fear they'll fall on the floor in bits before our eyes. We might be lucky enough to get our stockings on but then we have to block the holes in our shoes and I fight with my brother, Malachy, over any scrap of cardboard or paper in the house. Michael is only six and he has to wait for anything left over unless Mam threatens us from the bed that we're to help our small brother. She says, If ye don't fix yeer brother's shoes an' I have to get out of this bed there will be wigs on the green. You'd have to feel sorry for Michael because he's too old to play with Alphie and too young to play with us and he can't fight with anyone for the same reasons.
The rest of the dressing is easy, the shirt I wore to bed is the shirt I wear to school. I wear it day in day out. It's the shirt for football, for climbing walls, for robbings orchards. I go to Mass and the Confraternity in that shirt and people sniff the air and move away. If Mam gets a docket for a new one at the St. Vincent de Paul the old shirt is promoted to towel and hangs damp on the chair for months or Mam might use bits of it to patch other shirts. She might even cut it up and let Alphie wear it a while before it winds up on the floor pushed against the bottom of the door to block the rain from the lane.
We go to school through lanes and back streets so that we won't meet the respectable boys who go to the Christian Brothers'School or the rich ones who go to the Jesuit school, Crescent College. The Christian Brothers' boys wear tweed jackets, warm woolen sweaters, shirts, ties and shiny new boots. We know they're the ones who will get jobs in the civil service and help the people who run the world. The Crescent College boys wear blazers and school scarves tossed around their necks and over their shoulders to show they're cock o' the walk. They have long hair which falls across their foreheads and over their eyes so that they can toss their quiffs like Englishmen. We know they're the ones who will go to university, take over the family business, run the government, run the world. We'll be the messenger boys on bicycles who deliver their groceries or we'll go to England to work on the building sites. Our sisters will mind their children and scrub their floors unless they go off to England, too. We know that. We're ashamed of the way we look and if boys from the rich schools pass remarks we'll get into a fight and wind up with bloody noses or torn clothes. Our masters will have no patience with us and our fights because their sons go to the rich schools and, Ye have no right to raise your hands to a better class of people so ye don't.
You never know when you might come home and find Mam sitting by the fire chatting with a woman and a child, strangers. Always a woman and child. Mam finds them wandering the streets and if they ask, Could you spare a few pennies, miss? her heart breaks. She never has money so she invites them home for tea and a bit of fried bread and if it's a bad night she'll let them sleep by the fire on a pile of rags in the corner. The bread she gives them always means less for us and if we complain she says there are always people worse off and we can surely spare a little from what we have.
Michael is just as bad. He brings home stray dogs and old men. You never know when you'll find a dog in the bed with him. There are dogs with sores, dogs with no ears, no tails. There's a blind greyhound he found in the park tormented by children. Michael fought off the children, picked up the greyhound that was bigger than himself and told Mam the dog could have his supper. Mam says, What supper? We're lucky if there's a cut of bread in the house. Michael tells her the dog can have his bread. Mam says that dog has to go tomorrow and Michael cries all night and cries worse in the morning when he finds the dog dead in the bed beside him. He won't go to school because he has to dig a grave outside where the stable was and he wants all of us to dig with him and say the rosary. Malachy says it's useless saying prayers for a dog, how do you know he was even a Catholic? Michael says, Of course he was a Catholic dog. Didn't I have him in my arms? He cries so hard over the dog Mam lets us all stay at home from school. We're so delighted we don't mind helping Michael with the grave and we say three Hail Marys. We're not going to stand there wasting a good day off from school saying the rosary for a dead greyhound. Michael is only six but when he brings old men home he manages to get the fire going and give them tea. Mam says it's driving her crazy to come home and find these old men drinking out of her favorite mug and mumbling and scratching by the fire. She tells Bridey Hannon that Michael has a habit of bringing home old men all a bit gone in the head and if he doesn't have a bit of bread for them he knocks on neighbors' doors and has no shame begging for it. In the end she tells
Michael, No more old men. One of them left us with lice and we're plagued.
The lice are disgusting, worse than rats. They're in our heads and ears and they sit in the hollows of our collarbones. They dig into our skin. They get into the seams of our clothes and they're everywhere in the coats we use as blankets. We have to search every inch of Alphie's body because he's a baby and helpless.
The lice are worse than the fleas. Lice squat and suck and we can see our blood through their skins. Fleas jump and bite and they're clean and we prefer them. Things that jump are cleaner than things that squat.
We all agree there will be no more stray women and children, dogs and old men. We don't want any more diseases and infections.
Michael cries.
Grandma's next-door neighbor, Mrs. Purcell, has the only wireless in her lane. The government gave it to her because she's old and blind. I want a radio. My grandmother is old but she's not blind and what's the use of having a grandmother who won't go blind and get a government radio?
Sunday nights I sit outside on the pavement under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to plays on the BBC and Radio Eireann, the Irish station. You can hear plays by O'Casey, Shaw, Ibsen and Shakespeare himself, the best of all, even if he is English. Shakespeare is like mashed potatoes, you can never get enough of him. And you can hear strange plays about Greeks plucking out their eyes because they married their mothers by mistake.
One night I'm sitting under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to Macbeth. Her daughter, Kathleen, sticks her head out the door. Come in, Frankie. My mother says you'll catch the consumption sitting on the ground in this weather.
Ah, no, Kathleen. It's all right.
No. Come in.
They give me tea and a grand cut of bread slathered with blackberry
jam. Mrs. Purcell says, Do you like the Shakespeare, Frankie?
I love the Shakespeare, Mrs. Purcell.
Oh, he's music, Frankie, and he has the best stories in the world.
I don't know what I'd do with meself of a Sunday night if I didn't have the Shakespeare.
When the play finishes she lets me fiddle with the knob on the radio and I roam the dial for distant sounds on the shortwave band, strange whispering and hissing, the whoosh of the ocean coming and going and the Morse Code dit dit dit dot. I hear mandolins, guitars, Spanish bagpipes, the drums of Africa, boatmen wailing on the Nile. I see sailors on watch sipping mugs of hot cocoa. I see cathedrals, skyscrapers, cottages. I see Bedouins in the Sahara and the French Foreign Legion, cowboys on the American prairie. I see goats skipping along the rocky coast of Greece where the shepherds are blind because they married their mothers by mistake. I see people chatting in cafés, sipping wine, strolling on boulevards and avenues. I see night women in doorways, monks chanting vespers, and here is the great boom of Big Ben, This is the BBC Overseas Service and here is the news.
Mrs. Purcell says, Leave that on, Frankie, so we'll know the state of the world.
After the news there is the American Armed Forces Network and it's lovely to hear the American voices easy and cool and here is the music,
oh, man, the music of Duke Ellington himself telling me take the A train to where Billie Holiday sings only to me, I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby.
Oh, Billie, Billie, I want to be in America with you and all that music, where no one has bad teeth, people leave food on their plates, every family has a lavatory, and everyone lives happily ever after.
And Mrs. Purcell says, Do you know what, Frankie?
What, Mrs. Purcell?
That Shakespeare is that good he must have been an Irishman. The rent man is losing his patience. He tells Mam, Four weeks
behind you are, missus. That's one pound two shillings. This has to stop for I have to go back to the office and report to Sir Vincent Nash that the McCourts are a month behind. Where am I then, missus? Out on my arse jobless and a mother to support that's ninety-two and a daily communicant in the Franciscan church. The rent man collects the rents, missus, or he loses the job. I'll be back next week and if you don't have the money, one pound eight shillings and sixpence total, 'tis out on the pavement you'll be with the skies dripping on your furniture.
Mam comes back up to Italy and sits by the fire wondering where in God's name she'll get the money for a week's rent never mind the arrears. She'd love a cup of tea but there's no way of boiling the water till Malachy pulls a loose board off the wall between the two upstairs rooms. Mam says, Well, 'tis off now and we might as well chop it up for the fire. We boil the water and use the rest of the wood for the morning tea but what about tonight and tomorrow and ever after? Mam says, One more board from that wall, one more and not another one. She says that for two weeks till there's nothing left but the beam frame. She warns us we are not to touch the beams for they hold up the ceiling and the house itself.
Oh, we'd never touch the beams.
She goes to see Grandma and it's so cold in the house I take the hatchet to one of the beams. Malachy cheers me on and Michael claps his hands with excitement. I pull on the beam, the ceiling groans and down on Mam's bed there's a shower of plaster, slates, rain. Malachy says, Oh, God, we'll all be killed, and Michael dances around singing, Frankie broke the house, Frankie broke the house.
We run through the rain to tell Mam the news. She looks puzzled with Michael chanting, Frankie broke the house, till I explain there's a hole in the house and it's falling down. She says, Jesus, and runs through the streets with Grandma trying to keep up.
Mam sees her bed buried under plaster and slates and pulls at her hair, What'll we do at all, at all? and screams at me for interfering with the beams. Grandma says, I'll go to the landlord's office and tell them fix this before ye are all drowned entirely.
She's back in no time with the rent man. He says, Great God in heaven, where's the other room?
Grandma says, What room?
I rented ye two rooms up here and one is gone. Where is that room? Mam says, What room?
There were two rooms up here and now there's one. And what happened
to the wall? There was a wall. Now there's no wall. I distinctly remember a wall because I distinctly remember a room. Now where is that wall? Where is that room?
Grandma says, I don't remember a wall and if I don't remember a wall how can I remember a room?
Ye don't remember? Well, I remember. Forty years a landlord's agent and I never seen the likes of this. By God, 'tis a desperate situation altogether when you can't turn your back but tenants are not paying their rent and making walls and rooms disappear on top of it. I want to know where that wall is and what ye did with the room, so I do.
Mam turns to us. Do any of ye remember a wall?
Michael pulls at her hand. Is that the wall we burned in the fire? The rent man says, Dear God in heaven, this beats Banagher, this
takes the bloody biscuit, this is goin' beyond the beyonds. No rent and what am I to tell Sir Vincent below in the office? Out, missus, I'm puttin' ye out. One week from today I'll knock on this door and I want to find nobody at home, everybody out never to return. Do you have me, missus?
Mam's face is tight. 'Tis a pity you weren't alive in the times when the English were evicting us and leaving us on the side of the road.
No lip, missus, or I'll send the men to put ye out tomorrow.
He goes out the door and leaves it open to show what he thinks of us. Mam says, I don't know in God's name what I'm going to do. Grandma says, Well, I don't have room for ye but your cousin, Gerard Griffin, is living out the Rosbrien Road in that little house of his mother's and he'd surely be able to take ye in till better times come. 'Tis all hours of the night but I'll go up and see what he says and Frank can come with me.
She tells me put on a coat but I don't have one and she says, I suppose there's no use in asking if ye have an umbrella either. Come on.
She pulls the shawl over her head and I follow her out the door, up the lane, through the rain to Rosbrien Road nearly two miles away. She knocks on the door of a little cottage in a long row of little cottages. Are you there, Laman? I know you're in there. Open the door.
Grandma, why are you calling him Laman? Isn't his name Gerard?
How would I know? Do I know why the world calls your uncle Pat Ab? Everyone calls this fella Laman. Open the door. We'll go in. He might be working overtime.
She pushes the door. It's dark and there's a damp sweet smell in the room. This room looks like the kitchen and there's a smaller room next to it. There's a little loft above the bedroom with a skylight where the rain is beating. There are boxes everywhere, newspapers, magazines, bits of food, mugs, empty tins. We can see two beds taking up all the space in the bedroom, a great acre of a bed and a smaller one near the window. Grandma pokes at a lump in the big bed. Laman, is that you? Get up, will you, get up.
What? What? What? What?
There's trouble. Angela is gettin' evicted with the children an' 'tis delvin'out of the heavens. They need a bit of shelter till
they get on their feet an' I have no room for them. You can put them up in the loft if you like but that wouldn't do because the small ones wouldn't be able to climb and they'd fall down an' get killed so you go up there an' they can move in here.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
He hoists himself from the bed and there's a whiskey smell. He goes to the kitchen and pulls the table to the wall for his climb to the loft.
Grandma says, That's fine now. Ye can move up here tonight an' ye won't have the eviction men coming after ye.
Grandma tells Mam she's going home. She's tired and drenched and she's not twenty-five anymore. She says there's no need to be taking beds or furniture with all the stuff that's up in Laman Griffin's. We put Alphie in the pram and pile around him the pot, the pan, the kettle, the jam jars and mugs, the Pope, two bolsters and the coats from the beds. We drape the coats over our heads and push the pram through the streets. Mam tells us be quiet going up the lane or the neighbors will know we got the eviction and there will be shame. The pram has a bockety wheel which tilts it and makes it go in different directions. We try to keep it straight and we're having a great time because it must be after midnight and surely Mam won't make us go to school tomorrow. We're moving so far from Leamy's School now maybe we'll never have to go again. Once we get away from the lane Alphie bangs on the pot with the spoon and Michael sings a song he heard in a film with Al Jolson, Swanee, how I love ya, how I love ya, my dear ol'Swanee. He makes us laugh the way he tries to sing in a deep voice like Al Jolson.
Mam says she's glad it's late and there's no one on the streets to see our shame.
Once we get to the house we take Alphie and everything else from the pram so that Malachy and I can run back down to Roden Lane for the trunk. Mam says she'd die if she lost that trunk and everything in it.
Malachy and I sleep at opposite ends of the small bed. Mam takes the big bed with Alphie beside her and Michael at the bottom. Everything is damp and musty and Laman Griffin snores over our heads. There are no stairs in this house and that means no angel ever on the seventh step.
But I'm twelve going on thirteen and I might be too old for angels.
It's still dark when the alarm goes off in the morning and Laman Griffin snorts and blows his nose and hawks the stuff from his chest. The floor creaks under him and when he pisses for ages into the chamber pot we have to stuff our mouths with coats to stop the laughing and Mam hisses at us to be quiet. He grumbles away above us before he climbs down to get his bicycle and bang his way out the door. Mam whispers, The coast is clear, go back to sleep. Ye can stay at home today.
We can't sleep. We're in a new house, we have to pee and we want to explore. The lavatory is outside, about ten steps from the back door, our own lavatory, with a door you can close and a proper seat where you can sit and read squares of the Limerick Leader Laman Griffin left behind for wiping himself. There is a long backyard, a garden with tall grass and weeds, an old bicycle that must have belonged to a giant, tin cans galore, old papers and magazines rotting into the earth, a rusted sewing machine, a dead cat with a rope around his neck that somebody must have thrown over the fence.
Michael gets a notion in his head that this is Africa and keeps asking, Where's Tarzan? Where's Tarzan? He runs up and down the backyard with no pants on trying to imitate Tarzan yodeling from tree to tree. Malachy looks over the fences into the other yards and tells us, They have gardens. They're growing things. We can grow things. We can have our own spuds and everything.
Mam calls from the back door, See if ye can find anything to start the fire in here.
There's a wooden shed built against the back of the house. It's collapsing and surely we could use some of the wood for the fire. Mam is
disgusted with the wood we bring in. She says it's rotten and full of white maggots but beggars can't be choosers. The wood sizzles above the burning paper and we watch the white maggots try to escape. Michael says he feels sorry for the white maggots but we know he's sorry for everything in the world.
Mam tells us this house used to be a shop, that Laman Griffin's mother sold groceries through the little window and that's how she was able to send Laman away to Rockwell College so that he could wind up as an officer in the Royal Navy. Oh, he was, indeed. An officer in the Royal Navy, and here's a picture of him with other officers all having dinner with a famous American film star Jean Harlow. He was never the same after he met Jean Harlow. He fell madly in love with her but what was the use? She was Jean Harlow and he was nothing but an officer in the Royal Navy and it drove him to drink and they threw him out of the Navy. Now look at him, a common laborer for the Electricity Supply Board and a house that's a disgrace. You'd look at this house and never know there was a human being living in it. You can see Laman never moved a thing since his mother died and now we have to clean up so that we can live in this place.
There are boxes packed with bottles of purple hair oil. While Mam is out in the lavatory we open a bottle and smear it on our heads. Malachy says the smell is gorgeous but when Mam comes back she says, What's that horrible stink? and wants to know why our heads are suddenly greasy. She makes us stick our heads under the tap outside and dry ourselves with an old towel pulled out from under a pile of magazines called The Illustrated London News so old they have pictures of Queen Victoria and Prince Edward waving. There are bars of Pear's soap and a thick book called Pear's Encyclopedia, which keeps me up day and night because it tells you everything about everything and that's all I want to know.
There are bottles of Sloan's Liniment, which Mam says will come in handy when we get cramps and pains from the damp. The bottles say, Here's the pain, Where's the Sloan's? There are boxes of safety pins and bags packed with women's hats that crumble when you touch them. There are bags with corsets, garters, women's high button shoes and different laxatives that promise glowing cheeks, bright eyes and a curl in your hair. There are letters from General Eoin O'Duffy to Gerard Griffin, Esq., saying welcome to the ranks of the National Front, the Irish Blueshirts, that it is a privilege to know a man like Gerard Griffin is interested in the movement with his excellent education, his Royal Navy training, his reputation as a great rugby player on the Young Munster team that won the national championship, the Bateman Cup. General O'Duffy is forming an Irish Brigade that will soon sail off to Spain to fight with that great Catholic Generalissimo Franco himself, and Mr. Griffin would be a powerful addition to the Brigade.
Mam says Laman's mother wouldn't let him go. She didn't spend all those years slaving away in a little shop to send him to college so that he could go gallivanting off to Spain for Franco so he stayed at home and got that job digging holes for the poles of the Electricity Supply Board along country roads and his mother was happy to have him home to herself every night but Friday when he drank his pint and moaned over Jean Harlow.
Mam is happy we'll have loads of paper for lighting the fire though the wood we burn from that collapsing shed leaves a sickening smell and she worries the white maggots will escape and breed.
We work all day moving boxes and bags to the shed outside. Mam opens all the windows to air the house and let out the smell of the hair oil and the years of no air. She says it's a relief to be able to see the floor again and now we can sit down and have a nice cup of tea in peace, ease and comfort, and won't it be lovely when the warm weather comes and we might be able to have a garden and sit outside with our tea the way the English do.
Laman Griffin comes home at six every night but Friday, has his tea and goes to bed till next morning. Saturdays he goes to bed at one in the afternoon and stays there till Monday morning. He pulls the kitchen table over to the wall under the loft, climbs up on a chair, pulls the chair up to the table, climbs up on the chair again, catches a leg of the bed, pulls himself up. If he's too drunk on Fridays he makes me climb up for his pillow and blankets and sleeps on the kitchen floor by the fire or falls into bed with me and my brothers and snores and farts all night.
When we first moved in he complained over how he gave up his room downstairs for the loft and he's worn out climbing up and down to go to the lavatory in the backyard. He calls down, Bring the table, the chair, I'm coming down, and we have to clear off the table and pull it to the wall. He's fed up, he's finished with the climbing, he's going to use his mother's lovely chamber pot. He lies in bed all day reading books from the library, smoking Gold Flake cigarettes and throwing Mam a few shillings to send one of us to the shop so that he can have scones with his tea or a nice bit of ham and sliced tomato. Then he calls to Mam, Angela, this chamber pot is full, and she drags chair and table to climb for the chamber pot, empty it in the lavatory outside, rinse it and climb back to the loft. Her face gets tight and she says, Is there anything else your lordship would like this day? and he laughs, Woman's work, Angela, woman's work and free rent.
Laman throws down his library card from the loft and tells me get him two books, one on angling, one on gardening. He writes a note to the librarian to say his legs are killing him from digging holes for the Electricity Supply Board and from now on Frank McCourt will be getting his books. He knows the boy is only thirteen going on fourteen and he knows the rules are strict about allowing children into the adult part of the library but the boy will wash his hands and behave himself and do what he's told, thank you.
The librarian reads the note and says 'tis an awful pity about Mr. Griffin, he's a true gentleman and a man of great learning, you wouldn't believe the books he reads, sometimes four a week, that one day he took home a book in French, French, if you don't mind, on the history of the rudder, the rudder, if you don't mind, she'd give anything for a look inside his head for it must be packed with all sorts of learning, packed, if you don't mind.
She picks out a gorgeous book with colored pictures about English gardens. She says, I know what he likes in the fishing department, and chooses a book called In Search of the Irish Salmon by Brigadier General Hugh Colton. Oh, says the librarian, he reads hundreds of books about English officers fishing in Ireland. I've read some myself out of pure curiosity and you can see why those officers are glad to be in Ireland after all they put up with in India and Africa and other desperate
places. At least the people here are polite. We're known for that, the politeness, not running around throwing spears at people.
Laman lies in the bed, reads his books, talks down from the loft about the day his legs will heal and he'll be out there in the back planting a garden which will be famous far and wide for color and beauty and when he's not gardening he'll be roaming the rivers around Limerick and bringing home salmon that will make your mouth water. His mother left a recipe for salmon that's a family secret and if he had the time and his legs weren't killing him he'd find it someplace in this house. He says now that I'm reliable I can get a book for myself every week but don't be bringing home filth. I want to know what the filth is but he won't tell me so I'll have to find out for myself.
Mam says she wants to join the library too but it's a long walk from Laman's house, two miles, and would I mind getting her a book every week, a romance by Charlotte M. Brame or any other nice writer. She doesn't want any books about English officers looking for salmon or books about people shooting each other. There's enough trouble in the world without reading about people bothering fish and each other.
Grandma caught a chill the night we had the trouble in the house in Roden Lane and the chill turned into pneumonia. They shifted her to the City Home Hospital and now she's dead.
Her oldest son, my uncle Tom, thought he'd go to England to work like other men in the lanes of Limerick but his consumption got worse and he came back to Limerick and now he's dead.
His wife, Galway Jane, followed him, and four of their six children had to be put into orphanages. The oldest boy, Gerry, ran away and joined the Irish army, deserted and crossed to the English army. The oldest girl, Peggy, went to Aunt Aggie and lives in misery.
The Irish army is looking for boys who are musical and would like to train in the Army School of Music. They accept my brother, Malachy, and he goes off to Dublin to be a soldier and play the trumpet.
Now I have only two brothers at home and Mam says her family is disappearing before her very eyes.

Boys from my class at Leamy's School are going on a weekend cycling trip to Killaloe. They tell me I should borrow a bicycle and come. All I need is a blanket, a few spoons of tea and sugar and a few cuts of bread to keep me going. I'll learn to cycle on Laman Griffin's bicycle every night after he goes to bed and he'll surely let me borrow it for the two days in Killaloe.
The best time to ask him for anything is Friday night when he's in a good mood after his night of drinking and his dinner. He brings home the same dinner in his overcoat pockets, a big steak dripping blood, four potatoes, an onion, a bottle of stout. Mam boils the potatoes and fries the steak with sliced onion. He keeps his overcoat on, sits at the table and eats the steak out of his hands. The grease and blood roll down his chin and on to the overcoat where he wipes his hands. He drinks his stout and laughs that there's nothing like a great bloody steak of a Friday night and if that's the worst sin he ever commits he'll float to heaven body and soul, ha ha ha.
Of course you can have my bike, he says. Boy should be able to get out and see the countryside. Of course. But you have to earn it. You can't be getting something for nothing, isn't that right?
'Tis.
And I have a job for you. You don't mind doing a bit of a job, do
you?
I don't.
And you'd like to help your mother?
I would.
Well, now, that very chamber pot is full since this morning. I want
you to climb up and get it and take it to the lavatory and rinse it under the tap abroad and climb back up with it.
I don't want to empty his chamber pot but I dream of cycling miles on the road to Killaloe, fields and sky far from this house, a swim in the Shannon, a night sleeping in a barn. I pull the table and chair to the wall. I climb up and under the bed there's the plain white chamber pot streaked brown and yellow, brimming with piss and shit. I lay it gently at the edge of the loft so that it won't spill, climb down to the chair, reach for the chamber pot, bring it down, turn my face away, hold it while I step down to the table, place it on the chair, step to the floor, take the chamber pot to the lavatory, empty it, and get sick behind the lavatory till I get used to this job.
Laman says I'm a good boy and the bike is mine anytime I want it as long as the chamber pot is empty and I'm there to run to the shop for his cigarettes, go to the library for books and do whatever else he wants. He says, You have a great way with a chamber pot. He laughs and Mam stares into the dead ashes in the fireplace.
It's raining so hard one day, Miss O'Riordan the librarian says, Don't go out in that or you'll ruin the books you're carrying. Sit down over there and behave yourself. You can read all about the saints while you're waiting.
There are four big books, Butler's Lives of the Saints. I don't want to spend my life reading about saints but when I start I wish the rain would last forever. Whenever you see pictures of saints, men or women, they're always looking up to heaven where there are clouds filled with little fat angels carrying flowers or harps giving praise. Uncle Pa Keating says he can't think of a single saint in heaven he'd want to sit down and have a pint with. The saints in these books are different. There are stories about virgins, martyrs, virgin martyrs and they're worse than any horror film at the Lyric Cinema.
I have to look in the dictionary to find out what a virgin is. I know the Mother of God is the Virgin Mary and they call her that because she didn't have a proper husband, only poor old St. Joseph. In the Lives of the Saints the virgins are always getting into trouble and I don't know why. The dictionary says, Virgin, woman (usually a young woman) who is and remains in a state of inviolate chastity.
Now I have to look up inviolate and chastity and all I can find here is that inviolate means not violated and chastity means chaste and that means pure from unlawful sexual intercourse. Now I have to look up intercourse and that leads to intromission, which leads to intromittent, the copulatory organ of any male animal. Copulatory leads to copulation, the union of the sexes in the art of generation and I don't know what that means and I'm too weary going from one word to another in this heavy dictionary which leads me on a wild goose chase from this word to that
word and all because the people who wrote the dictionary don't want the likes of me to know anything.
All I want to know is where I came from but if you ask anyone they tell you ask someone else or send you from word to word.
All these virgin martyrs are told by Roman judges they have to give up their faith and accept the Roman gods but they say, Nay, and the judges have them tortured and killed. My favorite is St. Christina the Astonishing who takes ages to die. The judge says, Cut off her breast, and when they do she throws it at him and he goes deaf dumb and blind. Another judge is brought on the case and he says, Cut off the other breast, and the same thing happens. They try to kill her with arrows but they just bounce off her and kill the soldiers who shot them. They try to boil her in oil but she rocks in the vat and takes a nap for herself. Then the judges get fed up and have her head cut off and that does the job. The feast of St. Christina the Astonishing is the twenty-fourth of July and I think I'll keep that for myself along with the feast of St. Francis of Assisi on the fourth of October. The librarian says, You have to go home now, the rain is stopped, and when I'm going out the door she calls me back. She wants to write a note to my mother and she doesn't mind one bit if I read it. The note says, Dear Mrs. McCourt, Just when you think Ireland is gone to the dogs altogether you find a boy sitting in the library so absorbed in the Lives of the Saints he doesn't realize the rain has stopped and you have to drag him away from the aforesaid Lives. I think, Mrs. McCourt, you might have a future priest on your hands and I will light a candle in hopes it comes true. I remain, Yours truly, Catherine O'Riordan, Asst. Librarian.
Hoppy O'Halloran is the only master in Leamy's National School who ever sits. That's because he's the headmaster or because he has to rest himself from the twisting walk that comes from the short leg. The other masters walk back and forth in the front of the room or up and down the aisles and you never know when you'll get a whack of a cane or a slap of a strap for giving the wrong answer or writing something sloppy. If Hoppy wants to do anything to you he calls you to the front of the room to punish you before three classes.
There are good days when he sits at the desk and talks about America. He says, My boys, from the frozen wastes of North Dakota to the fragrant orange groves of Florida, Americans enjoy all climates. He talks about American history, If the American farmer, with flintlock and musket, could wrest from the English a continent, surely we, warriors ever, can recover our island.
If we don't want him tormenting us with algebra or Irish grammar all we have to do is ask him a question about America and that gets him so excited he might go on for the whole day.
He sits at his desk and recites the tribes and chiefs he loves. Arapaho, Cheyenne, Chippewa, Sioux, Apache, Iroquois. Poetry, my boys, poetry. And listen to the chiefs, Kicking Bear, Rain-in-the-Face, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and the genius, Geronimo.
In seventh class he hands out a small book, a poem that goes on for pages and pages, The Deserted Village, by Oliver Goldsmith. He says that this seems to be a poem about England but it is a lament for the poet's native land, our own native land, Ireland. We are to get this poem by heart, twenty lines a night to be recited every morning. Six boys are called to the front of the room for reciting and if you miss a line you are slapped twice on each hand. He tells us put the books under the desks
and the whole class chants the passage on the schoolmaster in the village.
Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way, With blossomed furze unprofitably gay,
There, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule
The village master taught his little school.
A man severe he was and stern to view, I knew him well, and every truant knew.
Full well the boding tremblers learned to trace The day's disaster in his morning face.
Full well they laughed with counterfeited glee At all his jokes for many a joke had he.
Full well the busy whisper circling round Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned.
He always closes his eyes and smiles when we reach the last lines of the passage, Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught, The love he bore to learning was in fault.
The village all declared how much he knew.
'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too. Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage, And even the story ran that he could gauge.
In arguing, too, the parson owned his skill, For, even though vanquished, he could argue still, While words of learned length and thundering sound Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around.
And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, That one small head could carry all he knew.
We know he loves these lines because they're about a schoolmaster, about him, and he's right because we wonder how one small head could carry all he knows and we will remember him in these lines. He says, Ah, boys, boys, You can make up your own minds but first stock them. Are you listening to me? Stock your minds and you can move through the world resplendent. Clarke, define resplendent.
I think it's shining, sir.
Pithy, Clarke, but adequate. McCourt, give us a sentence with pithy.
Clarke is pithy but adequate, sir.
Adroit, McCourt. You have a mind for the priesthood, my boy, or politics. Think of that.
I will, sir.
Tell your mother come and see me.
I will, sir.
Mam says, No, I could never go near Mr. O'Halloran. I don't have a
decent dress or a proper coat. What does he want to see me for? I don't know.
Well, ask him.
I can't. He'll kill me. If he says bring your mother you have to bring your mother or out comes the stick.
She comes to see him and he talks to her in the hallway. He tells her that her son Frank must continue school. He must not fall into the
messenger boy trap. That leads nowhere. Take him up to the Christian Brothers, tell them I sent you, tell them he is a bright boy and ought to be going to secondary school and beyond that, university.
He tells her he did not become headmaster of Leamy's National School to preside over an academy of messenger boys.
Mam says, Thank you, Mr. O'Halloran.
I wish Mr. O'Halloran would mind his own business. I don't want to go to the Christian Brothers. I want to quit school forever and get a job, get my wages every Friday, go to the pictures on Saturday nights like everyone.
A few days later Mam tells me give my face and hands a good wash, we're going to the Christian Brothers. I tell her I don't want to go, I want to work, I want to be a man. She tells me stop the whining, I'm going to secondary school and we'll all manage somehow. I'm going to school if she has to scrub floors and she'll practice on my face.
She knocks on the door at the Christian Brothers and says she wants to see the superior, Brother Murray. He comes to the door, looks at my mother and me and says, What?
Mam says, This is my son, Frank. Mr. O'Halloran at Leamy's says he's bright and would there be any chance of getting him in here for secondary school?
We don't have room for him, says Brother Murray and closes the door in our faces.
Mam turns away from the door and it's a long silent walk home. She takes off her coat, makes tea, sits by the fire. Listen to me, she says. Are you listening?
I am.
That's the second time a door was slammed in your face by the Church.
Is it? I don't remember.
Stephen Carey told you and your father you couldn't and closed the door in your face. Do you remember that?
I do.
And now Brother Murray slams the door in your face. I don't mind. I want to get a job.
Her face tightens and she's angry. You are never to
be an altar boy
let anybody
slam the door in your face again. Do you hear me?
She starts to cry by the fire, Oh, God, I didn't bring ye into the
world to be a family of messenger boys.
I don't know what to do or say, I'm so relieved I don't have to
stay in school for five or six more years. I'm free.
I'm thirteen going on fourteen and it's June, the last month of school forever. Mam takes me to see the priest, Dr. Cowpar, about getting a job as telegram boy. The supervisor in the post office, Mrs. O'Connell, says, Do you know how to cycle, and I lie that I do. She says I can't start till I'm fourteen so come back in August.
Mr. O'Halloran tells the class it's a disgrace that boys like McCourt, Clarke, Kennedy, have to hew wood and draw water. He is disgusted by this free and independent Ireland that keeps a class system foisted on us by the English, that we are throwing our talented children on the dungheap.
You must get out of this country, boys. Go to America, McCourt. Do you hear me?
I do, sir.
Priests come to the school to recruit us for the foreign missions, Redemptorists, Franciscans, Holy Ghost Fathers, all converting the distant heathen. I ignore them. I'm going to America till one priest catches my attention. He says he comes from the order of the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic Bedouin tribes and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.
I ask for the application.
I will need a letter from the parish priest and a physical examination by my family doctor. The parish priest writes the letter on the spot. He would have been glad to see me go last year. The doctor says, What's this?
That's an application to join the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic tribes of the Sahara and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.
Oh, yeh? French Foreign Legion, is it? Do you know the preferred form of transportation in the Sahara Desert?
Trains?
No. It's the camel. Do you know what a camel is?
It has a hump. It has more than a hump. It has a nasty, mean
disposition and its teeth are green with gangrene and it bites. Do you know where it bites?
In the Sahara?
No, you omadhaun. It bites your shoulder, rips it right off. Leaves you standing there tilted in the Sahara. How would you like that, eh? And what class of a spectacle you'd be strolling down the street, lopsided in Limerick. What girl in her right mind will look at an ex-White Father with one miserable scrawny shoulder? And look at your eyes. They're bad enough here in Limerick. In the Sahara they'll fester and rot and fall out of your head. How old are you?
Thirteen.
Go home to your mother.
It's not our house and we don't feel free in it the way we did in
Roden Lane, up in Italy or down in Ireland. When Laman comes home he wants to read in his bed or sleep and we have to be quiet. We stay in the streets till after dark and when we come inside there's nothing to do but go to bed and read a book if we have a candle or paraffin oil for the lamp.
Mam tells us go to bed, she'll be after us in a minute as soon as she climbs to the loft with Laman's last mug of tea. We often fall asleep before she goes up but there are nights we hear them talking, grunting, moaning. There are nights when she never comes down and Michael and Alphie have the big bed to themselves. Malachy says she stays up there because it's too hard for her to climb down in the dark.
He's only twelve and he doesn't understand.
I'm thirteen and I think they're at the excitement up there.
I know about the excitement and I know it's a sin but how can it be
a sin if it comes to me in a dream where American girls pose in swimming suits on the screen at the Lyric Cinema and I wake up pushing and pumping? It's a sin when you're wide awake and going at yourself the way the boys talked about it in Leamy's schoolyard after Mr. O'Dea roared the Sixth Commandment at us, Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery, which means impure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, and that's what adultery is, Dirty Things in General.
One Redemptorist priest barks at us all the time about the Sixth Commandment. He says impurity is so grave a sin the Virgin Mary turns her face away and weeps.
And why does she weep, boys? She weeps because of you and what you are doing to her Beloved Son. She weeps when she looks down the long dreary vista of time and beholds in horror the spectacle of Limerick boys defiling themselves, polluting themselves, interfering with themselves, abusing themselves, soiling their young bodies, which are the temples of the Holy Ghost. Our Lady weeps over these abominations knowing that every time you interfere with yourself you nail to the cross her Beloved Son, that once more you hammer into His dear head the crown of thorns, that you reopen those ghastly wounds. In an agony of thirst He hangs on the cross and what is He offered by those perfidious Romans? A lavatory sponge plunged into vinegar and gall and thrust into His poor mouth, a mouth that moves rarely except to pray, to pray even for you, boys, even for you who nailed Him to that cross. Consider Our Lord's suffering. Consider the crown of thorns. Consider a small pin driven into your skull, the agony of the piercing. Consider then twenty thorns driven into your head. Reflect, meditate on the nails tearing His hands, His feet. Could you endure a fraction of that agony? Take that pin again, that mere pin. Force it into your side. Enlarge that sensation a hundredfold and you are penetrated by that awful lance. Oh, boys, the devil wants your souls. He wants you with him in hell and know this, that every time you interfere with yourself, every time you succumb to the vile sin of self- abuse you not only nail Christ to the cross you take another step closer to hell itself. Retreat from the abyss, boys. Resist the devil and keep your hands to yourself.
I can't stop interfering with myself. I pray to the Virgin Mary and tell her I'm sorry I put her Son back on the cross and I'll never do it again but I can't help myself and swear I'll go to confession and after that, surely after that, I'll never never do it again. I don't want to go to hell with devils chasing me for eternity jabbing me with hot pitchforks.
The priests of Limerick have no patience with the likes of me. I go to confession and they hiss that I'm not in a proper spirit of repentance, that if I were I'd give up this hideous sin. I go from church to church looking for an easy priest till Paddy Clohessy tells me there's one in the Dominican church who's ninety years old and deaf as a turnip. Every few weeks the old priest hears my confession and mumbles that I should pray for him. Sometimes he falls asleep and I don't have the heart to wake him up so I go to Communion the next day without penance or absolution. It's not my fault if priests fall asleep on me and surely I'm in a state of grace just for going to confession. Then one day the little panel in the confession box slides back and it's not my man at all, it's a young priest with a big ear like a seashell. He'll surely hear everything.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession.
And what have you done since then, my child?
I hit my brother, I went on the mooch from school, I lied to my mother.
Yes, my child, and what else?
I – I - I did dirty things, Father.
Ah, my child, was that with yourself or with another or with some class of beast?
Some class of beast. I never heard of a sin like that before. This priest must be from the country and if he is he's opening up new worlds to me.
The night before I'm to go to Killaloe Laman Griffin comes home drunk and eats a great bag of fish and chips at the table. He tells Mam boil water for tea and when she says she has no coal or turf he yells at her and calls her a great lump living free under his roof with her pack of brats. He throws money at me to go to the shop for a few sods of turf and wood for kindling. I don't want to go. I want to hit him for the way he treats my mother but if I say anything he won't let me have the bicycle tomorrow after I've waited three weeks.
When Mam gets the fire going and boils the water I remind him of his promise to loan me the bike.
Did you empty the chamber pot today?
Oh, I forgot. I'll do it this minute.
He shouts, You didn't empty my damn chamber pot. I promise you the
bike. I give you tuppence a week to run messages for me and empty the chamber pot and you stand there with your thick gob hanging out and tell me you didn't do it.
I'm sorry. I forgot. I'll do it now.
You will, will you? And how do you think you'll get up to the loft? Are you going to pull the table out from under my fish and chips?
Mam says, Sure, he was at school all day and he had to go to the doctor for his eyes.
Well, you can bloody well forget about the bicycle. You didn't live up to the bargain.
But he couldn't do it, says Mam.
He tells her shut up and mind her own business and she goes quiet by the fire. He goes back to his fish and chips but I tell him again, You promised me. I emptied that chamber pot and did your messages for three weeks.
Shut up and go to bed.
You can't tell me go to bed. You're not my father, and you promised
me.
I'm telling you, as sure as God made little apples, that if I get
up from this table you'll be calling for your patron saint. You promised me.
He pushes the chair back from the table. He stumbles toward me and sticks his finger between my eyes. I'm telling you shut your gob, scabby
eyes.
I won't. You promised me.
He punches my shoulders and when I won't stop moves to my head. My
mother jumps up, crying, and tries to pull him away. He punches and kicks me into the bedroom but I keep saying, You promised me. He knocks me to my mother's bed and punches till I cover my face and head with my arms.
I'll kill you, you little shit.
Mam is screaming and pulling at him till he falls backward into the kitchen. She says, Come on, oh, come on. Eat your fish and chips. He's only a child. He'll get over it. I hear him go back to his chair and pull it to the table.
I hear him snuffle and slurp when he eats and drinks. Hand me the matches, he says. By Jesus, I need a fag after that. There's a put-put sound when he puffs on the cigarette and a whimper from my mother.
He says, I'm going to bed, and with the drink in him it takes him a while to climb the chair to the table, pull up the chair, climb to the loft. The bed squeaks under him and he grunts when he pulls off his boots and drops them to the floor.
I can hear Mam crying when she blows into the globe of the paraffin oil lamp and everything goes dark. After what happened she'll surely want to get into her own bed and I'm ready to go to the small one against the wall. Instead, there's the sound of her climbing the chair, the table, the chair, crying up into the loft and telling Laman Griffin, He's only a boy, tormented with his eyes, and when Laman says, He's a little shit and I want him out of the house, she cries and begs till there's whispering and grunting and moaning and nothing.
In awhile they're snoring in the loft and my brothers are asleep around me. I can't stay in this house for if Laman Griffin comes at me again I'll take a knife to his neck. I don't know what to do or where to go.
I leave the house and follow the streets from the Sarsfield Barracks to the Monument Café. I dream of how I'll get back at Laman some day. I'll go to America and see Joe Louis. I'll tell him my troubles and he'll understand because he comes from a poor family. He'll show me how to build up my muscles, how to hold my hands and use my feet. He'll show me how to dig my chin into my shoulder the way he does and how to let go with a right uppercut that will send Laman flying. I'll drag Laman to the graveyard at Mungret where his family and Mam's family are buried and I'll cover him with earth all the way to his chin so that he won't be able to move and he'll beg for his life and I'll say, End of the road, Laman, you're going to meet your Maker, and he'll beg and beg while I trickle dirt on his face till it's covered completely and he's gasping and asking God for forgiveness for not giving me the bike and punching me all over the house and doing the excitement with my mother and I'll be laughing away because he's not in a state of grace after the excitement and he's going to hell as sure as God made little apples as he used to say himself.
The streets are dark and I have to keep an eye out in case I might be lucky like Malachy long ago and find fish and chips dropped by drunken soldiers. There's nothing on the ground. If I find my uncle, Ab Sheehan, he might give me some of his Friday night fish and chips, but they tell me in the café he came and went already. I'm thirteen now so I don't call him Uncle Pat anymore. I call him Ab or The Abbot like everybody else. Surely if I go to Grandma's house he'll give me a piece of bread or something and maybe he'll let me stay the night. I can tell him I'll be working in a few weeks delivering telegrams and getting big tips at the post office and ready to pay my own way.
He's sitting up in bed finishing his fish and chips, dropping to the floor the Limerick Leader they were wrapped in, wiping his mouth and hands with the blanket. He looks at me, That face is all swole. Did you fall on that face?
I tell him I did because there's no use telling him anything else. He wouldn't understand. He says, You can stay in me mother's bed tonight. You can't walk the streets with that face and them two red eyes in your head.
He says there's no food in the house, not a scrap of bread, and when he falls asleep I take the greasy newspaper from the floor. I lick the front page, which is all advertisements for films and dances in the city. I lick the headlines. I lick the great attacks of Patton and Montgomery in France and Germany. I lick the war in the Pacific. I lick the obituaries and the sad memorial poems, the sports pages, the market prices of eggs butter and bacon. I suck the paper till there isn't a smidgen of grease.
I wonder what I'll do tomorrow.
XIV
In the morning The Abbot gives me the money to go to Kathleen O'Connell's for bread, margarine, tea, milk. He boils water on the gas ring and tells me I can have a mug of tea and, Go aisy with the sugar, I'm not a millionaire. You can have a cut o' bread but don't make it too thick.
It's July and school is over forever. In a few weeks I'll be delivering telegrams at the post office, working like a man. In the weeks I'm idle I can do anything I like, get up in the morning, stay in bed, take long walks out the country like my father, wander around Limerick. If I had the money I'd go over to the Lyric Cinema, eat sweets, see Errol Flynn conquering everyone in sight. I can read the English and Irish papers The Abbot brings home or I can use the library cards of Laman Griffin and my mother till I'm found out.
Mam sends Michael with a milk bottle of warm tea, a few cuts of bread smeared with dripping, a note to say Laman Griffin isn't angry anymore and I can come back. Michael says, Are you coming home, Frankie?
No.
Ah, do, Frankie. Come on.
I live here now. I'm never going back.
But Malachy is gone to the army and you're here and I have no big
brother. All the boys have big brothers and I only have Alphie. He's not even four and can't talk right.
I can't go back. I'm never going back. You can come here any time you like.
His eyes glint with tears and that gives me such a pain in my heart I want to say, All right, I'll come with you. I'm only saying that. I know I'll never be able to face Laman Griffin again and I don't know if I can look at my mother. I watch Michael go up the lane with the sole of his shoe broken and clacking along the pavement. When I start that job at the post office I'll buy him shoes so I will. I'll give him an egg and take him to the Lyric Cinema for the film and the sweets and then we'll go to Naughton's and eat fish and chips till our bellies are sticking out a mile. I'll get money some day for a house or a flat with electric light and a lavatory and beds with sheets blankets pillows like the rest of the world. We'll have breakfast in a bright kitchen with flowers dancing in a garden beyond, delicate cups and saucers, eggcups, eggs soft in the yolk and ready to melt the rich creamery butter, a teapot with a cozy on it, toast with butter and marmalade galore. We'll take our time and listen to music from the BBC or the American Armed Forces Network. I'll buy proper clothes for the whole family so our arses won't be hanging out of our pants and we won't have the shame. The thought of the shame brings a pain
in my heart and starts me sniffling. The Abbot says, What's up with you? Didn't you have your bread? Didn't you have your tay? What more do you want? 'Tis an egg you'll be lookin' for next.
There's no use talking to someone who was dropped on his head and sells papers for a living.
He complains he can't be feeding me forever and I'll have to get my own bread and tea. He doesn't want to come home and find me reading in the kitchen with the electric lightbulb blazing away. He can read numbers so he can and when he goes out to sell papers he reads the electric meter so he'll know how much I used and if I don't stop turning on that light he'll take the fuse out and carry it in his pocket and if I put another fuse in he'll have the electricity pulled out altogether and go back to gas, which was good enough for his poor dead mother and will surely suit him for all he does is sit up in the bed to eat his fish and chips and count his money before he goes to sleep.
I get up early like Dad and go on long walks into the country. I walk around the graveyard in the old abbey at Mungret where my mother's relations are buried and I go up the boreen to the Norman castle at Carrigogunnell where Dad brought me twice. I climb to the top and Ireland is spread out before me, the Shannon shining its way to the Atlantic. Dad told me this castle was built hundreds of years ago and if you wait for the larks to stop their singing over there you can hear the Normans below hammering and talking and getting ready for battle. Once he brought me here in the dark so that we could hear Norman and Irish voices down through the centuries and I heard them. I did.
Sometimes I'm up there alone on the heights of Carrigogunnell and there are voices of Norman girls from olden times laughing and singing in French and when I see them in my mind I'm tempted and I climb to the very top of the castle where once there was a tower and there in full view of Ireland I interfere with myself and spurt all over Carrigogunnell and fields beyond.
That's a sin I could never tell a priest. Climbing to great heights and going at yourself before all of Ireland is surely worse than doing it in a private place with yourself or with another or with some class of a beast. Somewhere down there in the fields or along the banks of the Shannon a boy or a milkmaid might have looked up and seen me in my sin and if they did I'm doomed because the priests are always saying that anyone who exposes a child to sin will have a millstone tied around his neck and be cast into the sea.
Still, the thought of someone watching me brings on the excitement again. I wouldn't want a small boy to be watching me. No, no, that would surely lead to the millstone, but if there was a milkmaid gawking up she'd surely get excited and go at herself though I don't know if girls can go at themselves when they don't have anything to go at. No equipment, as Mikey Molloy used to say.
I wish that old deaf Dominican priest would come back so that I could tell him my troubles with the excitement but he's dead now and I'll have to face a priest who'll go on about the millstone and the doom.
Doom. That's the favorite word of every priest in Limerick.
I walk back along O'Connell Avenue and Ballinacurra where people have their bread and milk delivered early to their doorsteps and surely there's no harm if I borrow a loaf or a bottle with every intention of giving it back when I get my job at the post office. I'm not stealing, I'm borrowing, and that's not a mortal sin. Besides, I stood on top of a
castle this morning and committed a sin far worse than stealing bread and milk and if you commit one sin you might as well commit a few more because you get the same sentence in hell. One sin, eternity. A dozen sins, eternity.
Might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, as my mother would say. I drink the odd pint of milk and leave the bottle so that the milkman won't be blamed for not delivering. I like milkmen because one of them gave me two broken eggs which I swallowed raw with bits of shells and all. He said I'd grow up powerful if I had nothing else but two eggs in a pint of porter every day. Everything you need is in the egg and everything you want is in the pint.
Some houses get better bread than others. It costs more and that's what I take. I feel sorry for the rich people who will get up in the morning and go to the door and find their bread missing but I can't let myself starve to death. If I starve I'll never have the strength for my telegram boy job at the post office, which means I'll have no money to put back all that bread and milk and no way of saving to go to America and if I can't go to America I might as well jump into the River Shannon. It's only a few weeks till I get my first wages in the post office and surely these rich people won't collapse with the hunger till then. They can always send the maid out for more. That's the difference between the poor and the rich. The poor can't send out for more because there's no money to send out for more and if there was they wouldn't have a maid to send. It's the maids I have to worry about. I have to be careful when I borrow the milk and the bread and they're at the front doors polishing knobs, knockers and letter boxes. If they see me they'll be running to the woman of the house, Oh, madam, madam, there's an urchin beyant that's makin' off with all the milk and bread.
Beyant. Maids talk like that because they're all from the country, Mullingar heifers, says Paddy Clohessy's uncle, beef to the heels, and they wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.
I bring home the bread and even if The Abbot is surprised he doesn't say, Where did you get it? because he was dropped on his head and that knocks the curiosity out of you. He just looks at me with his big eyes that are blue in the middle and yellow all around and slurps his tea from the great cracked mug his mother left behind. He tells me, That's me mug and don't be drinkin' your tay oush of ish.
Oush of ish. That's the Limerick slum talk that always worried Dad. He said, I don't want my sons growing up in a Limerick lane saying, Oush of ish. It's common and low-class. Say out of it properly.
And Mam said, I hope it keeps fine for you but you're not doing much to get us oush of ish.
Out beyond Ballinacurra I climb orchard walls for apples. If there's a dog I move on because I don't have Paddy Clohessy's way of talking to them. Farmers come at me but they're always slow in their rubber boots and even if they jump on a bicycle to chase me I jump over walls where they can't take a bike.
The Abbot knows where I got the apples. If you grow up in the lanes of Limerick you're bound to rob the odd orchard sooner or later. Even if you hate apples you have to rob orchards or your pals will say you're a sissy.
I always offer The Abbot an apple but he won't eat it because of the scarcity of teeth in his head. He has five left and he won't risk leaving them in an apple. If I cut the apple into slices he still won't
eat it because that's not the proper way to eat an apple. That's what he says and if I say, You slice bread before you eat it, don't you? he says, Apples is apples and bread is bread.
That's how you talk when you're dropped on your head.
Michael comes again with warm tea in a milk bottle and two cuts of fried bread. I tell him I don't need it anymore. Tell Mam I'm taking care of myself and I don't need her tea and fried bread, thank you very much. Michael is delighted when I give him an apple and I tell him come every second day and he can have more. That stops him from asking me to go back to Laman Griffin's and I'm glad it stops his tears.
There's a market down in Irishtown where the farmers come on Saturdays with their vegetables, hens, eggs, butter. If I'm there early they'll give me a few pennies for helping unload their carts or motor cars. At the end of the day they'll give me vegetables they can't sell, anything crushed, bruised or rotten in parts. One farmer's wife always gives me cracked eggs and tells me, Fry them eggs tomorrow when you come back from Mass in a state of grace for if you ate them eggs with a sin on your sowl they'll stick in your gullet, so they will.
She's a farmer's wife and that's how they talk.
I'm not much better than a beggar now myself the way I stand at the doors of fish and chip shops when they're closing in hopes they might have burnt chips left over or bits of fish floating around in the grease. If they're in a hurry the shop owners will give me the chips and a sheet of paper for wrapping.
The paper I like is the News of the World. It's banned in Ireland but people sneak it in from England for the shocking pictures of girls in swimming suits that are almost not there. Then there are stories of people committing all kinds of sins you wouldn't find in Limerick, getting divorces, committing adultery.
Adultery. I still have to find out what that word means, look it up in the library. I'm sure it's worse than what the masters taught us, bad thoughts, bad words, bad deeds. I take my chips home and get into bed like The Abbot. If he has a few pints taken he sits up eating his chips from the Limerick Leader and singing ""The Road to Rasheen. "" I eat my chips. I lick the News of the World. I lick the stories about people doing shocking things. I lick the girls in their bathing suits and when there's nothing left to lick I look at the girls till The Abbot blows out the light and I'm committing a mortal sin under the blanket.
I can go to the library any time with Mam's card or Laman Griffin's. I'll never be caught because Laman is too lazy to get out of bed on a Saturday and Mam will never go near a library with the shame of her clothes.
Miss O'Riordan smiles. The Lives of the Saints are waiting for you, Frank. Volumes and volumes. Butler, O'Hanlon, Baring Gould. I've told the head librarian all about you and she's so pleased she's ready to give you your own grown-up card. Isn't that wonderful?
Thanks, Miss O'Riordan.
I'm reading all about St. Brigid, virgin, February first. She was so beautiful that men from all over Ireland panted to marry her and her father wanted her to marry someone important. She didn't want to marry anyone so she prayed to God for help and He caused her eye to melt in her head so that it dribbled down her cheek and left such a great welt the men of Ireland lost interest.
Then there's St. Wilgefortis, virgin martyr, July twentieth. Her mother had nine children, all at the same time, four sets of twins and Wilgefortis the odd one, all winding up martyrs for the faith. Wilgefortis was beautiful and her father wanted to marry her off to the King of Sicily. Wilgefortis was desperate and God helped her by allowing a beard and a mustache to grow on her face, which made the King of Sicily think twice but sent her father into such a rage he had her crucified beard and all.
St. Wilgefortis is the one you pray to if you're an Englishwoman with a troublesome husband.
The priests never tell us about virgin martyrs like St. Agatha, February fifth. February is a powerful month for virgin martyrs. Sicilian pagans ordered Agatha to give up her faith in Jesus and like all the virgin martyrs she said, Nay. They tortured her, stretched her on the rack, tore her sides with iron hooks, burned her with blazing torches, and she said, Nay, I will not deny Our Lord. They crushed her breasts and cut them off but when they rolled her over hot coals it was more than she could bear so she expired, giving praise.
Virgin martyrs always died singing hymns and giving praise not minding one bit if lions tore big chunks from their sides and gobbled them on the spot.
How is it the priests never told us about St. Ursula and her eleven thousand maiden martyrs, October twenty-first? Her father wanted her to marry a pagan king but she said, I'll go away for awhile, three years, and think about it. So off she goes with her thousand noble ladies-in- waiting and their companions, ten thousand. They sailed around for awhile and traipsed through various countries till they stopped in Cologne where the chief of the Huns asked Ursula to marry him. Nay, she said, and the Huns killed her and the maidens with her. Why couldn't she say yes and save the lives of eleven thousand virgins? Why did virgin martyrs have to be so stubborn?
I like St. Moling, an Irish bishop. He didn't live in a palace like the bishop of Limerick. He lived in a tree and when other saints visited him for dinner they would sit around on branches like birds having a grand time with their water and dry bread. He was walking along one day and a leper said, Hoy, St. Moling, where are you going? I'm going to Mass, says St. Moling. Well, I'd like to go to Mass too, so why don't you hoist me up on your back and carry me? St. Moling did but he no sooner had the leper up on his back than the leper started to complain. Your hair shirt, he said, is hard on my sores, take it off. St. Moling took off the shirt and off they went again. Then the leper says, I need to blow my nose. St. Moling says, I don't have any class of a handkerchief, use your hand. The leper says, I can't hold on to you and blow my nose at the same time. All right, says St. Moling, you can blow into my hand. That won't do, says the leper, I barely have a hand left with the leprosy and I can't hold on and blow into your hand. If you were a proper saint you'd twist around here and suck the stuff out of my head. St. Moling didn't want to suck the leper's snot but he did and offered it up and praised God for the privilege.
I could understand my father sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head when he was a baby and desperate but I don't understand why God wanted St. Moling to go around sucking the snot out of lepers' heads. I don't understand God at all and even if I'd like to be a saint and have
everyone adore me I'd never suck the snot of a leper. I'd like to be a saint but if that's what you have to do I think I'll stay the way I am.
Still, I'm ready to spend my life in this library reading about virgins and virgin martyrs till I get into trouble with Miss O'Riordan over a book someone left on the table. The author is Lin Yütang. Anyone can tell this is a Chinese name and I'm curious to know what the Chinese talk about. It's a book of essays about love and the body and one of his words sends me to the dictionary. Turgid. He says, The male organ of copulation becomes turgid and is inserted into the receptive female orifice.
Turgid. The dictionary says swollen and that's what I am, standing there looking at the dictionary because I know now what Mikey Molloy was talking about all along, that we're no different from the dogs that get stuck in each other in the streets and it's shocking to think of all the mothers and fathers doing the likes of this.
My father lied to me for years about the Angel on the Seventh Step.
Miss O'Riordan wants to know what word I'm looking for. She always looks worried when I'm at the dictionary so I tell her I'm looking for canonize or beatific or any class of a religious word.
And what's this? she says. This is not the Lives of the Saints.
She picks up Lin Yütang and starts reading the page where I left the book face down on the table.
Mother o' God. Is this what you were reading? I saw this in your hand.
Well, I-I-only wanted to see if the Chinese, if the Chinese, ah, had any saints.
Oh, indeed, you did. This is disgraceful. Filth. No wonder the Chinese are the way they are. But what could you expect of slanty eyes and yellow skin and you, now that I look at you, have a bit of the slanty eye yourself. You are to leave this library at once.
But I'm reading the Lives of the Saints.
Out or I'll call the head librarian and she'll have the guards on you. Out. You should be running to the priest and confessing your sins. Out, and before you go hand me the library cards of your poor mother and Mr. Griffin. I have a good mind to write to your poor mother and I would if I thought it wouldn't destroy her entirely. Lin Yütang, indeed. Out.
There's no use trying to talk to librarians when they're in that state. You could stand there for an hour telling them all you've read about Brigid and Wilgefortis and Agatha and Ursula and the maiden martyrs but all they think about is one word on one page of Lin Yütang.
The People's Park is behind the library. It's a sunny day, the grass is dry, and I'm worn out begging for chips and putting up with librarians who get into a state over turgid and I'm looking at the clouds drifting above the monument and drifting off myself all turgid till I'm having a dream about virgin martyrs in bathing suits in the News of the World pelting Chinese writers with sheeps' bladders and I wake up in a state of excitement with something hot and sticky pumping out of me oh God my male organ of copulation sticking out a mile people in the park giving me curious looks and mothers telling their children come over here love come away from that fella someone should call the guards on him.
The day before my fourteenth birthday I see myself in the glass in Grandma's sideboard. The way I look how can I ever start my job at the post office. Everything is torn, shirt, gansey, short pants, stockings, and my shoes are ready to fall off my feet entirely. Relics of oul'
decency, my mother would call them. If my clothes are bad I'm worse. No matter how I drench my hair under the tap it sticks out in all directions. The best cure for standing up hair is spit, only it's hard to spit on your own head. You have to let go with a good one up in the air and duck to catch it on your poll. My eyes are red and oozing yellow, there are matching red and yellow pimples all over my face and my front teeth are so black with rot I'll never be able to smile in my life.
I have no shoulders and I know the whole world admires shoulders. When a man dies in Limerick the women always say, Grand man he was, shoulders that big and wide he wouldn't come in the door for you, had to come in sideways. When I die they'll say, Poor little divil, died without a sign of a shoulder. I wish I had some sign of a shoulder so that people would know I was at least fourteen years of age. All the boys in Leamy's had shoulders except for Fintan Slattery and I don't want to be like him with no shoulders and knees worn away from prayer. If I had any money left I'd light a candle to St. Francis and ask him if there's any chance God could be persuaded to perform a miracle on my shoulders. Or if I had a stamp I could write to Joe Louis and say, Dear Joe, Is there any chance you could tell me where you got your powerful shoulders even though you were poor?
I have to look decent for my job so I take off all my clothes and stand naked in the backyard washing them under the tap with a bar of carbolic soap. I hang them on Grandma's clothesline, shirt, gansey, pants, stockings, and pray to God it won't rain, pray they'll be dry for tomorrow, which is the start of my life.
I can't go anywhere in my pelt so I stay in bed all day reading old newspapers, getting excited with the girls in the News of the World and thanking God for the drying sun. The Abbot comes home at five and makes tea downstairs and even though I'm hungry I know he'll grumble if I ask him for anything. He knows the one thing that worries me is he might go to Aunt Aggie and complain I'm staying in Grandma's house and sleeping in her bed and if Aunt Aggie hears that she'll come over and throw me into the street.
He hides the bread when he's finished and I can never find it. You would think that one who was never dropped on his head would be able to find the hidden bread of one who was dropped on his head. Then I realize if the bread is not in the house he must take it with him in the pocket of the overcoat he wears winter and summer. The minute I hear him clumping from the kitchen to the backyard lavatory I run downstairs, pull the loaf from the pocket, cut off a thick slice, back into the pocket, up the stairs and into bed. He can never say a word, never accuse me. You'd have to be a thief of the worst class to steal one slice of bread and no one would ever believe him, not even Aunt Aggie. Besides, she'd bark at him and say, What are you doing anyway going around with a loaf of bread in your pocket? That's no place for a loaf of bread.
I chew the bread slowly. One mouthful every fifteen minutes will make it last and if I wash it down with water the bread will swell in my belly and give me the full feeling.
I look out the back window to make sure the evening sun is drying my clothes. Other backyards have lines with clothes that are bright and colorful and dance in the wind. Mine hang from the line like dead dogs.
The sun is bright but it's cold and damp in the house and I wish I had something to wear in the bed. I have no other clothes and if I touch anything of The Abbot's he'll surely run to Aunt Aggie. All I can find in
the wardrobe is Grandma's old black woolen dress. You're not supposed to wear your Grandmother's old dress when she's dead and you're a boy but what does it matter if it keeps you warm and you're in bed under the blankets where no one will ever know. The dress has the smell of old dead grandmother and I worry she might rise from the grave and curse me before the whole family and all assembled. I pray to St. Francis, ask him to keep her in the grave where she belongs, promise him a candle when I start my job, remind him the robe he wore himself wasn't too far from a dress and no one ever tormented him over it and fall asleep with the image of his face in my dream.
The worst thing in the world is to be sleeping in your dead grandmother's bed wearing her black dress when your uncle The Abbot falls on his arse outside South's pub after a night of drinking pints and people who can't mind their own business rush to Aunt Aggie's house to tell her so that she gets Uncle Pa Keating to help her carry The Abbot home and upstairs to where you're sleeping and she barks at you, What are you doin' in this house, in that bed? Get up and put on the kettle for tea for your poor uncle Pat that fell down, and when you don't move she pulls the blankets and falls backward like one seeing a ghost and yelling Mother o' God what are you doin' in me dead mother's dress?
That's the worst thing of all because it's hard to explain that you're getting ready for the big job in your life, that you washed your clothes, they're drying abroad on the line, and it was so cold you had to wear the only thing you could find in the house, and it's even harder to talk to Aunt Aggie when The Abbot is groaning in the bed, Me feet is like a fire, put water on me feet, and Uncle Pa Keating is covering his mouth with his hand and collapsing against the wall laughing and telling you that you look gorgeous and black suits you and would you ever straighten your hem. You don't know what to do when Aunt Aggie tells you, Get out of that bed and put the kettle on downstairs for tea for your poor uncle. Should you take off the dress and put on a blanket or should you go as you are? One minute she's screaming, What are you doin' in me poor mother's dress? the next she's telling you put on that bloody kettle. I tell her I washed my clothes for the big job.
What big job?
Telegram boy at the post office.
She says if the post office is hiring the likes of you they must be
in a desperate way altogether, go down and put on that kettle.
The next worse thing is to be out in the backyard filling the
kettle from the tap with the moon beaming away and Kathleen Purcell from next door perched up on the wall looking for her cat. God, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' in your grandmother's dress? and you have to stand there in the dress with the kettle in your hand and explain how you washed your clothes which are hanging there on the line for all to see and you were so cold in the bed you put on your grandmother's dress and your uncle Pat, The Abbot, fell down and was brought home by Aunt Aggie and her husband, Pa Keating, and she drove you into the backyard to fill this kettle and you'll take off this dress as soon as ever your clothes are dry because you never had any desire to go through life in your dead grandmother's dress.
Now Kathleen Purcell lets out a scream, falls off the wall, forgets the cat, and you can hear her giggling into her blind mother, Mammy, Mammy, wait till I tell you about Frankie McCourt abroad in the backyard in his dead grandmother's dress. You know that once Kathleen Purcell gets
a bit of scandal the whole lane will know it before morning and you might as well stick your head out the window and make a general announcement about yourself and the dress problem.
By the time the kettle boils The Abbot is asleep from the drink and Aunt Aggie says she and Uncle Pa will have a drop of tea themselves and she doesn't mind if I have a drop myself. Uncle Pa says on second thought the black dress could be the cassock of a Dominican priest and he goes down on his knees and says, Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Aunt Aggie says, Get up, you oul' eejit, and stop makin' a feck of religion. Then she says, And you what are you doin' in this house?
I can't tell her about Mam and Laman Griffin and the excitement in the loft. I tell her I was thinking of staying here a while because of the great distance from Laman Griffin's house to the post office and as soon as I get on my feet we'll surely find a decent place and we'll all move on, my mother and brothers and all.
Well, she says, that's more than your father would do.
XV
It's hard to sleep when you know the next day you're fourteen and starting your first job as a man. The Abbot wakes at dawn moaning. Would I ever make him some tay and if I do I can have a big cut of bread from the half loaf in his pocket which he was keeping there out of the way of the odd rat and if I look in Grandma's gramophone where she used to keep the records I'll find a jar of jam.
He can't read, he can't write, but he knows where to hide the jam.
I bring The Abbot his tea and bread and make some for myself. I put on my damp clothes and get into the bed hoping that if I stay there the clothes will dry from my own heat before I go to work. Mam always says it's the damp clothes that give you the consumption and an early grave. The Abbot is sitting up telling me he has a terrible pain in his head from a dream where I was wearing his poor mother's black dress and she flying around screaming, Sin, sin, 'tis a sin. He finishes his tea and falls into a snore sleep and I wait for his clock to say half-past eight, time to get up and be at the post office at nine even if the clothes are still damp on my skin.
On my way out I wonder why Aunt Aggie is coming down the lane. She must be coming to see if The Abbot is dead or needing a doctor. She says, What time do you have to be at that job?
Nine.
All right.
She turns and walks with me to the post office on Henry Street. She
doesn't say a word and I wonder if she's going to the post office to denounce me for sleeping in my grandmother's bed and wearing her black dress. She says, Go up and tell them your aunt is down here waiting for you and you'll be an hour late. If they want to argue I'll go up and argue.
Why do I have to be an hour late?
Do what you're bloody well told.
There are telegram boys sitting on a bench along a wall. There are
two women at a desk, one fat, one thin. The thin one says, Yes? My name is Frank McCourt, miss, and I'm here to start work.
What kind of work would that be now?
Telegram boy, miss.
The thin one cackles, Oh, God, I thought you were here to clean the
lavatories.
No, miss. My mother brought a note from the priest, Dr. Cowpar, and
there's supposed to be a job.
Oh, there is, is there? And do you know what day this is?
I do, miss. 'Tis my birthday. I'm fourteen.
Isn't that grand, says the fat woman. Today is Thursday, says the
thin woman.
Your job starts on Monday. Go away and wash yourself and come back then.
The telegram boys along the wall are laughing. I don't know why but I feel my face turning hot. I tell the women, Thank you, and on the way out I hear the thin one, Jesus above, Maureen, who dragged in that specimen? and they laugh along with the telegram boys.
Aunt Aggie says, Well? and I tell her I don't start till Monday. She says my clothes are a disgrace and what did I wash them in.
Carbolic soap.
They smell like dead pigeons and you're making a laughingstock of the whole family.
She takes me to Roche's Stores and buys me a shirt, a gansey, a pair of short pants, two pairs of stockings and a pair of summer shoes on sale. She gives me two shillings to have tea and a bun for my birthday. She gets on the bus to go back up O'Connell Street too fat and lazy to walk. Fat and lazy, no son of her own, and still she buys me the clothes for my new job.
I turn toward Arthur's Quay with the package of new clothes under my arm and I have to stand at the edge of the River Shannon so that the whole world won't see the tears of a man the day he's fourteen.
Monday morning I'm up early to wash my face and flatten my hair with water and spit. The Abbot sees me in my new clothes. Jaysus, he says, is it gettin' married you are? and goes back to sleep.
Mrs. O'Connell, the fat woman, says, Well, well, aren't we the height of fashion, and the thin one, Miss Barry, says, Did you rob a bank on the weekend? and there's a great laugh from the telegram boys sitting on the bench along the wall.
I'm told to sit at the end of the bench and wait for my turn to go out with telegrams. Some telegram boys in uniforms are the permanent ones who took the exam. They can stay in the post office forever if they like, take the next exam for postman and then the one for clerk that lets them work inside selling stamps and money orders behind the counter downstairs. The post office gives permanent boys big waterproof capes for the bad weather and they get two weeks holiday every year. Everyone says these are good jobs, steady and pensionable and respectable, and if you get a job like this you never have to worry again in your whole life, so you don't.
Temporary telegram boys are not allowed to stay in the job beyond the age of sixteen. There are no uniforms, no holidays, the pay is less, and if you stay out sick a day you can be fired. No excuses. There are no waterproof capes. Bring your own raincoat or dodge the raindrops.
Mrs. O'Connell calls me to her desk to give me a black leather belt and pouch. She says there's a great shortage of bicycles so I'll have to walk my first batch of telegrams. I'm to go to the farthest address
first, work my way back, and don't take all day. She's long enough in the post office to know how long it takes to deliver six telegrams even by foot. I'm not to be stopping in pubs or bookies or even home for a cup of tea and if I do I'll be found out. I'm not to be stopping in chapels to say a prayer. If I have to pray do it on the hoof or on the bicycle. If it rains pay no attention. Deliver the telegrams and don't be a sissy.
One telegram is addressed to Mrs. Clohessy of Arthur's Quay and that couldn't be anyone but Paddy's mother.
Is that you, Frankie McCourt? she says. God, I wouldn't know you you're that big. Come in, will you.
She's wearing a bright frock with flowers all over and shiny new shoes. There are two children on the floor playing with a toy train. On the table there is a teapot, cups with saucers, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, butter, jam. There are two beds over by the window where there were none before. The big bed in the corner is empty and she must know what I'm wondering. He's gone, she says, but he's not dead. Gone t' England with Paddy. Have a cup o' tay an' a bit o' bread. You need it, God help us. You look like one left over from the Famine itself. Ate that bread an' jam an' build yourself up. Paddy always talked about you and Dennis, my poor husband that was in the bed, never got over the day your mother came an' sang the song about the Kerry dancing. He's over in England now making sandwiches in a canteen and sending me a few bob every week. You'd wonder what the English are thinking about when they take a man that has the consumption and give him a job making sandwiches. Paddy has a grand job in a pub in Cricklewood, which is in England. Dennis would still be here if it wasn't for Paddy climbin' the wall for the tongue.
Tongue?
Dennis had the craving, so he did, for a nice sheep's head with a bit of cabbage and a spud so up with me to Barry the butcher with the last few shillings I had. I boiled that head an' sick an' all as he was Dennis couldn't wait for it to be done. He was a demon there in the bed callin' for the head an' when I gave it to him on the plate he was delighted with himself suckin' the marrow outa every inch of that head. Then he finishes an' he says, Mary, where is the tongue?
What tongue? says I.
The tongue of this sheep. Every sheep is born with a tongue that lets him go ba ba ba and there's a great lack of tongue in this head. Go up to Barry the butcher and demand it.
So up with me to Barry the butcher and he said, That bloody sheep came in here bleatin'an'cryin'so much we cut the tongue from her and thrun it to the dog who gobbled it up and ever since ba bas like a sheep and if he doesn't quit I'll cut his tongue and throw it to the cat.
Back I go to Dennis and he gets frantic in the bed. I want that tongue, he says. All the nourishment is in the tongue. And what do you think happens next but my Paddy, that was your friend, goes up to Barry the butcher after dark, climbs the wall, cuts the tongue of a sheep's head that's on a hook on the wall and brings it back to his poor father in the bed. Of course I have to boil that tongue with salt galore and Dennis, God love him, ates it, lies back in the bed a minute, throws back the blanket and stands out on his two feet announcing to the world that consumption or no consumption, he's not going to die in that bed, if he's going to die at all it might as well be under a German bomb with him
making a few pounds for his family instead of whining in the bed there beyond.
She shows me a letter from Paddy. He's working in his uncle Anthony's pub twelve hours a day, twenty-five shillings a week and every day soup and a sandwich. He's delighted when the Germans come over with the bombs so that he can sleep while the pub is closed. At night he sleeps on the floor of the hallway upstairs. He will send his mother two pounds every month and he's saving the rest to bring her and the family to England where they'll be much better off in one room in Cricklewood than ten rooms in Arthur's Quay. She'll be able to get a job no bother. You'd have to be a sad case not to be able to get a job in a country that's at war especially with Yanks pouring in and spending money right and left. Paddy himself is planning to get a job in the middle of London where Yanks leave tips big enough to feed an Irish family of six for a week.
Mrs. Clohessy says, We have enough money for food and shoes at last, thanks be to God and His Blessed Mother. You'll never guess who Paddy met over there in England fourteen years of age an' workin' like a man. Brendan Kiely, the one ye used to call Question. Workin' he is an' savin' so he can go an' join the Mounties an' ride all over Canada like Nelson Eddy singin' I'll be callin' you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. If it wasn't for Hitler we'd all be dead an' isn't that a terrible thing to say. And how's your poor mother, Frankie?
She's grand, Mrs. Clohessy.
No, she's not. I seen her in the Dispensary and she looks worse than my Dennis did in the bed. You have to mind your poor mother. You look desperate too, Frankie, with them two red eyes starin' outa your head. Here's a little tip for you. Thruppence. Buy yourself a sweet.
I will, Mrs. Clohessy.
Do.
***
At the end of the week Mrs. O'Connell hands me the first wages of
my life, a pound, my first pound. I run down the stairs and up to O'Connell Street, the main street, where the lights are on and people are going home from work, people like me with wages in their pockets. I want them to know I'm like them, I'm a man, I have a pound. I walk up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and hope they'll notice me. They don't. I want to wave my pound note at the world so they'll say, There he goes, Frankie McCourt the workingman, with a pound in his pocket.
It's Friday night and I can do anything I like. I can have fish and chips and go to the Lyric Cinema. No, no more Lyric. I don't have to sit up in the gods anymore with people all around me cheering on the Indians killing General Custer and the Africans chasing Tarzan all over the jungle. I can go to the Savoy Cinema now, pay sixpence for a seat down front where there's a better class of people eating boxes of chocolates and covering their mouths when they laugh. After the film I can have tea and buns in the restaurant upstairs.
Michael is across the street calling me. He's hungry and wonders if there's any chance he could go to The Abbot's for a bit of bread and stay there for the night instead of going all the way to Laman Griffin's. I tell him he doesn't have to worry about a bit of bread. We'll go to the Coliseum Café and have fish and chips, all he wants, lemonade galore, and then we'll go to see Yankee Doodle Dandy with James Cagney and eat two big bars of chocolate. After the film we have tea and buns and we sing
and dance like Cagney all the way to The Abbot's. Michael says it must be great to be in America where people have nothing else to do but sing and dance. He's half asleep but he says he's going there some day to sing and dance and would I help him go and when he's asleep I start thinking about America and how I have to save money for my fare instead of squandering it on fish and chips and tea and buns. I'll have to save a few shillings from my pound because if I don't I'll be in Limerick forever. I'm fourteen now and if I save something every week surely I should be able to go to America by the time I'm twenty. There are telegrams for offices, shops, factories where there's no hope of a tip. Clerks take the telegrams without a look at you or a thank you. There are telegrams for the respectable people with maids along the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road where there's no hope of a tip. Maids are like clerks, they don't look at you or say thank you. There are telegrams for the houses of priests and nuns and they have maids, too, even if they say poverty is noble. If you waited for tips from priests or nuns you'd die on their doorstep.
There are telegrams for people miles outside the city, farmers with muddy yards and dogs who want to eat your legs. There are telegrams for rich people in big houses with gate lodges and miles of land surrounded by walls. The gatekeeper waves you in and you have to cycle for miles up long drives past lawns, flower beds, fountains to reach the big house. If the weather is fine people are playing croquet, the Protestant game, or strolling around, talking and laughing, all decked out in flowery dresses and blazers with crests and golden buttons and you'd never know there was a war on. There are Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked outside the great front door where a maid tells you go around to the servants' entrance don't you know any better.
People in the big houses have English accents and they don't tip telegram boys.
The best people for tips are widows, Protestant ministers' wives and the poor in general. Widows know when the telegram money order is due from the English government and they wait by the window. You have to be careful if they ask you in for a cup of tea because one of the temporary boys, Scrawby Luby, said an old widow of thirty-five had him in for tea and tried to take down his pants and he had to run out of the house though he was really tempted and had to go to confession the next Saturday. He said it was very awkward hopping up on the bike with his thing sticking out but if you cycle very fast and think of the sufferings of the Virgin Mary you'll go soft in no time.
Protestant ministers' wives would never carry on like Scrawby Luby's old widow unless they're widows themselves. Christy Wallace, who is a permanent telegram boy and ready to be a postman any day, says Protestants don't care what they do even if they're ministers' wives. They're doomed anyway, so what does it matter if they have a bit of a romp with a telegram boy. All the telegram boys like Protestant ministers' wives. They might have maids but they answer doors themselves and say, One moment, please, and give you sixpence. I'd like to talk to them and ask them how it feels to be doomed but they might get offended and take back the sixpence.
The Irishmen working in England send their telegram money orders on Friday nights and all day Saturday and that's when we get the good tips. The minute we deliver one batch we're out with another.
The worst lanes are in the Irishtown, off High Street or Mungret Street, worse than Roden Lane or O'Keeffe's Lane or any lane I lived in. There are lanes with channels running down the middle. Mothers stand at doors and yell gardyloo when they empty their slop buckets. Children make paper boats or float matchboxes with little sails on the greasy water.
When you ride into a lane the children call out, Here's the telegram boy, here's the telegram boy. They run to you and the women wait at the door. If you give a small child a telegram for his mother he's the hero of the family. Little girls know they're supposed to wait till the boys get their chance though they can get the telegram if they have no brothers. Women at the door will call to you that they have no money now but if you're in this lane tomorrow knock on the door for your tip, God bless you an' all belongin' to you.
Mrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry at the post office tell us every day our job is to deliver telegrams and nothing else. We are not to be doing things for people, going to the shop for groceries or any other kind of message. They don't care if people are dying in the bed. They don't care if people are legless, lunatic or crawling on the floor. We are to deliver the telegram and that's all. Mrs. O'Connell says, I know everything ye do, everything, for the people of Limerick have their eye on ye and there are reports which I have here in my drawers.
A fine place to keep reports, says Toby Mackey under his breath.
But Mrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry don't know what it's like in the lane when you knock on a door and someone says come in and you go in and there's no light and there's a pile of rags on a bed in a corner the pile saying who is it and you say telegram and the pile of rags tells you would you ever go to the shop for me I'm starving with the hunger and I'd give me two eyes for a cup of tea and what are you going to do say I'm busy and ride off on your bike and leave the pile of rags there with a telegram money order that's pure useless because the pile of rags is helpless to get out of the bed to go to the post office to cash the bloody money order.
What are you supposed to do?
You're told never never go to the post office to cash one of those money orders for anyone or you'll lose your job forever. But what are you supposed to do when an old man that was in the Boer War hundreds of years ago says his legs are gone and he'd be forever grateful if you'd go to Paddy Considine in the post office and tell him the situation and Paddy will surely cash the money order and keep two shillings for yourself grand boy that you are. Paddy Considine says no bother but don't tell anyone or I'd be out on my arse and so would you, son. The old man from the Boer War says he knows you have telegrams to deliver now but would you ever come back tonight and maybe go to the shop for him for he doesn't have a thing in the house and he's freezing on top of it. He sits in an old armchair in the corner covered with bits of blankets and a bucket behind the chair that stinks enough to make you sick and when you look at that old man in the dark corner you want to get a hose with hot water and strip him and wash him down and give him a big feed of rashers and eggs and mashed potatoes with loads of butter salt and onions.
I want to take the man from the Boer War and the pile of rags in the bed and put them in a big sunny house in the country with birds chirping away outside the window and a stream gurgling.
Mrs. Spillane in Pump Lane off Carey's Road has two crippled twin children with big blond heads, small bodies, and bits of legs that dangle
over the edges of the chairs. They look into the fire all day and say, Where's Daddy? They speak English like everybody else but they babble away to one another in a language they made up, Hung sup tea tea sup hung. Mrs. Spillane says that means, When are we getting our supper? She tells me she's lucky if her husband sends four pounds a month and she's beside herself with the abuse she gets from the Dispensary over him being in England. The children are only four and they're very bright even if they can't walk or take care of themselves. If they could walk, if they were any way normal, she'd pack up and move to England out of this godforsaken country that fought so long for freedom and look at the state of us, De Valera in his mansion above in Dublin the dirty oul' bastard and the rest of the politicians that can all go to hell, God forgive me. The priests can go to hell too and I won't ask God to forgive me for saying the likes of that. There they are, the priests and the nuns telling us Jesus was poor and 'tis no shame, lorries driving up to their houses with crates and barrels of whiskey and wine, eggs galore and legs of ham and they telling us what we should give up for Lent. Lent, my arse. What are we to give up when we have Lent all year long?
I want to take Mrs. Spillane and her two blond crippled children and put them in that house in the country with the pile of rags and the man from the Boer War and wash everyone and let them all sit in the sun with the birds singing and the streams gurgling.
I can't leave the pile of rags alone with a useless money order because the pile is an old woman, Mrs. Gertrude Daly, all twisted with every class of disease you can get in a Limerick lane, arthritis, rheumatism, falling hair, a nostril half gone from her jabbing at it with her finger, and you wonder what kind of a world is it when this old woman sits up from the rags and smiles at you with teeth that gleam white in the dark, her own teeth and perfect.
That's right, she says, me own teeth, and when I rot in the grave they'll find me teeth a hundred years from now all white an' shiny an' I'll be declared a saint.
The telegram money order, three pounds, is from her son. It has a message, Happy Birthday, Mammy, Your fond son, Teddy. She says, A wonder he can spare it, the little shit, trottin' around with every tart in Piccadilly. She asks if I'd ever do her a favor and cash the money order and get her a little Baby Powers whiskey at the pub, a loaf of bread, a pound of lard, seven potatoes, one for each day of the week. Would I boil
a potato for
bread, bring
O'Connor the
some soap so
grateful and
my troubles.
her, mash it up with a lump of lard, give her a cut of
her a drop of water to go with the whiskey? Would I go to chemist for ointment for her sores and while I'm at it bring she can give her body a good scrub and she'll be forever
say a prayer for me and here's a couple of shillings for all
Ah, no thanks, ma'am.
Take the money. Little tip. You did me great favors.
I couldn't, ma'am, the way you are.
Take the money or I'll tell the post office you're not to deliver
my telegram anymore.
Oh, all right, ma'am. Thanks very much.
Good night, son. Be good to your mother.
Good night, Mrs. Daly.
School starts in September and some days Michael stops at The
Abbot's before the walk home to Laman Griffin's. On rainy days he says,
Can I stay here tonight? and soon he doesn't want to go back to Laman Griffin's at all. He's worn out and hungry with two miles out and two miles back.
When Mam comes looking for him I don't know what to say to her. I don't know how to look at her and I keep my eyes off to one side. She says, How's the job? as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's and I say, Grand, as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's. If the rain is too heavy for her to go home she stays in the small room upstairs with Alphie. She goes back to Laman's the next day but Michael stays and soon she's moving in herself bit by bit till she stops going to Laman's altogether.
The Abbot pays the rent every week. Mam gets the relief and the food dockets till someone informs on her and she's cut off from the Dispensary. She's told that if her son is bringing in a pound a week that's more than some families get on the dole and she should be grateful he has a job. Now I have to hand over my wages. Mam says, A pound? Is that all you get for riding around in all kinds of weather? This would be four dollars in America. Four dollars. And you couldn't feed a cat for four dollars in New York. If you were delivering telegrams for Western Union in New York you'd be earning twenty-five dollars a week and living in luxury. She always translates Irish money into American so that she won't forget and tries to convince everyone times were better over there. Some weeks she lets me keep two shillings but if I go to a film or buy a secondhand book there's nothing left, I won't be able to save for my fare, and I'll be stuck in Limerick till I'm an old man of twenty-five.
Malachy writes from Dublin to say he's fed up and doesn't want to spend the rest of his life blowing a trumpet in the army band. He's home in a week and complains when he has to share the big bed with Michael, Alphie and me. He had his own army cot up there in Dublin with sheets and blankets and a pillow. Now he's back to overcoats and a bolster that sends up a cloud of feathers when you touch it. Mam says, Pity about you. I'm sorry for your troubles. The Abbot has his own bed, and my mother has the small room. We're all together again, no Laman tormenting us. We make tea and fried bread and sit on the kitchen floor. The Abbot says you're not supposed to be sitting on kitchen floors, what are tables and chairs for? He tells Mam that Frankie is not right in the head and Mam says we'll all catch our death from the damp of the floor. We sit on the floor and sing and Mam and The Abbot sit on chairs. She sings ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" and the Abbot sings ""The Road to Rasheen"" and we still don't know what his song is about. We sit on the floor and tell stories about things that happened, things that never happened and things that will happen when we all go to America.
There are slow days at the post office and we sit on the bench and talk. We can talk but we are not to laugh. Miss Barry says we should be grateful we're getting paid to sit there, bunch of idlers and streetboys that we are, and that there is to be no laughing. Getting paid for sitting and chatting is no laughing matter and the first titter out of any of us and out we go till we come to our senses and if the tittering continues we'll be reported to the proper authorities.
The boys talk about her under their breath. Toby Mackey says, What that oul' bitch needs is a good rub o' the relic, a good rub o' the brush. Her mother was a streetwalking flaghopper and her father escaped from a lunatic asylum with bunions on his balls and warts on his wank.
There is laughing along the bench and Miss Barry calls to us, I warned ye against the laughing. Mackey, what is it you're prattling about over there?
I said we'd all be better off out in the fresh air on this fine day delivering telegrams, Miss Barry.
I'm sure you did, Mackey. Your mouth is a lavatory. Did you hear
me?
I did, Miss Barry.
You have been heard on the stairs, Mackey. Yes, Miss Barry.
Shut up, Mackey.
I will, Miss Barry.
Not another word, Mackey.
No, Miss Barry.
I said shut up, Mackey.
All right, Miss Barry.
That's the end of it, Mackey. Don't try me. I won't, Miss Barry.
Mother o' God give me patience.
Yes, Miss Barry.
Take the last word, Mackey. Take it, take it, take it.
I will, Miss Barry.
Toby Mackey is a temporary telegram boy like me. He saw a film
called The Front Page and now he wants to go to America some day and be a tough newspaper reporter with a hat and a cigarette. He keeps a notebook in his pocket because a good reporter has to write down what happens. Facts. He has to write down facts not a lot of bloody poetry, which is all you hear in Limerick with men in pubs going on about our great sufferings under the English. Facts, Frankie. He writes down the number of telegrams he delivers and how far he travels. We sit on the bench making sure we don't laugh and he tells me that if we deliver forty telegrams a day that's two hundred a week and that's ten thousand a year and twenty thousand in our two years at the job. If we cycle one hundred and twenty-five miles in a week that's thirteen thousand miles in two years and that's halfway around the world, Frankie, and no wonder there isn't a scrap of flesh on our arses.
Toby says nobody knows Limerick like the telegram boy. We know every avenue, road, street, terrace, mews, place, close, lane. Jasus, says Toby, there isn't a door in Limerick we don't know. We knock on all kinds of doors, iron, oak, plywood. Twenty thousand doors, Frankie. We rap, kick, push. We ring and buzz bells. We shout and whistle, Telegram boy, telegram boy. We drop telegrams in letter boxes, shove them under doors, throw them over the transom. We climb in windows where people are bedridden. We fight off every dog who wants to turn us into dinner. You never know what's going to happen when you hand people their telegrams. They laugh and sing and dance and cry and scream and fall down in a weakness and you wonder if they'll wake up at all and give you the tip. It's not a bit like delivering telegrams in America where Mickey Rooney rides around in a film called The Human Comedy and people are pleasant and falling over themselves to give you a tip, inviting you in, giving you a cup of tea and a bun.
Toby Mackey says he has facts galore in his notebook and he doesn't give a fiddler's fart about anything and that's the way I'd like to be myself.
Mrs. O'Connell knows I like the country telegrams and if a day is sunny she gives me a batch of ten that will keep me away all morning and I don't have to return till after the dinner hour at noon. There are fine autumn days when the Shannon sparkles and the fields are green and glinting with silver morning dew. Smoke blows across fields and there's the sweet smell of turf fires. Cows and sheep graze in the fields and I wonder if these are the beasts the priest was talking about. I wouldn't be surprised because there's no end to the bulls climbing on cows, rams on sheep, stallions on mares, and they all have such big things it makes me break out in a sweat to look at them and I feel sorry for all the female creatures in the world who have to suffer like that though I wouldn't mind being a bull myself because they can do what they like and it's never a sin for an animal. I wouldn't mind going at myself here but you never know when a farmer might come along the road driving cows and sheep to a fair or to another field raising his stick and bidding you, Good day, young fella, grand morning, thank God and His Blessed Mother. A farmer that religious might be offended if he saw you breaking the Sixth Commandment forninst his field. Horses like to stick their heads over fences and hedges to see what's passing by and I stop and talk to them because they have big eyes and long noses that show how intelligent they are. Sometimes two birds will be singing to each other across a field and I have to stop and listen to them and if I stay long enough more birds will join till every tree and bush is alive with birdsong. If there's a stream gurgling under a bridge on the road, birds singing and cows mooing and lambs baaing, that's better than any band in a film. The smell of dinner bacon and cabbage wafting from a farmhouse makes me so weak with the hunger I climb into a field and stuff myself with blackberries for half an hour. I stick my face into the stream and drink icy water that's better than the lemonade in any fish and chip shop.
When I'm finished delivering the telegrams there's enough time to go to the ancient monastery graveyard where my mother's relations are buried, the Guilfoyles and the Sheehans, where my mother wants to be buried. I can see from here the high ruins of Carrigogunnell Castle and there's plenty of time to cycle there, sit up on the highest wall, look at the Shannon flowing out to the Atlantic on its way to America and dream of the day I'll be sailing off myself.
The boys at the post office tell me I'm lucky to get the Carmody family telegram, a shilling tip, one of the biggest tips you'll ever get in Limerick. So why am I getting it? I'm the junior boy. They say, Well, sometimes Theresa Carmody answers the door. She has the consumption and they're afraid of catching it from her. She's seventeen, in and out of the sanatorium, and she'll never see eighteen. The boys at the post office say sick people like Theresa know there's little time left and that makes them mad for love and romance and everything. Everything. That's what the consumption does to you, say the boys at the post office.
I cycle through wet November streets thinking of that shilling tip, and as I turn into the Carmody street the bicycle slides out from under me and I skid along the ground scraping my face and tearing open the back of my hand. Theresa Carmody opens the door. She has red hair. She had green eyes like the fields beyond Limerick. Her cheeks are bright pink and her skin is a fierce white. She says, Oh, you're all wet and bleeding.
I skidded on my bike.
Come in and I'll put something on your cuts.
I wonder, Should I go in? I might get the consumption and that will be the end of me. I want to be alive when I'm fifteen and I want the shilling tip. Come in. You'll perish standing there.
She puts on the kettle for the tea. Then she dabs iodine on my cuts and I try to be a man and not whimper. She says, Oh, you're a great bit of a man. Go into the parlor and dry yourself before the fire. Look, why don't you take off your pants and dry them on the screen of the fire?
Ah, no.
Ah, do.
I will.
I drape my pants over the screen. I sit there watching the steam
rise and I watch myself rise and I worry she might come in and see me in my excitement.
There she is with a plate of bread and jam and two cups of tea. Lord, she says, you might be a scrawny bit of a fellow but that's a fine boyo you have there.
She puts the plate and the cups on a table by the fire and there they stay. With her thumb and forefinger she takes the tip of my excitement and leads me across the room to a green sofa against the wall and all the time my head is filled with sin and iodine and fear of consumption and the shilling tip and her green eyes and she's on the sofa don't stop or I'll die and she's crying and I'm crying for I don't know what's happening to me if I'm killing myself catching consumption from her mouth I'm riding to heaven I'm falling off a cliff and if this is a sin I don't give a fiddler's fart.
We take our ease on the sofa a while till she says, Don't you have more telegrams to deliver? and when we sit up she gives a little cry, Oh, I'm bleeding.
What's up with you?
I think it's because it's the first time.
I tell her, Wait a minute. I bring the bottle from the kitchen and
splash the iodine on her injury. She leaps from the sofa, dances around the parlor like a wild one and runs into the kitchen to douse herself with water. After she dries herself she says, Lord, you're very innocent. You're not supposed to be pouring iodine on girls like that.
I thought you were cut.
For weeks after that I deliver the telegram. Sometimes we have the excitement on the sofa but there are other days she has the cough and you can see the weakness on her. She never tells me she has the weakness. She never tells me she has the consumption. The boys at the post office say I must have been having a great time with the shilling tip and Theresa Carmody. I never tell them I stopped taking the shilling tip. I never tell them about the green sofa and the excitement. I never tell them of the pain that comes when she opens the door and I can see the weakness on her and all I want to do then is make tea for her and sit with my arms around her on the green sofa.
One Saturday I'm told to deliver the telegram to Theresa's mother at her job in Woolworth's. I try to be casual. Mrs. Carmody, I always deliver the telegram to your, I think your daughter, Theresa?
Yes, she's in the hospital.
Is she in the sanatorium?
I said she's in the hospital.
She's like everyone else in Limerick, ashamed of the TB, and she
doesn't give me a shilling or any kind of tip. I cycle out to the
sanatorium to see Theresa. They say you have to be a relation and you have to be adult. I tell them I'm her cousin and I'll be fifteen in August. They tell me go away. I cycle to the Franciscan church to pray for Theresa. St. Francis, would you please talk to God. Tell Him it wasn't Theresa's fault. I could have refused that telegram Saturday after Saturday. Tell God Theresa was not responsible for the excitement on the sofa because that's what the consumption does to you. It doesn't matter anyway, St. Francis, because I love Theresa. I love her as much as you love any bird or beast or fish and will you tell God take the consumption away and I promise I'll never go near her again.
The next Saturday they give me the Carmody telegram. From halfway up the street I can see the blinds are drawn. I can see the black crepe wreath on the door. I can see the white purple-lined mourning card. I can see beyond the door and walls where Theresa and I tumbled naked and wild on the green sofa and I know now she is in hell and all because of me.
I slip the telegram under the door and cycle back down to the Franciscan church to beg for the repose of Theresa's soul. I pray to every statue, to the stained glass windows, the Stations of the Cross. I swear I'll lead a life of faith, hope and charity, poverty, chastity and obedience.
Next day, Sunday, I go to four Masses. I do the Stations of the Cross three times. I say rosaries all day. I go without food and drink and wherever I find a quiet place I cry and beg God and the Virgin Mary to have mercy on the soul of Theresa Carmody.
On Monday I follow the funeral to the graveyard on my post office bicycle. I stand behind a tree a distance from the grave. Mrs. Carmody weeps and moans. Mr. Carmody snuffles and looks puzzled. The priest recites the Latin prayers and sprinkles the coffin with holy water.
I want to go to the priest, to Mr. and Mrs. Carmody. I want to tell them how I'm the one who sent Theresa to hell. They can do whatever they like with me. Abuse me. Revile me. Throw grave dirt at me. But I stay behind the tree till the mourners leave and the grave diggers fill in the grave.
Frost is already whitening the fresh earth on the grave and I think of Theresa cold in the coffin, the red hair, the green eyes. I can't understand the feelings going through me but I know that with all the people who died in my family and all the people who died in the lanes around me and all the people who left I never had a pain like this in my heart and I hope I never will again.
It's getting dark. I walk my bicycle out of the graveyard. I have telegrams to deliver.
XVI
Mrs. O'Connell gives me telegrams to deliver to Mr. Harrington, the Englishman with the dead wife that was born and bred in Limerick. The boys at the post office say sympathy telegrams are a waste of time. People just cry and moan with the grief and they think they're excused from the tip. They'll ask you if you'd like to come in for a look at the departed and a prayer by the bed. That wouldn't be so bad if they offered you a drop of sherry and a ham sandwich. Oh, no, they're happy to get your prayer but you're only a telegram boy and you're lucky if you get a
dry biscuit. Older boys at the post office say you have to play your cards right to get the grief tip. If you're asked in to say a prayer you have to kneel by the corpse, give a powerful sigh, bless yourself, drop your forehead to the bedclothes so they won't see your face, let your shoulders shake like one collapsing with sorrow, hold on to the bed with your two hands as if they're going to have to tear you away to deliver the rest of your telegrams, make sure your cheeks are glinting with tears or the spit you dabbed on, and if you don't get a tip after all that push the next batch of telegrams under the door or fire them over the transom and leave them to their grief.
This isn't my first time delivering telegrams to the Harrington house. Mr. Harrington is always away on business for the insurance company and Mrs. Harrington is generous with the tip. But she's gone and Mr. Harrington answers the doorbell. His eyes are red and he sniffles. He says, Are you Irish?
Irish? What else would I be standing there on his doorstep in Limerick with a batch of telegrams in my hand? I am, sir. He says, Come in. Put the telegrams on the hall stand. He shuts the hall door, locks it, puts the key in his pocket and I think, Aren't Englishmen very peculiar.
You'll want to see her, of course. You'll want to see what you people have done to her with your damn tuberculosis. Race of ghouls. Follow me.
He leads me first to the kitchen where he picks up a plate of ham sandwiches and two bottles, and then upstairs. Mrs. Harrington looks lovely in the bed, blond, pink, peaceful.
This is my wife. She may be Irish but she doesn't look it, thank God. Like you. Irish. You'll need a drink, of course. You Irish quaff at every turn. Barely weaned before you clamor for the whiskey bottle, the pint of stout. You'll have what, whiskey, sherry?
Ah, a lemonade will be lovely.
I am mourning my wife not celebrating the bloody citrus. You'll have a sherry. Swill from bloody Catholic fascist Spain.
I gulp the sherry. He refills my glass and goes to refill his own with whiskey. Damn. Whiskey all gone. Stay here. Do you hear me? I'm going to the pub for another bottle of whiskey. Stay till I come back. Don't move.
I'm confused, dizzy from the sherry. I don't know what you're supposed to do with grieving Englishmen. Mrs. Harrington, you look lovely in the bed. But you're a Protestant, already doomed, in hell, like Theresa. Priest said, Outside the Church there is no salvation. Wait, I might be able to save your soul. Baptize you Catholic. Make up for what I did to Theresa. I'll get some water. Oh, God, the door is locked. Why? Maybe you're not dead at all? Watching me. Are you dead, Mrs. Harrington? I'm not afraid. Your face is icy. Oh, you're dead all right. I'll baptize you with sherry from bloody Catholic fascist Spain. I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son, the- What the bloody hell are you doing? Get off my wife, you wretched Papist twit. What primitive Paddy ritual is this? Did you touch her? Did you? I'll wring your scrawny neck.
I - I, -
Oi, Oi, speak English, you scrap.
I was just, a little sherry to get her into heaven.
Heaven? We had heaven, Ann, I, our daughter, Emily. You'll never lay your pink piggy eyes on her. Oh, Christ, I can't stand it. Here, more sherry.
Ah, no, thanks.
Ah, no thanks. That puny Celtic whine. You people love your alcohol. Helps you crawl and whine better. Of course you want food. You have the collapsed look of a starving Paddy. Here. Ham. Eat.
Ah, no thanks.
Ah, no thanks. Say that again and I'll ram the ham up your arse. He waves a ham sandwich at me, with the heel of his hand pushes it
into my mouth.
He collapses into a chair. Oh, God, God, what am I to do? Must rest
a moment.
My stomach heaves. I rush to the window, stick my head out and
throw up. He leaps from the chair and charges me.
You, you, God blast you to hell, you vomited on my wife's rosebush. He lunges at me, misses, falls to the floor. I climb out the
window, hang on to the ledge. He's at the window, grabbing at my hands. I let go, drop to the rosebush, into the ham sandwich and sherry I've just thrown up. I'm pricked by rose thorns, stung, my ankle is twisted. He's at the window, barking, Come back here, you Irish runt. He'll report me to the post office. He hits me in the back with the whiskey bottle, pleads, Will you not watch one hour with me?
He pelts me with sherry glasses, whiskey glasses, assorted ham sandwiches, items from his wife's dressing table, powders, creams, brushes.
I climb on my bike and wobble through the streets of Limerick, dizzy with sherry and pain. Mrs. O'Connell attacks me, Seven telegrams, one address, and you're gone all day.
I was, I was,
You was. You was. Drunk is what you was. Drunk is what you are. Reeking. Oh, we heard. That nice man rang, Mr. Harrington, lovely Englishman that sounds like James Mason. Lets you in to say a prayer for his poor wife and next thing you're out the window with the sherry and the ham. Your poor mother. What she brought into the world.
He made me eat the ham, drink the sherry.
Made you? Jesus, that's a good one. Made you. Mr. Harrington is a refined Englishman and there is no reason for him to lie and we don't want your kind in this post office, people that can't keep their hands off the ham and sherry, so hand in your telegram pouch and bicycle for your days are done in this post office.
But I need the job. I have to save and go to America.
America. Sad day when America lets in the likes of you.
I hobble through the streets of Limerick. I'd like to go back and
throw a brick through Mr. Harrington's window. No. Respect for the dead. I'll go across the Sarsfield Bridge and out the riverbank where I can lie down somewhere in the bushes. I don't know how I can go home and tell my mother I lost my job. Have to go home. Have to tell her. Can't stay out the riverbank all night. She'd be frantic.
Mam begs the post office to take me back. They say no. They never heard the likes. Telegram boy mauling corpse. Telegram boy fleeing scene with ham and sherry. He will never set foot in the post office again. No.
She gets a letter from the parish priest. Take the boy back, says the parish priest. Oh, yes, Father, indeed, says the post office. They'll
let me stay till my sixteenth birthday, not a minute longer. Besides, says Mrs. O'Connell, when you think of what the English did to us for eight hundred years that man had no right to complain over a little ham and sherry. Compare a little ham and sherry to the Great Famine and where are you? If my poor husband was alive and I told him what you did he'd say you struck a blow, Frank McCourt, struck a blow.
Every Saturday morning I swear I'll go to confession and tell the priest of my impure acts at home, on lonely boreens around Limerick with cows and sheep gawking, on the heights of Carrigogunnell with the world looking up.
I'll tell him about Theresa Carmody and how I sent her to hell, and that will be the end of me, driven from the Church.
Theresa is a torment to me. Every time I deliver a telegram to her street, every time I pass the graveyard I feel the sin growing in me like an abscess and if I don't go to confession soon I'll be nothing but an abscess riding around on a bicycle with people pointing and telling each other, There he is, there's Frankie McCourt, the dirty thing that sent Theresa Carmody to hell.
I look at people going to Communion on Sundays, everyone in a state of grace, returning to their seats with God in their mouths, peaceful, easy, ready to die at any moment and go straight to heaven or go home to their rashers and eggs without a worry in the world.
I'm worn out from being the worst sinner in Limerick. I want to get rid of this sin and have rashers and eggs and no guilt, no torment. I want to be ordinary.
The priests tell us all the time that God's mercy is infinite but how can any priest give absolution to someone like me who delivers telegrams and winds up in a state of excitement on a green sofa with a girl dying of the galloping consumption.
I cycle all around Limerick with telegrams and stop at every church. I ride from Redemptorists to Jesuits to Augustinians to Dominicans to Franciscans. I kneel before the statue of St. Francis of Assisi and beg him to help me but I think he's too disgusted with me. I kneel with people in the pews next to confessionals but when my turn comes I can't breathe, my heart pounds, my forehead turns cold and clammy and I run from the church.
I swear I'll go to confession at Christmas. I can't. Easter. I can't. Weeks and months pass and it's a year since Theresa died. I'll go on her anniversary but I can't. I'm fifteen now and I pass churches without stopping. I'll have to wait till I go to America where there are priests like Bing Crosby in Going My Way who won't kick me out of the confessional like Limerick priests.
I still have the sin in me, the abscess, and I hope it doesn't kill me entirely before I see the American priest.
There's a telegram for an old woman, Mrs. Brigid Finucane. She says, How old are you, by?
Fifteen and a half, Mrs. Finucane.
Young enough to make a fool of yourself and ould enough to know better. Are you shmart, by? Are you anyway intelligent?
I can read and write, Mrs. Finucane.
Arrah, there are people above in the lunatic asylum can read and write. Can you write a letter?
I can.
She wants me to write letters to her customers. If you need a suit or dress for your child you can go to her. She gives you a ticket to a shop and they give you the clothes. She gets a discount and charges you the full price and interest on top. You pay her back weekly. Some of her customers fall behind in their payments and they need threatening letters. She says, I'll give you threepence for every letter you write and another threepence if it brings a payment. If you want the job come here on Thursday and Friday nights, and bring your own paper and envelopes.
I'm desperate for that job. I want to go to America. But I have no money for paper and envelopes. Next day I'm delivering a telegram to Woolworth's and there is the answer, a whole section packed with paper and envelopes. I have no money so I have to help myself. But how? Two dogs save the day for me, two dogs at the door of Woolworth's stuck together after the excitement. They yelp and run in circles. Customers and sales clerks giggle and pretend to be looking someplace else and while they're busy pretending I slip paper and envelopes under my sweater, out the door and off on my bike far from stuck dogs.
Mrs. Finucane looks suspicious. That's very fancy stationery you have there, by. Is that your mother's? You'll give that back when you get the money, won't you, by?
Oh, I will.
From now on I'm never to come to her front door. There's a lane behind her house and I'm to come in the back door for fear someone might see me.
In a large ledger she gives me the names and addresses of six customers behind in their payments. Threaten 'em, by. Frighten the life out of 'em.
My first letter,
Dear Mrs. O'Brien,
Inasmuch as you have not seen fit to pay me what you owe me I may be forced to resort to legal action. There's your son, Michael, parading around the world in his new suit which I paid for while I myself have barely a crust to keep body and soul together. I am sure you don't want to languish in the dungeons of Limerick jail far from friends and family.
I remain, yours in litigious anticipation, Mrs. Brigid Finucane She tells me, That's a powerful letter, by, better than anything you'd read in the Limerick Leader. That word, inasmuch, that's a holy terror of a word. What does it mean?
I think it means this is your last chance.
I write five more letters and she gives me money for stamps. On my way to the post office I think, Why should I squander money on stamps when I have two legs to deliver the letters myself in the dead of night? When you're poor a threatening letter is a threatening letter no matter how it comes in the door.
I run through the lanes of Limerick shoving letters under doors, praying no one will see me.
The next week Mrs. Finucane is squealing with joy. Four of 'em paid. Oh, sit down now and write more, by. Put the fear of God in 'em.
Week after week my threatening letters grow sharper and sharper. I begin to throw in words I hardly understand myself.
Dear Mrs. O'Brien,
Inasmuch as you have not succumbed to the imminence of litigation in our previous epistle be advised that we are in consultation with our barrister above in Dublin.
Next week Mrs. O'Brien pays. She came in tremblin' with tears in her eyes, by, and she promised she'd never miss another payment.
On Friday nights Mrs. Finucane sends me to a pub for a bottle of sherry. You're too young for sherry, by. You can make yourself a nice cup of tea but you have to use the tea leaves left over from this morning. No, you can't have a piece of bread with the prices they're charging. Bread is it? Next thing you'll be asking for an egg.
She rocks by the fire, sipping her sherry, counting the money in the purse on her lap, entering payments in her ledger before she locks everything in the trunk under her bed upstairs. After a few sherries she tells me what a lovely thing it is to have a little money so you can leave it to the Church for Masses to be said for the repose of your soul. It makes her so happy to think of priests saying Masses for her years and years after she's dead and buried.
Sometimes she falls asleep and if the purse drops to the floor I help myself to an extra few shillings for the overtime and the use of all the big new words. There will be less money for the priests and their Masses but how many Masses does a soul need and surely I'm entitled to a few pounds after the way the Church slammed doors in my face? They wouldn't let me be an altar boy, a secondary school pupil, a missionary with the White Fathers. I don't care. I have a post office savings account and if I keep writing successful threatening letters, helping myself to the odd few shillings from her purse and keeping the stamp money, I'll have my escape money to America. If my whole family dropped from the hunger I wouldn't touch this money in the post office.
Often I have to write threatening letters to neighbors and friends of my mother and I worry they might discover me. They complain to Mam, That oul' bitch, Finucane, below in Irishtown, sent me a threatening letter. What kind of a demon outa hell would torment her own kind with a class of a letter that I can't make head nor tail of anyway with words never heard on land or sea. The person that would write that letter is worse than Judas or any informer for the English.
My mother says anyone that writes such letters should be boiled in oil and have his fingernails pulled out by blind people.
I'm sorry for their troubles but there's no other way for me to save the money for America. I know that someday I'll be a rich Yank and send home hundreds of dollars and my family will never have to worry about threatening letters again.

Some of the temporary telegram boys are taking the permanent exam in August. Mrs. O'Connell says, You should take that exam, Frank McCourt. You have a bit of a brain in your head and you'd pass it no bother. You'd be a postman in no time and a great help to your poor mother.
Mam says I should take it, too, become a postman, save up, go to America and be a postman over there and wouldn't that be a lovely life.
I'm delivering a telegram to South's pub on a Saturday and Uncle Pa Keating is sitting there, all black as usual. He says, Have a lemonade there, Frankie, or is it a pint you want now that you're near sixteen?
Lemonade, Uncle Pa, thanks.
You'll want your first pint the day you're sixteen, won't you? I will but my father won't be here to get it for me.
Don't worry about that. I know 'tis not the same without your
father but I'll get you the first pint. 'Tis what I'd do if I had a son. Come here the night before you're sixteen.
I will, Uncle Pa.
I hear you're taking that exam for the post office?
I am.
Why would you do a thing like that? 'Tis a good job and I'd be a
postman in no time and it has the pension.
Ah, pension my arse. Sixteen years of age an' talking about the
pension. Is it coddin' me you are? Do you hear what I said, Frankie? Pension my arse. If you pass the exam you'll stay in the post office nice and secure the rest of your life. You'll marry a Brigid and have five little Catholics and grow little roses in your garden. You'll be dead in your head before you're thirty and dried in your ballocks the year before. Make up your own bloody mind and to hell with the safeshots and the begrudgers. Do you hear me, Frankie McCourt?
I do, Uncle Pa. That's what Mr. O'Halloran said.
What did he say?
Make up your own mind.
True for Mr. O'Halloran. 'Tis your life, make your own decisions
and to hell with the begrudgers, Frankie. In the heel o' the hunt you'll be going to America anyway, won't you?
I will, Uncle Pa.
The day of the exam I'm excused from work. There's a sign in an office window on O'Connell Street, SMART BOY WANTED, NEAT HANDWRITING, GOOD AT SUMS, APPLY HERE TO MANAGER, MR. MCCAFFREY, EASONS LTD.
I stand outside the place of the exam, the house of the Limerick Protestant Young Men's Association. There are boys from all over Limerick climbing the steps to take the exam and a man at the door is handing them sheets of paper and pencils and barking at them to hurry up, hurry up. I look at the man at the door, I think of Uncle Pa Keating and what he said, I think of the sign in Easons' office, SMART BOY WANTED. I don't want to go in that door and pass that exam for if I do I'll be a permanent telegram boy with a uniform, then a postman, then a clerk selling stamps for the rest of my life. I'll be in Limerick forever, growing roses with my head dead and my ballocks all dried up.
The man at the door says, You, are you coming in here or are you goin' to stand there with your face hanging out?
I want to say to the man, Kiss my arse, but I still have a few weeks left in the post office and he might report me. I shake my head and walk up the street where a smart boy is wanted.
The manager, Mr. McCaffrey, says, I would like to see a specimen of your handwriting, to see, in short, if you have a decent fist. Sit down there at that table. Write your name and address and write me a paragraph explaining why you came here for this job and how you propose to rise in the ranks of Eason and Son, Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assiduity where there is great opportunity in this company for a boy that will keep his eye on the guidon ahead and guard his flanks from the siren call of sin.
I write,
Frank McCourt,
4 Little Barrington Street,
Limerick City,
County Limerick,
Ireland
I am applying for this job so that I can rise to the highest ranks of Easons Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assadooty knowing that if I keep my eyes ahead and protect my flanks I'll be safe from all temptation and a credit to Easons and Ireland in general.
What's this? says Mr. McCaffrey. Do we have here a twisting of the truth?
I don't know, Mr. McCaffrey.
Little Barrington Street. That's a lane. Why are you calling it a street? You live in a lane, not a street.
They call it a street, Mr. McCaffrey.
Don't be getting above yourself, boy.
Oh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.
You live in a lane and that means you have nowhere to go but up. Do
you understand that, McCourt?
I do, sir.
You have to work your way out of the lane, McCourt. I do, Mr. McCaffrey.
You have the cut and jib of a lane boy, McCourt. Yes, Mr. McCaffrey.
You have the look of the lane all over you. All over you from poll to toe cap. Don't try to fool the populace, McCourt. You'd have to rise early in the morning to fool the likes of me.
Oh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.
Then there's the eyes. Very sore eyes you have there. Can you see? I can, Mr. McCaffrey.
You can read and write but can you do addition and subtraction?
I can, Mr. McCaffrey.
Well, I don't know what the policy is on sore eyes. I would have to
ring Dublin and see where they stand on sore eyes. But your writing is clear, McCourt. A good fist. We'll take you on pending the decision on the sore eyes. Monday morning. Half six at the railway station.
In the morning? In the morning. We don't give out the bloody morning papers at night, do we?
No, Mr. McCaffrey.
Another thing. We distribute The Irish Times, a Protestant paper, run by the freemasons in Dublin. We pick it up at the railway station. We count it. We take it to the newsagents. But we don't read it. I don't want to see you reading it. You could lose the Faith and by the look of those eyes you could lose your sight. Do you hear me, McCourt?
I do, Mr. McCaffrey.
No IrishTimes, and when you come in next week I'll tell you about all the English filth you're not to read in this office. Do you hear me?
I do, Mr. McCaffrey.
Mrs. O'Connell has the tight mouth and she won't look at me. She says to Miss Barry, I hear a certain upstart from the lanes walked away from the post office exam. Too good for it, I suppose.
True for you, says Miss Barry.
Too good for us, I suppose.
True for you.
Do you think he'd ever tell us why he didn't take the exam?
Oh, he might, says Miss Barry, if we went down on our two knees. I tell her, I want to go to America, Mrs. O'Connell.
Did you hear that, Miss Barry?
I did, indeed, Mrs. O'Connell.
He spoke.
He did, indeed.
He will rue the day, Miss Barry.
Rue he will, Mrs. O'Connell.
Mrs. O'Connell talks past me to the boys waiting on the bench for
their telegrams, This is Frankie McCourt who thinks he's too good for the post office.
I don't think that, Mrs. O'Connell.
And who asked you to open your gob, Mr. High and Mighty? Too grand for us, isn't he, boys?
He is, Mrs. O'Connell.
And after all we did for him, giving him the telegrams with the good tips, sending him to the country on fine days, taking him back after his disgraceful behavior with Mr. Harrington, the Englishman, disrespecting the body of poor Mrs. Harrington, stuffing himself with ham sandwiches, getting fluthered drunk on sherry, jumping out the window and destroying every rosebush in sight, coming in here three sheets to the wind, and who knows what else he did delivering telegrams for two years, who knows indeed, though we have a good idea, don't we, Miss Barry?
We do, Mrs. O'Connell, though 'twouldn't be a fit subject to be talking about.
She whispers to Miss Barry and they look at me and shake their heads.
A disgrace he is to Ireland and his poor mother. I hope she never finds out. But what would you expect of one born in America and his father from the North. We put up with all that and still took him back.
She keeps talking past me again to the boys on the bench.
Going to work for Easons he is, working for that pack of freemasons and Protestants above in Dublin. Too good for the post office but ready and willing to deliver all kinds of filthy English magazines all over Limerick. Every magazine he touches will be a mortal sin. But he's leaving now, so he is, and a sorry day it is for his poor mother that prayed for a son with a pension to take care of her in her latter days. So here, take your wages and go from the sight of us.
Miss Barry says, He's a bad boy, isn't he, boys?
He is, Miss Barry.
I don't know what to say. I don't know what I did wrong. Should I
say I'm sorry? Good-bye?
I lay my belt and pouch on Mrs. O'Connell's desk. She glares at me,
Go on. Go to your job at Easons. Go from us. Next boy, come up for your telegrams.
They're back at work and I'm down the stairs to the next part of my life.
XVII
I don't know why Mrs. O'Connell had to shame me before the whole world, and I don't think I'm too good for the post office or anything else. How could I with my hair sticking up, pimples dotting my face, my eyes red and oozing yellow, my teeth crumbling with the rot, no shoulders, no flesh on my arse after cycling thirteen thousand miles to deliver twenty thousand telegrams to every door in Limerick and regions beyond?
Mrs. O'Connell said a long time ago she knew everything about every telegram boy. She must know about the times I went at myself on top of Carrigogunnell, milkmaids gawking, little boys looking up.
She must know about Theresa Carmody and the green sofa, how I got her into a state of sin and sent her to hell, the worst sin of all, worse than Carrigogunnell a thousand times. She must know I never went to confession after Theresa, that I'm doomed to hell myself.
A person that commits a sin like that is never too good for the post office or anything else.
The barman at South's remembers me from the time I sat with Mr. Hannon, Bill Galvin, Uncle Pa Keating, black white black. He remembers my father, how he spent his wages and his dole while singing patriotic songs and making speeches from the dock like a condemned rebel.
And what is it you'd like? says the barman.
I'm here to meet Uncle Pa Keating and have my first pint.
Oh, begod, is that a fact? He'll be here in a minute and sure
there's no reason why I shouldn't draw his pint and maybe draw your first pint, is there now?
There isn't, sir.
Uncle Pa comes in and tells me sit next to him against the wall. The barman brings the pints, Uncle Pa pays, lifts his glass, tells the men in the pub, This is my nephew, Frankie McCourt, son of Angela Sheehan, the sister of my wife, having his first pint, here's to your health and long life, Frankie, may you live to enjoy the pint but not too much.
The men lift their pints, nod, drink, and there are creamy lines on their lips and mustaches. I take a great gulp of my pint and Uncle Pa tells me, Slow down for the love o' Jasus, don't drink it all, there's more where that came from as long as the Guinness family stays strong and healthy.
I tell him I want to stand him a pint with my last wages from the post office but he says, No, take the money home to your mother and you can stand me a pint when you come home from America flushed with success and the heat from a blonde hanging on your arm.
The men in the pub are talking about the terrible state of the world and how in God's name Hermann Goering escaped the hangman an hour before the hanging. The Yanks are over there in Nuremberg declaring they don't know how the Nazi bastard hid that pill. Was it in his ear? Up his nostril? Up his arse? Surely the Yanks looked in every hole and cranny of every Nazi they captured and still Hermann wiped their eye. There you are. It shows you can sail across the Atlantic, land in Normandy, bomb Germany off the face of the earth, but when all's said and done they can't find a little pill planted in the far reaches of Goering's fat arse.
Uncle Pa buys me another pint. It's harder to drink because it fills me and makes my belly bulge. The men are talking about
concentration camps and the poor Jews that never harmed a soul, men, women, children crammed into ovens, children, mind you, what harm could they do, little shoes scattered everywhere, crammed in, and the pub is misty and the voices fading in and out. Uncle Pa says, Are you all right? You're as white as a sheet. He takes me to the lavatory and the two of us have a good long piss against the wall which keeps moving back and forth. I can't go into the pub again, cigarette smoke, stale Guinness, Goering's fat arse, small shoes scattered, can't go in again, good night, Uncle Pa, thanks, and he tells me go straight home to my mother, straight home, oh, he doesn't know about the excitement in the loft or the excitement on the green sofa or me in such a state of doom that if I died now I'd be in hell in a wink.
Uncle Pa goes back to his pint. I'm out on O'Connell Street and why shouldn't I take the few steps to the Jesuits and tell all my sins this last night I'll be fifteen. I ring the bell at the priests'house and a big man answers, Yes? I tell him, I want to go to confession, Father. He says, I'm not a priest. Don't call me father. I'm a brother.
All right, Brother. I want to go to confession before I'm sixteen tomorrow. State o' grace on my birthday.
He says, Go away. You're drunk. Child like you drunk as a lord ringing for a priest at this hour. Go away or I'll call the guards.
Ah, don't. Ah, don't. I only want to go to confession. I'm doomed. You're drunk and you're not in a proper spirit of repentance.
He closes the door in my face. Another door closed in the face, but
I'm sixteen tomorrow and I ring again. The brother opens the door, swings me around, kicks my arse and sends me tripping down the steps.
He says, Ring this bell again and I'll break your hand.
Jesuit brothers are not supposed to talk like that. They're supposed to be like Our Lord, not walking the world threatening people's hands.
I'm dizzy. I'll go home to bed. I hold on to railings along Barrington Street and keep to the wall going down the lane. Mam is by the fire smoking a Woodbine, my brothers upstairs in the bed. She says, That's a nice state to come home in.
It's hard to talk but I tell her I had my first pint with Uncle Pa. No father to get me the first pint.
Your Uncle Pa should know better.
I stagger to a chair and she says, Just like your father. I try to control the way my tongue moves in my mouth. I'd rather be, I'd rather, rather be like my father than Laman Griffin.
She turns away from me and looks into the ashes in the range but I won't leave her alone because I had my pint, two pints, and I'm sixteen tomorrow, a man.
Did you hear me? I'd rather be like my father than Laman Griffin. She stands up and faces me. Mind your tongue, she says.
Mind your own bloody tongue.
Don't talk to me like that. I'm your mother.
I'll talk to you any bloody way I like.
You have a mouth like a messenger boy.
Do I? Do I? Well, I'd rather be a messenger boy than the likes of
Laman Griffin oul' drunkard with the snotty nose and his loft and people climbing up there with him.
She walks away from me and I follow her upstairs to the small room. She turns, Leave me alone, leave me alone, and I keep barking at her,
Laman Griffin, Laman Griffin, till she pushes me, Get out of this room, and I slap her on the cheek so that tears jump in her eyes and there's a small whimpering sound from her, You'll never have the chance to do that again, and I back away from her because there's another sin on my long list and I'm ashamed of myself.
I fall into my bed, clothes and all, and wake up in the middle of the night puking on my pillow, my brothers complaining of the stink, telling me clean up, I'm a disgrace. I hear my mother crying and I want to tell her I'm sorry but why should I after what she did with Laman Griffin.
In the morning my small brothers are gone to school, Malachy is out looking for a job, Mam is at the fire drinking tea. I place my wages on the table by her elbow and turn to go. She says, Do you want a cup of tea?
No.
'Tis your birthday.
I don't care.
She calls up the lane after me, You should have something in your
stomach, but I give her my back and turn the corner without answering. I still want to tell her I'm sorry but if I do I'll want to tell her she's the cause of it all, that she should not have climbed to the loft that night and I don't give a fiddler's fart anyway because I'm still writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane and saving to go to America.
I have the whole day before I go to Mrs. Finucane to write the threatening letters and I wander down Henry Street till the rain drives me into the Franciscan church where St. Francis stands with his birds and lambs. I look at him and wonder why I ever prayed to him. No, I didn't pray, I begged.
I begged him to intercede for Theresa Carmody but he never did a thing, stood up there on his pedestal with the little smile, the birds, the lambs, and didn't give a fiddler's fart about Theresa or me.
I'm finished with you, St. Francis. Moving on. Francis. I don't know why they ever gave me that name. I'd be better off if they called me Malachy, one a king, the other a great saint. Why didn't you heal Theresa? Why did you let her go to hell? You let my mother climb to the loft. You let me get into a state of doom. Little children's shoes scattered in concentration camps. I have the abscess again. It's in my chest and I'm hungry.
St. Francis is no help, he won't stop the tears bursting out of my two eyes, the sniffling and choking and the God oh Gods that have me on my knees with my head on the back of the pew before me and I'm so weak with the hunger and the crying I could fall on the floor and would you please help me God or St. Francis because I'm sixteen today and I hit my mother and sent Theresa to hell and wanked all over Limerick and the county beyond and I dread the millstone around my neck.
There is an arm around my shoulders, a brown robe, click of black rosary beads, a Franciscan priest.
My child, my child, my child.
I'm a child and I lean against him, little Frankie on his father's lap, tell me all about Cuchulain, Dad, my story that Malachy can't have or Freddie Leibowitz on the swings.
My child, sit here with me. Tell me what troubles you. Only if you want to. I am Father Gregory.
I'm sixteen today, Father.
Oh, lovely, lovely, and why should that be a trouble to you?
I drank my first pint last night.
Yes? I hit my mother.
God help us, my child. But He will forgive you. Is there anything
else?
I can't tell you, Father.
Would you like to go to confession?
I can't, Father. I did terrible things.
God forgives all who repent. He sent His only Beloved Son to die
for us.
I can't tell, Father. I can't.
But you could tell St. Francis, couldn't you?
He doesn't help me anymore.
But you love him, don't you?
I do. My name is Francis.
Then tell him. We'll sit here and you'll tell him the things that
trouble you. If I sit and listen it will only be a pair of ears for St. Francis and Our Lord. Won't that help?
I talk to St. Francis and tell him about Margaret, Oliver, Eugene, my father singing Roddy McCorley and bringing home no money, my father sending no money from England, Theresa and the green sofa, my terrible sins on Carrigogunnell, why couldn't they hang Hermann Goering for what he did to the little children with shoes scattered around concentration camps, the Christian Brother who closed the door in my face, the time they wouldn't let me be an altar boy, my small brother Michael walking up the lane with the broken shoe clacking, my bad eyes that I'm ashamed of, the Jesuit brother who closed the door in my face, the tears in Mam's eyes when I slapped her.
Father Gregory says, Would you like to sit and be silent, perhaps pray a few minutes?
His brown robe is rough against my cheek and there's a smell of soap. He looks at St. Francis and the tabernacle and nods and I suppose he's talking to God. Then he tells me kneel, gives me absolution, tells me say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, three Glory Bes. He tells me God forgives me and I must forgive myself, that God loves me and I must love myself for only when you love God in yourself can you love all God's creatures.
But I want to know about Theresa Carmody in hell, Father.
No, my child. She is surely in heaven. She suffered like the martyrs in olden times and God knows that's penance enough. You can be sure the sisters in the hospital didn't let her die without a priest.
Are you sure, Father?
I am, my child.
He blesses me again, asks me to pray for him, and I'm happy
trotting through the rainy streets of Limerick knowing Theresa is in heaven with the cough gone.
Monday morning and it's dawn in the railway station. Newspapers and magazines are piled in bundles along the platform wall. Mr. McCaffrey is there with another boy, Willie Harold, cutting the twine on the bundles, counting, entering the count in a ledger. English newspapers and The Irish Times have to be delivered early, magazines later in the morning. We count out the papers and label them for delivery to shops around the city.
Mr. McCaffrey drives the van and stays at the wheel while Willie and I run into shops with bundles and take orders for the next day, add or drop in the ledger. After the papers are delivered we unload the magazines at the office and go home to breakfast for fifty minutes.
When I return to the office there are two other boys, Eamon and Peter, already sorting magazines, counting and stuffing them into news agents' boxes along the wall. Small orders are delivered by Gerry Halvey on his messenger bicycle, big orders in the van. Mr. McCaffrey tells me stay in the office so that I can learn to count magazines and enter them in the ledger. The minute Mr. McCaffrey leaves Eamon and Peter pull out a drawer where they hide cigarette butts and light up. They can't believe I don't smoke. They want to know if there's something wrong with me, the bad eyes or the consumption maybe. How can you go out with a girl if you don't smoke? Peter says, Wouldn't you be a right eejit if you were going out the road with the girl and she asked you for a fag and you said you didn't smoke, wouldn't you be a right eejit then? How would you ever get her into a field for a bit of a feel? Eamon says, 'Tis what my father says about men who don't drink, they're not to be trusted. Peter says if you find a man that won't drink or smoke that's a man that's not even interested in girls and you'd want to keep your hand over the hole of your arse, that's what you'd want to be doing.
They laugh and that brings on the cough and the more they laugh the more they cough till they're holding on to one another banging one another between the shoulder blades and wiping tears from their cheeks. When the fit passes we pick out English and American magazines and look at the advertisements for women's underwear, brassieres and panties and long nylon stockings. Eamon is looking at an American magazine called See with pictures of Japanese girls who keep the soldiers happy so far away from home and Eamon says he has to go to the lavatory and when he does Peter gives me a wink, You know what he's up to in there, don't you? and sometimes Mr. McCaffrey gets into a state when boys linger in the lavatory interfering with themselves and wasting the valuable time for which Easons is paying them and on top of it putting their immortal souls in danger. Mr. McCaffrey won't come right out and say, Stop that wanking, because you can't accuse someone of a mortal sin unless you have proof. Sometimes he goes snooping in the lavatory when a boy comes out. He comes back himself with the threatening look and tells the boys, Ye are not to be looking at those dirty magazines from foreign parts. Ye are to count them and put them in the boxes and that's all.
Eamon comes back from the lavatory and Peter goes in with an American magazine, Collier's, that has pictures of girls in a beauty contest. Eamon says, Do you know what he's doing in there? At himself. Five times a day he goes in. Every time a new American magazine comes in with the women's underwear he goes in. Never done going at himself. Borrows magazines to take home unbeknownst to Mr. McCaffrey and God knows what he does with himself and the magazines all night. If he fell dead in there the jaws of hell would open wide.
I'd like to get into the lavatory myself when Peter comes out but I don't want them saying, There he goes, new boy, first day on the job, already at himself. Won't light up a fag oh no but wanks away like an oul' billygoat.
Mr. McCaffrey returns from van delivery and wants to know why all the magazines aren't counted out, bundled and ready to go. Peter tells him, We were busy teaching the new boy, McCourt. God help us, he was a
bit slow with the bad eyes you know but we kept at him and now he's getting faster.
Gerry Halvey, the messenger boy, won't be in for a week because he's entitled to his holidays and he wants to spend the time with his girlfriend, Rose, who's coming back from England. I'm the new boy and I have to be messenger boy while he's gone, cycling around Limerick on the bicycle with the big metal basket in front. He shows me how to balance papers and magazines so that the bicycle won't tip over with me in the saddle and a lorry passing by that will run over me and leave me like a piece of salmon in the road. He saw a soldier once that was run over by an army lorry and that's what he looked like, salmon.
Gerry is making a last delivery at Easons kiosk at the railway station at noon on Saturday and that's handy because I can meet him there to get the bicycle and he can meet Rose off the train. We stand at the gate waiting and he tells me he hasn't seen Rose in a year. She's over there working in a pub in Bristol and he doesn't like that one bit because the English are forever pawing the Irish girls, hands up under the skirts and worse, and the Irish girls are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their jobs. Everyone knows Irish girls keep themselves pure especially Limerick girls known the world over for their purity who have a man to come back to like Gerry Halvey himself. He'll be able to tell if she was true to him by her walk. If a girl comes back after a year with a certain class of a walk that's different from the one she went away with then you know she was up to no good with the Englishmen dirty horny bastards that they are.
The train hoots into the station and Gerry waves and points to Rose coming toward us from the far end of the train, Rose smiling away with her white teeth and lovely in a green dress. Gerry stops waving and mutters under his breath, Look at the walk on her, bitch, hoor, street walker, flaghopper, trollop, and runs from the station. Rose walks up to me, Was that Gerry Halvey you were standing with?
'Twas.
Where is he?
Oh, he went out.
I know he went out. Where did he go?
I don't know. He didn't tell me. He just ran out.
Didn't say anything?
I didn't hear him say anything.
Do you work with him?
I do. I'm taking over the bike.
What bike?
The messenger bike.
Is he on a messenger bike?
He is.
He told me he worked in Easons office, clerk, inside job?
I feel desperate. I don't want to make a liar of Gerry Halvey, to
get him into trouble with the lovely Rose. Oh, we all take turns on the messenger bike. An hour in the office, an hour on the bike. The manager says 'tis good to get out in the fresh air.
Well, I'll just go home and put my suitcase down and go to his house. I thought he'd carry this for me.
I have the bike here and you can stick the case in the basket and I'll walk you home.
We walk up to her house in Carey's Road and she tells me she's so excited about Gerry. She saved her money in England and now she wants to go back with him and get married even if he's only nineteen and she's only seventeen. What matter when you're in love. I lived like a nun in England and dreamt of him every night and thank you very much for carrying my case.
I turn away to jump on the bike and cycle back to Easons when Gerry comes at me from behind. His face is red and he's snorting like a bull. What were you doing with my girl, you little shite? Eh? What? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you did anything with my girl I'll kill you.
I didn't do anything. Carried her case because 'twas heavy. Don't look at her again or you're dead.
I won't, Gerry. I don't want to look at her.
Oh, is that a fact? Is she ugly or what?
No, no, Gerry, she's yours and she loves you. How do you know?
She told me.
She did?
She did, honest to God.
Jasus.
He bangs on her door, Rose, Rose, are you there? and she comes out,
Of course, I'm here, and I ride away on the messenger bicycle with the sign on the basket that says Easons wondering about the way he's kissing her now and the terrible things he said about her in the station and wondering how Peter in the office could tell Mr. McCaffrey a barefaced lie about me and my eyes when all the time he and Eamon were looking at girls in their underwear and then going at themselves in the lavatory.
Mr. McCaffrey is in a terrible state in the office. Where were you? Great God above in heaven, does it take you all day to cycle from the railway station? We have an emergency here and we should have Halvey but he's gone off on his friggin' holidays, God forgive the language, and you'll have to cycle around as fast as you can, good thing you were a telegram boy that knows every inch of Limerick, and go to every bloody shop that's a customer and walk right in grab whatever copies you see of John O'London's Weekly tear out page sixteen and if anyone bothers you tell them 'tis government orders and they're not to interfere in government business and if they lay a finger on you they're liable to arrest, imprisonment and a large fine now go for God's sake and bring back every page sixteen you tear out so that we can burn them here in the fire.
Every shop, Mr. McCaffrey?
I'll do the big ones, you do the small ones all the way to Ballinacurra and out the Ennis Road and beyond, God help us. Go on, go.
I'm jumping on the bike and Eamon runs down the steps. Hey, McCourt, wait. Listen. Don't give him all the page sixteens when you come back.
Why?
We can sell 'em, me an' Peter.
Why?
'Tis all about birth control and that's banned in Ireland.
What's birth control?
Aw, Christ above, don't you know anything? 'Tis condoms, you know,
rubbers, French letters, things like that to stop the girls from getting up the pole.
Up the pole?
Pregnant. Sixteen years of age an' you're pure ignorant. Hurry up an' get the pages before everybody starts runnin' to the shop for John O'London's Weekly.
I'm about to push away on the bike when Mr. McCaffrey runs down the steps. Hold on, McCourt, we'll go in the van. Eamon, you come with us.
What about Peter?
Leave him. He'll wind up with a magazine in the lavatory anyway. Mr. McCaffrey talks to himself in the van. Nice bloody how do you
do ringing down here from Dublin on a fine Saturday to send us tearing around Limerick ripping pages out of an English magazine when I could be at home with a cup of tea and a nice bun and a read of The Irish Press with my feet up on a box under the picture of the Sacred Heart nice bloody how do you do entirely.
Mr. McCaffrey runs into every shop with us behind him. He grabs the magazines, hands each of us a pile and tells us start tearing. Shop owners scream at him, What are ye doing? Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph, is it pure mad ye are? Put back them magazines or I'll call the guards.
Mr. McCaffrey tells them, Government orders, ma'am. There is filth in John O'London this week that's not fit for any Irish eyes and we are here to do God's work. What filth?
What filth? Show me the filth before ye go mutilatin' the magazines. I won't pay Easons for these magazines, so I won't.
Ma'am, we don't care at Easons. We'd rather lose large amounts than have the people of Limerick and Ireland corrupted by this filth.
What filth?
Can't tell you. Come on, boys.
We throw the pages on the floor of the van and when Mr. McCaffrey
is in a shop arguing we stuff some into our shirts. There are old magazines in the van and we tear and scatter them so that Mr. McCaffrey will think they're all page sixteen from John O'London.
The biggest customer for the magazine, Mr. Hutchinson, tells Mr. McCaffrey get to hell out of his shop or he'll brain him, get away from them magazines, and when Mr. McCaffrey keeps on tearing out pages Mr. Hutchinson throws him into the street, Mr. McCaffrey yelling that this is a Catholic country and just because Hutchinson is a Protestant that doesn't give him the right to sell filth in the holiest city in Ireland. Mr. Hutchinson says, Ah, kiss my arse, and Mr. McCaffrey says, See, boys? See what happens when you're not a member of the True Church?
Some shops says they've already sold all their copies of John O'London and Mr. McCaffrey says, Oh, Mother o'God, what's going to become of us all? Who did ye sell them to?
He demands the names and address of the customers who are in danger of losing their immortal souls from reading articles on birth control. He will go to their houses and rip out that filthy page but the shopkeepers say, 'Tis Saturday night, McCaffrey, and getting dark and would you ever take a good running jump for yourself.
On the way back to the office Eamon whispers to me in the back of the van, I have twenty-one pages. How many do you have? I tell him fourteen but I have over forty and I'm not telling him because you never have to tell the truth to people who lie about your bad eyes. Mr. McCaffrey tells us bring in the pages from the van. We scoop up everything on the floor and he's happy sitting at his desk at the other end of the office ringing Dublin to tell them how he stormed through
shops like God's avenger and saved Limerick from the horrors of birth control while he watches a dancing fire of pages that have nothing to do with John O'London's Weekly.
Monday morning I cycle through the streets delivering magazines and people see the Easons sign on the bike and stop me to see if there's any chance they could get their hands on a copy of John O'London's Weekly. They're all rich looking people, some in motor cars, men with hats, collars and ties, and two fountain pens in their pockets, women with hats and little bits of fur dangling from their shoulders, people who have tea at the Savoy or the Stella and stick out their little fingers to show how well bred they are and now want to read this page about birth control.
Eamon told me early in the day, Don't sell the bloody page for less than five shillings. I asked him if he was joking. No, he wasn't. Everyone in Limerick is talking about this page and they're dying to get their hands on it.
Five shillings or nothing, Frankie. If they're rich charge more but that's what I'm charging so don't be going around on your bicycle and puttin' me out of business with low prices. We have to give Peter something or he'll be running to McCaffrey and spilling the beans.
Some people are willing to pay seven shillings and sixpence and I'm rich in two days with over ten pounds in my pocket minus one for Peter the snake, who would betray us to McCaffrey. I put eight pounds in the post office for my fare to America and that night we have a big supper of ham, tomatoes, bread, butter, jam. Mam wants to know if I won the sweepstakes and I tell her people give me tips. She's not happy I'm a messenger boy because that's the lowest you can drop in Limerick but if it brings in ham like this we should light a candle in gratitude. She doesn't know the money for my fare is growing in the post office and she'd die if she knew what I was earning from writing threatening letters.
Malachy has a new job in the stockroom of a garage handing out parts to mechanics and Mam herself is taking care of an old man, Mr. Sliney, out in the South Circular Road while his two daughters go off to work every day. She tells me if I'm delivering papers out there to come to the house for tea and a sandwich. The daughters will never know and the old man won't mind because he's only half conscious most of the time worn out from all his years in the English army in India.
She looks peaceful in the kitchen of this house in her spotless apron, everything clean and polished around her, flowers bobbing in the garden beyond, birds chirping away, music from Radio Eireann on the wireless. She sits at the table with a pot of tea, cups and saucers, plenty of bread, butter, cold meats of all kinds. I can have any class of a sandwich but all I know is ham and brawn. She doesn't have any brawn because that's the kind of thing you'd find people eating in lanes not in a house on the South Circular Road. She says the rich won't eat brawn because it's what they scoop off floors and counters in bacon factories and you never know what you're getting. The rich are very particular about what they stick between two slices of bread. Over in America brawn is called head cheese and she doesn't know why.
She gives me a ham sandwich with juicy slices of tomato and tea in a cup with little pink angels flying around shooting arrows at other little flying angels who are blue and I wonder why they can't make teacups and chamber pots without all kinds of angels and maidens cavorting in the glen. Mam says that's the way the rich are, they love
the bit of decoration and wouldn't we if we had the money. She'd give her two eyes to have a house like this with flowers and birds abroad in the garden and the wireless playing that lovely Warsaw Concerto or the Dream of Olwyn and no end of cups and saucers with angels shooting arrows.
She says she has to look in on Mr. Sliney he's so old and feeble he forgets to call for the chamber pot.
Chamber pot? You have to empty his chamber pot?
Of course I do. There's a silence here because I think we're remembering the cause of all our troubles, Laman Griffin's chamber pot. But that was a long time ago and now it's Mr. Sliney's chamber pot, which is no harm because she's paid for this and he's harmless. When she comes back she tells me Mr. Sliney would like to see me, so come in while he's awake.
He's lying in a bed in the front parlor, the window blocked with a black sheet, no sign of light. He tells my mother, Lift me up a bit, missus, and pull back that bloody thing off the window so I can see the boy. He has long white hair down to his shoulders. Mam whispers he won't let anyone cut it. He says, I have me own teeth, son. Would you credit that? Do you have your own teeth, son?
I do, Mr. Sliney.
Ah. I was in India you know. Me and Timoney up the road. Bunch of Limerick men in India. Do you know Timoney, son?
I did, Mr. Sliney.
He's dead, you know. Poor bugger went blind. I have me sight. I have me teeth. Keep your teeth, son.
I will, Mr. Sliney.
I'm getting tired, son, but there's one thing I want to tell you. Are you listening to me?
I am, Mr. Sliney.
Is he listening to me, missus?
Oh, he is, Mr. Sliney.
Good. Now here's what I want to tell you. Lean over here so I can
whisper in your ear. What I want to tell you is, Never smoke another man's pipe.
***
Halvey goes off to England with Rose and I have to stay on the messenger bike all through the winter. It's a bitter winter, ice everywhere, and I never know when the bike will go out from under me and send me flying into the street or onto the pavement, magazines and papers scattered. Shops complain to Mr. McCaffrey that The Irish Times is coming in decorated with bits of ice and dog shit and he mutters to us that's the way that paper should be delivered, Protestant rag that it is.
Every day after my deliveries I take The Irish Times home and read it to see where the danger is. Mam says it's a good thing Dad isn't here. He'd say, Is this what the men of Ireland fought and died for that my own son is sitting there at the kitchen table reading the freemason paper?
There are letters to the editor from people all over Ireland claiming they heard the first cuckoo of the year and you can read between the lines that people are calling each other liars. There are reports about Protestant weddings and pictures and the women always look lovelier than the ones we know in the lanes. You can see Protestant women have perfect teeth although Halvey's Rose had lovely teeth.
I keep reading The Irish Times and wondering if it's an occasion of sin though I don't care. As long as Theresa Carmody is in heaven not
coughing I don't go to confession anymore. I read The Irish Times and TheTimes of London because that tells me what the King is up to every day and what Elizabeth and Margaret are doing.
I read English women's magazines for all the food articles and the answers to women's questions. Peter and Eamon put on English accents and pretend they're reading from English women's magazines.
Peter says, Dear Miss Hope, I'm going out with a fellow from Ireland named McCaffrey and he has his hands all over me and his thing pushing against my belly button and I'm demented not knowing what to do. I remain, yours anxiously, Miss Lulu Smith, Yorkshire.
Eamon says, Dear Lulu, If this McCaffrey is that tall that he's pushing his yoke against your belly button I suggest you find a smaller man who will slip it between your thighs. Surely you can find a decent short man in Yorkshire.
Dear Miss Hope, I am thirteen years old with black hair and something terrible is happening and I can't tell anyone not even my mother. I'm bleeding every few weeks you know where and I'm afraid I'll be found out. Miss Agnes Tripple, Little Biddle-on-the-Twiddle, Devon.
Dear Agnes, You are to be congratulated. You are now a woman and you can get your hair permed because you are having your monthlies. Do not fear your monthlies for all Englishwomen have them. They are a gift of God to purify us so that we can have stronger children for the empire, soldiers to keep the Irish in their place. In some parts of the world a woman with a monthly is unclean but we British cherish our women with the monthlies, oh we do indeed.
In the springtime there's a new messenger boy and I'm back in the office. Peter and Eamon drift off to England. Peter is fed up with Limerick, no girls, and you're driven to yourself, wank wank wank, that's all we ever do in Limerick. There are new boys. I'm senior boy and the job is easier because I'm fast and when Mr. McCaffrey is out in the van and my work is done I read the English, Irish, American magazines and papers. Day and night I dream of America.
Malachy goes to England to work in a rich Catholic boys' boarding school and he walks around cheerful and smiling as if he's the equal of any boy in the school and everyone knows when you work in an English boarding school you're supposed to hang your head and shuffle like a proper Irish servant. They fire him for his ways and Malachy tells them they can kiss his royal Irish arse and they say that's the kind of foul language and behavior you'd expect. He gets a job in the gas works in Coventry shoveling coal into the furnaces like Uncle Pa Keating, shoveling coal and waiting for the day he can go to America after me.

I'm seventeen, eighteen, going on nineteen, working away at Easons, writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane, who says she's not long for this world and the more Masses said for her soul the better she'll feel. She puts money in envelopes and sends me to churches around the city to knock on priests' doors, hand in the envelopes with the request for Masses. She wants prayers from all the priests but the Jesuits. She says, They're useless, all head and no heart. That's what they should
have over their door in Latin and I won't give them a penny because every penny you give a Jesuit goes to a fancy book or a bottle of wine.
She sends the money, she hopes the Masses are said, but she's never sure and if she's not sure why should I be handing out all that money to priests when I need the money to go to America and if I keep back a few pounds for myself and put it in the post office who will ever know the difference and if I say a prayer for Mrs. Finucane and light candles for her soul when she dies won't God listen even if I'm a sinner long past my last confession.
I'll be nineteen in a month. All I need is a few pounds to make up the fare and a few pounds in my pocket when I land in America.
The Friday night before my nineteenth birthday Mrs. Finucane sends me for the sherry. When I return she is dead in the chair, her eyes wide open, and her purse on the floor wide open. I can't look at her but I help myself to a roll of money. Seventeen pounds. I take the key to the trunk upstairs. I take forty of the hundred pounds in the trunk and the ledger. I'll add this to what I have in the post office and I have enough to go to America. On my way out I take the sherry bottle to save it from being wasted.
I sit by the River Shannon near the dry docks sipping Mrs. Finucane's sherry. Aunt Aggie's name is in the ledger. She owes nine pounds. It might have been the money she spent on my clothes a long time ago but now she'll never have to pay it because I heave the ledger into the river. I'm sorry I'll never be able to tell Aunt Aggie I saved her nine pounds. I'm sorry I wrote threatening letters to the poor people in the lanes of Limerick, my own people, but the ledger is gone, no one will ever know what they owe and they won't have to pay their balances. I wish I could tell them, I'm your Robin Hood.
Another sip of the sherry. I'll spare a pound or two for a Mass for Mrs. Finucane's soul. Her ledger is well on its way down the Shannon and out to the Atlantic and I know I'll follow it someday soon.
The man at O'Riordan's Travel Agency says he can't get me to America by air unless I travel to London first, which would cost a fortune. He can put me on a ship called the Irish Oak, which will be leaving Cork in a few weeks. He says, Nine days at sea, September October, best time of the year, your own cabin, thirteen passengers, best of food, bit of a holiday for yourself and that will cost fifty-five pounds, do you have it?
I do.
I tell Mam I'm going in a few weeks and she cries. Michael says, Will we all go some day?
We will.
Alphie says, Will you send me a cowboy hat and a thing you throw that comes back to you?
Michael tells him that's a boomerang and you'd have to go all the way to Australia to get the likes of that, you can't get it in America.
Alphie says you can get it in America yes you can and they argue about America and Australia and boomerangs till Mam says, For the love o' Jesus, yeer brother is leaving us and the two of ye are there squabbling over boomerangs. Will ye give over?
Mam says we'll have to have a bit of party the night before I go. They used to have parties in the old days when anyone would go to America, which was so far away the parties were called American wakes because the family never expected to see the departing one again in this
life. She says 'tis a great pity Malachy can't come back from England but we'll be together in America someday with the help of God and His Blessed Mother.
On my days off from work I walk around Limerick and look at all the places we lived, the Windmill Street, Hartstonge Street, Roden Lane, Rosbrien Road, Little Barrington Street, which is really a lane. I stand looking at Theresa Carmody's house till her mother comes out and says, What do you want? I sit at the graves of Oliver and Eugene in the old St. Patrick's Burying Ground and cross the road to St. Lawrence's Cemetery where Theresa is buried. Wherever I go I hear voices of the dead and I wonder if they can follow you across the Atlantic Ocean.
I want to get pictures of Limerick stuck in my head in case I never come back. I sit in St. Joseph's Church and the Redemptorist church and tell myself take a good look because I might never see this again. I walk down Henry Street to say good-bye to St. Francis though I'm sure I'll be able to talk to him in America.
Now there are days I don't want to go to America. I'd like to go to O'Riordan's Travel Agency and get back my fifty-five pounds. I could wait till I'm twenty-one and Malachy can go with me so that I'll know at least one person in New York. I have strange feelings and sometimes when I'm sitting by the fire with Mam and my brothers I feel tears coming and I'm ashamed of myself for being weak. At first Mam laughs and tells me, Your bladder must be near your eye, but then Michael says, We'll all go to America, Dad will be there, Malachy will be there and we'll all be together, and she gets the tears herself and we sit there, the four of us, like weeping eejits.
Mam says this is the first time we ever had a party and isn't it a sad thing altogether that you have it when your children are slipping away one by one, Malachy to England, Frank to America. She saves a few shillings from her wages taking care of Mr. Sliney to buy bread, ham, brawn, cheese, lemonade and a few bottles of stout. Uncle Pa Keating brings stout, whiskey and a little sherry for Aunt Aggie's delicate stomach and she brings a cake loaded with currants and raisins she baked herself. The Abbot brings six bottles of stout and says, That's all right, Frankie, ye can all drink it as long as I have a bottle or two for meself to help me sing me song.
He sings ""The Road to Rasheen. "" He holds his stout, closes his eyes, and song comes out in a high whine. The words make no sense and everyone wonders why tears are seeping from his shut eyes. Alphie whispers to me, Why is he crying over a song that makes no sense?
I don't know.
The Abbot ends his song, opens his eyes, wipes his cheeks and tells us that was a sad song about an Irish boy that went to America and got shot by gangsters and died before a priest could reach his side and he tells me don't be gettin' shot if you're not near a priest.
Uncle Pa says that's the saddest song he ever heard and is there any chance we could have something lively. He calls on Mam and she says, Ah, no, Pa, sure I don't have the wind.
Come on, Angela, come on. One voice now, one voice and one voice
only.
All right. I'll try.
We all join in the chorus of her sad song,
A mother's love is a blessing No matter where you roam. Keep her while you have her,
You'll miss her when she's gone.
Uncle Pa says one song is worse than the one before and are we turning this night into a wake altogether, is there any chance someone would sing a song to liven up the proceedings or will he be driven to drink with the sadness.
Oh, God, says Aunt Aggie, I forgot. The moon is having an eclipse abroad this minute.
We stand out in the lane watching the moon disappear behind a round black shadow. Uncle Pa says, That's a very good sign for you going to America, Frankie.
No, says Aunt Aggie, 'tis a bad sign. I read in the paper that the moon is practicing for the end of the world.
Oh, end of the world my arse, says Uncle Pa. 'Tis the beginning for Frankie McCourt. He'll come back in a few years with a new suit and fat on his bones like any Yank and a lovely girl with white teeth hangin' from his arm.
Mam says, Ah, no, Pa, ah, no, and they take her inside and comfort her with a drop of sherry from Spain.
It's late in the day when the Irish Oak sails from Cork, past Kinsale and Cape Clear, and dark when lights twinkle on Mizen Head, the last of Ireland I'll see for God knows how long.
Surely I should have stayed, taken the post office examination, climbed in the world. I could have brought in enough money for Michael and Alphie to go to school with proper shoes and bellies well filled. We could have moved from the lane to a street or even an avenue where houses have gardens. I should have taken that examination and Mam would never again have to empty the chamber pots of Mr. Sliney or anyone else.
It's too late now. I'm on the ship and there goes Ireland into the night and it's foolish to be standing on this deck looking back and thinking of my family and Limerick and Malachy and my father in England and even more foolish that songs are going through my head Roddy McCorley goes to die and Mam gasping Oh the days of the Kerry dancing with poor Mr. Clohessy hacking away in the bed and now I want Ireland back at least I had Mam and my brothers and Aunt Aggie bad as she was and Uncle Pa, standing me my first pint, and my bladder is near my eye and here's a priest standing by me on the deck and you can see he's curious.
He's a Limerickman but he has an American accent from his years in Los Angeles. He knows how it is to leave Ireland, did it himself and never got over it. You live in Los Angeles with sun and palm trees day in day out and you ask God if there's any chance He could give you one soft rainy Limerick day.
The priest sits beside me at the table of the First Officer, who tells us ship's orders have been changed and instead of sailing to New York we're bound for Montreal.
Three days out and orders are changed again. We are going to New York after all.
Three American passengers complain, Goddam Irish. Can't they get it straight?
The day before we sail into New York orders are changed again. We are going to a place up the Hudson River called Albany.
The Americans say, Albany? Goddam Albany? Why the hell did we have to sail on a goddam Irish tub? Goddam.
The priest tells me pay no attention. All Americans are not like that.
I'm on deck the dawn we sail into New York. I'm sure I'm in a film, that it will end and lights will come up in the Lyric Cinema. The priest wants to point out things but he doesn't have to. I can pick out the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Brooklyn Bridge. There are thousands of cars speeding along the roads and the sun turns everything to gold. Rich Americans in top hats white ties and tails must be going home to bed with the gorgeous women with white teeth. The rest are going to work in warm comfortable offices and no one has a care in the world.
The Americans are arguing with the captain and a man who climbed aboard from a tugboat. Why can't we get off here? Why do we have to sail all the goddam way to goddam Albany?
The man says, Because you're passengers on the vessel and the captain is the captain and we have no procedures for taking you ashore.
Oh, yeah. Well, this is a free country and we're American citizens.
Is that a fact? Well, you're on an Irish ship with an Irish captain and you'll do what he goddam tells you or swim ashore.
He climbs down the ladder, tugboat chugs away, and we sail up the Hudson past Manhattan, under the George Washington Bridge, past hundreds of Liberty ships that did their bit in the war, moored now and ready to rot.
The captain announces the tide will force us to drop anchor overnight opposite a place called, the priest spells it for me, Poughkeepsie. The priest says that's an Indian name and the Americans say goddam Poughkeepsie.
After dark a small boat put-puts to the ship and an Irish voice calls up, Hello, there. Bejasus, I saw the Irish flag, so I did. Couldn't believe me two eyes. Hello, there.
He invites the First Officer to go ashore for a drink and bring a friend and, You, too, Father. Bring a friend.
The priest invites me and we climb down a ladder to the small boat with the First Officer and the Wireless Officer. The man in the boat says his name is Tim Boyle from Mayo God help us and we docked there at the right time because there's a bit of a party and we're all invited. He takes us to a house with a lawn, a fountain and three pink birds standing on one leg. There are five women in a room called a living room. The women have stiff hair, spotless frocks. They have glasses in their hands and they're friendly and smile with perfect teeth. One says, Come right in. Just in time for the pawty.
Pawty. That's the way they talk and I suppose I'll be talking like that in a few years.
Tim Boyle tells us the girls are having a bit of a time while their husbands are away overnight hunting deer, and one woman, Betty, says, Yeah. Buddies from the war. That war is over nearly five years and they can't get over it so they shoot animals every weekend and drink Rheingold till they can't see. Goddam war, excuse the language, Fawder.
The priest whispers to me, These are bad women. We won't stay here long.
The bad women say, Whatcha like to drink? We got everything. What's your name, honey?
Frank McCourt.
Nice name. So you take a little drink. All the Irish take a little drink. You like a beer?
Yes, please. Gee, so polite. I like the Irish. My grandmother was half Irish so that makes me half, quarter? I dunno. My name is Frieda. So here's your beer, honey.
The priest sits at the end of a sofa which they call a couch and two women talk to him. Betty asks the First Officer if he'd like to see the house and he says, Oh, I would, because we don't have houses like this in Ireland. Another woman tells the Wireless Officer he should see what they have growing in the garden, you wouldn't believe the flowers. Frieda asks me if I'm okay and I tell her yes but would she mind telling me where the lavatory is.
The what?
Lavatory.
Oh, you mean the bathroom. Right this way, honey, down the hall. Thanks.
She pushes in the door, turns on the light, kisses my cheek and
whispers she'll be right outside if I need anything.
I stand at the toilet bowl firing away and wonder what I'd need at
a time like this and if this is a common thing in America, women waiting outside while you take a splash.
I finish, flush and go outside. She takes my hand and leads me into a bedroom, puts down her glass, locks the door, pushes me down on the bed. She's fumbling at my fly. Damn buttons. Don't you have zippers in Ireland? She pulls out my excitement climbs up on me slides up and down up and down Jesus I'm in heaven and there's a knock on the door the priest Frank are you in there Frieda putting her finger to her lips and her eyes rolling to heaven Frank are you in there Father would you ever take a good running jump for yourself and oh God oh Theresa do you see what's happening to me at long last I don't give a fiddler's fart if the Pope himself knocked on this door and the College of Cardinals gathered gawking at the windows oh God the whole inside of me is gone into her and she collapses on me and tells me I'm wonderful and would I ever consider settling in Poughkeepsie.
Frieda tells the priest I had a bit of a dizziness after going to the bathroom, that's what happens when you travel and you're drinking a strange beer like Rheingold, which she believes they don't have in Ireland. I can see the priest doesn't believe her and I can't stop the way the heat is coming and going in my face. He already wrote down my mother's name and address and now I'm afraid he'll write and say your fine son spent his first night in America in a bedroom in Poughkeepsie romping with a woman whose husband was away shooting deer for a bit of relaxation after doing his bit for America in the war and isn't this a fine way to treat the men who fought for their country.
The First Officer and the Wireless Officer return from their tours of the house and the garden and they don't look at the priest. The women tell us we must be starving and they go into the kitchen. We sit in the living room saying nothing to each other and listening to the women whispering and laughing in the kitchen. The priest whispers to me again, Bad women, bad women, occasion of sin, and I don't know what to say to him.
The bad women bring out sandwiches and pour more beer and when we finish eating they put on Frank Sinatra records and ask if anyone would like to dance. No one says yes because you'd never get up and dance with bad women in the presence of a priest, so the women dance with each other and laugh as if they all had little secrets. Tim Boyle drinks whiskey and
falls asleep in a corner till Frieda wakes him and tells him take us back to the ship. When we're leaving Frieda leans toward me as if she might kiss my cheek but the priest says good night in a very sharp way and no one shakes hands. As we walk down the street to the river we hear the women laughing, tinkling and bright in the night air.
We climb the ladder and Tim calls to us from his little boat, Mind yourselves going up that ladder. Oh, boys, oh, boys, wasn't that a grand night? Good night, boys, and good night, Father.
We watch his little boat till it disappears into the dark of the Pough- keepsie riverbank. The priest says good night and goes below and the First Officer follows him.
I stand on the deck with the Wireless Officer looking at the lights of America twinkling. He says, My God, that was a lovely night, Frank. Isn't this a great country altogether?

How 'bout a big hand now (wa-wait a minute)

Groovy groovy jazzy funky pounce bounce dance
As we dip in the melodic sea
Rhythm keeps flowin', drip's the MC
Sweet sugar pop sugar pop rocks
Pop you don't stop til the sweet beat drops
I show and prove as I stick and move
Every poem's recited on top of the groove
Smooth, my, floatin' like a butterfly
Notes that I float, sung like a lullaby
Brace yourself as the beat hits ya, dip trip, flip fantasia

Feel the beat drop, jazz and hip-hop
Drippin' in your dome makes you zone and bop
Funk and fusion a fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin' on the rhythm ya cruisin'
Up down, round and round, rhymes profound
But nevertheless you've got to get down
Fantasy freak through the beat so unique
You move your feet and sweat from the heat
Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhyme some will call me a poet
Poem steady flowin', growin' showin' sights and sounds
Caught in the groove in the tale I found
Many tripped the tour upon the rhymes they saw
To an infinite height, to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go, off I take ya, dip trip, flip fantasia

Jump to the jam, boogie woogie jam slam
Bust the dialect I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic master
Rhymin' on the mic I'll bring the suckers to disaster
Boukou ducks but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I fix the funky words into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow, verbs manifest

262,Dunkie Butt (Please Please Please),"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

266,"Old Times' Sake (From ""Above The Rim"")","I remember how, that night, I lay awake in the wagon-lit in a tender, delicious ecstasy of excitement, my burning cheek pressed against the impeccable linen of the pillow and the pounding of my heart mimicking that of the great pistons ceaselessly thrusting the train that bore me through the night, away from Paris, away from girlhood, away from the white, enclosed quietude of my mother's apartment, into the unguessable country of marriage.

And I remember I tenderly imagined how, at this very moment, my mother would be moving slowly about the narrow bedroom I had left behind for ever, folding up and putting away all my little relics, the tumbled garments I would not need any more, the scores for which there had been no room in my trunks, the concert programmes I'd abandoned; she would linger over this torn ribbon and that faded photograph with all the half-joyous, half-sorrowful emotions of a woman on her daughter's wedding day. And, in the midst of my bridal triumph, I felt a pang of loss as if, when he put the gold band on my finger, I had, in some way, ceased to be her child in becoming his wife.

Are you sure, she'd said when they delivered the gigantic box that held the wedding dress he'd bought me, wrapped up in tissue paper and red ribbon like a Christmas gift of crystallized fruit. Are you sure you love him? There was a dress for her, too; black silk, with the dull, prismatic sheen of oil on water, finer than anything she'd worn since that adventurous girlhood in Indo-China, daughter of a rich tea planter. My eagle-featured, indomitable mother; what other student at the Conservatoire could boast that her mother had outfaced a junkful of Chinese pirates, nursed a village through a visitation of the plague, shot a man-eating tiger with her own hand and all before she was as old as I?

'Are you sure you love him?'

'I'm sure I want to marry him,' I said.

And would say no more. She sighed, as if it was with reluctance that she might at last banish the spectre of poverty from its habitual place at our meagre table. For my mother herself had gladly, scandalously, defiantly beggared herself for love; and, one fine day, her gallant soldier never returned from the wars, leaving his wife and child a legacy of tears that never quite dried, a cigar box full of medals and the antique service revolver that my mother, grown magnificently eccentric in hardship, kept always in her reticule, in case--how I teased her--she was surprised by footpads on her way home from the grocer's shop.

Now and then a starburst of lights spattered the drawn blinds as if the railway company had lit up all the stations through which we passed in celebration of the bride. My satin nightdress had just been shaken from its wrappings; it had slipped over my young girl's pointed breasts and shoulders, supple as a garment of heavy water, and now teasingly caressed me, egregious, insinuating, nudging between my thighs as I shifted restlessly in my narrow berth. His kiss, his kiss with tongue and teeth in it and a rasp of beard, had hinted to me, though with the same exquisite tact as this nightdress he'd given me, of the wedding night, which would be voluptuously deferred until we lay in his great ancestral bed in the sea-girt, pinnacled domain that lay, still, beyond the grasp of my imagination ... that magic place, the fairy castle whose walls were made of foam, that legendary habitation in which he had been born. To which, one day, I might bear an heir. Our destination, my destiny.

Above the syncopated roar of the train, I could hear his even, steady breathing. Only the communicating door kept me from my husband and it stood open. If I rose up on my elbow, I could see the dark, leonine shape of his head and my nostrils caught a whiff of the opulent male scent of leather and spices that always accompanied him and sometimes, during his courtship, had been the only hint he gave me that he had come into my mother's sitting room, for, though he was a big man, he moved as softly as if all his shoes had soles of velvet, as if his footfall turned the carpet into snow.

He had loved to surprise me in my abstracted solitude at the piano. He would tell them not to announce him, then soundlessly open the door and softly creep up behind me with his bouquet of hot-house flowers or his box of marrons glacés, lay his offering upon the keys and clasp his hands over my eyes as I was lost in a Debussy prelude. But that perfume of spiced leather always betrayed him; after my first shock, I was forced always to mimic surprise, so that he would not be disappointed.

He was older than I. He was much older than I; there were streaks of pure silver in his dark mane. But his strange, heavy, almost waxen face was not lined by experience. Rather, experience seemed to have washed it perfectly smooth, like a stone on a beach whose fissures have been eroded by successive tides. And sometimes that face, in stillness when he listened to me playing, with the heavy eyelids folded over eyes that always disturbed me by their absolute absence of light, seemed to me like a mask, as if his real face, the face that truly reflected all the life he had led in the world before he met me, before, even, I was born, as though that face lay underneath this mask. Or else, elsewhere. As though he had laid by the face in which he had lived for so long in order to offer my youth a face unsigned by the years.

And, elsewhere, I might see him plain. Elsewhere. But, where?

In, perhaps, that castle to which the train now took us, that marvellous castle in which he had been born.

Even when he asked me to marry him, and I said: 'Yes,' still he did not lose that heavy, fleshy composure of his. I know it must seem a curious analogy, a man with a flower, but sometimes he seemed to me like a lily. Yes. A lily. Possessed of that strange, ominous calm of a sentient vegetable, like one of those cobra-headed, funereal lilies whose white sheaths are curled out of a flesh as thick and tensely yielding to the touch as vellum. When I said that I would marry him, not one muscle in his face stirred, but he let out a long, extinguished sigh. I thought: Oh! how he must want me! And it was as though the imponderable weight of his desire was a force I might not withstand, not by virtue of its violence but because of its very gravity.

He had the ring ready in a leather box lined with crimson velvet, a fire opal the size of a pigeon's egg set in a complicated circle of dark antique gold. My old nurse, who still lived with my mother and me, squinted at the ring askance: opals are bad luck, she said. But this opal had been his own mother's ring, and his grandmother's, and her mother's before that, given to an ancestor by Catherine de Medici ... every bride that came to the castle wore it, time out of mind. And did he give it to his other wives and have it back from them? asked the old woman rudely; yet she was a snob. She hid her incredulous joy at my marital coup--her little Marquise--behind a façade of fault-finding. But, here, she touched me. I shrugged and turned my back pettishly on her. I did not want to remember how he had loved other women before me, but the knowledge often teased me in the threadbare self-confidence of the small hours.

I was seventeen and knew nothing of the world; my Marquis had been married before, more than once, and I remained a little bemused that, after those others, he should now have chosen me. Indeed, was he not still in mourning for his last wife? Tsk, tsk, went my old nurse.

And even my mother had been reluctant to see her girl whisked off by a man so recently bereaved. A Romanian countess, a lady of high fashion. Dead just three short months before I met him, a boating accident, at his home, in Brittany. They never found her body but I rummaged through the back copies of the society magazines my old nanny kept in a trunk under her bed and tracked down her photograph. The sharp muzzle of a pretty, witty, naughty monkey; such potent and bizarre charm, of a dark, bright, wild yet worldly thing whose natural habitat must have been some luxurious interior decorator's jungle filled with potted palms and tame, squawking parakeets.

Before that? Her face is common property; everyone painted her but the Redon engraving I liked best, The Evening Star Walking on the Rim of Night. To see her skeletal, enigmatic grace, you would never think she had been a barmaid in a café in Montmartre until Puvis de Chavannes saw her and had her expose her flat breasts and elongated thighs to his brush. And yet it was the absinthe doomed her, or so they said.

The first of all his ladies? That sumptuous diva; I had heard her sing Isolde, precociously musical child that I was, taken to the opera for a birthday treat. My first opera; I had heard her sing Isolde. With what white-hot passion had she burned from the stage! So that you could tell she would die young. We sat high up, halfway to heaven in the gods, yet she half-blinded me. And my father, still alive (oh, so long ago), took hold of my sticky little hand, to comfort me, in the last act, yet all I heard was the glory of her voice.

Married three times within my own brief lifetime to three different graces, now, as if to demonstrate the eclecticism of his taste, he had invited me to join this gallery of beautiful women, I, the poor widow's child with my mouse-coloured hair that still bore the kinks of the plaits from which it had so recently been freed, my bony hips, my nervous, pianist's fingers.

He was rich as Croesus. The night before our wedding--a simple affair, at the Mairie, because his countess was so recently gone--he took my mother and me, curious coincidence, to see Tristan. And, do you know, my heart swelled and ached so during the Liebestod that I thought I must truly love him. Yes. I did. On his arm, all eyes were upon me. The whispering crowd in the foyer parted like the Red Sea to let us through. My skin crisped at his touch.

How my circumstances had changed since the first time I heard those voluptuous chords that carry such a charge of deathly passion in them! Now, we sat in a loge, in red velvet armchairs, and a braided, bewigged flunkey brought us a silver bucket of iced champagne in the interval. The froth spilled over the rim of my glass and drenched my hands, I thought: My cup runneth over. And I had on a Poiret dress. He had prevailed upon my reluctant mother to let him buy my trousseau; what would I have gone to him in, otherwise? Twice-darned underwear, faded gingham, serge skirts, hand-me-downs. So, for the opera, I wore a sinuous shift of white muslin tied with a silk string under the breasts. And everyone stared at me. And at his wedding gift.

His wedding gift, clasped round my throat. A choker of rubies, two inches wide, like an extraordinarily precious slit throat.

After the Terror, in the early days of the Directory, the aristos who'd escaped the guillotine had an ironic fad of tying a red ribbon round their necks at just the point where the blade would have sliced it through, a red ribbon like the memory of a wound. And his grandmother, taken with the notion, had her ribbon made up in rubies; such a gesture of luxurious defiance! That night at the opera comes back to me even now ... the white dress; the frail child within it; and the flashing crimson jewels round her throat, bright as arterial blood.

I saw him watching me in the gilded mirrors with the assessing eye of a connoisseur inspecting horseflesh, or even of a housewife in the market, inspecting cuts on the slab. I'd never seen, or else had never acknowledged, that regard of his before, the sheer carnal avarice of it; and it was strangely magnified by the monocle lodged in his left eye. When I saw him look at me with lust, I dropped my eyes but, in glancing away from him, I caught sight of myself in the mirror. And I saw myself, suddenly, as he saw me, my pale face, the way the muscles in my neck stuck out like thin wire. I saw how much that cruel necklace became me. And, for the first time in my innocent and confined life, I sensed in myself a potentiality for corruption that took my breath away.

The next day, we were married.

The train slowed, shuddered to a halt. Lights; clank of metal; a voice declaring the name of an unknown, never-to-be visited station; silence of the night; the rhythm of his breathing, that I should sleep with, now, for the rest of my life. And I could not sleep. I stealthily sat up, raised the blind a little and huddled against the cold window that misted over with the warmth of my breathing, gazing out at the dark platform towards those rectangles of domestic lamplight that promised warmth, company, a supper of sausages hissing in a pan on the stove for the station master, his children tucked up in bed asleep in the brick house with the painted shutters ... all the paraphernalia of the everyday world from which I, with my stunning marriage, had exiled myself.

Into marriage, into exile; I sensed it, I knew it--that, henceforth, I would always be lonely. Yet that was part of the already familiar weight of the fire opal that glimmered like a gypsy's magic ball, so that I could not take my eyes off it when I played the piano. This ring, the bloody bandage of rubies, the wardrobe of clothes from Poiret and Worth, his scent of Russian leather--all had conspired to seduce me so utterly that I could not say I felt one single twinge of regret for the world of tar-tines and maman that now receded from me as if drawn away on a string, like a child's toy, as the train began to throb again as if in delighted anticipation of the distance it would take me.

The first grey streamers of the dawn now flew in the sky and an eldritch half-light seeped into the railway carriage. I heard no change in his breathing but my heightened, excited senses told me he was awake and gazing at me. A huge man, an enormous man, and his eyes, dark and motionless as those eyes the ancient Egyptians painted upon their sarcophagi, fixed upon me. I felt a certain tension in the pit of my stomach, to be so watched, in such silence. A match struck. He was igniting a Romeo y Julieta fat as a baby's arm.

'Soon,' he said in his resonant voice that was like the tolling of a bell and I felt, all at once, a sharp premonition of dread that lasted only as long as the match flared and I could see his white, broad face as if it were hovering, disembodied, above the sheets, illuminated from below like a grotesque carnival head. Then the flame died, the cigar glowed and filled the compartment with a remembered fragrance that made me think of my father, how he would hug me in a warm fug of Havana, when I was a little girl, before he kissed me and left me and died.

As soon as my husband handed me down from the high step of the train, I smelled the amniotic salinity of the ocean. It was November; the trees, stunted by the Atlantic gales, were bare and the lonely halt was deserted but for his leather-gaitered chauffeur waiting meekly beside the sleek black motor car. It was cold; I drew my furs about me, a wrap of white and black, broad stripes of ermine and sable, with a collar from which my head rose like the calyx of a wildflower. (I swear to you, I had never been vain until I met him.) The bell clanged; the straining train leapt its leash and left us at that lonely wayside halt where only he and I had descended. Oh, the wonder of it; how all that might of iron and steam had paused only to suit his convenience. The richest man in France.

'Madame.'

The chauffeur eyed me; was he comparing me, invidiously, to the countess, the artist's model, the opera singer? I hid behind my furs as if they were a system of soft shields. My husband liked me to wear my opal over my kid glove, a showy, theatrical trick--but the moment the ironic chauffeur glimpsed its simmering flash he smiled, as though it was proof positive I was his master's wife. And we drove towards the widening dawn, that now streaked half the sky with a wintry bouquet of pink of roses, orange of tiger-lilies, as if my husband had ordered me a sky from a florist. The day broke around me like a cool dream.

Sea; sand; a sky that melts into the sea--a landscape of misty pastels with a look about it of being continuously on the point of melting. A landscape with all the deliquescent harmonies of Debussy, of the études I played for him, the reverie I'd been playing that afternoon in the salon of the princess where I'd first met him, among the teacups and the little cakes, I, the orphan, hired out of charity to give them their digestive of music.

And, ah! his castle. The faery solitude of the place; with its turrets of misty blue, its courtyard, its spiked gate, his castle that lay on the very bosom of the sea with seabirds mewing about its attics, the casements opening on to the green and purple, evanescent departures of the ocean, cut off by the tide from land for half a day ... that castle, at home neither on the land nor on the water, a mysterious, amphibious place, contravening the materiality of both earth and the waves, with the melancholy of a mermaiden who perches on her rock and waits, endlessly, for a lover who had drowned far away, long ago. That lovely, sad, sea-siren of a place!

The tide was low; at this hour, so early in the morning, the causeway rose up out of the sea. As the car turned on to the wet cobbles between the slow margins of water, he reached out for my hand that had his sultry, witchy ring on it, pressed my fingers, kissed my palm with extraordinary tenderness. His face was as still as ever I'd seen it, still as a pond iced thickly over, yet his lips, that always looked so strangely red and naked between the black fringes of his beard, now curved a little. He smiled; he welcomed his bride home.

No room, no corridor that did not rustle with the sound of the sea and all the ceilings, the walls on which his ancestors in the stern regalia of rank lined up with their dark eyes and white faces, were stippled with refracted light from the waves which were always in motion; that luminous, murmurous castle of which I was the chatelaine, I, the little music student whose mother had sold all her jewellery, even her wedding ring, to pay the fees at the Conservatoire.

First of all, there was the small ordeal of my initial interview with the housekeeper, who kept this extraordinary machine, this anchored, castellated ocean liner, in smooth running order no matter who stood on the bridge; how tenuous, I thought, might be my authority here! She had a bland, pale, impassive, dislikeable face beneath the impeccably starched white linen head-dress of the region. Her greeting, correct but lifeless, chilled me; daydreaming, I dared presume too much on my status ... briefly wondered how I might install my old nurse, so much loved, however cosily incompetent, in her place. Ill-considered schemings! He told me this one had been his foster mother; was bound to his family in the utmost feudal complicity, 'as much part of the house as I am, my dear'. Now her thin lips offered me a proud little smile. She would be my ally as long as I was his. And with that, I must be content.

But, here, it would be easy to be content. In the turret suite he had given me for my very own, I could gaze out over the tumultuous Atlantic and imagine myself the Queen of the Sea. There was a Bechstein for me in the music room and, on the wall, another wedding present--an early Flemish primitive of Saint Cecilia at her celestial organ. In the prim charm of this saint, with her plump, sallow cheeks and crinkled brown hair, I saw myself as I could have wished to be. I warmed to a loving sensitivity I had not hitherto suspected in him. Then he led me up a delicate spiral staircase to my bedroom; before she discreetly vanished, the housekeeper set him chuckling with some, I dare say, lewd blessing for newlyweds in her native Breton. That I did not understand. That he, smiling, refused to interpret.

And there lay the grand, hereditary matrimonial bed, itself the size, almost, of my little room at home, with the gargoyles carved on its surfaces of ebony, vermilion lacquer, gold leaf; and its white gauze curtains, billowing in the sea breeze. Our bed. And surrounded by so many mirrors! Mirrors on all the walls, in stately frames of contorted gold, that reflected more white lilies than I'd ever seen in my life before. He'd filled the room with them, to greet the bride, the young bride. The young bride, who had become that multitude of girls I saw in the mirrors, identical in their chic navy blue tailor-mades, for travelling, madame, or walking. A maid had dealt with the furs. Henceforth, a maid would deal with everything.

'See,' he said, gesturing towards those elegant girls. 'I have acquired a whole harem for myself!'

I found that I was trembling. My breath came thickly. I could not meet his eye and turned my head away, out of pride, out of shyness, and watched a dozen husbands approach me in a dozen mirrors and slowly, methodically, teasingly, unfasten the buttons of my jacket and slip it from my shoulders. Enough! No; more! Off comes the skirt; and, next, the blouse of apricot linen that cost more than the dress I had for first communion. The play of the waves outside in the cold sun glittered on his monocle; his movements seemed to me deliberately coarse, vulgar. The blood rushed to my face again, and stayed there.

And yet, you see, I guessed it might be so--that we should have a formal disrobing of the bride, a ritual from the brothel. Sheltered as my life had been, how could I have failed, even in the world of prim bohemia in which I lived, to have heard hints of his world?

He stripped me, gourmand that he was, as if he were stripping the leaves off an artichoke--but do not imagine much finesse about it; this artichoke was no particular treat for the diner nor was he yet in any greedy haste. He approached his familiar treat with a weary appetite. And when nothing but my scarlet, palpitating core remained, I saw, in the mirror, the living image of an etching by Rops from the collection he had shown me when our engagement permitted us to be alone together ... the child with her sticklike limbs, naked but for her button boots, her gloves, shielding her face with her hand as though her face were the last repository of her modesty; and the old, monocled lecher who examined her, limb by limb. He in his London tailoring; she, bare as a lamb chop. Most pornographic of all confrontations. And so my purchaser unwrapped his bargain. And, as at the opera, when I had first seen my flesh in his eyes, I was aghast to feel myself stirring.

At once he closed my legs like a book and I saw again the rare movement of his lips that meant he smiled.

Not yet. Later. Anticipation is the greater part of pleasure, my little love.

And I began to shudder, like a racehorse before a race, yet also with a kind of fear, for I felt both a strange, impersonal arousal at the thought of love and at the same time a repugnance I could not stifle for his white, heavy flesh that had too much in common with the armfuls of arum lilies that filled my bedroom in great glass jars, those undertakers' lilies with the heavy pollen that powders your fingers as if you had dipped them in turmeric. The lilies I always associate with him; that are white. And stain you.

This scene from a voluptuary's life was now abruptly terminated. It turns out he has business to attend to; his estates, his companies--even on your honeymoon? Even then, said the red lips that kissed me before he left me alone with my bewildered senses--a wet, silken brush from his beard; a hint of the pointed tip of the tongue. Disgruntled, I wrapped a neglige of antique lace around me to sip the little breakfast of hot chocolate the maid brought me; after that, since it was second nature to me, there was nowhere to go but the music room and soon I settled down at my piano.

Yet only a series of subtle discords flowed from beneath my fingers: out of tune ... only a little out of tune; but I'd been blessed with perfect pitch and could not bear to play any more. Sea breezes are bad for pianos; we shall need a resident piano-tuner on the premises if I'm to continue with my studies! I flung down the lid in a little fury of disappointment; what should I do now, how shall I pass the long, sea-lit hours until my husband beds me?

I shivered to think of that.

His library seemed the source of his habitual odour of Russian leather. Row upon row of calf-bound volumes, brown and olive, with gilt lettering on their spines, the octavo in brilliant scarlet morocco. A deep-buttoned leather sofa to recline on. A lectern, carved like a spread eagle, that held open upon it an edition of Huysmans's Là-bas, from some over-exquisite private press; it had been bound like a missal, in brass, with gems of coloured glass. The rugs on the floor, deep, pulsing blues of heaven and red of the heart's dearest blood, came from Isfahan and Bokhara; the dark panelling gleamed; there was the lulling music of the sea and a fire of apple logs. The flames flickered along the spines inside a glass-fronted case that held books still crisp and new. Eliphas Levy; the name meant nothing to me. I squinted at a title or two: The Initiation, The Key of Mysteries, The Secret of Pandora's Box, and yawned. Nothing, here, to detain a seventeen-year-old girl waiting for her first embrace. I should have liked, best of all, a novel in yellow paper; I wanted to curl up on the rug before the blazing fire, lose myself in a cheap novel, munch sticky liqueur chocolates. If I rang for them, a maid would bring me chocolates.

Nevertheless, I opened the doors of that bookcase idly to browse. And I think I knew, I knew by some tingling of the fingertips, even before I opened that slim volume with no title at all on the spine, what I should find inside it. When he showed me the Rops, newly bought, dearly prized, had he not hinted that he was a connoisseur of such things? Yet I had not bargained for this, the girl with tears hanging on her cheeks like stuck pearls, her cunt a split fig below the great globes of her buttocks on which the knotted tails of the cat were about to descend, while a man in a black mask fingered with his free hand his prick, that curved upwards like the scimitar he held. The picture had a caption: 'Reproof of curiosity'. My mother, with all the precision of her eccentricity, had told me what it was that lovers did; I was innocent but not naïve. The Adventures of Eulalie at the Harem of the Grand Turk had been printed, according to the flyleaf, in Amsterdam in 1748, a rare collector's piece. Had some ancestor brought it back himself from that northern city? Or had my husband bought it for himself, from one of those dusty little bookshops on the Left Bank where an old man peers at you through spectacles an inch thick, daring you to inspect his wares ... I turned the pages in the anticipation of fear; the print was rusty. Here was another steel engraving: 'Immolation of the wives of the Sultan'. I knew enough for what I saw in that book to make me gasp.

There was a pungent intensification of the odour of leather that suffused his library; his shadow fell across the massacre.

'My little nun has found the prayerbooks, has she?' he demanded, with a curious mixture of mockery and relish; then, seeing my painful, furious bewilderment, he laughed at me aloud, snatched the book from my hands and put it down on the sofa.

'Have the nasty pictures scared Baby? Baby mustn't play with grownups' toys until she's learned how to handle them, must she?'

Then he kissed me. And with, this time, no reticence. He kissed me and laid his hand imperatively upon my breast, beneath the sheath of ancient lace. I stumbled on the winding stair that led to the bedroom, to the carved, gilded bed on which he had been conceived. I stammered foolishly: We've not taken luncheon yet; and, besides, it is broad daylight...

All the better to see you.

He made me put on my choker, the family heirloom of one woman who had escaped the blade. With trembling fingers, I fastened the thing about my neck. It was cold as ice and chilled me. He twined my hair into a rope and lifted it off my shoulders so that he could the better kiss the downy furrows below my ears; that made me shudder. And he kissed those blazing rubies, too. He kissed them before he kissed my mouth. Rapt, he intoned:' Of her apparel she retains/Only her sonorous jewellery.'

A dozen husbands impaled a dozen brides while the mewing gulls swung on invisible trapezes in the empty air outside.

I was brought to my senses by the insistent shrilling of the telephone. He lay beside me, felled like an oak, breathing stertorously, as if he had been fighting with me. In the course of that one-sided struggle, I had seen his deathly composure shatter like a porcelain vase flung against a wall; I had heard him shriek and blaspheme at the orgasm; I had bled. And perhaps I had seen his face without its mask; and perhaps I had not. Yet I had been infinitely dishevelled by the loss of my virginity.

I gathered myself together, reached into the cloisonne cupboard beside the bed that concealed the telephone and addressed the mouthpiece. His agent in New York. Urgent.

I shook him awake and rolled over on my side, cradling my spent body in my arms. His voice buzzed like a hive of distant bees. My husband. My husband, who, with so much love, filled my bedroom with lilies until it looked like an embalming parlour. Those somnolent lilies, that wave their heavy heads, distributing their lush, insolent incense reminiscent of pampered flesh.

When he'd finished with the agent, he turned to me and stroked the ruby necklace that bit into my neck, but with such tenderness now, that I ceased flinching and he caressed my breasts. My dear one, my little love, my child, did it hurt her? He's so sorry for it, such impetuousness, he could not help himself; you see, he loves her so ... and this lover's recitative of his brought my tears in a flood. I clung to him as though only the one who had inflicted the pain could comfort me for suffering it. For a while, he murmured to me in a voice I'd never heard before, a voice like the soft consolations of the sea. But then he unwound the tendrils of my hair from the buttons of his smoking jacket, kissed my cheek briskly and told me the agent from New York had called with such urgent business that he must leave as soon as the tide was low enough. Leave the castle? Leave France! And would be away for at least six weeks.

'But it is our honeymoon!'

A deal, an enterprise of hazard and chance involving several millions, lay in the balance, he said. He drew away from me into that waxworks stillness of his; I was only a little girl, I did not understand. And, he said unspoken to my wounded vanity, I have had too many honeymoons to find them in the least pressing commitments. I know quite well that this child I've bought with a handful of coloured stones and the pelts of dead beasts won't run away. But, after he'd called his Paris agent to book a passage for the States next day--just one tiny call, my little one--we should have time for dinner together.

And I had to be content with that,

A Mexican dish of pheasant with hazelnuts and chocolate; salad; white, voluptuous cheese; a sorbet of muscat grapes and Asti spumante. A celebration of Krug exploded festively. And then acrid black coffee in precious little cups so fine it shadowed the birds with which they were painted. I had Cointreau, he had cognac in the library, with the purple velvet curtains drawn against the night, where he took me to perch on his knee in a leather armchair beside the flickering log fire. He had made me change into that chaste little Poiret shift of white muslin; he seemed especially fond of it, my breasts showed through the flimsy stuff, he said, like little soft white doves that sleep, each one, with a pink eye open. But he would not let me take off my ruby choker, although it was growing very uncomfortable, nor fasten up my descending hair, the sign of a virginity so recently ruptured that still remained a wounded presence between us. He twined his fingers in my hair until I winced; I said, I remember, very little.

'The maid will have changed our sheets already,' he said. 'We do not hang the bloody sheets out of the window to prove to the whole of Brittany you are a virgin, not in these civilized times. But I should tell you it would have been the first time in all my married lives I could have shown my interested tenants such a flag.'

Then I realized, with a shock of surprise, how it must have been my innocence that captivated him--the silent music, he said, of my unknowingness, like La Terrasse des audiences au clair de lune played upon a piano with keys of ether. You must remember how ill at ease I was in that luxurious place, how unease had been my constant companion during the whole length of my courtship by this grave satyr who now gently martyrized my hair. To know that my naivety gave him some pleasure made me take heart. Courage! I shall act the fine lady to the manner born one day, if only by virtue of default.

Then, slowly yet teasingly, as if he were giving a child a great, mysterious treat, he took out a bunch of keys from some interior hidey-hole in his jacket--key after key, a key, he said, for every lock in the house. Keys of all kinds--huge, ancient things of black iron; others slender, delicate, almost baroque; wafer-thin Yale keys for safes and boxes. And, during his absence, it was I who must take care of them all.

I eyed the heavy bunch with circumspection. Until that moment, I had not given a single thought to the practical aspects of marriage with a great house, great wealth, a great man, whose key ring was as crowded as that of a prison warder. Here were the clumsy and archaic keys for the dungeons, for dungeons we had in plenty although they had been converted to cellars for his wines; the dusty bottles inhabited in racks all those deep holes of pain in the rock on which the castle was built. These are the keys to the kitchens, this is the key to the picture gallery, a treasure house filled by five centuries of avid collectors--ah! he foresaw I would spend hours there.

He had amply indulged his taste for the Symbolists, he told me with a glint of greed. There was Moreau's great portrait of his first wife, the famous Sacrificial Victim with the imprint of the lacelike chains on her pellucid skin. Did I know the story of the painting of that picture? How, when she took off her clothes for him for the first time, she fresh from her bar in Montmartre, she had robed herself involuntarily in a blush that reddened her breasts, her shoulders, her arms, her whole body? He had thought of that story, of that dear girl, when first he had undressed me ... Ensor, the great Ensor, his monolithic canvas: The Foolish Virgins. Two or three late Gauguins, his special favourite the one of the tranced brown girl in the deserted house which was called: Out of the Night We Come, Into the Night We Go. And, besides the additions he had made himself, his marvellous inheritance of Watteaus, Poussins and a pair of very special Fragonards, commissioned for a licentious ancestor who, it was said, had posed for the master's brush himself with his own two daughters ... He broke off his catalogue of treasures abruptly.

Your thin white face, chérie; he said, as if he saw it for the first time. Your thin white face, with its promise of debauchery only a connoisseur could detect.

A log fell in the fire, instigating a shower of sparks; the opal on my finger spurted green flame. I felt as giddy as if I were on the edge of a precipice; I was afraid, not so much of him, of his monstrous presence, heavy as if he had been gifted at birth with more specific gravity than the rest of us, the presence that, even when I thought myself most in love with him, always subtly oppressed me ... No. I was not afraid of him; but of myself. I seemed reborn in his unreflective eyes, reborn in unfamiliar shapes. I hardly recognized myself from his descriptions of me and yet, and yet--might there not be a grain of beastly truth hi them? And, in the red firelight, I blushed again, unnoticed, to think he might have chosen me because, in my innocence, he sensed a rare talent for corruption.

Here is the key to the china cabinet--don't laugh, my darling; there's a king's ransom in Sèvres in that closet, and a queen's ransom in Limoges. And a key to the locked, barred room where five generations of plate were kept.

Keys, keys, keys. He would trust me with the keys to his office, although I was only a baby; and the keys to his safes, where he kept the jewels I should wear, he promised me, when we returned to Paris. Such jewels! Why, I would be able to change my earrings and necklaces three times a day, just as the Empress Josephine used to change her underwear. He doubted, he said, with that hollow, knocking sound that served him for a chuckle, I would be quite so interested in his share certificates although they, of course, were worth infinitely more.

Outside our firelit privacy, I could hear the sound of the tide drawing back from the pebbles of the foreshore; it was nearly time for him to leave me. One single key remained unaccounted for on the ring and he hesitated over it; for a moment, I thought he was going to unfasten it from its brothers, slip it back into his pocket and take it away with him.

'What is that key?' I demanded, for his chaffing had made me bold. 'The key to your heart? Give it me!'

He dangled the key tantalizingly above my head, out of reach of my straining fingers; those bare red lips of his cracked sidelong in a smile.

'Ah, no,' he said. 'Not the key to my heart. Rather, the key to my enfer.'

He left it on the ring, fastened the ring together, shook it musically, like a carillon. Then threw the keys in a jingling heap in my lap. I could feel the cold metal chilling my thighs through my thin muslin frock. He bent over me to drop a beard-masked kiss on my forehead.

'Every man must have one secret, even if only one, from his wife,' he said. 'Promise me this, my whey-faced piano-player; promise me you'll use all the keys on the ring except that last little one I showed you. Play with anything you find, jewels, silver plate; make toy boats of my share certificates, if it pleases you, and send them sailing off to America after me. All is yours, everywhere is open to you--except the lock that this single key fits. Yet all it is is the key to a little room at the foot of the west tower, behind the still-room, at the end of a dark little corridor full of horrid cobwebs that would get into your hair and frighten you if you ventured there. Oh, and you'd find it such a dull little room! But you must promise me, if you love me, to leave it well alone. It is only a private study, a hideaway, a ""den"", as the English say, where I can go, sometimes, on those infrequent yet inevitable occasions when the yoke of marriage seems to weigh too heavily on my shoulders. There I can go, you understand, to savour the rare pleasure of imagining myself wifeless.'

There was a little thin starlight in the courtyard as, wrapped in my furs, I saw him to his car. His last words were, that he had telephoned the mainland and taken a piano-tuner on to the staff; this man would arrive to take up his duties the next day. He pressed me to his vicuña breast, once, and then drove away.

I had drowsed away that afternoon and now I could not sleep. I lay tossing and turning in his ancestral bed until another daybreak discoloured the dozen mirrors that were iridescent with the reflections of the sea. The perfume of the lilies weighed on my senses; when I thought that, henceforth, I would always share these sheets with a man whose skin, as theirs did, contained that toad-like, clammy hint of moisture, I felt a vague desolation that within me, now my female wound had healed, there had awoken a certain queasy craving like the cravings of pregnant women for the taste of coal or chalk or tainted food, for the renewal of his caresses. Had he not hinted to me, in his flesh as in his speech and looks, of the thousand, thousand baroque intersections of flesh upon flesh? I lay in our wide bed accompanied by, a sleepless companion, my dark newborn curiosity.

I lay in bed alone. And I longed for him. And he disgusted me.

Were there jewels enough in all his safes to recompense me for this predicament? Did all that castle hold enough riches to recompense me for the company of the libertine with whom I must share it? And what, precisely, was the nature of my desirous dread for this mysterious being who, to show his mastery over me, had abandoned me on my wedding night?

Then I sat straight up in bed, under the sardonic masks of the gargoyles carved above me, riven by a wild surmise. Might he have left me, not for Wall Street but for an importunate mistress tucked away God knows where who knew how to pleasure him far better than a girl whose fingers had been exercised, hitherto, only by the practice of scales and arpeggios? And, slowly, soothed, I sank back on to the heaping pillows; I acknowledged that the jealous scare I'd just given myself was not unmixed with a little tincture of relief.

At last I drifted into slumber, as daylight filled the room and chased bad dreams away. But the last thing I remembered, before I slept, was the tall jar of lilies beside the bed, how the thick glass distorted their fat stems so they looked like arms, dismembered arms, drifting drowned in greenish water.

Coffee and croissants to console this bridal, solitary waking. Delicious. Honey, too, in a section of comb on a glass saucer. The maid squeezed the aromatic juice from an orange into a chilled goblet while I watched her as I lay in the lazy, midday bed of the rich. Yet nothing, this morning, gave me more than a fleeting pleasure except to hear that the piano-tuner had been at work already. When the maid told me that, I sprang out of bed and pulled on my old serge skirt and flannel blouse, costume of a student, in which I felt far more at ease with myself than in any of my fine new clothes.

After my three hours of practice, I called the piano-tuner in, to thank him. He was blind, of course; but young, with a gentle mouth and grey eyes that fixed upon me although they could not see me. He was a blacksmith's son from the village across the causeway; a chorister in the church whom the good priest had taught a trade so that he could make a living. All most satisfactory. Yes. He thought he would be happy here. And if, he added shyly, he might sometimes be allowed to hear me play ... for, you see, he loved music. Yes. Of course, I said. Certainly. He seemed to know that I had smiled.

After I dismissed him, even though I'd woken so late, it was still barely time for my 'five o'clock'. The housekeeper, who, thoughtfully forewarned by my husband, had restrained herself from interrupting my music, now made me a solemn visitation with a lengthy menu for a late luncheon. When I told her I did not need it, she looked at me obliquely, along her nose. I understood at once that one of my principal functions as chatelaine was to provide work for the staff. But, all the same, I asserted myself and said I would wait until dinner-time, although I looked forward nervously to the solitary meal. Then I found I had to tell her what I would like to have prepared for me; my imagination, still that of a schoolgirl, ran riot. A fowl in cream--or should I anticipate Christmas with a varnished turkey? No; I have decided. Avocado and shrimp, lots of it, followed by no entrée at all. But surprise me for dessert with every ice-cream in the ice box. She noted all down but sniffed; I'd shocked her. Such tastes! Child that I was, I giggled when she left me.

But, now ... what shall I do, now?

I could have spent a happy hour unpacking the trunks that contained my trousseau but the maid had done that already, the dresses, the tailor-mades hung in the wardrobe in my dressing room, the hats on wooden heads to keep their shape, the shoes on wooden feet as if all these inanimate objects were imitating the appearance of life, to mock me. I did not like to linger in my overcrowded dressing room, nor in my lugubriously lily-scented bedroom. How shall I pass the time?

I shall take a bath in my own bathroom! And found the taps were little dolphins made of gold, with chips of turquoise for eyes. And there was a tank of goldfish, who swam in and out of moving fronds of weeds, as bored, I thought, as I was. How I wished he had not left me. How I wished it were possible to chat with, say, a maid; or, the piano-tuner ... but I knew already my new rank forbade overtures of friendship to the staff.

I had been hoping to defer the call as long as I could, so that I should have something to look forward to in the dead waste of time I foresaw before me, after my dinner was done with, but, at a quarter before seven, when darkness already surrounded the castle, I could contain myself no longer. I telephoned my mother. And astonished myself by bursting into tears when I heard her voice.

No, nothing was the matter. Mother, I have gold bath taps.

I said, gold bath taps!

No; I suppose that's nothing to cry about, Mother.

The line was bad, I could hardly make out her congratulations, her questions, her concern, but I was a little comforted when I put the receiver down.

Yet there still remained one whole hour to dinner and the whole, unimaginable desert of the rest of the evening.

The bunch of keys lay, where he had left them, on the rug before the library fire which had warmed their metal so that they no longer felt cold to the touch but warm, almost, as my own skin. How careless I was; a maid, tending the logs, eyed me reproachfully as if I'd set a trap for her as I picked up the clinking bundle of keys, the keys to the interior doors of this lovely prison of which I was both the inmate and the mistress and had scarcely seen. When I remembered that, I felt the exhilaration of the explorer.

Lights! More lights!

At the touch of a switch, the dreaming library was brilliantly illuminated. I ran crazily about the castle, switching on every light I could find--I ordered the servants to light up all their quarters, too, so the castle would shine like a seaborne birthday cake lit with a thousand candles, one for every year of its life, and everybody on shore would wonder at it. When everything was lit as brightly as the café in the Gare du Nord, the significance of the possessions implied by that bunch of keys no longer intimidated me, for I was determined, now, to search through them all for evidence of my husband's true nature. His office first, evidently.

A mahogany desk half a mile wide, with an impeccable blotter and a bank of telephones. I allowed myself the luxury of opening the safe that contained the jewellery and delved sufficiently among the leather boxes to find out how my marriage had given me access to a jinn's treasury--parures, bracelets, rings ... While I was thus surrounded by diamonds, a maid knocked on the door and entered before I spoke; a subtle discourtesy. I would speak to my husband about it. She eyed my serge skirt superciliously; did madame plan to dress for dinner?

She made a moue of disdain when I laughed to hear that, she was far more the lady than I. But, imagine--to dress up in one of my Poiret extravaganzas, with the jewelled turban and aigrette on my head, roped with pearl to the navel, to sit down all alone in the baronial dining hall at the head of that massive board at which King Mark was reputed to have fed his knights ... I grew calmer under the cold eye of her disapproval. I adopted the crisp inflections of an officer's daughter. No, I would not dress for dinner. Furthermore, I was not hungry enough for dinner itself. She must tell the housekeeper to cancel the dormitory feast I'd ordered. Could they leave me sandwiches and a flask of coffee in my music room? And would they all dismiss for the night?

Mais oui, madame.

I knew by her bereft intonation I had let them down again but I did not care; I was armed against them by the brilliance of his hoard. But I would not find his heart amongst the glittering stones; as soon as she had gone, I began a systematic search of the drawers of his desk.

All was in order, so I found nothing. Not a random doodle on an old envelope, nor the faded photograph of a woman. Only the files of business correspondence, the bills from the home farms, the invoices from tailors, the billets-doux from international financiers. Nothing. And this absence of the evidence of his real life began to impress me strangely; there must, I thought, be a great deal to conceal if he takes such pains to hide it.

His office was a singularly impersonal room, facing inwards, on to the courtyard, as though he wanted to turn his back on the siren sea in order to keep a clear head while he bankrupted a small businessman in Amsterdam or--I noticed with a thrill of distaste--engaged in some business in Laos that must, from certain cryptic references to his amateur botanist's enthusiasm for rare poppies, be to do with opium. Was he not rich enough to do without crime? Or was the crime itself his profit? And yet I saw enough to appreciate his zeal for secrecy.

Now I had ransacked his desk, I must spend a cool-headed quarter of an hour putting every last letter back where I had found it, and, as I covered the traces of my visit, by some chance, as I reached inside a little drawer that had stuck fast, I must have touched a hidden spring, for a secret drawer flew open within that drawer itself; and this secret drawer contained--at last!--a file marked: Personal.

I was alone, but for my reflection in the uncurtained window.

I had the brief notion that his heart, pressed flat as a flower, crimson and thin as tissue paper, lay in this file. It was a very thin one.

I could have wished, perhaps, I had not found that touching, ill-spelt note, on a paper napkin marked La Coupole, that began: 'My darling, I cannot wait for the moment when you may make me yours completely.' The diva had sent him a page of the score of Tristan, the Liebestod, with the single, cryptic word: 'Until...' scrawled across it. But the strangest of all these love letters was a postcard with a view of a village graveyard, among mountains, where some black-coated ghoul enthusiastically dug at a grave; this little scene, executed with the lurid exuberance of Grand Guignol, was captioned: 'Typical Transylvanian Scene--Midnight, All Hallows.' And, on the other side, the message: 'On the occasion of this marriage to the descendant of Dracula--always remember, ""the supreme and unique pleasure of love is the certainty that one is doing evil"". Toutes amitiés, C.'

A joke. A joke in the worst possible taste; for had he not been married to a Romanian countess? And then I remembered her pretty, witty face, and her name--Carmilla. My most recent predecessor in this castle had been, it would seem, the most sophisticated.

I put away the file, sobered. Nothing in my life of family love and music had prepared me for these grown-up games and yet these were clues to his self that showed me, at least, how much he had been loved, even if they did not reveal any good reason for it. But I wanted to know still more; and, as I closed the office door and locked it, the means to discover more fell in my way.

Fell, indeed; and with the clatter of a dropped canteen of cutlery, for, as I turned the slick Yale lock, I contrived, somehow, to open up the key ring itself, so that all the keys tumbled loose on the floor. And the very first key I picked out of that pile was, as luck or ill fortune had it, the key to the room he had forbidden me, the room he would keep for his own so that he could go there when he wished to feel himself once more a bachelor.

I made my decision to explore it before I felt a faint resurgence of my ill-defined fear of his waxen stillness. Perhaps I half-imagined, then, that I might find his real self in his den, waiting there to see if indeed I had obeyed him; that he had sent a moving figure of himself to New York, the enigmatic, self-sustaining carapace of his public person, while the real man, whose face I had glimpsed in the storm of orgasm, occupied himself with pressing private business in the study at the foot of the west tower, behind the still-room. Yet, if that were so, it was imperative that I should find him, should know him; and I was too deluded by his apparent taste for me to think my disobedience might truly offend him.

I took the forbidden key from the heap and left the others lying there.

It was now very late and the castle was adrift, as far as it could go from the land, in the middle of the silent ocean where, at my orders, it floated, like a garland of light. And all silent, all still, but for the murmuring of the waves.

I felt no fear, no intimation of dread. Now I walked as firmly as I had done in my mother's house.

Not a narrow, dusty little passage at all; why had he lied to me? But an ill-lit one, certainly; the electricity, for some reason, did not extend here, so I retreated to the still-room and found a bundle of waxed tapers in a cupboard, stored there with matches to light the oak board at grand dinners. I put a match to my little taper and advanced with it in my hand, like a penitent, along the corridor hung with heavy, I think Venetian, tapestries. The flame picked out, here, the head of a man, there, the rich breast of a woman spilling through a rent in her dress--the Rape of the Sabines, perhaps? The naked swords and immolated horses suggested some grisly mythological subject. The corridor wound downwards; there was an almost imperceptible ramp to the thickly carpeted floor. The heavy hangings on the wall muffled my footsteps, even my breathing. For some reason, it grew very warm; the sweat sprang out in beads on my brow. I could no longer hear the sound of the sea.

A long, a winding corridor, as if I were in the viscera of the castle; and this corridor led to a door of worm-eaten oak, low, round-topped, barred with black iron.

And still I felt no fear, no raising of the hairs on the back of the neck, no prickling of the thumbs.

The key slid into the new lock as easily as a hot knife into butter.

No fear; but a hesitation, a holding of the spiritual breath.

If I had found some traces of his heart in a file marked: Personal, perhaps, here, in his subterranean privacy, I might find a little of his soul. It was the consciousness of the possibility of such a discovery, of its possible strangeness, that kept me for a moment motionless, before, in the foolhardiness of my already subtly tainted innocence, I turned the key and the door creaked slowly back.

'There is a striking resemblance between the act of love and the ministrations of a torturer,' opined my husband's favourite poet; I had learned something of the nature of that similarity on my marriage bed. And now my taper showed me the outlines of a rack. There was also a great wheel, like the ones I had seen in woodcuts of the martyrdoms of the saints, in my old nurse's little store of holy books. And--just one glimpse of it before my little flame caved in and I was left in absolute darkness--a metal figure, hinged at the side, which I knew to be spiked on the inside and to have the name: the Iron Maiden.

Absolute darkness. And, about me, the instruments of mutilation.

Until that moment, this spoiled child did not know she had inherited nerves and a will from the mother who had defied the yellow outlaws of Indo-China; My mother's spirit drove me on, into that dreadful place, in a cold ecstasy to know the very worst. I fumbled for the matches in my pocket; what a dim, lugubrious light they gave! And yet, enough, oh, more than enough, to see a room designed for desecration and some dark night of unimaginable lovers whose embraces were annihilation.

The walls of this stark torture chamber were the naked rock; they gleamed as if they were sweating with fright. At the four corners of the room were funerary urns, of great antiquity, Etruscan, perhaps, and, on three-legged ebony stands, the bowls of incense he had left burning which filled the room with a sacerdotal reek. Wheel, rack and Iron Maiden were, I saw, displayed as grandly as if they were items of statuary and I was almost consoled, then, and almost persuaded myself that I might have stumbled only upon a little museum of his perversity, that he had installed these monstrous items here only for contemplation.

Yet at the centre of the room lay a catafalque, a doomed, ominous bier of Renaissance workmanship, surrounded by long white candles and, at its foot, an armful of the same lilies with which he had filled my bedroom, stowed in a four-foot-high jar glazed with a sombre Chinese red. I scarcely dared examine this catafalque and its occupant more closely; yet I knew I must.

Each time I struck a match to light those candles round her bed, it seemed a garment of that innocence of mine for which he had lusted fell away from me.

The opera singer lay, quite naked, under a thin sheet of very rare and precious linen, such as the princes of Italy used to shroud those whom they had poisoned. I touched her, very gently, on the white breast; she was cool, he had embalmed her. On her throat I could see the blue imprint of his strangler's fingers. The cool, sad flame of the candles flickered on her white, closed eyelids. The worst thing was, the dead lips smiled.

Beyond the catafalque, in the middle of the shadows, a white, nacreous glimmer; as my eyes accustomed themselves to the gathering darkness, I at last--oh, horrors!--made out a skull; yes, a skull, so utterly denuded, now, of flesh, that it scarcely seemed possible the stark bone had once been richly upholstered with life. And this skull was strung up by a system of unseen cords, so that it appeared to hang, disembodied, in the still, heavy air, and it had been crowned with a wreath of white roses, and a veil of lace, the final image of his bride.

Yet the skull was still so beautiful, had shaped with its sheer planes so imperiously the face that had once existed above it, that I recognized her the moment I saw her; face of the evening star walking on the rim of night. One false step, oh, my poor, dear girl, next in the fated sisterhood of his wives; one false step and into the abyss of the dark you stumbled.

And where was she, the latest dead, the Romanian countess who might have thought her blood would survive his depredations? I knew she must be here, in the place that had wound me through the castle towards it on a spool of inexorability. But, at first, I could see no sign of her. Then, for some reason--perhaps some change of atmosphere wrought by my presence--the metal shell of the Iron Maiden emitted a ghostly twang; my feverish imagination might have guessed its occupant was trying to clamber out, though, even in the midst of my rising hysteria, I knew she must be dead to find a home there.

With trembling fingers, I prised open the front of the upright coffin, with its sculpted face caught in a rictus of pain. Then, overcome, I dropped the key I still held in my other hand. It dropped into the forming pool of her blood.

She was pierced, not by one but by a hundred spikes, this child of the land of the vampires who seemed so newly dead, so full of blood ... oh God! how recently had he become a widower? How long had he kept her in this obscene cell? Had it been all the time he had courted me, in the clear light of Paris?

I closed the lid of her coffin very gently and burst into a tumult of sobbing that contained both pity for his other victims and also a dreadful anguish to know I, too, was one of them.

The candles flared, as if in a draught from a door to elsewhere. The light caught the fire opal on my hand so that it flashed, once, with a baleful light, as if to tell me the eye of God--his eye--was upon me. My first thought, when I saw the ring for which I had sold myself to this fate, was, how to escape it.

I retained sufficient presence of mind to snuff out the candles round the bier with my fingers, to gather up my taper, to look around, although shuddering, to ensure I had left behind me no traces of my visit.

I retrieved the key from the pool of blood, wrapped it in my handkerchief to keep my hands clean, and fled the room, slamming the door behind me. It crashed to with a juddering reverberation, like the door of hell.

I could not take refuge in my bedroom, for that retained the memory of his presence trapped in the fathomless silvering of his mirrors. My music room seemed the safest place, although I looked at the picture of Saint Cecilia with a faint dread; what had been the nature of her martyrdom? My mind was in a tumult; schemes for flight jostled with one another ... as soon as the tide receded from the causeway, I would make for the mainland--on foot, running, stumbling; I did not trust that leather-clad chauffeur, nor the well-behaved housekeeper, and I dared not take any of the pale, ghostly maids into my confidence, either, since they were his creatures, all. Once at the village, I would fling myself directly on the mercy of the gendarmerie.

But--could I trust them, either? His forefathers had ruled this coast for eight centuries, from this castle whose moat was the Atlantic. Might not the police, the advocates, even the judge, all be in his service, turning a common blind eye to his vices since he was milord whose word must be obeyed? Who, on this distant coast, would believe the white-faced girl from Paris who came running to them with a shuddering tale of blood, of fear, of the ogre murmuring in the shadows? Or, rather, they would immediately know it to be true. But were all honour-bound to let me carry it no further.

Assistance. My mother. I ran to the telephone; and the line, of course, was dead.

Dead as his wives.

A thick darkness, unlit by any star, still glazed the windows. Every lamp in my room burned, to keep the dark outside, yet it seemed still to encroach on me, to be present beside me but as if masked by my lights, the night like a permeable substance that could seep into my skin. I looked at the precious little clock made from hypocritically innocent flowers long ago, in Dresden; the hands had scarcely moved one single hour forward from when I first descended to that private slaughterhouse of his. Time was his servant, too; it would trap me, here, in a night that would last until he came back to me, like a black sun on a hopeless morning.

And yet the time might still be my friend; at that hour, that very hour, he set sail for New York.

To know that, in a few moments, my husband would have left France calmed my agitation a little. My reason told me I had nothing to fear; the tide that would take him away to the New World would let me out of the imprisonment of the castle. Surely I could easily evade the servants. Anybody can buy a ticket at a railway station. Yet I was still rilled with unease. I opened the lid of the piano; perhaps I thought my own particular magic might help me, now, that I could create a pentacle out of music that would keep me from harm for, if my music had first ensnared him, then might it not also give me the power to free myself from him?

Mechanically, I began to play but my fingers were stiff and shaking. At first, I could manage nothing better than the exercises of Czerny but simply the act of playing soothed me and, for solace, for the sake of the harmonious rationality of its sublime mathematics, I searched among his scores until I found The Well-Tempered Clavier. I set myself the therapeutic task of playing all Bach's equations, every one, and, I told myself, if I played them all through without a single mistake--then the morning would find me once more a virgin.

Crash of a dropped stick.

His silver-headed cane! What else? Sly, cunning, he had returned; he was waiting for me outside the door!

I rose to my feet; fear gave me strength. I flung back my head defiantly.

'Come in!' My voice astonished me by its firmness, its clarity.

The door slowly, nervously opened and I saw, not the massive, irredeemable bulk of my husband but the slight, stooping figure of the piano-tuner, and he looked far more terrified of me than my mother's daughter would have been of the Devil himself. In the torture chamber, it seemed to me that I would never laugh again; now, helplessly, laugh I did, with relief, and, after a moment's hesitation, the boy's face softened and he smiled a little, almost in shame. Though they were blind, his eyes were singularly sweet.

'Forgive me,' said Jean-Yves. 'I know I've given you grounds for dismissing me, that I should be crouching outside your door at midnight ... but I heard you walking about, up and down--I sleep in a room at the foot of the west tower--and some intuition told me you could not sleep and might, perhaps, pass the insomniac hours at your piano. And I could not resist that. Besides, I stumbled over these--'

And he displayed the ring of keys I'd dropped outside my husband's office door, the ring from which one key was missing. I took them from him, looked round for a place to stow them, fixed on the piano stool as if to hide them would protect me. Still he stood smiling at me. How hard it was to make everyday conversation.

'It's perfect,' I said. 'The piano. Perfectly in tune.'

But he was full of the loquacity of embarrassment, as though I would only forgive him for his impudence if he explained the cause of it thoroughly.

'When I heard you play this afternoon, I thought I'd never heard such a touch. Such technique. A treat for me, to hear a virtuoso! So I crept up to your door now, humbly as a little dog might, madame, and put my ear to the keyhole and listened, and listened--until my stick fell to the floor through a momentary clumsiness of mine, and I was discovered.'

He had the most touchingly ingenuous smile.

'Perfectly in tune,' I repeated. To my surprise, now I had said it, I found I could not say anything else. I could only repeat: 'In tune ... perfect ... in tune,' over and over again. I saw a dawning surprise in his face. My head throbbed. To see him, in his lovely, blind humanity, seemed to hurt me very piercingly, somewhere inside my breast; his figure blurred, the room swayed about me. After the dreadful revelation of that bloody chamber, it was his tender look that made me faint.

When I recovered consciousness, I found I was lying in the piano-tuner's arms and he was tucking the satin cushion from the piano-stool under my head.

'You are in some great distress,' he said. 'No bride should suffer so much, so early in her marriage.'

His speech had the rhythms of the countryside, the rhythms of the tides.

'Any bride brought to this castle should come ready dressed in mourning, should bring a priest and a coffin with her,' I said.

'What's this?'

It was too late to keep silent; and if he, too, were one of my husband's creatures, then at least he had been kind to me. So I told him everything, the keys, the interdiction, my disobedience, the room, the rack, the skull, the corpses, the blood.

'I can scarcely believe it,' he said, wondering. 'That man ... so rich; so well-born.'

'Here's proof,' I said and tumbled the fatal key out of my handkerchief on to the silken rug.

'Oh God,' he said. 'I can smell the blood.'

He took my hand; he pressed his arms about me. Although he was scarcely more than a boy, I felt a great strength flow into me from his touch.

'We whisper all manner of strange tales up and down the coast,' he said.' There was a Marquis, once, who used to hunt young girls on the mainland; he hunted them with dogs, as though they were foxes. My grandfather had it from his grandfather, how the Marquis pulled a head out of his saddle bag and showed it to the blacksmith while the man was shoeing his horse. ""A fine specimen of the genus, brunette, eh, Guillaume?"" And it was the head of the blacksmith's wife.'

But, in these more democratic times, my husband must travel as far as Paris to do his hunting in the salons. Jean-Yves knew the moment I shuddered.

'Oh, madame! I thought all these were old wives' tales, chattering of fools, spooks to scare bad children into good behaviour! Yet how could you know, a stranger, that the old name for this place is the Castle of Murder?'

How could I know, indeed? Except that, in my heart, I'd always known its lord would be the death of me.

'Hark!' said my friend suddenly. 'The sea has changed key; it must be near morning, the tide is going down.'

He helped me up. I looked from the window, towards the mainland, along the causeway where the stones gleamed wetly in the thin light of the end of the night and, with an almost unimaginable horror, a horror the intensity of which I cannot transmit to you, I saw, in the distance, still far away yet drawing moment by moment inexorably nearer, the twin headlamps of his great black car, gouging tunnels through the shifting mist.

My husband had indeed returned; this time, it was no fancy.

'The key!' said Jean-Yves. 'It must go back on the ring, with the others. As though nothing had happened.'

But the key was still caked with wet blood and I ran to my bathroom and held it under the hot tap. Crimson water swirled down the basin but, as if the key itself were hurt, the bloody token stuck. The turquoise eyes of the dolphin taps winked at me derisively; they knew my husband had been too clever for me! I scrubbed the stain with my nail brush but still it would not budge. I thought how the car would be rolling silently towards the closed courtyard gate; the more I scrubbed the key, the more vivid grew the stain.

The bell in the gatehouse would jangle. The porter's drowsy son would push back the patchwork quilt, yawning, pull the shirt over his head, thrust his feet into his sabots ... slowly, slowly; open the door for your master as slowly as you can ...

And still the bloodstain mocked the fresh water that spilled from the mouth of the leering dolphin.

'You have no more time,' said Jean-Yves. 'He is here. I know it. I must stay with you.'

'You shall not!' I said. 'Go back to your room, now. Please.'

He hesitated. I put an edge of steel in my voice, for I knew I must meet my lord alone.

'Leave me!'

As soon as he had gone, I dealt with the keys and went to my bedroom. The causeway was empty; Jean-Yves was correct, my husband had already entered the castle. I pulled the curtains close, stripped off my clothes and pulled the bedcurtains round me as a pungent aroma of Russian leather assured me my husband was once again beside me.

'Dearest!'

With the most treacherous, lascivious tenderness, he kissed my eyes, and, mimicking the new bride newly wakened, I flung my arms around him, for on my seeming acquiescence depended my salvation.

'Da Silva of Rio outwitted me,' he said wryly.' My New York agent telegraphed Le Havre and saved me a wasted journey. So we may resume our interrupted pleasures, my love.'

I did not believe one word of it. I knew I had behaved exactly according to his desires; had he not bought me so that I should do so? I had been tricked into my own betrayal to that illimitable darkness whose source I had been compelled to seek in his absence and, now that I had met that shadowed reality of his that came to life only in the presence of its own atrocities, I must pay the price of my new knowledge. The secret of Pandora's box; but he had given me the box, himself, knowing I must learn the secret. I had played a game in which every move was governed by a destiny as oppressive and omnipotent as himself, since that destiny was himself; and I had lost. Lost at that charade of innocence and vice in which he had engaged me. Lost, as the victim loses to the executioner.

His hand brushed my breast, beneath the sheet. I strained my nerves yet could not help but flinch from the intimate touch, for it made me think of the piercing embrace of the Iron Maiden and of his lost lovers in the vault. When he saw my reluctance, his eyes veiled over and yet his appetite did not diminish. His tongue ran over red lips already wet. Silent, mysterious, he moved away from me to draw off his jacket. He took the gold watch from his waistcoat and laid it on the dressing table, like a good bourgeois; scooped out his raiding loose change and now--oh God!--makes a great play of patting his pockets officiously, puzzled lips pursed, searching for something that has been mislaid. Then turns to me with a ghastly, a triumphant smile.

'But of course! I gave the keys to you!'

'Your keys? Why, of course. Here, they're under the pillow; wait a moment--what--Ah! No ... now, where can I have left them? I was whiling away the evening without you at the piano, I remember. Of course! The music room!'

Brusquely he flung my négligé of antique lace on the bed.

'Go and get them.'

'Now? This moment? Can't it wait until morning, my darling?'

I forced myself to be seductive. I saw myself, pale, pliant as a plant that begs to be trampled underfoot, a dozen vulnerable, appealing girls reflected in as many mirrors, and I saw how he almost failed to resist me. If he had come to me in bed, I would have strangled him, then.

But he half-snarled: 'No. It won't wait. Now.'

The unearthly light of dawn filled the room; had only one previous dawn broken upon me in that vile place? And there was nothing for it but to go and fetch the keys from the music stool and pray he would not examine them too closely, pray to God his eyes would fail him, that he might be struck blind.

When I came back into the bedroom carrying the bunch of keys that jangled at every step like a curious musical instrument, he was sitting on the bed in his immaculate shirtsleeves, his head sunk in his hands.

And it seemed to me he was in despair.

Strange. In spite of my fear of him, that made me whiter than my wrap, I felt there emanate from him, at that moment, a stench of absolute despair, rank and ghastly, as if the lilies that surrounded him had all at once begun to fester, or the Russian leather of his scent were reverting to the elements of flayed hide and excrement of which it was composed. The chthonic gravity of his presence exerted a tremendous pressure on the room, so that the blood pounded in my ears as if we had been precipitated to the bottom of the sea, beneath the waves that pounded against the shore.

I held my life in my hands amongst those keys and, in a moment, would place it between his well-manicured fingers. The evidence of that bloody chamber had showed me I could expect no mercy. Yet, when he raised his head and stared at me with his blind, shuttered eyes as though he did not recognize me, I felt a terrified pity for him, for this man who lived in such strange, secret places that, if I loved him enough to follow him, I should have to die.

The atrocious loneliness of that monster!

The monocle had fallen from his face. His curling mane was disordered, as if he had run his hands through it in his distraction. I saw how he had lost his impassivity and was now filled with suppressed excitement. The hand he stretched out for those counters in his game of love and death shook a little; the face that turned towards me contained a sombre delirium that seemed to me compounded of a ghastly, yes, shame but also of a terrible, guilty joy as he slowly ascertained how I had sinned.

That tell-tale stain had resolved itself into a mark the shape and brilliance of the heart on a playing card. He disengaged the key from the ring and looked at it for a while, solitary, brooding.

'It is the key that leads to the kingdom of the unimaginable,' he said. His voice was low and had in it the timbre of certain great cathedral organs that seem, when they are played, to be conversing with God.

I could not restrain a sob.

'Oh, my love, my little love who brought me a white gift of music,' he said, almost as if grieving. 'My little love, you'll never know how much I hate daylight!""

Then he sharply ordered: 'Kneel!'

I knelt before him and he pressed the key lightly to my forehead, held it there for a moment. I felt a faint tingling of the skin and, when I involuntarily glanced at myself in the mirror, I saw the heart-shaped stain had transferred itself to my forehead, to the space between the eyebrows, like the caste mark of a brahmin woman. Or the mark of Cain. And now the key gleamed as freshly as if it had just been cut. He clipped it back on the ring, emitting that same, heavy sigh as he had done when I said that I would marry him.

'My virgin of the arpeggios, prepare yourself for martyrdom.'

'What form shall it take?' I said.

'Decapitation,' he whispered, almost voluptuously. 'Go and bathe yourself; put on that white dress you wore to hear Tristan and the necklace that prefigures your end. And I shall take myself off to the armoury, my dear, to sharpen my great-grandfather's ceremonial sword.'

'The servants?'

'We shall have absolute privacy for our last rites; I have already dismissed them. If you look out of the window you can see them going to the mainland.'

It was now the full, pale light of morning; the weather was grey, indeterminate, the sea had an oily, sinister look, a gloomy day on which to die. Along the causeway I could see trouping every maid and scullion, every pot-boy and pan-scourer, valet, laundress and vassal who worked in that great house, most on foot, a few on bicycles. The faceless housekeeper trudged along with a great basket in which, I guessed, she'd stowed as much as she could ransack from the larder. The Marquis must have given the chauffeur leave to borrow the motor for the day, for it went last of all, at a stately pace, as though the procession were a cortege and the car already bore my coffin to the mainland for. burial.

But I knew no good Breton earth would cover me, like a last, faithful lover; I had another fate.

'I have given them all a day's holiday, to celebrate our wedding,' he said. And smiled.

However hard I stared at the receding company, I could see no sign of Jean-Yves, our latest servant, hired but the preceding morning.

'Go, now. Bathe yourself; dress yourself. The lustratory ritual and the ceremonial robing; after that, the sacrifice. Wait in the music room until I telephone for you. No, my dear!' And he smiled, as I started, recalling the line was dead.' One may call inside the castle just as much as one pleases; but, outside--never.'

I scrubbed my forehead with the nail brush as I had scrubbed the key but this red mark would not go away, either, no matter what I did, and I knew I should wear it until I died, though that would not be long. Then I went to my dressing room and put on that white muslin shift, costume of a victim of an auto-da-fé, he had bought me to listen to the Liebestod in. Twelve young women combed out twelve listless sheaves of brown hair in the mirrors; soon, there would be none. The mass of lilies that surrounded me exhaled, now, the odour of their withering. They looked like the trumpets of the angels of death.

On the dressing table, coiled like a snake about to strike, lay the ruby choker.

Already almost lifeless, cold at heart, I descended the spiral staircase to the music room but there I found I had not been abandoned.

'I can be of some comfort to you,' the boy said.' Though not much use.'

We pushed the piano stool in front of the open window so that, for as long as I could, I would be able to smell the ancient, reconciling smell of the sea that, in time, will cleanse everything, scour the old bones white, wash away all the stains. The last little chambermaid had trotted along the causeway long ago and now the tide, fated as I, came tumbling in, the crisp wavelets splashing on the old stones.

'You do not deserve this,' he said.

'Who can say what I deserve or no?' I said. 'I've done nothing; but that may be sufficient reason for condemning me.'

'You disobeyed him,' he said. 'That is sufficient reason for him to punish you.'

'I only did what he knew I would.'

'Like Eve,' he said.

The telephone rang a shrill imperative. Let it ring. But my lover lifted me up and set me on my feet; I knew I must answer it. The receiver felt heavy as earth.

'The courtyard. Immediately.'

My lover kissed me, he took my hand. He would come with me if I would lead him. Courage. When I thought of courage, I thought of my mother. Then I saw a muscle in my lover's face quiver.

'Hoofbeats!' he said.

I cast one last, desperate glance from the window and, like a miracle, I saw a horse and rider galloping at a vertiginous speed along the causeway, though the waves crashed, now, high as the horse's fetlocks. A rider, her black skirts tucked up around her waist so she could ride hard and fast, a crazy, magnificent horsewoman in widow's weeds.

As the telephone rang again.

'Am I to wait all morning?'

Every moment, my mother drew nearer.

'She will be too late,' Jean-Yves said and yet he could not restrain a note of hope that, though it must be so, yet it might not be so.

The third, intransigent call.

'Shall I come up to heaven to fetch you down, Saint Cecilia? You wicked woman, do you wish me to compound my crimes by desecrating the marriage bed?'

So I must go to the courtyard where my husband waited in his London-tailored trousers and the shirt from Turnbull and Asser, beside the mounting block, with, in his hand, the sword which his great-grandfather had presented to the little corporal, in token of surrender to the Republic, before he shot himself. The heavy sword, unsheathed, grey as that November morning, sharp as childbirth, mortal.

When my husband saw my companion, he observed: 'Let the blind lead the blind, eh? But does even a youth as besotted as you are think she was truly blind to her own desires when she took my ring? Give it me back, whore.'

The fires in the opal had all died down. I gladly slipped it from my finger and, even in that dolorous place, my heart was lighter for the lack of it. My husband took it lovingly and lodged it on the tip of his little finger; it would go no further.

'It will serve me for a dozen more fiancées,' he said. 'To the block, woman. No--leave the boy; I shall deal with him later, utilizing a less exalted instrument than the one with which I do my wife the honour of her immolation, for do not fear that in death you will be divided.'

Slowly, slowly, one foot before the other, I crossed the cobbles. The longer I dawdled over my execution, the more time it gave the avenging angel to descend ...

'Don't loiter, girl! Do you think I shall lose appetite for the meal if you are so long about serving it? No; I shall grow hungrier, more ravenous with each moment, more cruel ... Run to me, run! I have a place prepared for your exquisite corpse in my display of flesh!'

He raised the sword and cut bright segments from the air with it, but still I lingered although my hopes, so recently raised, now began to flag. If she is not here by now, her horse must have stumbled on the causeway, have plunged into the sea ... One thing only made me glad; that my lover would not see me die.

My husband laid my branded forehead on the stone and, as he had done once before, twisted my hair into a rope and drew it away from my neck.

'Such a pretty neck,' he said with what seemed to be a genuine, retrospective tenderness. 'A neck like the stem of a young plant.'

I felt the silken bristle of his beard and the wet touch of his lips as he kissed my nape. And, once again, of my apparel I must retain only my gems; the sharp blade ripped my dress in two and it fell from me. A little green moss, growing in the crevices of the mounting block, would be the last thing I should see in all the world.

The whizz of that heavy sword.

And--a great battering and pounding at the gate, the jangling of the bell, the frenzied neighing of a horse! The unholy silence of the place shattered in an instant. The blade did not descend, the necklace did not sever, my head did not roll. For, for an instant, the beast wavered in his stroke, a sufficient split second of astonished indecision to let me spring upright and dart to the assistance of my lover as he struggled sightlessly with the great bolts that kept her out.

The Marquis stood transfixed, utterly dazed, at a loss. It must have been as if he had been watching his beloved Tristan for the twelfth, the thirteenth time and Tristan stirred, then leapt from his bier in the last act, announced in a jaunty aria interposed from Verdi that bygones were bygones, crying over spilt milk did nobody any good and, as for himself, he proposed to live happily ever after. The puppet master, open-mouthed, wide-eyed, impotent at the last, saw his dolls break free of their strings, abandon the rituals he had ordained for them since time began and start to live for themselves; the king, aghast, witnesses the revolt of his pawns.

You never saw such a wild thing as my mother, her hat seized by the winds and blown out to sea so that her hair was her white mane, her black lisle legs exposed to the thigh, her skirts tucked round her waist, one hand on the reins of the rearing horse while the other clasped my father's service revolver and, behind her, the breakers of the savage, indifferent sea, like the witnesses of a furious justice. And my husband stood stock-still, as if she had been Medusa, the sword still raised over his head as in those clockwork tableaux of Bluebeard that you see in glass cases at fairs.

And then it was as though a curious child pushed his centime into the slot and set all in motion. The heavy, bearded figure roared out aloud, braying with fury, and, wielding the honourable sword as if it were a matter of death or glory, charged us, all three.

On her eighteenth birthday, my mother had disposed of a man-eating tiger that had ravaged the villages in the hills north of Hanoi. Now, without a moment's hesitation, she raised my father's gun, took aim and put a single, irreproachable bullet through my husband's head.

We lead a quiet life, the three of us. I inherited, of course, enormous wealth but we have given most of it away to various charities. The castle is now a school for the blind, though I pray that the children who live there are not haunted by any sad ghosts looking for, crying for, the husband who will never return to the bloody chamber, the contents of which are buried or burned, the door sealed.

I felt I had a right to retain sufficient funds to start a little music school here, on the outskirts of Paris, and we do well enough. Sometimes we can even afford to go to the Opéra, though never to sit in a box, of course. We know we are the source of many whisperings and much gossip but the three of us know the truth of it and mere chatter can never harm us. I can only bless the--what shall I call it?--the maternal telepathy that sent my mother running headlong from the telephone to the station after I had called her, that night. I never heard you cry before, she said, by way of explanation. Not when you were happy. And who ever cried because of gold bath taps?

The night train, the one I had taken; she lay in her berth, sleepless as I had been. When she could not find a taxi at that lonely halt, she borrowed old Dobbin from a bemused farmer, for some internal urgency told her that she must reach me before the incoming tide sealed me away from her for ever. My poor old nurse, left scandalized at home--what? interrupt milord on his honeymoon?--she died soon after. She had taken so much secret pleasure in the fact that her little girl had become a marquise; and now here I was, scarcely a penny the richer, widowed at seventeen in the most dubious circumstances and busily engaged in setting up house with a piano-tuner. Poor thing, she passed away in a sorry state of disillusion! But I do believe my mother loves him as much as I do.

No paint nor powder, no matter how thick or white, can mask that red mark on my forehead; I am glad he cannot see it--not for fear of his revulsion, since I know he sees me clearly with his heart--but, because it spares my shame.",Angela Carter,Sweet Sable,1994,"[100, 93, 97]",3

But it's home, so I flex, get pressures off my chest
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next?
Stomach ache, head to Steak-N-Take for a bean pie
Get a Final Call from the brother in the bow tie
I'm where little kids dream and fiend for fun
Lots of laughter moms, no pops playing with her son
I passed by a girl's wake, they say she died at seven
Hit by a stray, but I pray that there's a hood in heaven
Fake brothers claim there's no shame in their game
You know my name, show me a real nigga with a brain
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
You know I gotta give props, I can't stop, without y'all, I'll be nothin
No wreckin', no checks, and no rhymin', no cuttin'
No stages, front pages, no phones, no beepers
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah
I come with the real life perspective and rule
'Cause me and my peoples from around the way remain cool
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day, around the way, around the muthafuckin' way",Queen Latifah,Queen Latifah,1994,"[92, 77, 65, 68, 63, 61, 56, 54, 59, 63, 68]",11

[Intro 1: Producer Tag]
Finny Music

[Intro 2: DJ Paul]
Who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
These niggas got plenty Anna but they ain't got plenty guns
I'm bustin' out luxury cars, still got these hoes on the run
I'm hearin' plenty mean words, but ain't no actions to boot
We can do some straight war for war, we can do some stickin' and movin'
We can meet in the middle of these streets or in the middle of this ring
I can pop your chest, plastic Glock, or pop your jaw diamond rings
Bitch don't hate me hate the bank, for stacks of cheese that I take
Or hate my shiny wristband, and big ass rims I rotate
See people flip when I'm comin', got suckas sick at the stomach
They wonderin' what I brought in, they wonderin' what I got comin'
Niggas I'm comin' like this, off in your mouth like a bitch
Trust me when you think of me, I'm bringing water, I'll start it

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
What's the business?
It's that player that you love to hate, always see come out the bank
Always have to mention my name, when you high on that drank
Catch up with this boy you can't, cause you know I'm holdin' rank
When you see the platinum Rolex with the ice it make you faint
Through the streets now have you heard, 'bout the Mafia droppin' birds
Runnin' from the narcs and cops, tossin' out the bags of herb
Ain't afraid to pop the steel, hollow tips to make you feel
If you wanna punk me out, Cartier's and a Dracula grill

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]
I can't take anymore, I'm 'bout to explode
I'm 'bout to overload, I'm 'bout to get it, boy
All I wanna know is where the G's at, where the key's at
Keep it easy, you don't want to get skeeted
All on this motherfuckin' room, nigga, boom
Lay down on your back so you can get up soon
Stab you in your heart with a har-fuckin-poon
Nigga, boom, nigga, boom

[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow's on it, I'm still hungry, starvin' for a platinum supper
Wipe it easy, some black founded, crooked ass set'll be eating rubber
'Cause if they skit-skat, gun 'em all down, even ghost towns
Splish-Splash, brains on the ground, with a cannon round
Ball bat, bash him in his back, beatin' bitches down
Battleaxe blaze from the cross, body never found
Catch a close encounter cause the Anna kills off these rap bums
Chemical reaction cobra venom shot into his arm

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These, these, these bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These...
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one of y'all step, the first one I'm a toss out

[Verse 5: Gangsta Boo]
Here we go, all you weak ass hoes
In my face like you my friend
Triple Six dropped in again, time to make ends
Dope game, my game, hoes lame, it's a shame
How that Gangsta Boo is runnin' the click up on you bitches man
Fat cat, what I be, packin', how you love that
Fuck a platinum plaque, gimme money, where the dollars at
(Blap, blap) You're dead in a second for 10 G's
(Where you from?) Black haven is where I be on my P's and Q's

[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
Parents please, watch out for your children
This the one that'll lock 'em in the basement
Some of them talkin' so rugged, some corrupted ugly pussa-pussa
Close your fucking mouth, my nigga, Koopsta tryin' to tell ya somethin'
Peter-Peter, pussy eater, one of them fucked by Koopsta Knicca
Lord, I done some sins, cause she married, but I don't know that nigga
Figured he is a killa, so he figures he'll watch us fuckin'
Put them muthafuckin' slugs upside that thug, cuz, oh my

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These, the-these, these, these bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one of y'all step, the first one I'm a toss out

[Verse 7: Juicy J & DJ Paul]
For that dick game, wouldn't buy your bitch with my loose change
Thirsty niggas eatin' bitches ass with the shit stain
Insane like my motherfuckin' wrist game, nigga
Houses on the hill cost the same fuckin' thing
Counted up a hunnid this mornin'
Then I went spent me 50
Then I hit the VLive, tryna buy me some ass and titties
Rappers sample my old shit, keep runnin' 'em bags, I'm uh rich
Get 'em samples cleared 'cause that publish you might not get some
Niggas act like they don't owe me somethin'
I'm the reason bitches twerkin' they ass, now show me somethin'
Payin' homage is a real nigga move, bitch I paid my dues
Sold a million out the trunk, you niggas uber poo
Pour that mud up like that butter, first nigga with that pipe in the club
Used to have to turn my shit up, had niggas tryna fight in the club
Y'all leaving with them, we hit them hoes right in the club
And I know I'm icy'd up, pinky just like that dub
You gotta like my shit, you a hater or somethin'
I'm a grown ass man, you a baby or somethin'
Probably fucked yo mama on the come up in the 80's, homie
Don't you ever try to play me, homie
Got a wife now like Kanye
And I wish a bitch would try to bite her like Beyonce
My daughter 2 months and she been paid
Boutta sign more deals, cop more real estate
Me and Pat used to rob for 'em petty things
Now it's nothin' less than private jets, 7 figure checks
Hater, catch yo fuckin' breathe, you broke, ain't got nothin' left
We them niggas in Dubai from the north, don't you ever flex
Mafia, runnin' shit, Juicy J ain't never quit
Ain't a bitch I never hit, still countin' paper, bitch
When the smoke clears, nigga, I'm still here
Higher than I been in 20 goddamn years, uh
Motherfuckin' legend get your smoke right, dope right (Who run it)
Ain't no conversation for that broke life, show right,  (Who run it) bitch

[Verse 8: CupcakKe & DJ Paul]
Let me talk my shit real quick (Who run it), all the real niggas gon' feel this
How that's yo' kid but he ain't got bills? Can't find you in family pics
Food stamps, they go so quick when you up in a family of six
So it's funny how they sell that shit for a little pack of weed and a new pair of kicks
Man, I'm so dead, I can't, inside I feel so blank
Little girls on Twitter talkin' 'bout they break up, girl, sit back on Paint
If I'm alive, no complaints, none of these judges saints
Let the black beat her, that's 10 years, but if white beat her, ""nice tank""
It's so ridiculous, ain't shit funny, ain't ticklish
Don't test me if I'm with the shits, end up in a cage, no Nicholas
Everything about me is interesting, I'ma need more and more Benjamins
Damn, I can't breathe, stop smoking them trees, got your insides looking like Christmas
Ungrateful hoes, get the fuck out of here, you had a rough day and I had a rough year
So when I get money I really do care, go and invest it, not spending on gear
Think about that, just stating facts, niggas don't chart when it's real rap
Earn my respect then you get it right back, that go hand in hand ain't talkin' dap
A lot of issues in my past still hurt me to this day, to the core
I don't ever open up 'cause I know people change like the oil
Over 100k up on tour, still got a mindset like I'm poor
But I'm on the roll when it come to rappin' like a pack of aluminum foil
Man, I love walking barefoot, I really like the feel when I'm at the bottom (what?)
'Cause I know it's only for a couple of seconds, then I'm right back to my stardom (that's right)
Motherfuckers ain't woke, man, I gotta fuck around and re-alarm 'em
I'm woke all day, 3 AM, when they call me Jake from State Farm
Okay, lil' bitch, act like you know, anything I say is right like nose
Walk right over there, hoe, like roach, and it's over for these hoes, no dose
Walk in that bitch with a white T, they don't really like me but you know how that goes
Walk out that bitch you would think I'm little red riding hood, how I got blood on my clothes

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 9: G Herbo]
All I smoke is loud, you got that mild like Darius (yeah)
My son ain't gotta work because he gon' inherit it, uh huh (gon' inherit it)
We yell, ""Gang-gang first,"" you don't even know your heritage (bitch)
Took the cash from verses, I give that shit to charity
Lovin' my city like Chano, I swear
Why the fuck I still gotta ride everywhere with it?
""Herb I seen you on the news, I was worried""
We was just jokin' with y'all, that's a parody
We don't talk too much, got D's everywhere (everywhere)
We still fresh, double G's everywhere (everywhere)
I put the VV's everywhere (everywhere)
I do Mike Amiri's, every pair
And they know me for shittin' on everybody
I'm the one that do shit that you hear about
I'm the one that told y'all that I move like Obama
Then how the fuck they end up with my whereabouts?
Hold on everybody gotta clear it out
Middle of summer, hot like a sauna
We was laid back in the back of the Honda
Told young to sneak up, anaconda
It ain't happen, not one day, your honor
I was somewhere eatin' Benihana's
Get valet and Lil' Benny to park it
All my life I had been in apartments
Move to Bali, get a brib, I’m ballin
My bitch always primpin', keep ballin'
Yes I'm a lil' workaholic
Hit the crib with a 50 and all 20's
I'ma just make her count all of 'em
But I get the backend all blues
Nah don't fuck around, bruh, do all of it
Know it's goin' right to lil' dude
Already got a closet, all shoes
Bought 10 pairs of baby G-Fazos
And my bitch got a closet with some Loubs
Cashed out on the crib, I ain't get the view
I'm like, ""Fuck it, no problem, it'll do""
Mama's crib got a pond, not a pool
We had roaches and rats, I ain't get to move
I survived through it all, it's true (yes, it's true)
Slept on couches and floors all through middle school
Now I'm cool, now I'm 'bool
Now my car go vroom, (vroom)
Niggas hatin' on me, but it's bool
Guess I got rich too soon
Nigga, I've been rappin' like six years (what?)
I seen ten niggas get killed
What about me turnin' down them deals? (Huh)
Now you pissed off 'cause I switched wheels?

[Interlude: G Herbo]
Uh, who run it? Limit
No Limit run it
No Limit man
No Limit
Who run it? G Herbo
I'm done with this shit

[Verse 10: Lil Uzi Vert]
Who y'all think you foolin'? Not me
Y'all niggas really ain't airin' nothin'
This bust down, tryna scare us or some'
Your shit weak, tryna compare us or somethin'
What I made last week? Like a million or somethin'
Rich, mad 'cause your bitch ate my kids or somethin'
Man, I could fuck your wife like you sharin' or somethin'
Galore ass mansion with lira or somethin'
Nigga tried to get my ho, tried to fuck my bitch
You think I'ma miss that?
Man she sucked Meen's dick and she sucked Rock's dick
So you think I'ma kiss that?
I was in L.A., bitch powdered her nose
Told her I ain't with that
Boy you trippin', SI diamonds on your neck
Mean you better give your wrist back
Me no broke, Akademiks, yeah, that's where you get your news at
Ask your bros, Grammy-nominated songs just to prove that
Know your bros told you, nah, you better not just do that, uh
I'm going mode, T.Y., tell me when to go, boy, you ain't rich, you a bitch (facts)
Oh you T'd out? Bitch, you beat out
Y'all worried 'bout me, better get your lick back
Just like bitches, y'all all chit chat
Car so foreign got an engine in the back
Balenciaga with the Gucci and the Prada
With the Louis and the Pucci and it's all mismatched
Ho, it's Lil Uzi and I'm far from a goofy
In Chiraq, 150, be strapped
Got a 40 shorty, boy, better get back
Gun loud, backyard party, kick back
How I'm broke If I just hired myself a hitman?
Be quiet, bro, them niggas over there'll turn to six rats
Not lyin', bro, I been fucked this bitch for six racks
After I drop that shit, me, Herbo, Ari and my bitch is gonna relax
Prolly somewhere on a beach, prolly somewhere on an island
You know that my Rollie got XO diamonds in it, so that's that Perfect Timing
Said, ""Elliot, bezel it,"" ice kettle chips, I run it back like a Heisman
Pull up, I'm swervin', I'm mergin', I got the whip, yeah the one right with the curtains
Got boys that be workin' their block to be twerkin', the Tesla pull up for diversion
On the beat, me and Herbo, we purgin', the Perky the molly the lean got us slurrin'
You call her phone, you think she sleep, but she suckin' my dick while her words keep on slurpin'
She said that my shit the same size as a two-liter ginger ale, why she keep burpin'
I take out my hair and I stand on my money, your bitch think I'm Julius Erving

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

I'm on Percocet's, I think I'm finna skydive (yeah)
You little pussycat, you must think you got nine lives (21)
I'm so sick of all this fruity shit, you niggas on thin ice
That stick gon' cut you half-time, now these niggas wanna switch sides (straight up)
I ain't really with that takin' shit, lil' nigga, I'm walkin' up (straight up)
That .30 like a tree lil' nigga, watch where you barkin' up (straight up)
We got way too many shots, y'all lil' niggas can't dodge enough (on God)
We can even challenge ya, 'cause y'all lil' niggas ain't charged enough (fast)
Quarter million dollar for a walkthrough (straight up)
Get the utmost respect when I walk through (straight up)
I love the way you suck that dick, lil' bitch, don't forget who taught you (straight up)
Way too much, can't stalk you (straight up)
Bogeyman, nigga, I'll haunt you (on God)
All these bullets 'round me, nigga, I ain't got time to punch you (21)

Broad day, I'll see food, had to hit a lick at Kiku (yeah-yeah)
Lil' bitch I don't need you (yeah-yeah)
Hell Nah, I can't eat you (yeah-yeah)
Let the whole gang G you, then I left that bitch at Jeju (yeah-yeah)
You must be scared or some, nigga, let's bet the spread or some (21)
That's your main bitch, but I bet that lil' bitch spread for some (on God)
I got all these blues like I ain't bangin' red or somethin' (trre)
I bought all these cars like l ain't got no legs or somethin' (yeah)
Fuck that other side, pull up in ya hood switch it (21)
Sex, money, murder, two guns, nigga, big B's (21)
Every time I hit that bitch she come back like a frisbee (yeah)
I ain't got time to play with nobody kids, go watch Disney (yeah)
Skin made of concrete, nigga, you can never be me (21)
My brother down the road with a touchscreen and a FeFe (BF)
Candlelight gang, leave a nigga on the TV (21)
Fish fry gang, y'all can't even afford to die
Bitch, I'm way too real, I can't even afford to lie

[Verse 12: A$AP Rocky]
Make a bitch wanna stare or something
Niggas stare, you queer or somethin'?
You's a bitch, yeah we stay done
Chose a whip but I'm staying sunny
Diamonds sunny like I'm Cher or something
Smiley faces with the glasses
Fashion brands invite you to Paris
Boy you late that's a demerit, dang it
Get fucking maggot brain having
Rappers claiming the trap and the fashion
They only got Louis and the trap
I'm causing the flood and the traffic
The way that you be moving is whack
All of them rumors is facts
They've been in clap for the clap back
Your baby mama a nag nag
Nag nag nag nag nag nag...

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

[Verse 13: Trippie Redd]
Lil' nigga let them llamas fly, leave a young nigga so traumatized
Totin' gats jit, all my niggas ride
Don't make me make another mama cry
Do a drill, catch another homicide
Fix your face, nigga, you got butterflies?
Chopper at your throat and you afraid to die
Big 14, fuck the other side
Jugg, jugg, got all this jewelry
Man, this shit ain't new to me
Your bitch new to you, she ain't new to me
I ain't really with the fucking foolery
Glistenin' in these fucking diamonds
Bad bitch and I'm fucking shining
I got a bad bitch from the fucking islands
Taking trips to the fucking islands
Guess these guys don't realize
When they talking fly, man, it's suicide
Don't talk, do a nigga do or die
Nobody else, nigga, you and I
Big chopper, I'ma let the bullets fly
That red dot right between your eyes
I don't play, pussy, wish a nigga try
'Cause that'd be the night niggas die
Niggas act like I ain't G.O.A.T. or somethin'
Take a trip, go chill with the bros or somethin'
Call a few bitches, chill with some hoes or somethin'
Niggas be flexin', they bold or somethin'
They don't want that war, go home or somethin'
Internet flexin' with the phone or somethin'
You a lil' pup, nigga, fetch a bone or somethin'
Niggas male strippers when them poles bummin'

Glock out, running we empty 12
Bitch on my dick, that's a love spell (yeah)
Bitch with the shits, call her Annabelle (yeah)

Burn out, burn out
Every time we turn out, make a big scene (yeah)
2K, 3K, 4K, 5K, spent it on my new jeans (skrt skrt skrt)
Gave big bro twenty-seven racks for his birthday, the world made a scene (facts)
Y'all don't even know how a nigga live

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 15: Tutweezy]

[Verse 16: Young M.A.]
Twenty racks in the back of jeans
Tatted sleeves, Patek freeze
Pretty nigga, that indeed
Thottie with me, black and cream
African, Japanese
I just call her blackanese
I'm just gonna tap that and leave
I don't leave the house unless I got a bag waitin' for me at the front door
If you short on my cash, thirty niggas hoppin' out a Uber truck
So don't try your luck, hoes down to fuck
Top floor of the hotel
Smokin' weed in the bathroom, put the shower on so it's no smell
Street cold, don't tell
But I'd rather live where it's no hell
It's funny how hatin' niggas be the ones who names ring no bells
Oh well, my bitch bad
And her pussy got a soap smell
She a model, nah she a model
She a little bougie
And I'm just tryna put this big wet tongue on top of that coochie
Earlier she a little mad at me, she a little moody
Sometimes I don't understand the bitch, she a little confusing
Like half the time I don't be even doin' shit, and she be assuming
Like I ain't loyal or somethin'
You act like I don't call you or somethin'
You act like you a little spoiled or somethin'
Is you hot like you boiling somethin'?
So all you rappers it's a rap for you like aluminum foil or somethin'
Better crown her, came from the ground up, from the soil or somethin'
Been 'bout it, every nigga with me poppin' like oil or somethin'
I was slackin', had to get on track like I'm recordin' or somethin'
I hear a lot of talk, but honestly they ain't really talkin' 'bout nothin'
And nowadays I don't trust a thing, so I ain't really sure about nothin'
I just fucked your bitch in Givenchy flip flops
And yeah we spendin' money, but we also spin blocks
Bend blocks, shout out my nigga Jezz, big opps
They ain't open up them doors, I had to pick locks
Free Bobby, free Rowdy, free the whole 9
Got lit on my own nigga, didn't need a cosign
It's Red Lyfe, no red lights, green lights go time
But before you get on the road, nigga make sure you know your road signs
He asked did I fuck his bitch, I said ""uh yeah nigga, four times""
My sex drive longer than my show lines, make her cum in no time
RL that's the bro sign, can't come in, we got closed sign
Can't hang here, this is not a clothesline
Fuck around and get clotheslined
No ghostwriter, I wrote mine
Wrote the whole rap and the whole rhyme
They like ""MA, where the album at?""
I just need a lil' more time
I got guns, but if I ain't usin' it, no need to show mine
Don't mean I won't blow, ma
Bitch nigga, you could blow, ma
In the club I drink out the bottle, ain't no need to even pour mine
Stripper bitches don't like me 'cause I get money and don't throw mine
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me, ain't gotta say it, you already know why
If I had a dick, you could suck it
If I had nuts, you could hold mine

[Refrain: Young M.A.]
I said, if I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Haha
If I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Fuck y'all niggas
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 17: Bhad Bhabie]
Ayy
When I look around, don't see nobody in my lane
See these rappers need the clout, that's why they always say my name
I'm only gettin' better, bitter bitch it ain't gon' change
Why you tryna hang around me, bitch, get off 'cause you ain't gang
You ain't gang, treat you like a stain
All my biz is straight, I'd still be good without the fame
I got so many cousins, aunts, uncles that I never knew
On me for my revenue, I'm big now like I'm 7'2""
New whip and my leather smooth, try me, I'ma play it cool
Windows down, AC blowin', 20 below, I'm extra cool
You lookin' fed up 'cause of my bread up, I keep my head to the sky
Run up, [?] and I'm back to [?] where I'm droppin' the fire
Who want it? Tell me, bitches, who blunted?
You ain't know my crew run it? All we see is blue hundreds
On my dash, 200, these bitches sad and can't run it
Ho I'm a star, you wanna walkthrough you better tell me who fundin'

[Verse 18: Crank Lucas]

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

[Verse 19: Chevy Woods & Wiz Khalifa]
Ay bitch, this a brand new chain
Put her in Vera Wang
She got a crazy top
I let her go insane
G-shit in my veins
Limited seats on my plane
Get to the country they know my name
I could pay for anything I'm ordering
Whether it's bitches, California weed, fourth down
Got 20 inches
I'm rolling up hella green by the pound
You wanna pinch this
Wondering what the stench is
Always played my position
We balling cause we the realest
...

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

[Verse 20: Roy Purdy]
Just make sure to always stay true to who you are"", and I did that
Jeans black with a pink hat
Sorry, I don't wanna come to ya kickback
Oh no, so cold like Frozone
9-2-0, what I rep, that's home
Big racks, big facts, no foolery
Got 'em like ""God damn, man, who is he?""
It's me, ya boy Roy so crispy
Really had to go and hit 'em with the quick speed
Too fast, look left, look right
You ain't gon' see nothin' like me in sight
Hit my dance real quick, ouu, I just might
Wanna sleep on me? Okay, good night
I'm gone, new song comin' soon
Ya boy Roy really been up in the stu'
It's nothin' new, yeah, this what I do
Been makin' music way before all the views
Whi-white T with the white vans
Oh man, god damn, I'm fresh
Kickin', laid back, life's good, no stress
I don't gotta flex, you know I'm up next
Sike, bitch, I'm up now
I'm holdin' it down
I'm feelin' great
I cannot frown
""Who Run It"" remix
Just something light
Had to snap real quick, now I'm droppin' the mic
Okay

[Verse 21: Slim Jesus]
Ayy, ayy, gang
Y'all know how the fuck I'm rockin' man
I'm hearin' a whole lot of talk about who run this shit
I be countin' stacks
Who run Ohio, that's me
Which one of y'all hotter than me?
Leave the beat like a hundred degrees
And it's still all this ice on me
Who getting plays like me?
Who getting paid like me?
Y'all was not made like me
And I put that on my G's
Remember they hated on me
I knew all I needed was cheese
Ran it up and I blew it on jeans
Had to run it back up times three
None of y'all wanna be like me
Run around with them pipes like me
Fresh pair of Off-Whites on my feet
Gold chain on a Polo white tee
In a trap with a whole lot of P's
Smoking dope 'til we Vietnamese
I threw bro lil thirty
He threw like fifty to me
All of these rappers is broke
That shit be sickening to me
You blew the whole bag on the road
You look like a victim to me
I just pulled up in a foreign
And you got a Honda on E
All black tints on all my whips
'Cause I know they're looking for me
Just know wherever I go
It's a glizzy with me right up under the seat
I give a fuck what you claiming you is
You can get touched with the heat
I remember being irrelevant
Now I get bands for all of my feats
Remember totin' tourists
Now we got AR's that's chopping down trees
It's a fifty on bro and a thirty on me
You don't really really want the beef
You can talk that shit on the internet
Run up, get done up, get wrapped up in sheets
They was talking crazy last night
'Til a hundred shots hit they block
I don't even know who got hit with that shit
But we smoking all opps
Everywhere I go I'm with the gang
It's at least three or four of them Glocks
If you speaking on who run it, ain't say my name, you smoking on rocks
I'm in the street like fuck 12, bitch I'm off the Henny
You can find me with the gang 'cause I don't fuck with many
Them my brothers, if I'm busting they gon' dump it with me
They know I'm a threat and that's the reason they ain't fucking with me, gang

Niggas goin down fast like stop drop

[Verse 23: TA Double Dolla]
They say I'm bougie and cocky

Threw a bag at my baby mama here you go, go shopping
Every other day I'm waking up to new money
Gettin deposits in
From negative to positive
Dollar boy just landed
In the city of angels
...

[Verse 24: Idontknowjeffery]
Point me out to who run it
Fuckin' man or a woman
I kick they ass in the stomach until they vomit from it
Nigga I'm sick I'm bubonic and you and that bitch is platonic
Stab your ass in the stomach and clean the mess up with Comet
Fuck all that extra shit
I'm in the bed with a naked bitch and her head just twist like damn exorcist
What ya tryna posses me with
The way she suck my dick was an accident cause I ain't even have to ask the bitch
Nigga I'm stingy as hell
I'm face my hoes nigga I don't even pass the bitch
And I shit on niggas on accident like I ate some laxatives
Try to impress me with that bullshit turn him to an acronym
Nigga its Prick Harper
I'm a shit starter
And all that bullshit you talkin' make my dick harder
I treat a rapper like his father I don't text him I don't call him
I don't bother
Nigga I let the Glock solve problems

[Verse 25: Xavier Wulf]
These rappers ain't runnin' shit but ya bitch
Who, where she at?
She at the crib tryna cook me something every damn day
Told her ""bitch I do it better"" by myself go move away
Here to stay
Up from now until whenever the fuck I say
...
Well I could I ain't never had a juug but I had a blunt to finish
You rap niggas still capping
...
Pulled up with a bitch so thick I'ma leave a little bit early just to hit

[Verse 27: Jeremih]
Lil' mama give me head 'til I'm dead, I call it brainstormin'
You ain't even halfway 'Yonce, I could put a ring on it
Pop, country, rap, trap, punk, rock, I could still sing on it
On the block wit' niggas big as Shaq but I could still hang on it
3 story, no story, no Tory, this a different lane on 'em
Lane to lane, white ghost, red gust, that's a candy cane, homie
Everybody wanna be the king but who gon' make the claim for it
I'ma say me for the moment
[?]
So [?], I ain't scared or nothin'
Chicago made me a bear or somethin'
I just skydive, I'm so live, you could catch me comin' out the air or somethin'
Lost some niggas gettin' this money, still got a pocket full of dead homies
Got a bad bitch wit' a head on her
Versace robe, two bands for it
It's God's plan, I ain't playin' for it
I'm just tryna be the landlord
I came to fuck up the buildin'
Hitman, I'm gon' make a killin'
I'm used to shoppin' at Sears, now I be shoppin' wit Siri
Used to be stealin' cologne, now I be stealin' your bitches

[Bridge]
Yeah
Nah mean?
[?]
[?] slow it down, you know?
Go the other way on 'em

[Verse 28: Jeremih]
Yeah
Pull up to the Valley, car got no keys
Diamond pinky ring cost a low key
Make a play [?], you should proceed
Big ballin', put the money on the flo' seats
Bank account always doin' backflips
Used to have the walls and the matress
Numbers still the same since the old me
Don't get it fucked up, I ain't the old me
Who run it? Now who run it?
My pockets on cucumber
I'ma have yo' girl over
Have her speakin' boonomics
Got the Kevin Gates, I got that two phones, I got two numbers
Ain't talking YouTube numbers
I could take a few summers

[Verse 33: Dax]
Had to come here and enlighten
Had to come give you the facts, trapping is wack
You might get a stack
Your daughter at home, your mama still crying
Blacks in America dying
Trump in office, he wildin'
Droppin these bars for fun, we going to war
But look at the timing, buying
They put me in chains, confined me
I'm rapping the real but can't get a deal
These niggas is not replying
Why the system be falsifying?
They say that I might be crazy
They say that my shit too real
The reason that they cannot play me
Industry cannot detain me
A cross of Pac and Baby
I've been to hell and back, that's why they say they cannot save me
Ain't poppin' no pills, I stay in the field
These niggas is fakes, they mad that I'm real
I see that you broke, don't know how that feel
You gave up your life by signin' a deal
Might shout out to Kaep for taking a kneel
Might shout out to Jag for rappin the real
My bars is guns, they can't conceal
These niggas dumb
Not a rapper, I be in my own division
Save the world by 2020, nigga I be on a mission
I just started and I'm right exactly where I had envisioned
Niggas blind, that's why I rap, to clear their motherfucking vision
Fucking on the game
Fucking on you bitches who've been fucking for the fame
I've be getting rich and dodging niggas who ain't changed
Tried to tell my shooters, had to read [?] out the chain
With a bitty lil name, lil nigga you ain't gang
You not, circle small, like a dot
Keep it tight 'cause people like to come and try and make you fall
I've seen it all, it's fine
They'll try and stop your shine
They snakes, still smile up in your face but talk that shit behind, behind
I seen it all baby, watch out for these snakes in the grass
They sayin' just enough to your face to keep you happy
That way in case you do make it, they can say they been there
Ayy DJ cut the beat, cut the beat

[Bridge: Dax]
Hip hop is not dead and never left
It's just a book collectin' dust I found on the shelf
I don't care if you wanna read it or anybody else
'Cause I'll turn myself to Jesus and resurrect it myself

[Verse 34: 6ix9ine]
Yo, I usually don't do this
But you know what I'm saying
Had to come body bag this one time
Niggas really thought I was in jail or something
Momma didn't raise no hoe or something
I was really in the store bought a Snickers or something
I - I was trapping in the-in the way back and I got that
And I flip that and I really get that
But I told my mom ""I don't do that!""
But she was really there
And I told her that ""Yeah, I'm coming in,""
But she was like, ""Nah, don't come near""
And I was like, ""GED""
And I said, ""I flip that, really get that""
I whip that and I hit that and I-yeah
LA see you next week, Coachella I'm here today
But fuck that we here and we live wit' TR3YWAY
Fuck that umm
Cut it

Please don't run, I got the MAC out

Watch in your face, tell me how you gon' act now, bitch

Clarity, clarity, clarity, clarity, all this ice on me (ice)
Got this bad bitch with blonde hair, I call her Russian Cream
And I got that baby chopper, I'll rock your ass to sleep
Can't stand me, take a seat (ho), designer head to feet, yeah
Everything on fleek, Cartier on me, yeah
I dress like a geek, yeah, boy your swag is weak, yeah
That shit is so cheap, yeah, my shit overseas, yeah

Call me Glock Ali, yeah, diamonds fighting like Tina
Turner, bitch I turn up, Royal Rumble
Thirty niggas with me and you know they ready to burn you
Knuck if you buck, run up and you get done up
No I'm not from Louisville, but bitch I keep my slugger
Straight up out the jungle, ain't no talk or tussle
Got no time to scuffle, I'm 'bout my chips like Ruffles
Workin like a butler, ain't no more struggle
Tell these niggas catch up, tennis chains mustard
Ran up my racks, run and tell that
Ran through a bag and got that shit right back
These niggas ain't doing shit, these niggas ain't talkin' jack
You niggas ain't running shit, this chopper make you run a lap
Yeah
Glizzock

[Verse 38: Ballout]
Who you think you ahead of? Not us
I'm in a truck called SRT or somethin'
Doin' Need for Speed or somethin'
Hundred thousand my key or somethin'
Two hundred my Jeep or somethin'
Niggas broke as hell actin' like they don't know how to eat or somethin'
Miami Beach Louis sandals, know I got my heat or somethin'
At the condo, you can't get in unless you got a key or somethin'
Smokin' out the 440 and it smoke a P or somethin'
Took the doors off, ridin' through Cali in my Jeep stuntin'
Long as they print money it's gon' keep comin'
I know you hear my Jeep runnin'
I ain't pumpin' gas, they gon' keep pumpin'
Ride through the hood and they keep honkin'
People look at me and they see money
I'm a boss, d-money
Load em' people up, my phone gon' keep jumpin'
They like ""Ball, is it weed or is it d-money?""
Bankroll like street money
Walk in Neiman's, leave the Hellcat and the Jeep runnin

[Verse 39: Chief Keef]
My bitch said she gon' leave me like she complete somethin'
Bitch, you [?] met you at 2:30 and fucked your ass at 3 somethin'

Might be in the trap, call Jeep or somethin'
Might get Ball with a whole P or somethin'
Might be in SRT or somethin'
Krispy might make a bitch cream or somethin'
Cross that red line, get a beam or somethin'
Wake you up like you had a bad dream or somethin'
Who, Chief Sosa think he Rambo?
I was in the field with the lizard
Doing spinouts since the blizzard
Like Snoop Dogg ""What's the wiz-zard?""
Disappear on that bitch like a wizard
And I'm cuttin' real sharp like a scissor
Roll by so fast, Big Dipper
I'm in LA more than a Clipper
Balenciaga more than a owner
Bitch, we out here more than a corner
Smoke way more dope than a stoner
And I drink way more than Homer
I can see like Christopher Columbus
Juiceman, the trap house bunkin'
You niggas ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
King Sosa don't care about nothin'
F on my shirt, on my feet double Gs
Start gettin' F's in sixth grade, couldn't even get a couple B's
All for my habit, whats the fee? A couple G's
Aye lil' bitch, these Moncler, no need to buckle these
Aye lil' baby, these not me, no need to upload these
And when you hear that [?], bitch that's me up your street
And just make you think about when they put that thing up your teeth
Lil' nigga said up yo chest talkin' to me, up your speech

[Verse 40: Chief Keef & Ballout]
Pullin' off from Neiman's doin' donuts in the Jeep
Track [?] Look like Black Hawk flying out the street
Hopped out for twenty minutes for a backend
Seen your girlfriends tryna get back in
Hopped in the Hellcat, had to put the track in
Ball, you got the blues, why the fuck you blackin'?
Ball, you can rap, why you steady trappin'?
'Cause I get it for the L-O like Shawty nigga, tap in
Sosa, why you pay a thousand for that headband?
Because Ben Franklin is a dead man
Any time you see me, wonder that's that bread man
If he step in front his gun, then that's a brave man

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 41: Moneybagg Yo]
Pink and purple in my cup, I'm Lil Pump-in'
Trap jumpin' (like what, like what?)
Like some fingers, it's thumpin'
Who done it?
Pockets fat with bricks of hundreds, I'm Klump-in' (Sherman)
I run it
Headed to the top, like quickies I'm comin' (ugh ugh)
Bagg
Talkin' 'bout quickies, I'm comin'
Ugh ugh, yeah
2 Heartless, 2 Heartless, two of 'em
Get hit for lookin' suspicious (watch how you look)
Diamonds wet, they gon' wash the dishes
Sittin' in the coupe with the missus, Whitney
If you bad you can fuck her with me
I'm taking chances, risks (risks)
Learn how to dance, my wrist did (Breezy)
I'm like the Memphis Kendrick (Lamar)
I was broke, now I""m a rich kid (look at my shoes, watch me plug walk)
This new freezer cost right here sixty (sixty K, shout out to Icebox)
AP ring and watch Jordan Pippen (duo)
And you know I run this shit, pockets keep me limpin'
2 Heartless, 2 Heartless, two of 'em, yeah

[Verse 42: Skippa Da Flippa]
Flippa
I get trippy like three six
I just hit a bad bitch with my new bitch
I don't do Kel-Tec, FN can't miss
Souped up box Chevy came with a kill switch (kill out)
I stack bread, mister winners (stack it)
I drive a tank in the winter (kill 'em)
No L's, nigga I'm a winner
This year is not for beginners
These pair of [?] call 'em Sprinters
Seventy K for a new straight A
I'm havin' shooters, no mayday
Every day to me is more money Monday
And my neck is cold like I ate a sundae
Get up, stack the money, never switch up
A hundred for the Patty, know I stay lit up
I'm pushin' for greatness but I don't do sit-ups
And I love a bitch that can get my dick up
I been quiet but I can really start a riot
You can get it grilled or fried
Your favorite rapper be cappin' with lies
I call it burnt out and tied, therefore we don't have ties
Water on me, submarine
Break the pot, I cook up clean
What's the blue strip without greens
When it comes [?] I'm the king
I say I'm too blunt, I'm not mean
Good game from an old head, call him Sega
Ice talk crazy on the Razr
I keep it player, new crib got layers
It ain't 'bout paper, I'll talk to you later
I give you pimpin', but I stay drippin'
You small like a wiz then I ball like I'm Pippen
You be slippin', they call you Tristan
You tell the tea so I named you Lipton
Hundred bows, kicked a hundred doors
They cash me out then I bring a hundred more
New Rari came with Lambo doors
House in Berlin came with three stoves
She ride the dick, no Rodeo Drive
Hit you with a combo, you get two sides
Black excellence, I'm excellent
I bought the block back for the Nobel Prize
Pink slip shawty right now 'cause I'm on
You pop big shit now then it's on
Think smart, first get a call then a home
You don't need a loan, get a zone, get it gone
I'm on my ten flip now, get your own
AP two-tone freeze, honeycomb
I'm lightskinned, call me Kev Combs
And I get money, badda-bing badda-bom
I could count a whole hundred in your face
I got air, fuck a pair of human race
Walk in safe, look like a Chase
Dipped out my safe and it turned to a chase
You tryna be me, I bet you gon' fail
Big checks comin', now I check the mail
I'm thinkin' money, blue or green hundreds
House in the hills, it look like a whale's (whoa)
I could say somethin' but it ain't the time
It ain't on me if ain't mine, eliminate me with a lime
I got heart of a lion, if I said they ain't bitin' I'd be lyin'
Lowkey in a low-rider, I write mines, no ghostwriter
I be leanin' and lookin' for the new Spider
I'm on fire and my chains firefighter (Flippa)

[Verse 43: Cdot Honcho]
I paid a G for my sneakers bitch
These ain’t no regular Adidas, hah
Have fo'nem parked outside your shit
Like your shit an arena
I’m up on Hollywood Boulevard
Fo'nem with me, not a bodyguard
Try it, you know they be choppin' shit
Might turn this bitch to a lumberyard
I was the first one in SRT
And I drove that bitch like a bumper car
I got your bitch up on DVD
Ain’t got a heart, need another heart
Roc, he'll circle around your block
On point like he really can’t find a park
Pop out you only gon' see a spark
Police said they only seen a dart
I got ten K in my joggers, ayy
You don’t want problems
Five on your head, niggas gon' pop out your closet
Smokin' biscotti, too much gelato
Feel like I’m sitting on a rocket
Ain’t no more space in my pockets
Ain’t no more space in my closet either
I just be thinking 'bout profit
I'm in the coupe with a mamacita
She only good for the noggin
That bitch know she got a mouth on her
She eat me up then I’m out on her
No we don’t play with the police games
She know we put a route on her
Look I ain't shit, with another one
Nothing was given l ran it up, bitch

[Verse 44: Sauce Walka]
If I really want his body I'ma sleep in the grass
If I get my hands dirty I'ma wash 'em in gas
Get that gunpowder off me, roll a wood up, and laugh
'cause I'm really 'bout that murder, I'll smoke your ass
Pay a bitch to wrap you with a cord and choke your ass nigga
Yeah I could get on some evil shit
Rip out your heart like a demon shit
Send body parts to your people shit
Yeah I send your hands to your mama
I send your legs to your daddy
I send your eyes to your granny
I send your foot to your daughter
Fuck it, the label some horror
Fuck it, the label some saw
Granny playin' guitar, 'cause you ain't never ever comin' back no more
I got guns when it comes to the store
I got guns that you niggas can't order
I got guns that you never can borrow
I got guns that can still shoot good underwater
I got guns that can shoot through brick walls, I got guns that got night vision
I got guns that shoot hand grenades, I got handguns that hold fifty
I got guns with long barrels on 'em, look so ugly, shoot so pretty
I got guns in my bitch titties, moral is don't fuck with me
If it's an issue we see him 'bout it, if it's an issue we be about it
It ain't a question if we about it, it ain't a question if we about it
Master P, yeah I'm 'bout it 'bout it
'bout it 'bout it, 'bout it 'bout it, 'bout it
Ran up him with a shotty, ran up on him with a shotgun
Make him jump like a pop gun, let both kids play with pop guns
Like a needle I'ma pop somethin', like a football I'ma drop somethin'
Ooh-wee
Who done it? who done it?
Who done it? who done it? nigga
The kid done did, one and done nigga
Sorry for the Sauce 3
Who done it? who done it? me

They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide (hah)
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us but I lied (hah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, ayy, look who I'm around, man

Fourth floor bound, man, that's if I get caught, man
Pushed me to the edge, so it really ain't my mothafuckin' fault
Man, I'm not to blame, man, this fuckin' industry is cutthroat
I'm not the same, man, and I could let you check the tag now
I'm rockin' name brand, I'm only chasin' after bags now
I got a game plan and I'm out here with the woo!

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
All of y'all wishy and washy
All y'all my kids in a car seat
I take my dime to hibachi, we do 69 like Tekashi
Lyin' in the sand, too much time in your hands, I think I need to find you a hobby
God got a plan, hope that God hold your hand, I think I'm 'bout to catch me a body!
Tell all my teachers that I said I'm back on my G shit and I'm coming back to get even
I went on tour and got paid, now I'm back in the region, I let off this mac for no reason
You are now witnessing greatness, I'm practically preaching and this is the passion of Jesus
And all you basic motherfuckas are lacking achievement, and I've just been laughing and geekin'
Back to business, I got mad intentions, I ain't perfect, I done made some bad decisions
But it's competition, I'm a savage winning
You can have the digits, I'm a mathematician
I don't see you niggas, I've been lacking vision
You've been acting different, I've been acting distant
I'ma do some shit to bring me mad attention
You gon' do some shit that send me back to prison, whoa!
This is uncomfortable, you just keep putting your feet in a fire
I think my gun got a crush on you, boy, you 'bout to meet your secret admirer
How you do shit you don't wanna do? I do that shit just to keep me inspired
I used to hit it and leave when I wanted to, now I hit it and be sleepin' inside her, woo
Roll up on 'em when I pull up on 'em, put that motherfucking smoke up on 'em with that holy water
Joyner Lucas, I'm a holy mona leader motor runnin'
Man, too many niggas know about it, but I thought about it
Prayed about it to the Lord about it in the morning, but I gotta show 'em what it's all about and I'ma call 'em out
I ain't that nigga you could talk about, you better calm it down
Don't be tryna give me the runaround, I'ma shut 'em down god damn, wait

Ayy, ayy
Look who I'm around man
A couple people switched, that's why you don't see 'em round man
Four four down man, know that that's a man down
I make bitches stand down then make them put they heads down
Only time you sendin' shots is when you sneak dissin'
Only time I'm on the block is when the bitches send chicken
I ain't trippin' on that nigga, he don't call unless it's business
I ain't trippin' on these bitches, once they eat they in they feelings
I ain't trippin' on no rapper that can't fight but in my business
Get to trippin' on that rapper, if she start I gotta finish
And if you fuck your niggas you can't call them boys your killers
'Cause they playin' with your feelings, mines ain't playin' with these niggas, haha
And I got shit they want but the shit they cannot buy
Bitches brazy on they Live but they barely go outside
I seen pussy in they eyes, I said fuck it, let' em slide
Told 'em I won't text these bitches, I just ho 'em, but I lied
I don't know why bitches tryin' while they funds lookin' tied
I can't trip because they lyin', let 'em take it up with God
These bitches plan winning, we gon' see how hard they grind
'Cause I push these bitches back every time I spit a line, haha

272,"Play My Funk (From ""Sugar Hill"")","""The schools in a portion of Boston stretching from just south of South Boston through Roxbury and into Dorchester are districted with a similar effect: the predominantly black areas are cut away from the predominantly white areas.""

Morgan v. Hennigan, U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, 1974

THE SEEK BUTTON on the Ford's radio is working. The downtown recedes. Miles of neighborhoods fill the windshield. The SEEK function locks on someplace in stereo, college FM probably. ""Yeah,"" a new friend says, ""Whas up. Whas goin on."" The radio has another button, VOL, which gets jacked repeatedly while the Ford hurtles, happily, to the source of the noise. Not to the station's broadcast booth on a campus across the river, nor to its transmission towers in the suburbs, but rather to RJam Productions in North Dorchester, where black kids from Boston's now-integrated high schools-Latin, Madison Park, Jeremiah Burke, Mattapan-cut demos and dream of being bigger than even the radio's new friend, a young man named Schoolly D who right now, at speaker-damaging volume, sounds darn big. ""Before we start this next record…,"" Schooly's saying. The record in question is called ""Signifying Rapper,"" a brief, bloody tale of ghetto retribution from Side 2 of Schoolly's Smoke Some Kill.

The black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in '74, and evidence is everywhere that nothing's changed since then. On the southbound left of the Fitzgerald Expressway pass 20 blocks of grim Irish-Catholic housing projects, the western border of Belfast, complete with Sinn Fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious United Ireland, a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the '74 court order that bused ""Them"" from wherever it is ""They"" live-the Third World fer crissakes--into 97-percent-white South Boston. On the Expressway's right is the place the fibula-busters are talking about: the simultaneous northern border of Haiti, Jamaica and Georgia; a territory that maps of Boston call North Dorchester.

Uniting the two sides of the Expressway is just about nothing. Both neighborhoods are tough and poor. Both hate the college world across the river, which, because of Boston's rotten public schools, they will never see as freshmen. And kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio, which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting the art of a ghetto Philadelphian roughly their age, once much poorer than they, but now, on royalties from Smoke Some Kill, very much richer.

Not that the shared digging of black street music is news, or even new: twenty years ago, when Morgan v. Hennigan, Boston's own Brown v. Board of Education, was inching through the courts, and even dark-complected Italians were sometimes unwelcome in the Irish precincts east of the Expressway, kids in Boston's Little Belfast sang along with James Brown over the radio.

""Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud
Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud!""

Except that halfway through the infectious funk, the crewcuts realize what they're saying: Jesus christ, ""I'm proud to be black"" fer chrissakes, like when you're in the porno store, you know, and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the men's part, you know? not the part for men in the part that's about men, Jesus, and you get the hell outta there. And so they hum/mumble the suppressed parts.

""Say it loud
I'm mmm hum proud
Say it loud
Mum hum hum proud!""

But rap isn't funk, rock or jazz, and the vast crossover move, broadcasting ""ghetto"" music over college radios to ghettos of a different color, is no simple reenactment of past crossovers. How, for example, does the sing-along fan of Smoke Some Kill mumble his way through these lines:

""Black is beautiful
Brown is sick? slick? stiff?
Yellow's OK
But white ain't shit.""

Rjam Productions, modestly headquartered in a mixed black/Hispanic Field, Corner section of North Dorchester, is as follows:

* One (1) four-car garage fitted with dubbing and remastering gear worth more than most of the rest of the real estate on the block;
* One (1) touch-tone telephone (leased);
* Two (2) Chevy Blazers, vanity-plated RJAM1 and RJAM2, each equipped with cellular phones and slick tape decks (also leased);
* One (1) VCR with Kathleen Turner's Body Heat cued up on the morning in question;
* Most importantly, eight (8) promising acts under binding contract

If, as has happened to many local labels, Rjam were liquidated to satisfy creditors, these would be the pieces. But there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneer's gavel. Schoolly D, the original Signifying Rapper, looms irresistibly from the pages of rap ""fanzines"" Hip-Hop and The Source; and Rjam's prime, unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next Schoolly D. Or the next Ice T, or Kool Moe Dee, or L. L. Cool J., or whoever's the special hero of the kid cutting the demo. On this particular morning, the dream is to be the next MC Lyte--a hard-rapping woman known for jams like ""MC Lyte vs. Vanna Whyte"" and ""10% Dis""--since today is Tam-Tam's day and Tam-Tam is, at 16, a tough girl in the MC Lyte mold who, like MC Lyte, can dance, look good, and tell men to beat it, all at once.

Or so claims Tam-Tam's producer, promoter, and dutch uncle, Gary Smith, who opened RJam on Martin Luther King's birthday, '89, with his older brother Nate. Nate, the elder statesman, is 25. Gary, 22, runs the company while Nate travels with his boyhood-friend-turned-boss, quadruple-platinum, Prince-derived rapper/singer, Bobby Brown. RJam was founded in part with an investment from the 23-year-old multi-millionaire Brown, a native of Roxbury. Brown now lives in Los Angeles.

Nate and Gary Smith turn a healthy profit making demos at $500/tape, but the brothers aren't in the health business. Their aim: to follow in the corporate footsteps of Def Jam, a once similarly tiny production company run from a basement in Hollis, Queens, which since its basement days, has given America Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J., the Beastie Boys, and much of the rest of that culture-quake called rap. Gary Smith doesn't compare RJam to Def Jam, and, unlike Def Jam's Russell Simmons, Gary produces pop, soul, and R&B as well as straight rap, and actually prefers R&B. But how many sophomores at nearby Jeremiah Burke can afford to dream in R&B, to front music lessons and $500 for an nth-hand sound set-up, find three friends to learn drums, bass and keyboards, and then raise another $500 to make a demo at RJam? Anybody with a larynx can rap, however, and Rjam's brisk business in rap demos pays the taxman, Boston Edison and the Chevrolet Motor Credit Corp.

Twenty minutes farther south on the Fitzgerald Expressway, across the Neponset River and into the pricey suburbs, is the scene of John Cheever's boyhood, more recently celebrated as Massachusetts Miracle country, where technology ventures are started at the rate of five per week, four of which will fail within 12 months. RJam's Gary Smith is secret brother to the men of the suburban Chambers of Commerce, sharing their worries about cash flow, overhead, and the enforceability of his contracts; but Gary's world and theirs are as far apart as those of Ward and Eldridge Cleaver. Worriers in suburbia fear that ballooning property values will hike taxes on computer executives' seaside homes. In Gary's neighborhood, property values are actually falling.

Waiting less than patiently for Tam-Tam, Gary honks twice. A tall, grave girl with an angel's heart-shaped face crosses the ghetto street and climbs into the back seat of RJAM1. She has, apparently, at least two voices, the cynical, sexy rant heard on tape this morning telling Pebbles men ain't worth it, and the whisper in which she now says hello.

As RJAM1 re-crosses North Dorchester, heading back to the soundproof studios to get the day's work started, Gary and DJ Reese hash out production details. Tam-Tam's a dignified island in the back seat, and a shiver accompanies the thought that this could be the Motor City in '63 with Berry Gordy and an eighty-pound teenage Diana Ross, just voted Best Dressed at Cass Technical High School, driving crosstown to record a little number called ""Where Did Our Love Go.""

Ask Tam-Tam about Diana Ross, and she gives a beatific smile. She's 16; she can remember only with difficulty the first rap she ever listened to, when rap was new and she was 8; Run-DMC or somebody, she mumbles in response to what suddenly seems a foolish question about her influences. Like most of rap's black audience (as distinct from rap's white audience, which is usually a decade older), Tam-Tam has no first-hand recollection of James Brown except as a source for rap. She is too young to have attended segregated schools. She was in diapers during the violent first few months of desegregation in Boston and can't remember the awful day in '74 when ""pro-neighborhood"" marchers from Irish South Boston came upon a black pedestrian at City Hall and beat him with pole-mounted American flags.

Tam-Tam has star presence, and like many who do, she seems to see very little of what goes on around her, the price of the star's intense focus on self. She reminds you of Senator Gary Hart. He, too, had star presence. In front of a crowd, Hart was riveting; in the elevator riding up to the auditorium, he was barely there. Being barely there in the neighborhood Tam-Tam calls home is probably not such a bad thing, and perhaps her drive to be star someday is an elaborate way to wall out the now and here. Ambition is, finally, a form of hope, a scarce commodity in North Dorchester.

Back in Rjam's control booth, Dj Reese and producer Ralph Stacey are programming the rhythm track for what will be ""Ho, You're Guilty."" Drum parts are taken from a Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, a synth which electronically reproduces programmed beats on the user's choice of drum-matrix. The TR-909's keys, on a console designed to resemble, vaguely, the familiar piano, are named after the sound each creates-bass, snare, mid-tom, hi-tom--and the sounds are named after the actual drums which, until the TR-909, were required to make those sounds. The TR-909 even sports a key named HAND CLAP, making it possible for the first time ever to clap hands with a single finger, rendering obsolete the Zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping. The finished ""Ho, You're Guilty"" will sound lush with percussion, melody, and instrumental breaks. Not one human musician will be employed in the recording process.

Each percussion line is programmed onto the mixing board as a separate track: a snare track, a bass track, a clap track, etc. Reese has been studying the classics lately, too, viz: James Brown's Dead on the Heavy Funk from '75ish, including the ageless groove, ""Funky President,"" in which James announces his third-party candidacy. Some of Bobby Byrd's Dead guitar, and a holy moment when James exhales rhythmically, have been isolated from a store-bought cassette of Dead, re-recorded on clean tape, then re-re-recorded onto a computer-readable memory diskette from which the sample is retrieved and altered by Ralph Stacey using a Roland D-50 linear synth. The guitar and the exhalation then go, as altered, from the synth to yet another of the 24 tracks on the big mixing board. Reese, the DJ, will weave a seamless rhythm track out of these 24 strands.

As Reese and Ralph Stacey mix the 24 tracks onto one master tape, Tam-Tam sips lemonade in the corner of the booth. You ask her if she is interested someday in learning about the obscure digital technology the two men manipulate on her behalf. She doesn't seem to register the question. ""The other career besides rap I'd like to pursue is modelling,"" she says. ""I'm five-seven. That's the perfect height for a model.""

Mixing takes the rest of the day. Producer Ralph Stacey at one late point corners you with a flinty stare and an uncomfortable question: ""Why do you want to write about rap, anyway?"" It is lucky that at that minute Reese is done mixing. Tomorrow the RJam staff will tape Tam-Tam's vocal track and lay this over Reese's rhythm track. Then the sound will be ""fattened"" with stacks of horns, guitar hooks, bells, canned applause, and whatever else they decide to take from other tapes or work up on the Rolands. The final demo tape of ""Ho, You're Guilty"" will then be shopped to the 20 major, minor, and tiny labels who might release the demo as a 12-inch single.

Everyone's ready to call it a day. Gary Smith's already huddled with some new wanna-be stars in RJam's reception area. Reese plays the mixed rhythm track once through over the big speakers in the control booth, and Tam-Tam immediately stands, modelling forgotten, utterly alert. Reese gestures to her with maestro hands. She raps at an absent Antoinette in the hard, sexy voice you haven't heard since this morning, extemporaneous but on beat:

""I'm a female
You're just a fairytale.""

The small-w we here are two white Boston males: one native, one oft-transplanted; both residing in Somerbridge, a dim, ethnic-Portuguese neighborhood whose gentrification we abet. M. is an attorney with a taste for jazz, Blues, funk; D. a grad student and would-be drifter who watches TV instead of sleeping. Our cultural tastes and interests are day and night. They converged only lately, when D's stereo arrived UPS and we discovered we shared an uncomfortable, somewhat furtive, and distinctively white enthusiasm for a certain music called rap/hip-hop.* About our passions and discomforts we could determine only that they were vague & distinct contexts and cathexes brought to bear across the same ethnic distance on the same thing. For instance, we agreed that real or serious rap is not JJ FAD or Tone Loc or Beasties, Egyptian Lover or Fat Boys, not experiments or freakshows or current commercial crossover slush. ""Serious"" rap--a unique U.S. inner-city fusion of funk, technified reggae, teen-to-teen ""hardcore"" rock, and the early 70s ""poetry of the black experience"" of Nikki Giavonni, the Last Poets, etc.--has, since its late-70s delivery at the record-scratching hands of Afrika Bambaataa and his Zulu Nation, Sugarhill Gang, Kool Herc and his automated Herculords, and Grandmaster Flash, always had its real roots in the Neighborhood, the black gang-banger Underground. Black music, of and for blacks.

We concurred as to the wheres and whens of rap's begetting--mid-to-late 70s' South Bronx house parties; then, by decade's end, block parties, with municipal electric lights tapped for a power source, literal dancing in the streets; by '82, regular rap-houses and then ""floating clubs""--the Roxy every Sunday, The Bronx's Disco Fever TWTh--everybody Breaking to a new musical antimusic being fashioned from records and turntables and an amateur DJs ad-lib banter; a very heavy reggae influence at the beginning; the more rhythmic pure rap an offshoot, its brisker, sparer, backbeat designed for Breakdance, and the smooth-rapping partygoer who just didn't want to shut up when others' music was on. We agreed, too, on rough chronology: amateur house-partiers giving way to professional DJs, pioneers; they, too, then overshadowed by new art-entrepreneurs, former Breakers, failed singers, gag-majorettes; then the rise of ""Indies,"" the tiny independent labels that keep most new music on life-support--Sugar Hill, Jive, Tommy Boy, Wild Pitch, Profile Records, Enjoy--then, after King Tim III's ""Personality Jock"" and Sugarhill Gang's ""Rapper's Delight,"" an entree into urban black radio; then to underground ""Mix"" radio; then corporate levels, digital technology, very big money, the early-80s talent that became an early Scene's cream--Spoonie G. and Sequence, Eric Fresh, Unknown DJ, Egyptian Lover and Run-DMC. Then, Spring '84, the extraordinary Midas touch of Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons' Def Jam label (now under contract to CBS) from which sprang a mid-80s stable of true stars, in the Underground--Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J, Slick Rick, the still-unparalleled Eric B. and Rakim--and L.A.'s alternatives: Kool Moe Dee, L.A. Dream Team, and others. And now, at decade's end, an absolute explosion of rap-as-pop, big business, MTV, special fashions, posters, merchandise, with only a few big, new, cutting-edge acts--L.A.'s N.W.A., Philadelphia's Schoolly D, Miami's 2 Live Crew, De La Soul's House-blend of rap/funk/jazz--remaining too esoteric or threatening or downright obscene to cross all the way over and cash in with big labels. By '89 rap is finally proving as ""important"" (read also lucrative) to an anemic shock-and rebellion-music industry as Punk was an exact decade ago. This was all just data. We agreed on it, and on how it was curious that we both had such strange, distant facts down cold.

Our point of departure, essay-wise, was always less what we know than what we felt, listening: less what we liked than why. For this attempt at an outside sampler we plunked down and listened to thousands of hours of rap, trying to summon a kind of objective, critical, purely ""aesthetic"" passion that the music itself made impossible. For outsiders, rap's easy to move to, hard to dissect. The more we listened and thought and drank beers and argued, the more we felt that the stuff's appeal for two highbrow, upscale whites was just plain incongruous. Because serious rap has, right from the start, presented itself as a closed show. Usually critical questions of culture, context, background and audience reduce quickly to vexed questions about prepositions. Not here. No question that serious rap is, and is very self-consciously, music by urban blacks about same to and for same. To mainstream whites it's a tight cohesion that can't but look, from outside the cultural window, like occlusion, clannishness (sic) and inbreeding, a kind of reverse snobbery about what's ""def"" and ""fresh"" and in-the-Scene that eerily recalls the exclusionary codes of college Societies and WASP-only country clubs. Serious rap is a musical movement that seems to revile whites as a group or Establishment, and simply to ignore their possibility as distinct individuals--the Great White Male is rap's Grand Inquisitor, its idiot questioner--its Alien Other no less than Reds were for McCarthy. The music's paranoia, together with its hermetic racial context, helps explain why from the outside it appears to us just as vibrant and impassioned as it does alien and scary.

Other incongruities. Rap is a ""music"" essentially without melody, built instead around a digitally synthesized drum- and back-beat often about as complex as five idle fingers on a waiting-room table, enhanced by ""sampled"" (pirated) ""krush grooves"" (licks or repetitive chord-series) conceived and recorded by pre-rap rock icons, the whole affair characterized by a distinctive, spare, noisy, clattering ""style"" whose obsessive if limited thematics revolve with the speed of low-I amperage around the performative circuit of the MC/rapper and his record-scratching, sound-mixing Sancho Panza, the DJ.

The rapper (the guy in the cameo cut or Kangol hat, pricey warm-up, unlaced Adidas, extra thick gold chain or oversized medallion) offers lyrics that are spoken or bellowed in straight, stressed, rhymed verse, the verse's syntax and meter often tortured for rhythmic gain or the kind of limboing-for-rhyme we tend to associate with doggerel about men from Nantucket. The lyrics, nearly always self-referential, tend to be variations on about half a dozen basic themes, themes that at first listen can seem less alien or shocking than downright dull. Eg: just how bad/cool/fresh/def the rapper and his lyrics are; just how equally un-all-these his music rivals are; how troublesome, vacuous and acquisitive women are; how wonderful it is to be ""paid in full"" for rapping instead of stealing or dealing; how gangs are really families, 'caine's constant bad news. And, in particular, how sex and violence and yuppie toys represent perfectly the urban black lifedrive to late-80s American glory.

The masks are many, too many for anything really but direct aural inspection: rap personae can change frequently even within single albums, the rapper delivering Hard, violent Black Nationalist communique on one cut, dubbing against Trinidadian steel drums on another, basking in big label eclat on a third, cracking a head and then defly outwitting someone muscled and dumb, cooing to his ""bitch"" and then on the flip side, threatening to go get his gun again if she can't learn who's boss. Though any crew naturally wants its own distinctive game and face, the quintessential rap group is unquintessential, chameleonesque. This is either by weird design, or it's a symptom and symbol of 80s facelessness…or most likely, it's just a good old venerable synecdoche of rap's genre itself, one that's now moving so fast it can't quite fix on its own identity -- much less hold still for anything like cool, critical classification or assessment, from outside.

The MC's Alice Toklas-esque DJ hovers ever nearby over his buffet of connected turntables and the black Germanness of a whole lot of digital editing & playback equipment. His responsibility is the song behind and around the rap -- the backbeat, krush groove, and the ""sound carpet,"" i.e. a kind of electric aural environment, a chaos behind the rapper's rhymed order, a digitalized blend of snippets, squeaks, screams, sirens, snatches from pop media, all mixed and splattered so that the listener cannot really listen but only feel the resultant mash of ""samples"" that results. The most recognizable of these samples range from staccato record-scratches to James Brown and Funkadelic licks, to M.L.K.'s public Dream, to quotidian pop pap like ""The Theme from Shaft,"" Brady Bunch dialogue, and '50s detergent commercials.

We have now read every review and essay to do with serious underground hip-hop available in every single on-line periodical ... xcept for one or two underground newsletters (viz. The City Sun, Fresh-Est) circulated in parts of the Bronx demimonde where learning about rap is as hard for white outsiders as scoring fine China White or AKs. From the kind of sedulous bibliomaniacal research to be expected of conscientious lawyers and PhDs, the following has become clear. Outside England, where the Punk-weaned audience has developed a taste for spectacle-through-windows, for vicarious Rage and Protest against circumstances that have exactly 0% to do with them, most of what Rolling Stone calls ""devoted rock consumers"" (meaning we post-baby-boomers), plus almost all established rock critics, tend to regard non-crossover rap as essentially boring and simplistic, or swaggering and bellicose and dangerous--at all events, basically vapid and empty because of its obsessive self-referentiality…in short, as closed to them, to us, as a music. Unrecognizable as what we've been trained and adverted to buy as pop.... Great to dance to, of course, but then what might the white audience for today's mainstream expect? Rap, whether fecund or sterile, is today's pop music's lone cutting edge, the new, the unfamiliar, the brain-resisted-while-body-boogies. And that resisted, alien, exhilarating cutting edge has always been black.

""What have you left me? what have I got?
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homey got jacked
My mother's on crack
My sister can't work cause her arms show tracks
Madness, insanity
Live in profanity
Then some punk claim that they understandin' me?
Give me a break--what world do you live in?
Death is my sex--guess my religion.""**

What makes this stuff so much more disturbing, more real to outsiders than the Punk Rock even those of us who remember it could never quite take seriously? Maybe even a closed music has to have some kind of detente with received custom: I always found it tough to listen straight-faced to a nihilist lecture from someone with a chartreuse mohawk and an earring in his eyelid who punctuates his delivery with vomit and spit. All doctrine and pronouncement, exclusively anti-, this Punk of a decade past afforded even willing mainstream listeners no easement across cultural void, nothing human to grab onto. I have no idea what a Punk performer thinks, feels, is, day-to-day... in fact I always suspected he had no day, but just retreated to his plush coffin at cockcrow. Can you imagine a Punk with four-foot hair and spiked jacket and nose-ring, say, eating a bologna sandwich? Replacing a light bulb? Putting a quarter in a meter? Not me, boy. And even Barnum, who knew fear sells, also knew that freakshows aren't frightening when the freakishness supplants all resemblance. 0% affinity = 0% empathy. And fear requires empathy as much as it does menace or threat.

Public Enemy and N.W.A., Ice T and Schoolly D discomfit us, our friends, the critics we read and cornered, because the Hard rappers' lyrics are conscientious about being of/for the real lives and attitudes of recognizable, if alien, persons. Here's where it's a level up from mere spectacle: ideology in Hard rap is always informed by incident or named condition. This makes rap not only better than Punk, but way scarier. Serious Hard raps afford white listeners genuine, horse's-mouth access to the life-and-death plight and mood of an American community on the genuine edge of im-/explosion, an ugly new sub-nation we've been heretofore conditioned to avoid, remand to the margins, not even see except through certain carefully abstract, attenuating filters.

For outsiders, rap is hard to dissect, easy to move to. The command is: dance, don't understand; participate, don't manipulate. Rap is a fortress protected by the twin moats of talk and technology. The first is that nu style of speak--the ""dialect drug,"" De La Soul calls it--that rappers fashion from jive and disseminate through record stores to all of us. Some in-words, like ""fly,"" meaning ""finelooking,"" have been in coin since the beginning, now venerable as Old English because they turn up on Grandmaster Flash cuts from '82. Others, like ""dead presidents,"" rap for $$, are either coming into or going out of currency, depending on when you read this. Rap, a club language, has myriad ways to describe one's own or others' looks. ""Fly"" is how a man digs a woman. One would never describe oneself as ""fly,"" even when cataloguing one's own attractions (done more in rap than anyplace except perhaps Village Voice personals). ""Fresh"" means irresistibly stylish, oft-modified by ""funky,"" ""crazy,"" or ""stoopid,"" predominantly used to convey the fly-ness of things other than women, including oneself or one's rap, which two concepts rappers, like schizophrenics, can't always keep separate in their heads. ""Dope"" means ""def,"" and ""def"" means crazy funky stoopid fresh. Synonyms include: the shit, the It, the cool, the thang, the word, the grooviest, the categorical imperative, die weltanschung, the that-which-Potter-Stewart-would-know-if-he-saw. A def rapper is so style-defining as to make the stylish mere copycats. To be def is to rap to the beat of a different drum machine--not seeking solitude, but rather confident that others will follow. The def rapper MC's a def rap, which rap def-ly tells of its own (and the rapper's) def-ness--so def, as MC/manager, entrepreneur Russell Rush Simmons brags, that it had to be on a label called Def Jam.

Rap celebrates power, equating strength with style, and style with the ""I"" in ""Individuality."" Rappers ""dis""--dismiss--the styleless, faceless. To ""ill"" is to be weak or wrong; to ""bite"" is to thieve another's dope beat. And only the ill would bite.

Early remastered pop was the first fake music ever, since what the record buyer of '63 experienced as Aural Event on his turntable couldn't happen live. Rock began to become an Illusion of Event which technology made possible; rock became more like the movies, starting down a long road at the end of which was MTV.

Not that this kept Phil Spector up nights. The gurus of the studio had fatter fish to clean, for the new freedom to shape sound had come at a price. With each magnetic jump from live, as tape was made of tapes which were themselves tapes of tapes, the hiss and crackle of interference multiplied. Dual high-bias media with 2 units each of sonic garbage per 10,000 units of Elvis Presley, retaped on similar 2-units-per-10,000 tape, became 4 units of hiss; retaped, 8; then 16; then 32. As the sound got fuller, it decayed.

The solution was a breakthrough called multi-tracking--using recorders that could capture and play back on 2 (as in stereo), 4 (as in '67's then-ear-shattering Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band), 12, 16, and today 24 parallel tracks, eliminating the hiss of transference from one machine to the next. Rhythms, melodies, harmonies could all be captured on separate tracks, allowing the performer or producer to mix and listen and re-mix, adding vocals or lead instrument on yet another track. Rap Edisons like Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa began as party DJs, not musicians. Their wiring of twin turntables to a mixer, allowing them to ""stack"" the sound of two different records while rapping into a mike, was a kind of crude, extemporaneous multitracking. Technological loops like those in the NASA-esque studios of CBS and Polygram were now in the hands of the homeboys. Carter was President. The Bee Gees, with five Top-Ten hits in twelve months, were king.

Digital recording, the science dividing Rjam's Tam-Tam on tape from Tam-Tam as heard ""live"" is a technology that converts music to codes or ""digits."" The codes are ""read"" by a computer, one combining sophisticated sound-to-code translation hardware with a number-crunching COS and a high-response synthesizer, at speeds of 40,000 digits per second and up. The recorded sounds, reduced to numbers, can be shaped, mangled, muffled, amplified, and even canonized.*** Hardware then translates the digits, as read and altered, back into sound, which can itself be recorded on multitrack and combined with yet more sounds. The result: hiss-free reproduction on an infinity of tracks, each of which can itself be manipulated infinitely.

Digital recording, part of the 80s sea-change in how pop gets made, divides the responsibility for the final song more or less equally between the performer, the engineer at the mixing board, the producer who coordinates the multi-tracking and mixing process, and the electronic hardware that actually ""makes"" the music we buy. The latest synthesizers**** produce notes from pure electric current instead of electronically amplified vibrations, with voltage-meters rather than hands or feet determining everything from key to pitch to timbre to ""attack-delay envelope"" (another non-rap term, denoting the microtimed, counterpoised quality of a note's duration, how a note's sound/quaver-structure as it builds is different from its sound and structure as it fades--the manipulation of a piano's foot-pedals, for example, affects the delay component of each note and chord's envelope). The Kurzweil 250, a state-of-the-art system, is a 1-?track/12,018-note synthesizer linked by software to an Apple MacIntosh Plus, which serves as an exhaustive library of digitized sound. The Kurzweil could put all of culture in a blender--take Janet Leigh's Cremora-curdling scream from Psycho, store it in the Mac, program the synth such that an F# will be reproduced as Janet Leigh's F# scream, then play ""We Shall Overcome"" as if screamed by Janet Leigh; store this; treat similarly Bach's St. Matthew's Passion, except with vast choruses of screaming Janet Leighs, then ""Mary Had a Little Lamb,"" then ""Twist and Shout"" (by the Isleys, not the Beatles), all as screams; then replay the four as one horrific jumble, or select amidst the jumble; and then whatever you came up with in the final, painstakingly re-mixed mix you could play backwards. And call that ""finished."" Or never finish. It's like holding music at gunpoint. You can make it do--or do to you --whatever you can think of. Whim is the only limit.

Basically we decided we were into rap because, even media-hype aside, this music had some kind of hard edge to it. Date of composition here is July '89. Think back. This last has been a fiscal year in which Madonna's ""back on top,"" in which covers of classic covers of classic tunes are themselves covered and then climb corporate charts, in which Rod Stewart's out of cryogenics and back on top.... MTV's ceased to be anything but a long commercial for itself and the interests of corporate labels; Bobby McFerrin makes a platinum mint and then several commercial jingles out of a burbled synth-reggae invitation to ""Be Happy,"" a song that has the same verbal-pre-packaging feel as ""Where's the Beef?""

This last year heavy metal's fake-Satanist male models accounted for 1/2 of total U.S. record sales; U2 filmed a $20,000,000 homage to their own self-righteousness and Bono's ever more ill-disguised megalomania. A year when even good old REM finally went corporate-pop with Green, when good old Springsteen trashed his bride, when as modest and nascent a talent as Tracy Chapman earned cymbal-crashing critical raves for her competent, updated frappe of Baez and Armatrading, so desperate were pop critics and consumers for any voice at once comprehensible and even remotely fresh. Just not a notable pop year at all. Except in rap. Rap appears in the famished late 80s as potentially a genuine musical Scene the way early jazz, rock, the Summer of Love, folk/protest, god even the way New Wave and Punk were ""Scenes""--the S-word here simultaneously meaning: something new to look at; something loud and upsetting (""Oh please, Veronica, let's not have a Scene!""); and, best, an identifiable set of places in time where large forces meet, marry and beget. Whether by virtue or default, rap is pretty much what there is to like right now, if you want to regard today's pop as anything more than covert jingles in 4/4-time. In our opinion.

But so the point is we enjoy it. Plus we've developed some theses about why serious rap is important, both as art-for-own-sake and as a kind of metaphor-with-larynx for a subbed-culture unique in its distillation of the energy and horror of the American present.

Rap is expanding gas-like through the 80s' dry time, growing from house party schtick, gang anthem, a small-label fad with the sort of pop lifespan you measure with eggtimers--then somehow, when we weren't looking, into Scene, movement, On The Air--finally, in the last 24 months, assuming the fecund role of genuine Genre. Exploding into subspecies now faster than you can track. There's now Dub's mix of rap and reggae, House's mix of rap and 70s-, huge-afro'd funk, Acid House's psychedelic hip-hop. There is black rap for white mass-consumption (Tone Loc, Run?DMC), black rap for local set and -house consumption (countless local stars and wanna-be's in every large city), ultra-black rap superstars for the whole marginal Nation inside (Heavy D, Public Enemy, Big Daddy Kane), white rap for white masses (the execrable Beastie Boys). There is Hispanic, Salsa-influenced rap out of different West Coast barrios, rap fused with West Indian or Islamic traditional music in Digital Underground, Eric B. and Rakim, and others, or fused with oh-so-danceable R&B in the new ""jack swing"" offshoot (Bobby Brown, MC Hammer); even gay and bohemian young urban Bs have their trendsetters in Teddy Riley and Guy, De La Soul, Kwabe. Etc. etc.***** A major impediment to sampling this Scene is the kaleidoscopic fury with which the Scene itself is changing. If you're reading this in print it's already dated.

And the rap world's vitality is one of replacement as well as variety, allowing the genre to remain fresh, as band after band is seduced into the ""real"" music biz. This Scene is hydra-like. Almost the moment a rap artist like Run-DMC or L. L. Cool J ""breaks through"" into major-market mix appeal, MTV's land of corporate bankability, certain reactions within the urban underground that spawned them can almost always be observed. The breakthrough band's B-boys themselves are without qualms about the pop bigtime: after all, they've been rapping all along about their entitlement to money and status, about the inevitable rewards of their freshness and unbiteable voice. Their postbreakthrough raps tend all often to become celebrations of their new wealth and fame, of the now-enhanced authority of their ""Message""--though it's hard to feature Public Enemy rapping about a Black-Militant renaissance, about revolution and American apocalypse, while lily-white CBS Records pays them millions for the distribution rights to just such exhortations to cut corporate throats.

Nevertheless, back in the underground Scene, the breakthrough band's tight set of original fans tends to hang loyal, to await feverishly ""their"" crew's spots on the same music TV they love to dis. In short, there are comparatively few of the accusations of selling out that accompanied a similarly oxymoronic coopting phenomenon in late-60s protest rock. Which if you think about it, is passing strange. The white mainstream Other against which serious rap aligns and defines itself makes the 60s ""Establishment"" too look downright benign.

Our opinion, then, from a distance: not only is a serious rap serious poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the Great 80s Market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we've been encouraged sadly to write off,6 it's quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today. ""Real"" (viz. academic) U.S. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocab, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred and (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn't get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers, doesn't get to move or inform more than a fraction of that readership (most of the moved being poets themselves), doesn't generate revenue for much of anyone save the universities to whom the best PhD-poets rent their names and time ... and especially does not inspire a whole culture's youth to try to follow in their Connecticut-catalogue brogans' prints. Because of rap's meteoric rise, though, you've got poor kids, tough kids, ""underachievers,"" a ""lost generation""... more young people--ostensibly forever turned off ""language"" by TV, video games and low U.S.D.E. budgets--more of these kids hunched over notebooks on their own time, trying to put words together in striking and creative ways, than the U.S.A. has probably ever had at one time. That few of these will become ""stars"" matters far less than the grim stats about, say, the tiny percentage of playground basketball phenoms who actually ride sports out and up from subclass status: the same verbal skills and enthusiasms rap values (and values enough to let rap-dissing stand symbolically for fighting or killing) can obviously be applied in mainstream-approved, ""productive"" ways--G.E.D.'s college, Standard Written English ...perhaps someday even ad-copywriting!

But is this wildfire of urban rap ambition raging around converted four-car garages like North Dorchester's RJam's in spite of the genre's near-disciplinary prosodic restrictions, or because of them? Can't really tell. Probably doesn't matter. The fact remains that, were ""important poetry"" presently defined in terms of what makes important art important in a Supply-Side democracy (popularity, effect, the separation of fan from his cash), staid journals like Poetry and American Poetry Review would be featuring some number of fade-cut, multiple-earring'd authors' photos in each issue; and highbrow public readings would always carry their back row fraction of bangers ready to ""listen rude"" to Wilbur and Levertov and Ashbery, just as e.g Rimbaud and Pound did to their own contemporaries ... to the delight and invigoration of a time's poetry...

... And even just the prospected fantasy of seeing Public Enemy's be-clocked Flavor Fav and like a Jorie Graham or Amy Clampitt sitting down over beer and Celestial Seasonings to hash out the debate over line-breaks in dactylic pentameter, a very serious young homeboy in Italian silk and pentagonal shades serving as interpreter is enough to make us hereby officially lobby for the admission of rhyme's renaissance--at least under the stringent rhythmic demands rap has forced on rhyme-as-form--to the cold corridors of Serious Appreciation.

Unlike the mostly docile poetry and fiction of the late 80s, though, rap's own quality, the def freshness of the MC's bit, is set up to be judged primarily in the context of what it is against. In case you thought we forgot, rap is first of all a movement in rock music, and thus the time-honored requirement is that the rap Scene set itself very consciously athwart those circumstances and forces whose enormity is required by all rock 'n roll to justify one of its essential roles, rebellion-against. Except now watch the objects of the rebellion alter, spread, grow in urgency--from the 50s' parents and principals, homework, hot rods, the sweet hurt of teen love, to the urban 80s, police, violent death, homelessness, the lure of ecstatic drugs that dehumanize weaponry, fatherlessness, the animal emptiness of sex w/o love, the almost Trilaterally sinister White Establishment (""THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBLE THE GOVERNMENT'S. . . ""), Everyone Else: life as a series of interruptions from an angry slumber about what the electric voices say you must have and the human voices say you may not, about the betrayal of the past, of the promises exacted by Carmichael, X, and the now-formal martyrdom of King.

Segregation may affect their hearts and minds, Earl Warren warned, as Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan, both alumni of Boston's old separate-but-awful schools, bear loud witness. Now, 40 years after X disgustedly quit a racist high school and began a career as a kind of be-bop gang-banger, 35 years after Brown v. Board of Education invented integration, 15 years after Morgan v. Hennigan brought Brown to Boston, North Dorchester is worse and its schools aren't better. A former United States Secretary of Education converts to Drug Czar, symbolizing a national change of mind: now drugs, not poor schools (and certainly not the American apartheid of which segregated schools were but one facet), is our root ""innercity"" problem. Tam-Tam's Boston is strangely less hopeful than the notoriously segregated pre-Hennigan city, perhaps because before Hennigan reformers could promise that segregation was why things were so bad. Segregation was blame's bullseye: abolish the bullseye, and blame for the estrangement of the races flies everywhere, hitting the cops, or the courts, or the teachers, or the taught, or what's taught. There's even a rap--B.D.P.'s ""Why is That?""--blaming our miseries on the failure of the schools to ""teach black kids to be black.""

But everything the white rock listener pays to enjoy is black-begotten. If today's Top?40 environment seems bleak or befouled, imagine the present mainstream without its sweetest sourcewaters, without the King-Waters-King Blues trinity, the Brownian soul, the backbeat, cut time, blue notes, funky French curves of sax and brass, the guitar solo, call-and-response, the Cold Medina or Lucky Powder, those lithely syncopated quintets in pomade and linen suits, the single hand in the white glove holding Pepsi aloft in the shadow of accidental flames.... Black music is American pop's breath and bread; and we, as both born audience and born salesmen, know it.

So maybe it's them. Them. Maybe we're approaching an enforced fork in the musical road where the white-run entertainment industry will have to pack up what it's taken and go seek its fortune on the backs of new minorities. Maybe, in serious rap, the extreme new insulation of the black sound is not only intentional but preplanned, part of a neo-Nationalist agenda, the hermetic new Scene's tight circle more like something large and coiled than something small and flat.

You may now be getting some hazy idea of the sorts of really quite scary possibilities with which the rap we like is replete. And, hazier, of how complicated this stuff of sampler-from-outside can be. What's remained passing strange, for use, is the vague threat's appeal. The unease and ambivalence with which the rare white at the window loves rap renders that love no less love. Whence the fear, though, is really no matter. For look at the world, at the masses we're part of. At what you look at closest. The plain 80s data is that, whereas love, devotion, passion seem only to divide, it's fear and strangeness that bind crowds, fill halls, unite Us, somehow, as audience, under the great tent.

*'Hip-hop' is an older synonym, coined by Rap pioneer, Kool Herc, to describe the heavily danceable Jamaican scatting he introduced between records at the huge South Bronx block parties he and other new-Scene celebrities, like Jazzy Five and former Black Spades leader, Afrika Bambaataa, could turn into late-70s frenzies of Breakdance (both music and dance a self-conscious reaction against the glittered unreality of downtown Disco).

**** ... themselves the heirs of a long, 20th-century evolutionary process, from the playe-?piano to the 20s Oncles Martenot and Theremin and Trautonium (crude electronic instruments big in France), to Pierre Schaeffer's musique concrete in '48, to the first Electronic Music Synthesizer invented by engineers at RCA in the 50s to the inauguration of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in '59, to Robert Moog's '64 development of the Moog 55, the first emitter of amplified ""blurps, fwipps, simps, twings, and schlonks"" to be commercially produceable. Walter/Wendy Carlos used a Moog 55 for his/her '68 Switched-On Bach, an album that did more than anything to popularize synthesized sound.

***** Note how the ecstatic force's movement extends beyond sound into dance-Chicago-based house-dancing is very different from Coast-based rap-dancing, while both are distinct from the Quaalude sway a De La Soul's lazy complexity invites--and beyond dance into urban haute couture itself. The ""cameo"" or ""fade,"" that troubling cyberpunk flat-top haircut favored by Carl Lewis and Grace Jones but popularized by the group Cameo's rapping Larry Blackmon, has now become less a haircut than a sculptural statement: words, logos, slogans and complex signs razored into the rigid anvil of hair that is, according to the Voice, ""the most culturally conscious unisex hairstyle since the afro."" The standard 80s-rap uniform--sideways baseball cap or Kangol, ropey chains, acetate warmup and unlaced hightops--""...now symbolizes a cruder, more casual era,"" and is diffracting into a rap-House-gay-jackswing look replete with polka-dot ties, loose pleated twills, and expensive dance-loafers or British ""moon boots,"" a combination Ricky Ricardo-Frank Sinatra dapper that now befits a Scene with the dignity, silliness and pull of real Genre. Plus don't forget that just one big change in street and school fashions means millions and millions in garment revenue--even more $$ once the white mainstream, as is its won't, follows in the cutting edge's media-delayed wake.

273,Hero,"[Verse 1]
There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There’s an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

[Chorus]
And then a hero comes along

That a hero lies in you

No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong

That a hero lies in you

Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone

And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin' real facts

Well I woke up this morning with the feeling of rejection
Called your name and you gave me no attention
You didn't care how I feel inside
But like a fool I've been when I swallowed my pride
But you just don't care
You turn away and you act like I'm not there
Into my loneliness I fade away
I only got one thing to say

I love to turn you on
I love to turn you on
I love to turn you on
Come on so I can give you some more
I love to turn you on
I wanted you for oh so long

It's such a mystery the things that you do to me
I don't know whether to laugh or to cry
Sometimes I feel so free
But then when you're with me
The pressure makes me feel like I'm gonna die
You drive me crazy and don't give me time to think
And then you say that you're runnin' away
Till I find out the truth for me and you
I just got one thing to say

I love to turn you on
You know I turn you on
I love to turn you on
With a kiss from my lips I turn your body on

You make pretty daisies, pretty daisies love
I’ve gotta find, find, find what you’re doing about things here
A few witches burning, gets a little toasty here
I gotta find, find, find
Why you always go when the wind blows

God sometimes you just don’t come through, babe
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God sometimes you just don’t come through

Come down and tell me what you mean, now
You got your 9, 9 iron in the back seat just in case
Huh, whatcha doing?

Sometimes I try and sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do
What I don't wanna do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die -you choose

I'm serious when I tell you, love
That a little heartbreak
Is ten to a dime
Don't be afraid (are you with me, baby?)
Just turn the page my love
I'm curious when the day will come
I see my reflections in your eyes
Take your time and I'll be there

[Chorus]

[Spoken Word: K.T.]
Looking through my eyes at the world
Can't you see
Every time I see your face
There's a choice to be made
Walking hand in hand
Through the sands of time
As I peer in the past
Foreign steps are terrorizing
Watching what is now
There's a fork in the path
Of the future of your life
Which road shall you choose
Choices to be made
Past and present
It's not easy
But my love will me die
Until your heart resurrects me

286,I'm Outstanding,"[Verse 1]
I was born three-six-seventy-two, I think it's on a Wednesday
Hail to the moon, just like Kunta Kinte
That means I'm gifted from the get-go, Mom's you never let go
Mad thanks for raising me right, bro
You gave me confidence to stop the nonsense
Didn't live in Bel Air like the Fresh Prince
Times are hard, times are rough
Didn't have Toys 'R' Us toys, but I had enough love
Plus the guidance from above
To go to the park, sweatin', push and shove
Maybe then for a dunk like you told me
Then there were a few times when Dad had to scold me
Prayed for my safety, I know how you was feeling
Didn't want me wheeling and get to drug-dealing
Remember when you asked me this one day
Who I wanna be like, I said Dr. J
Then you said, ""Good, now you gotta go
Take the damn ball and slam it through the hole""
Mom cracked a smile, Daddy gave a frown
I said to myself, ""I can't let them down""
So make way, I'm coming in for a landing
And nothing's gonna' stop me, from being outstanding

[Interlude]
I'm outstanding

[Verse 2]
Now let's skip to the time when I was fifteen
Shaq is in the house, no, Shaq is on the scene
Now my name's in papers, girls caught the vapors
Kids look up to me like a skyscraper
Now, a role model, I mean a role figure
Then I ask myself, can I get any bigger?
My dream is coming true, but coming true slowly
Then I remember what Mom and Dad told me
""Remember this, son, you are the one
Shoot your gift like a gun and never forget where you come from
You're young, gifted, and Black
If they can't say Shaquille O'Neal then make 'em scream, Shaq!'""
Like the fam do, in the stands too
When I freak the funk on a dunk they, ""Ah! Ooh!""
From high school to college, they gave me enough knowledge
Make that gift and now it's time for me to fulfill my dream
To be in the [leaders' game?] like Hakeem
I'll make the backboards shatter
Fans chit-chatter
Even make the other centers get madder
That's me, who can it be?
The master of disaster, seven foot three
Brother, ain't no other in the nation
I'm born from my mother but I'm God's creation
I'm outstanding

[Interlude]
I'm outstanding

[Verse 3]
Cause now I'm outstanding
Wave your hands and pump your fist
When I'm on the court you know it's strictly, ""Swish!""
Cause there's some things that I gotta do:
Tape up the ankle, pump up my Shaq shoe
And now it's time to take care of business
To run up and down the court with Nick and Dennis
Scott, but I won't stop
Gotta keep striving until I reach the top
Gonna take a peek over the mountain
I flow like a fountain
Peace, I gotta go! And I'm out and…
But before I go, wave your hands
Peace to all my family, friends and fam
I'm outstanding

""NEVER OUT OF THE FIGHT""
-Navy SEAL Creed
1 EXT. BAGRAM AIR BASE, AFGHANISTAN 1 Through massive sun flare, a BLACKHAWK Chopper coming in
fast. Landing hard on Bagram Air Base.
LUTTRELL (vo)
It’s something most of us have known all of our lives. What we all wanted. It’s in our blood.
A team of medical personal and Navy officers descend on the chopper. An assortment of high-ranking GENERALS and COMMANDING OFFICERS there to meet the chopper. Tight shots. A bloody hand dangles. A tear filled eyeball, sliced feet.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) (vo)
There’s a storm inside of us. I’ve heard many team guys speak of this. A burning. A river. A drive.
2 INT. OPERATING ROOM 2
Clothes cut. Blood soaked Dog Tags cut. “Luttrell” in UA boxer shorts, IVs and fresh blood bags. Multiple Gunshots. Chunk of an ear missing. Heartbeat monitor. Weak pulse.
LUTTRELL (vo)
An unrelenting desire to push yourself harder and further than anyone could think possible.
Chunks of bullet and shrapnel filling metal bowl. Tears streaming down cheeks, a hand scrawled map on a left thigh, focused eyes of surgeons. Admirals’ pace in the hallway.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) (vo)
Pushing ourselves into those dark cold corners where the bad things live. Where the bad things fight.
Heart monitor weak. Getting weaker. Compound fracture left shin. Bloody feet rinsed clean. Water flushing out bullet holes. Loose cracked tooth pulled out. Heart monitor getting weaker.
Surgical pack working franticly to save Luttrell. Tight on HEART MONITOR: FLATLINE
LUTTRELL CONT’D
We wanted that fight at the highest
volume. The loud fight. The loudest, coldest, hottest, most unpleasant of the unpleasant fights.
Pushing in on the flatline. Alarm screaming. Tight on Luttrell’s eyes starting to glaze over. Dying.

7 EXT. AFGHAN VILLAGE - DAY 7 INTERCUT AFGHAN VILLAGE. Intro Afghan warlord. AHMAD SHAH.
35 years old. Tall, strong. Fierce. He moves through an Afghan village with a small pack of equally fierce Taliban warriors.
3A.
￼
LOCAL AFGHANS avoid eye contact. This Shah and crew feels like an old school western bad guy moving through a cow town.
NOTHING like the SUICIDE BOMBERS of BAGDAD. These are real warriors. Strong-jawed. Thin but ripped muscles. Worn rich soulful faces, vivid eyes, color reds and blues. Strong boots. Military vests. Good radio equipment. Well-maintained weapons.
Shah’s number two is TARAQ. Late twenties. Shah is vicious, TARAQ, is more vicious. Strong and very, very violent.
A very worthy opponent.
RIGHT now they are clearly pissed. Shah leads the way, walks with purpose.
They are looking for a man. Someone has violated TALIBAN LAW, accused of aiding the Americans.
Shah moves into a house. Women and children terrified. Trembling. Women pleading.
Where is he?
SHAH SHAH Hagha Cherta Dey?
The women scream. As Shah starts throwing teenage boys around the room. Slamming them viciously into walls.
A 25-year-old man Gulab tries to reason with Shah. A YOUNG BOY watches.
GULAB GULAB
Please, we want no trouble. Mehrabani/lutfan, monga hes
mushkil no ghowaro
Taraq throws Gulab down hard. Turns, locks eyes with an older Afghan man(30s). Taraq moves quickly at him, kicking him in the face, his foot down hard on his throat.
SHAH
Have you spoken with the
Americans?
AFGHAN MAN Please! No!
SHAH
Aya taso Americayano sara khaberi keri dey?
AFGHAN MAN
Mehrabani/lutfan! Na!
Gulab watches. Frustrated. Furious.
You lie! Please!
TARAQ
AFGHAN MAN
TARAQ
Ta Dorogh wayee!
AFGHAN MAN
Mehrabani/lutfan!

He’s pressing down hard. Choking the man. The man’s family begs and screams. Shah studies the Afghan deep into his eyes. Decides he’s lying...Shah nods to Taraq.
Taraq yanks the Afghan to his feet. As his children watch Taraq leads the pleading farmer outside. Into the woods.
Taraq and his men throw the Afghan down over a fallen log. Face up.
Two of Taraq’s men hold him by the beard as Taraq stands over him. Razor sharp machete up.
Shah backlit. Ignoring the man’s pleading...as Taraq hacks down with brutal fury.
Tight on Shah, tight on Taraq, blood dripping from his hand. BLACK

MIKE MURPHY
Rooms a mess. Clothes and gear everywhere. Grenades on a desk next to a copy of GATES OF FIRE. New York Rangers flag next to a SEAL Flag, 8 x 10 head shot of Ron Burgundy.
Tight on Murphy. His eyes slowly open. Hold a moment. Murphy checks watch. 0500. Slow and smooth Murphy rises. Body strong. Not ripped. Effortless power.
Murphy goes to his computer. Opens it and checks his mail. Tight on Murphy’s inbox.
A picture of an Arabian Horse. Murphy studies the picture.
9A MOVING DOWN HALLWAY 9A Murphy now in shorts and a Navy T-shirt. Holding his laptop,
eating a banana. Stops by Luttrell’s door. Opens it. Luttrell sleeps, Murphy sits on his bed. Nudges Luttrell.

horse?

LUTTRELL
Oprah rides Arabic horses?

Why? How much do they cost?

Luttrell hits the stop watch.
Murphy and Dietz leap to bars, 75 Pull-ups as fast as possible. Brief pauses to recover. 100 push ups. Dietz slightly ahead of Murphy. Sprints out of the gym. Murphy close behind.
The two men charge up and over the gate. Body Armor on.
13 EXT. BAGRAM - MONTAGE - MORNING 13 Murphy and Dietz running hard racing each other on a two mile

AXE Who won?
LUTTRELL Murphy. Barely.
AXE Head shave?
Dietz looks pained.
MURPHY
Man...I got to think this one out.
If I shave his head, I’m going to have to look at him. Really look at him. Ears, face, funny shaped head...I don’t know. Marcus? What do you think?
LUTTRELL
I don’t know boss...I don’t want to
be looking at him that close either, but he has been running his mouth about beating you...a lot. Head shave is fair.
Axe?
MURPHY
11.
AXE
Hell yea, I say shave him, and he
can’t eat with us, make him eat with E3 Marines until it grows back. Shave the boy.
MURPHY Shane?
SHANE PATTON
Well, I could go both ways on this.
He did lose but, he was close and you’re Mike Murphy and I would have expected a much bigger separation. Plus, we’re at war and there’s the whole Samson thing, so I’m not sure. I’ll plead the fifth on this one.
Murphy looks stares at Shane.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) But you’re the boss, boss. So I’m
with you. I’ll shave his head, wax his balls if you give me the order. Sir, I’ll wax my own balls if you take me on Red Wings.
Murphy shakes his head at Patton, looks over to Dietz.

Marines last Tuesday in Kandahar. We just pulled this video off three different Tali web sights. It will in fact be a glorious day when Ahmad Shah and his good friend Taraq are no longer members of our human community.
Clear video of Shah executing a Taliban woman. Two men hold her down. Shah fires an AK-47. The bullet kicking up dust as it blasts through her skull into the dirt.
The SEALs study this footage. Dead serious.
AXE
Go back...freeze.
Axe studies an image of Shah.
AXE (CONT’D) No earlobes.
MURPHY What’s that?
AXE
The guys got no earlobes.
Silence as the team studies the image.
SHANE
earlobes for anyway?
DIETZ
and balance.
SHANE
DIETZ
I heard earlobes are key for head
balance - equilibrium. Cut a guys ear off, he’s gonna suck on a drunk test, balance beam, tight rope...
LUTTRELL
False. Earlobes have no biological
functions for humans. Fish can use earlobes like a valve to open or close the ear canal.
What are Piercing Balance.
14.
SHANE
Why would a fish want to let water
into his ear canal?
Luttrell shoots him a look - “shut the fuck up”
14A.
Murphy keeps things moving.
MURPHY
Bad guy. Senior Taliban commander
responsible for killing Marines in Eastern Afghanistan and sport killing civilians in the Hindu- Kush. Considered Tier One target rumored to be close to Bin Laden. Axe is going to go over our route in.
AXE
The helo pilots are going to do two
false inserts. Then drop us off at our primary insert, located here. Secondary insert located here. From our primary insert, our bearing will be zero three zero patrolling 1.5 kilometers to our designated lay up point. We will be moving up the backside of this mountain which will offer us good concealment from the target but the terrain is gonna be rocky so watch your footing. I’m estimating it’s gonna take us about two hours to complete.
MURPHY Luttrell - medical
LUTTRELL
First things first, win the fight.
There’s no medicine in a gunfight. It’s self aid, buddy aid, corpsman aide. Two weeks ago, Team 3 was near where you guys will be. Capelli got bit by a rattlesnake. and contrary to popular belief, there is poison oak, so watch the cock and balls cause that will suck. Drink lots of water, wear sunscreen, and Dietz bring your own chapstick.
Dietz stands up, starts talking comms
DIETZ
Crypto will be wide band, segment 2-
4. Murph’s got a SAT phone. Region is very steep so expect typical comms problems. We’ll be on two hour comms windows.
(MORE)
15.
DIETZ (CONT'D)
If we miss two windows I’d say wake somebody up. Other than that, don’t
sweat it.
Murphy picks up a plastic AC-130 and holds it over the map.
MURPHY AC-130 is with us?
15A.
Dietz takes the plane from Murphy. Moves it over the map.
DIETZ
Correct. Just for the infil. All
comms will be relayed through the AC-130, call sign Apollo. Suns up, she’s out. Some of the key pro- words - when we have a successful insert, Budweiser. When we’re halfway through infil, it’ll be Corona. At our observation point, Schlitz Malt Liquor. And if we positively identify Shah: touchdown.
Danny chucks the toy plane.
MURPHY
Reaction Force is the following:
The 47’s will relocate to J-Bad overnight.
Murphy uses toy plastic helicopters to explain the size and location of the QRF.
KRISTENSEN
That’s correct. You’ll have fifteen
team guys, and about a dozen Marines standing by all night. When we hear Schlitz Malt Liquor, we’re heading back to Bagram for phase 2. QRF will stay here - we’re leaving you with 4 team guys, 20 marines, 2 Blackhawks and 2 Apaches. The Apaches stay with the Blackhawks.
The toy Choppers circle on the map giving us a clear understanding of the playing field.
KRISTENSEN (CONT’D) The movement is so we can get the
47’s back here and be ready to bring it for phase two once you get eyes on Shah. Remember - comms will most likely be intermittent and there are reports that non- combatants are being used as recon elements for the enemy.
MURPHY Roger that.
Luttrell spits chew. Danny doodles furious, mashing demons. Axe quietly studies the picture of Ahmad Shah.
16.
JAG GOES OVER RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
AXE Lotta moving parts.
MURPHY
What we do, when we do, what we do.
KRISTENSEN
We go in four hours. I’m pulling up
tomorrow’s new guy presentation to 1800 tonight so that all may revel and partake.
SHANE PATTON Are you serious?
KRISTENSEN
Yes. Glorious evening gentlemen.

17 EXT. OULLETTE SEAL COMPOUND - CAMO CANOPY 17 LAST SUPPER.
Murphy, Luttrell, Axe and Dietz. Eating. Having a fly catch and kill competition.
DIETZ looks stressed.
He’s got a paint tile sample page on the table in front of him. Studying paint samples.
DIETZ
We were gonna wait but she’s all
into it and when she gets her head into something, that’s it. There’s no stopping her.
17.
MURPHY
So just let her do it. It’s good
for her. You got a handy man woman. That’s good.
17A.
MURPHY kills a fly. Places the dead fly by his coffee cup next to three other dead flies.
DIETZ I don’t know.
MURPHY Don’t know what?
DIETZ I don’t know.
What?
MURPHY
AXE
He’s worried that he’s losing
control over his castle.
MURPHY Really.
AXE Ask him.
MURPHY
Are you worried that you’re losing
control over your castle?
DIETZ Shut up Murph.
MURPHY Are you?
LUTTRELL
He’s having control issues cause
he’s the one whose always made the “taste” issues in the family.
DIETZ
She’s got great taste. I trust her.
MURPHY
So what’s the problem?
DIETZ
It’s not a problem. It’s just very
ongoing. Know what I mean?
Luttrell kills a fly. He’s got six dead ones. He and Murphy are competing.
18.
MURPHY
Not really. No. Marcus, you know
what he means? LUTTRELL
Control issues.
MURPHY Is that right?
DIETZ LUTTRELL DIETZ
No.
Yes.
It’s not control issues.
MURPHY What is it?
DIETZ
New grass leads to new bushes by
the window, leads to new windows, leads to new curtains, leads to new sofa, leads to new rug, leads to new floor...
MURPHY Got it.
LUTTRELL
Loss of control. Got to let that
go bro.
DIETZ
It’s like this weird journey that
she’s on. Moving through the house one room to the next.
AXE Where is she now?
DIETZ Kitchen. I think.
Murphy and Luttrell both kill flies at the same time. Marines with Buzz cuts in crisp uniform eating all around the SEALs. Stark contrast.
19.
CUT TO:
18 INT. SEAL TV ROOM 18
Tight on Shane Patton. Doing his best Napoleon Dynamite dance. He is not good. SEALs in lounge chairs. They watch, laugh and taunt. Music loud. Shane powers through. Finishes strong.
Whistles and clapping from the SEALs. AXE stands up. Puts an arm around Patton.
HEALY God was that awful
AXE
Ok, here’s the deal. That sucked,
but I’m voting that we move him forward cause I can’t watch this shit without puking anymore so I say lest be done with it. All in favor?
Luttrell and all SEALs put their hands up, except Murphy.
AXE (CONT’D) Come on Mikey.
MURPHY Can he say it?
Other SEALs agree. Shouting out. Debating whether Shane can “say it”. Making bets.
AXE knows what Murphy is thinking. Pauses. Looks at Shane.
AXE (quiet to Shane)
Can you say it?
SHANE PATTON I think so.
AXE Think so?
SHANE PATTON I can say it.
20.
AXE
Ok. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. He
can say it. Shut up.
The room silences. Patton, nervous, takes a deep breath.
SHANE PATTON (weak, then strong)
I’ve been around the world twice, talked to everyone once. I’ve seen two whales fuck, been to three world fairs, and I even know a man in Thailand with a wooden cock. I’ve pushed more peter, more sweeter, and more completer than any other peter-pusher around.
Tight on the SEALs smiling, some mouthing the words along with Shane.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D)
I am a hard-bodied, hairy-chested,
rootin, tootin, shootin, parachutin, demolition double cap crimping Frogman.
19 INT. CAMP OUELLETTE SEAL COMPOUND - READY ROOM 19 The entire SEAL TEAM jocks up. Gets ready.
SHANE PATTON (vo)
There ain’t nothing I can’t do. No sky too high, no sea too rough, no Muff too tough. I’ve learned a lot of lessons in my life. Never shoot a large caliber man with a small caliber bullet.
FLASH BURST IMAGES of all relevant equip, men being prepped. M4s, night vision goggles, hand guns, knives, scopes checked. Under Armor, PowerBars, water bottles, grenades, extra ammo, radio’s prepped, extra batteries, Laptops.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) (vo)
I drive all kinds of trucks. 2x’s, 4x’s, 6x’s even those big mother fuckers that bend and go TSSHITT TSSHITT when you step on the brakes.

SHANE PATTON (CONT’D)
Anything in life worth doing is worth overdoing. Moderation is for cowards.
DIETZ checking his radio equipment.
AXE going over his infil map.
LUTTRELL double checking all medical supplies.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) (vo)
I’m a lover, I’m a fighter, I’m a UDT/SEAL Diver. I’ll wine, dine, intertwine and then sneak out the back door when the refueling is done.
MURPHY watching all of it.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) If your feeling froggy than you
better jump because this Frogman has been there, done that and is going back for more.
20 EXT. CHOPPER PAD BAGRAM 20
Sun setting over the Afghan desert. Thirty SEALs laying on the deck on their gear. Chilling out waiting for the 47’s. The guys laying around. Danny studies a piece of paper with color tile samples printed on it.
MURPHY
Seems to me like you’ve got to
straighten this shit out. DANNY
There’s nothing to straighten out.
AXE
If there’s nothing to straighten,
why are you fighting?
DANNY We’re not fighting?
AXE
Well, what is it that you’re doing?
DANNY
We’re more like disagreeing.
22.
AXE Disagreeing or arguing?
DANNY
Probably more like mildly arguing.
Just because you’re Mr. Perfect marriage, don’t be judging us mortal marriages who occasionally have mild disagreements, sometimes even loving arguments.
MURPHY
It’s a fucking stupid loving
argument.
DANNY
It’s not an argument.
LUTTRELL
It is an argument. Sounded like a couple of bighorn rams smashing skulls.
DANNY
What the fuck is everyone listening
to my shit for?
LUTTRELL Bro, you’re loud.
DANNY
You’re louder than I am.
LUTTRELL
Just pick some tile and move the
fuck on.
DANNY
I picked the tile. She doesn’t like
it.
LUTTRELL
What does she fucking like?
DANNY (reading from paper)
“Rose Honey Dew”
LUTTRELL Say what bro?
DANNY
She likes rose honey
dew...something.
23.
LUTTRELL
Are you fucking kidding me?
DANNY That’s what she likes.
LUTTRELL
You gotta control that situation.
AXE
Rose tiles in the kitchen?
DANNY
Can we talk about something else?
AXE
Yea let’s talk about what she’s
gonna tile your bathroom in. DANNY
I don’t wanna talk about that.
MURPHY
(Ron Burgandy impersonation)
Danny? I’m gonna put it out there, if you like it, you can take it, if you don’t, send it right back.
Dietz stares at Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT’D) I wanna be on you.
LUTTRELL I wanna be on you.
MURPHY (pointing at Dietz)
On you.
Dietz smiles. Axe huge smile.
Chopper engines grow louder. 47’s back lit, coming in.

Murphy is the first to have binoculars up and is looking down hill, way down hill at the Afghan village. 2,000 ft., very steep, cliff like. Below them.
DANNY’S POV:
100 stone and wood homes, well-constructed. Looks almost charming. A couple of dozen Afghan villagers in different parts of the village, kids playing, women cooking, two men working on a roof. Looks quite peaceful.
Left: trying to see the rest of the village. Can’t get a good view, a mountain is blocking his view.
Danny has the radio out and is calling in the arrival pro- word.
DANNY (on radio)

DANNY
Beastmaster, this is Spartan 01. I
pass Schlitz Malt liquor. How copy?
Really weak signal.
HASSLERT
Spartan 01 this is Beastmaster.
Say again your last - you are weak and unreadable.
DANNY
Beastmaster, this is Spartan 01. I
pass Schlitz Malt Liquor, how copy.
HASSLERT
Spartan 01, this is Beastmaster.
Good copy. Hasslert looks to Kristensen.
HASSLERT (CONT’D) Sketchy comms, sir. Spartan 01 has
arrived.
Erik Kristensen sitting. Nods. Gets up. Checks the wall clock: 6:45 AM

Axelson and Luttrell together, spotting scopes out, they study the village.
LUTTRELL
Can’t see half the village.
MURPHY
Yea.
They study the surrounding area.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Let’s move down towards that peak,
see if that’s not better.
LUTTRELL Sounds good.
Luttrell looks back at Axe and Dietz. He soft whistles and rolls his index finger, points down towards the peak below them.
Axe and Danny immediately get it. They start moving out.
30 INT. J-BAD TOC 30 PETE MUSSLEMEN, one of the four SEALs left as part of the QRF

MURPHY We’re good.
Danny, on radio, trying to call in that they’ve relocated. Can’t get through.
DANNY (to Murphy)
No joy.
MURPHY Keep trying.
As the team sets up, Dietz is looking up at the small mountain behind him that seems to be killing his radio.
Series of shots:
Murphy and Luttrell scopes up, start counting Taliban. At forty, Luttrell looks to Murphy.
LUTTRELL That’s more than 10.
Yes.
MURPHY
Murphy is focused on a group of four men off to the side of the village playing a game with stones. Seeing who can throw the farthest.

Kristensen says I should get her whatever Silver was.
Silver?
LUTTRELL
MURPHY
Hi-Ho Silver. Lone Ranger’s horse.
LUTTRELL
Yea that’s a badass horse.
MURPHY
She doesn’t want a badass horse.
She wants an Arabic horse.
LUTTRELL
Dude, how’s she going to know the
difference. Get her a Quarter Horse, tell her it’s an Arabic. If she busts you, tell her if it’s good enough for the Lone Ranger...
MURPHY
How much for an Arabic?
LUTTRELL Probably around 15 grand.
MURPHY
Fuck.
Hell of a wedding present.
LUTTRELL MURPHY LUTTRELL

Danny on watch. Wedged into a tree stump.
ON DANNY.
Tired but awake. Alert. Quietly singing to himself.
TIGHT ON DANNY. His eyes a micro shift of focus. He stills himself ever so slightly.
DANNY’s POV
He’s looking down hill. Wide gentle slope of the mountain leading to a sharper drop. The fire lights up the village far below.
Nothing moves.
BACK to Danny. Eyes more focused. He slowly reaches down and kills the iPod.
Silence. Danny studies the hill with increasing focus. POV.
Nothing moves.
The three SEALs sleep.
Tight on Luttrell. Sleeping.
THEN a very faint sound from down hill. Silence. Then another.
Luttrell slowly opens his eyes. Listening. Another sound, a soft bell.
Marcus shifts, looks down hill.
Marcus’s POV
Looking down hill. Nothing moving. The sounds becoming more present. Bells.
Tight on Luttrell. Looking.
FADE OUT:
35.
BACK TO HIS POV
The empty hill. More Bells. Then cresting the hill. First just the tips of the ears. Then the forehead, nose, face....
A large male goat.
Bell ringing gently from his neck.
TIGHT ON MARCUS
Studying the goat.
As another goat appears. Then another...then another...then twenty...
A herd of goats moving up the hill right at them.
Marcus is wide awake, eyes scanning the hill scanning the goats when...
A human head crests the hill. A young Afghan BOY, ten years old.
Luttrell reaches for his Mark 12, looks over to Axe still sleeping. Then to Murph still sleeping. Then back to Danny.
Danny’s already on scope. Gun aimed at the approaching kid when...
Two more Afghan MEN crest the hill - an old man and a teenager.
The hill is full of goats. More than a hundred with the three Afghans moving straight at the SEALs.
The goat bells and baying of the animals creating serious noise. Murph and Axe both waking up.
Weapons coming up as they silently take in this bizarre situation.
Back to Marcus as the first goat passes by. Then another. Tight on lead Afghan boy...THE GOAT BOY.
He’s heading dangerously close to Luttrell’s hide singing quietly to himself.
Tight on Luttrell. Gun up and trained on the goat boy as he gets closer...closer...and then in a one in a million...this fucking goat boy takes one more step and comes down square on Luttrell’s head.
36.
Luttrell moves, the kid screams, Luttrell’s up, gun up...screaming.
LUTTRELL Get the fuck down.
Axe, Danny, and Murphy. Guns up moving in fast on the terrified goat men...
DANNY Down Down Down.
The kid screams and starts running downhill towards the village. AXE sprints on him fast, takes the kid down, hand over mouth.
Kid bites and struggles wild.
Goats running in fear as the three Afghans are roughly thrown down. Searched, a military style Motorola walkie talkie taken from the old man, flex-cuffed and gagged...
When it’s done the four SEALs stand over them. Murphy looking at Luttrell.
Fuck.
MURPHY
Murphy looks to Dietz.
MURPHY (CONT’D) (re: radio)
Can you get a call out or what? Dietz reaches for his radio.
33 INT. J-BAD TOC 33
In the radio room. Musselman and Comms guys by their radios. SILENT. Clearly Spartan 01 is not getting through.
34 BACK ON THE MOUNTAIN 34 The goats spread out, grazing, bells ringing loud. a large
dog, mouth foaming, growls and bark at the team.
Luttrell raises his Mark 12 at the dog when it gets too close.
Murphy is trying to interrogate the older man with a translation box. He speaks into it and it’s supposed to translate into Pashto.
37.
They have separated the older man from the boys. Murphy and Luttrell have them off to the side.. Axe stands watch over the boy.
MURPHY
(speaking into the Phrase-
O-Later)
Are you looking for Americans?
A robotic-like voice used for making out the question in Arabic.
The old man stares at Murphy with a combination of hatred and confusion.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Do the Taliban know we are up here?
Death stare from the old man. Murphy getting frustrated. Louder.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Do they know?
The old man stares, finally says something quiet. Too quiet for the translating machine. Murphy puts the mic closer.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Say again. Are you Taliban?
The old man rants on as the machine struggles to translate his slang Pashtun.
TRANSLATION MACHINE
Do not drink with many blood rooms
fire and knives...
MURPHY
This fuckin thing’s not working...
The machine starts translating what Murphy is saying.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Shut the fuck up !
Murphy throws the machine on the ground.
The dog makes another move at Luttrell. Fangs mashing. Luttrell raises his gun. The dog backs down.

DANNY
Spartan 01, Spartan base...Spartan

Murphy standing just off the group calls Luttrell over.
MURPHY Marcus.
Leaving Axe on security. Luttrell moves up the hill fifty feet with Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What do you think?
LUTTRELL
Murphy’s God Awful law. Not you
Mikey. The other prick. The God of screw-ups.
Nothing.
Yea.
MURPHY
LUTTRELL Soft Compromise bro.
MURPHY
Yea. I’m aware of that.
Murphy digs into his pack, pulls out his SATELLITE PHONE. Checks numbers on his wrist pad. Dials up J-Bad TOC (Command Center).
MURPHY (CONT’D) (a touch frustrated: to
Dietz)
I’m now going to be that guy calling on a fucking unsecure Sat line because your radio is not functioning.
DIETZ
Move that mountain, we’re good.
Talk to the mountain, sir.
39.
Loses the signal twice. Third try he gets through. Horrible connection.
37 INT. J-BAD TOC 37 A phone rings, answered by a young Marine, SGT. HASSLERT.
HASSLERT
J-Bad TOC, SERGEANT HASSLERT.
MURPHY
Sergeant can you hear me, this is
Spartan 01, can you here me? Horrible delays, echoes and static.
Hello?
HASSLERT
MURPHY
This is Spartan 01, do you hear me?
HASSLERT I hear you.
MURPHY
This is not a secure line and I
need to speak to the CO immediately.
The CO?
HASSLERT
MURPHY That’s correct.
HASSLERT Which CO sir?
MURPHY Commander Kristensen.
HASSLERT
Commander Kristensen is not here
sir.
MURPHY
What do you mean he’s not there?
HASSLERT
Commander Kristensen left this
morning.
40.
Murphy realizing Right. That’s
STATIC BAD Hello?
Hello?
he’s made a mistake.
MURPHY
Fuck. He’s back at BAGRAM.
HASSLERT correct sir.
MURPHY HASSLERT MURPHY
I‘m here, I need to speak right now with the commander.
HASSLERT Commander is in BAGRAM.
MURPHY
I know that can you please transfer
this call to BAGRAM OUELLETTE TOC.
HASSLERT Roger that. Stand by.
MURPHY Standing by.
Silence Murphy looks down at the goat herders. Moves over to Danny with the radio. Holding up his SAT phone.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
(re: SAT phone)
Handing them our goddamned position.
Tight on Murphy, the realization of how fucked they are is starting to settle in.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What’s the fucking problem?
DANNY Don’t know.
MURPHY
Does it need new fucking batteries?
41.
DANNY
No, it’s fine but they won’t
fucking answer me.
38 INT. OUELLETTE TOC 38
It’s quiet. Among the SEALs present: Patton, James Suh, Dan Healy. A phone in the SEAL TOC rings answered by PATTON
SHANE PATTON Ouellette TOC Petty Officer
Patton..
MURPHY Patton, this is Murphy.
Really Bad connection.
SHANE PATTON
You’re looking for Mike Murphy?
MURPHY This is Mike Murphy.
SHANE PATTON Mike Murphy?
MURPHY
Yes correct, this is Mike Murphy. A horrible connection.
Patton is confused. He knows that Murphy and his team are way deep on their opp.
Mike?
SHANE PATTON
MURPHY Is this Shane?
SHANE PATTON
It’s Shane. What’s up Mike? This
connection sucks.
MURPHY
Are you not receiving our transmissions?
SHANE PATTON Radio calls? Not in a while.
Patton yells over to the Comms guys.
42.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) Are you all hearing anything from
SPARTAN 1.
COMMS GUY
When? We’ve been communicating.
SHANE PATTON (back on the phone)
They say they are communicating with you.
MURPHY Say again.
SHANE PATTON
Comms says that you are good. Copy?
MURPHY
In the last twenty minutes?
SHANE PATTON (back to comms guy)
You talked in the last twenty minutes?
COMMS GUY Negative.
SHANE PATTON (into phone)
Negative Murph.
MURPHY
I need the skipper now.
SHANE PATTON He’s sleeping sir.
MURPHY Wake him up now.
Murphy’s voice is electronically garbled.
SHANE PATTON
Did you say wake him up sir?
MURPHY Right the fuck now!
SHANE PATTON Roger that.
43.
39 EXT. BAGRAM TOC. 39
SHANE PATTON barefooted jogs out of the TOC moves through a series of plywood barracks. Knocks on a door.
SHANE PATTON Skipper. Skipper.
He knocks harder.
SKIPPER! From inside.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D)
KRISTENSEN (oc)
What?
SHANE PATTON
Sir sorry sir. I’ve got Lieutenant
Murphy on the phone in the TOC. Says he needs to talk to you. Now.
A moment, then Kristensen’s door flies open. Kristensen in his underwear, flip flops, moving out, clearly just waking up.
39A Track with them as Kristensen moves back into the TOC. 39A Reaches for the phone.
KRISTENSEN (into phone)
Mike? Silence Static.
KRISTENSEN (CONT'D) Mike...? Mike...? Try him back.
PATTON reads Murphy’s SAT phone number off the board. Dials. Waits. Nothing. Tries again nothing.
KRISTENSEN (CONT'D) Is it dead?
SHANE PATTON
Yes sir. What’d he want?
KRISTENSEN
44.
SHANE PATTON No idea sir.
KRISTENSEN Did he say anything?
SHANE PATTON
Just that he needed to speak to
you.
KRISTENSEN Anything wrong?
SHANE PATTON Didn’t say sir.
Stay with Kristensen a bit concerned. Looking at the map of the Valley.
TIGHT ON KRISTENSEN
Thinking.....
40 EXT. HINDU KUSH MOUNTAIN 40 Murphy trying his IRIDIUM SAT phone one more time.
MURPHY
Can someone explain to me why they
both crash at the same time?
LUTTRELL AXE
Murphy’s law. Murphy’s law
Now a last resort. Murphy keys his personal radio. An MBITR
walkie talkie mounted on the side of his chest.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Spartan 01 to anyone. Spartan 01 to
anyone listening. Over.
LUTTRELL
We could light these goats on fire
and smoke signal our way out of here.
DANNY
I could go down to the village and
ask to borrow a phone.
Murphy just stares at the goat herders.
45.
MURPHY
(quietly to himself)
Fuck.
LUTTRELL
You’d get some interesting tile
ideas down there bro. Afghan Dirt Brown. Goat skin blond, she’ll dig that a hell of a lot more than what is it Honey creme...?
The goat noise is now really loud. Dogs barking and Axe is getting focused. Doing the math.
The kid bolts. Hands cuffed behind his back, he’s still fast as shit.
AXE Fuck me.
He charges again after the kid. Tackles him. Drags him back. AXE breathing hard. Looking at Murphy.
MURPHY
I’m thinking three ways this plays
out.
All eyes on Murphy. His brain churning.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
We let em go, we’re gonna fight. So
we can 1) Tie em up. Move out. Probably take them 15 minutes to get out. 2) Let em go. We hike out. Roll dice.
DIETZ Three?
AXE
Three, soft Compromise. Terminate
the compromise.
Axe stares at Murphy. Third choice is obvious.
Murphy looks up to the mountain top a mile behind them.
MURPHY
Can we get a signal from that
mountain?
46.
DANNY
I thought about that. Probably. I
don’t fucking know.
More dog barking, goat baying, bells ringing. The kids are staring rage into the eyes of the Americans.
DANNY (CONT’D) We gotta do something boss.
MURPHY
Yea.
Murphy walks back down to Luttrell and Axe.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What do you think?
LUTTRELL
They don’t seem to like us very
much.
MURPHY A pause. Reality setting in.
AXE
Shah’s down there. We let them go,
Shaw disappears. Mission fails.
MURPHY What? Kill them.
Axe stares at Murphy.
Murphy staring at Axe. Realizing how serious he is.
AXE
We are compromised Mike.
Marcus spits out some chew. Looking down, he shakes his head. A pained grin plasters his face.
Yea.
Shit.
LUTTRELL
47.
MURPHY Danny?
Danny takes a long look at the goat herders. Finally...
DANNY
I don’t give a shit what you
decide. I’m not a lawyer. Just tell me what to do Murph. You’re the big bucks, earn em’.
Murphy turns to Marcus.
MURPHY Marcus?
LUTTRELL I don’t know Mikey.
Luttrell takes his time. The goats sound like they are howling. The vibe on the mountain is becoming deathly serious.
LUTTRELL (CONT'D)
I don’t know. I don’t like it. We
kill them. Yea ok. We kill them. Bury them. They get found. Then what...
AXE Then what?
LUTTRELL
I’m just saying. It ain’t gonna be
private. Gonna be out there for the whole fucking world. CNN -- SEALs kill goat farmers. I don’t want that legacy, bro. I’m not killing goat farmers. Not feeling that.
48.
AXE
I’m not either, but the
Old man’s Tali and these kids can shoot better than you can.
LUTTRELL
Let’s just tie ‘em up and get the
fuck out of here.
AXE
We tie them up, we have no control over when they get found; get free. I will die before I let them dictate when we die. I will not end up showing your body -- your head -- on television. On the Computer. No way, they do not get that vote.
LUTTRELL
Then let’s just get the fuck out of
here.
I will do this, I will kill them right now. They will not harm you or me or my wife or your wife or any of our unborn children. No. These people are death and I will not fucking bow to this.
MURPHY
You want to kill, Axe? Really?
That’s your position?
AXE
I want to be playing golf with
Freddie Couples on Pebble Beach, but I’m having a little trouble getting a tee time.
LUTTRELL
If we kill these kids, it’s International news. CNN doesn’t care about Rules of Engagement. SEALs kill kids. That’s the story. Forever.
Tight on the guys taking this in. Murphy paces, staring intensely at one of the goat kids.
MURPHY
Axe what’s your call?
AXE
49.
Axe stares at Murphy.
AXE (sad grin)
My final answer?
49A.
MURPHY Your final answer.
AXE Kill them.
This hits hard.
MURPHY Danny?
Dietz stares at the tied up kids.
DANNY It’s your call bro.
MURPHY
You don’t have an opinion?
DANNY
Yea I have an opinion. Two
opinions. One is that for the record I don’t give a fuck what anyone thinks about what the fuck we do up here. We do what we do. What we have to do. That’s it. That’s our business.
MURPHY What’s two?
DANNY
Two is, this is the Navy and you’re
the boss and your job is to be the boss and my job is to do what I’m fucking told.
Ok.
MURPHY
DANNY
So you tell me what to do and it
will be done. Murphy looks to Marcus.
MURPHY
Marcus what’s your call?
Luttrell seems to get that with Danny out, Murphy’s for letting them go, Axe wants them dead - he’s the tie-breaker.
50.
ON MURPHY.
LUTTRELL
(slowly shaking his head)
No. I’d rather fight them straight up. I don’t want to kill these kids.
Thinking. He looks around the area. Looking for a burial spot. Stabbing at the stone earth with his M4. Clearly no soft earth anywhere close.
MURPHY (quiet)
Fuck me.
Murphy stares down at the Afghan village. Then long and hard at the three Afghans. Finally turns back to goat herders.
DANNY
Look at them. They fucking hate us.
We don’t know how many Hajji’s they have down there. We can’t let them go.
LUTTRELL
So now you have an opinion? I
thought you were standing by waiting for your orders?
AXE
This opp is a soup sandwich. Been so from the beginning. The pitch. The rope. Worst comms that I’ve ever seen. Soft intel, we are not wearing vests, have no heavy weapons, are weak in numbers.... It’s a cursed opp.
MURPHY
Starting to feel like a cursed opp.
LUTTRELL
It’s not a cursed opp. There are no fucking curses. Just Afghanistan. That’s all. Everyday man. Devil’s asshole.
AXE
Shah just killed twenty marines
last week and we’re on him. We’ve come this far and these people here are him. They are a part of him. We let them go.
(MORE)
51.
AXE (CONT'D)
We’re letting him go and why in the
fucking world does he have the right to do that to us?
Axe is starring at LUTTRELL.
51A.
Silence.
AXE.
Seriously Marcus. Why does he have
the right to do that to us?
LUTTRELL
I don’t see it that way.
MURPHY
So what is your fucking call bro?
LUTTRELL
Let them go. Shut it down.
So if Murphy was taking a vote it seems like it’s one vote for killing them, one vote for letting them go, Danny is neutral.
This is all on MURPHY.
Murphy turns away from them, looking down the steep pitched mountain. The village far below.
Murphy thinks. Looks at the young kids. The old man.
MURPHY
Here’s what we’re gonna do. Pack
up. Everything. We’re gonna let ‘em go and we’re gonna make the peak. When we make the peak were gonna make Comms. We’re calling QRF and we’re getting out.
Silence as the guys take in the plan. Luttrell lets out a huge breath.
MURPHY (CONT’D) That’s what we’re going to do.
DANNY Roger that.
LUTTRELL Yes sir.
MURPHY Let’s move it.
Quick Shots.
The guys quickly breaking down their gear. The goat boy watching confused.
52.
The older Goat herders. Defiant. Steel-eyed.
52A.
41 INT. SEAL TOC. BAGRAM. 41
Kristensen, Patton with Petty Officer Dan Healy, James Suh and some COMMS guys.
The Comms guys trying to get Spartan 01 back on line.
COMMS GUY
Spartan 01, Spartan 01, over.
Kristensen is on the phone, communicating with J-Bad TOC
KRISTENSEN
When was your last contact with
Spartan 01?
42 EXT. J-BAD TOC. 42 The two Blackhawks standing by with the two Apaches.
The Apache pilots are firing up their engines.
Musslemen comes out of a pilot station.
MUSSLEMEN
Where are you guys going?
APACHE PILOT
We just got called North. By an
Army 372, evidently they took some small fire.
MUSSLEMEN
We’re QRF, bro.
APACHE PILOT
That’s what we thought. BAGRAM is
now QRF.
The 47s?
Correct.
Are we not the QRF now?
APACHE PILOT That’s my understanding.
Mussleman is a bit confused...
MUSSLEMEN
APACHE PILOT
MUSSLEMEN
53.
Apache pilots climb into their two birds. Take off.
43 EXT. MOUNTAIN 43
10 MINUTES LATER:
Gear packed the four SEALs stand over the Afghans.
MURPHY CONT’D Everybody good?
Quick nods from the team as Murphy’s flip knife comes out. He quickly cuts through the flex cuffs. Freeing the Afghans.
MURPHY
You three just won the lottery.
Speak well of us.
An odd moment as the Afghans stare at the SEALs. Not fully understanding that they are free to leave.
Go!
MURPHY (CONT’D)
The little goat boy stares at Murphy. A beat then gets it. Turning fast he takes off sprinting down the hill.
The old man holds a beat. Says something quietly to the team. Sounds fairly ominous.
Then he too turns and slowly, deliberately starts making his way down the long steep mountain.
Murphy looks at the team.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Let’s move it.
The four SEALs, full gear, start moving up the mountain.
There is no trail. Just steep rocks, fallen trees, and a brutal pitch.
43A THE YOUNG GOAT BOY. 43A RUNNING DOWN THE HILL.
54.
Leaping over rocks. Fallen trees. The kid’s movements are beautiful. Mountain agility in his DNA. Virtually FLYING down the mountain.
43B UP TOP. 43B
Slow going for the SEALs. Murphy leading. Danny, loaded up with COMMS, second. Luttrell breathing hard. Axe bringing up the rear.
On AXE
Constantly checking behind him.
His left foot catches on some loose granite. Gives out.
Axe rolls his ankle hard. Slips, falls hard sliding fast tumbling and smashing hard into a fallen tree stump.
Sprained right ankle and bruised left ribs.
Murphy stops, looking back as Luttrell moves down to Axe. Axe struggling back on his feet.
You ok?
LUTTRELL.
AXE Fucking Afghanistan.
LUTTRELL.
Yea. I’m the one who’s supposed to
be falling.
AXE I’m fine.
He takes a step. White flash of burst pain tears through him. He buckles. Clearly not alright.
43C THE GOAT KID 43C Running hard approaching the village.
43D UP TOP. 43D Luttrell reaches for him. Axe pulls away.
AXE (CONT'D) I’m good. Let’s go.
Axe digs his foot in. Grinds through the pain and starts back up the hill.
55.
AXE (CONT'D)
Maybe we should just hike down to
the village, ask to borrow a phone.
Tight on Murphy’s small smile as he digs it up the hill. The group now moving even slower cause of Axe’s ankle.
44 EXT. THE VILLAGE. 44
Quiet. A couple of small fires. Some cooking. A group of young boys playing with sticks. Women cooking as - The young GOAT BOY comes tearing, full sprint into the village.
TIGHT ON THE GOAT BOY. Eyes wide. Screaming for Shah.
Villagers start to gather. Shah approaches the boys. Breathing hard, they point up the mountain.
A couple of Taliban hear this. Take off into the woods.
TRACKING with the two Taliban.
As they sprint deeper into the woods. Into the Taliban camp.
Taliban soldiers sleeping. The two find Shah and Taraq. Tell them about the Americans.
Shah quickly on his walkie talkie, old school but deathly effective. Rounding up his fighters.
Quick shots of the Taliban army. Feels like 150 men. Arming themselves. AK’s, RPG’s, grenades, a lot of ammo. Radio gear.
Quiet, cool, professional. These Afghan soldiers are loading up big time...
45 EXT. UP MOUNTAIN. 45 The SEALs cresting the hill.
Fuck.
MURPHY
He’s looking up at a larger hill in front of them. They have just ascended a false summit. Still blocked in by another very steep mountain.
Danny?
MURPHY (CONT'D)
56.
Dietz is already into the radio, as Luttrell and Axe spread out, digging in, guns pointed down hill.
Nothing.
DANNY (on radio)
Anvil 1 this is Spartan 01, over.
MURPHY Great.
Comms still clearly dead. Murphy weighing his options. They are high above the village. Murphy pulls out binoculars. Scanning the village and mountain.
All three SEALs on glass. SCANNING. SEALS POV
Nothing moving. From their vantage the town seems quiet. Business as usual.
They cannot see the Taliban off in the woods. They are OBLIVIOUS to the magnitude of the threat.
CUT TO:
46 TWENTY MINUTES LATER. 46
Danny still working the radio. Axe has tightened his boot. Murphy and Luttrell have spread out on the hill. Staring down at the village.
Murphy’s got his SAT phone out. Trying to get a signal. Can’t.
He’s looking with disgust at the mountain behind him, knowing that it’s blocking his signal.
MURPHY (to mountain)
Move Bitch.
Luttrell’s fifteen feet to his left.
LUTTRELL What do you want to do?
MURPHY
Go home, get in bed, and watch
Anchorman.
57.
Check.
LUTTRELL
MURPHY I wanna be on you.
LUTTRELL
Roger that. Should I spread the
word?
MURPHY
Not just yet. Let’s hold up for an
hour and see just how big of a can of hell we’ve opened.
LUTTRELL What do you think?
MURPHY
We did the right thing. We let our
love light shine. God ought to be smiling down on us. Isn’t that how it works? Good things happen to good people?
LUTTRELL
You think they’re coming after us?
MURPHY
Like a pack of wild dogs.
MURPHY keys his radio.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What say you Axe?
AXE (on radio)
I’m fine.
Murphy looks up behind him to the large cliff.
MURPHY (to Axe)
You good to go?
AXE
No problems boss.
MURPHY
Here’s the deal. Lay low here.
Soon as the sun sets we move.
(MORE)
58.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
If we can’t get comms from that top we’re probably gonna have to walk home anyway, so get some rest. Axe you’re first security. We move in about sixty minutes.
46A THIRTY MINUTES LATER. 46A Murphy, Danny, and Marcus. Hats low. Eyes closed. Danny on
the glass.
It’s quiet. Sun getting low. Probably two hours of sunlight left.
ON AXE.
Calmly checking down hill, whistling very quietly to himself.
Tight on Luttrell resting.
Danny. Eyes closed. One arm around his radio.
Murphy. Eyes open. Staring up at the sky.
Back to Axe. Focused down range.
Down the mountain. Something appears to move. Axe misses it. Hold a beat. More movement.
Just catches Axe’s peripheral... Axe shifts his gaze. Focusing.
THEN
More movement. Axe sees it, raises his gun eye to the scope. Gently scanning the area of movement.
Stops whistling.
AXE’S POV:
No movement.
Axe slowly pans his M-4 across the hill. Suddenly A FLASH OF SOMETHING HUMAN.
A HUMAN. He pans a bit more to the right. Then two more.
AXE pans way to the right. Almost as high as the SEALs are and he see’s more movement.
They are almost surrounded.
TIGHT ON LUTTRELL eyes still closed.
59.
MURPHY (CONT'D) (oc)
Sssst! Sssst!
Luttrell lifts up his hat and looks left.
Sees Axe, rigid, in firing position, his rifle aimed straight up the mountain.
MURPHY (CONT'D) (to Danny)
Try and call it in.
Danny desperate to get the radio to work.
Luttrell fixes his Mark 12 into firing position looks through scope down hill.
LUTTRELL’S POV.
Lined along the top are at least a dozen heavily armed Taliban warriors, each one of them with an AK pointing downward. Some carrying rocket propelled grenades.
LUTTRELL looks left.
More Taliban coming down hill to flank them. Luttrell looks right.
More Taliban.
The SEALs are FUCKED.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
How the fuck fast are these little
bastards? All four SEALs guns up.
Marcus in the middle, Axe and Danny up to his left. Murphy twenty feet off to his right. Marcus slowly belly crawls towards Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT'D) What are you thinking?
LUTTRELL
I’m thinking that we’re about
fixing to get into a pretty good gunfight.
Yea.
MURPHY
60.
LUTTRELL
Looks like I voted wrong.
MURPHY
Negative. We’ve been given the
opportunity to reach out and make some hell fucking strong contact with our friends from the other side. Job well done.
LUTTRELL Hoo-yah to that sir.
ON DANNY AND AXE
Looking up the hill which is now swarming with Taliban. Dozens of soldiers flowing down hill flanking them.
DANNY Do they see us?
AXE Dunno.
BACK TO MARCUS.
His back pressed up against a tree, inventorying his ammo. Grenades. Knife.
Danny, Axe, Murphy all doing the same. Readying for war.
Axe and Danny sneak quick looks at the pictures of their wives taped inside their helmets.
The trap tightening around all of them. All four focused up hill.
A TREE TWENTY FEET IN FRONT OF MARCUS.
A flash of a turban. Glint of an AK Barrel pointed in his general direction.
Luttrell tightens the grip of his rifle slowly starts pointing it in the direction of the man behind the tree.
Luttrell eyes on glass, still as marble. Aimed at the tree.
Marcus looks over his shoulder at Murphy whose gun is also trained on the tree.
Marcus eyes back on the scope. SCOPE POV:
61.
A fierce-eyed Taliban warrior peering straight into the scope. Black eyes and thick black beard. The barrel of his AK pointed dead on Luttrell.
Hold.
THEN.
Luttrell fires once. Blowing the man’s head off.
An odd brief moment of silence as the head shot Afghan stumbles, still standing, still clutching his AK-47. He takes three more steps towards Luttrell.
Stops.
Luttrell shoots again removes what’s left of the fighter’s head.
The Afghan starts to fall and as he hits the ground, all HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
From above and half way down both flanks the Taliban open fire.
Screaming at each other, communicating through violent, loud bursts of Pashto, the Taliban moving fast down the hill. Agile and fearless, not weighted down with US-style gear, they are able to leap boulders, fallen trees.
Taraq in the middle of the pack on the top of the SEALs. UP TOP - Shah calmly giving orders into his radio comms.
ON MURPHY.
Taliban moving down the hill on both sides. Shooting as they move.
A solid line of at least fifty Taliban in firing positions on top of the hill above them.
The SEALs are close to being surrounded.
MURPHY checks his rear.
MURPHY POV
A cliff. More of a series of cliffs. Multiple death falls. First one is at least 300 feet.
Murphy calls it.
Push right flank.
MURPHY
62.
Axe the farthest right starts shooting and moving right INTO the wall of the Taliban flanking his right.
Luttrell follows staying low, shooting, Danny firing with one arm. Desperate to get the radio up.
DANNY
Spartan 01 reporting major enemy
contact. We need help. Spartan 01 reporting major enemy contact. Request immediate QRF! Spartan 01 requesting immediate QRF.
Murphy’s doing the same with his SAT phone. He’s moving right trying to dial up the TOC. Not getting through.
Danny’s left two fingers HIT. Dangling bloody and mangled.
He tries to put them back into his hand. Jams his ring finger back into its socket. His pinkie is beyond repair.
DANNY (CONT’D)
Marcus!
Luttrell turns, Danny holds up his fucked up hand.
LUTTRELL Wrap it up bro.
DANNY Roger that.
Taliban gunfire is picking up. Axe the deepest right kills two Taliban. Two more immediately fill their positions.
MURPHY
Danny did you get the call through?
DANNY
I made the call. Don’t know if it
went through. You?
MURPHY
I couldn’t get a line.
DANNY Fuck.
Marcus is pushing right behind Axe trying to break the right Taliban flank.
Charging the Ambush.
63.
MURPHY
Keep pushing right. Kill ‘em all.
The four SEALs fighting well as a team. Crawling, shooting and covering as they start making progress killing their way into the right side of the Taliban ambush.
The Taliban close enough to see clearly.
Axe shot through the left shoulder. Ignoring it he keeps firing. His long scope making him very accurate. As he shoots deep into the left flank.
TALIBAN POV:
From behind at least 12 Tabliban fighters pushing deeper into the right side.
Two more Taliban hit. The remaining start taking solid covering positions, firing down at the four SEALs.
Axe being the closest takes the majority of the firepower.
Decent cover from a granite boulder which is getting hacked to pieces by the incoming AK fire.
Razor sharp stone shrapnel chunks slicing into Axe’s face and neck. Blood runs down his face drips off his chin.
Luttrell getting equally shot up. Returning fire. His cover rock getting shot up bad. Chunks of granite tearing into his face and neck.
FURTHER to the left, Danny and Murphy shooting, trying to get closer to Luttrell and Axe.
Danny takes another round, blowing clear through his right thigh shattering his right femur. Blood, muscle chunks and bone tear through his pants.
DANNY Goddammitt.
Pissed he keeps moving. Firing. Ignoring his two gunshots. Hand and Leg.
Danny moves up with Murphy behind some decent cover.
MURPHY Can you fight?
DANNY Roger that.
64.
MURPHY
Want me to take the radio?
DANNY Negative.
Murphy looks up towards Axe who is far right.
MURPHY (yelling)
AXE?!
AXE Sir!
MURPHY
Can we break that flank? Hold
this, we’re gonna push left!
Axe gets shot through the top of his shoulder the bullet tearing down through his shoulder and burning deep inside his chest.
Axe keeps firing, hitting a Taliban in the knee. The Taliban fires back at Axe missing but sending sharp rock chips shearing up off the granite into Axe’s face. Shredding his right ear, cutting into his eyeballs.
Half blind. Watery out of focus images as sweat mixed with blood. Axe struggles to see. When his vision clears up enough to focus:
AXE POV.
Two Tali fighters. Moving fast out of cover, right at AXE. Directly at the Americans. SEAL style. Attacking the counter attack.
The Taliban are close to the half blind Axe. Axe fires blind. Misses. The Taliban almost on him. Then:
One of the Tali hit with a round from Luttrell, killed. The other, wounded, falls on Axe. Vicious hand-to-hand fight.
Luttrell runs up to help Axe. Takes the remaining Taliban soldier out with a point-blank headshot.
From the right, a BELT FED MACHINE GUN opens up on their position.
Marcus and Axe start moving left. Both shot during the move - Marcus in his right butt-cheek, Axe in his right thigh.
65.
47 INT. TOC. BAGRAM 47 Comms guy at radio. Checking wall clock. See’s Kristensen,

KRISTENSEN
COMMS GUY 2 hours 15 minutes.
Tight on Kristensen. Thinking. Checking the clock.
KRISTENSEN Call me if they miss two.
COMMS GUY Roger that.
48 EXT. ON THE MOUNTAIN 48 CHAOS.

Marcus turns to Murphy.
Luttrell, Murphy and Axe do the same. For a second they look like four country boys cliff jumping into a lake. Except for the blood streaming from necks and guts and legs, the bullet tracers flying all around them...
They fly off the cliff and it looks kind of beautiful. Freeing...until.

Tight on beaded stone necklace with seven American Dog Tags hanging from it like human scalps.
Tight on a blood soaked dog tag: “Danny Dietz”
We move across the faces of several of these Afghan warriors They feel more like Comanche Indians than anything else.
Fierce and focused, guns up, they hunt Americans.
70A FURTHER DOWN: 3RD CLIFF EDGE ABOVE VILLAGE 70A
Luttrell and Axe at a major cliff edge, looking back up...guns pointed up mountain.
We pull wide and see just how close Taraq now is to Luttrell and Axe, 100 ft. away, max. Closing in.
On Luttrell - hearing Taraq and his men, whispering to Axe.
LUTTRELL
Come here Axe. Let me see you.
Axe nods, blood slow running from his head shot down the back of the neck. Axe touches the wound.

AXE I’ll do it.
LUTTRELL Stay quiet.
A nod from Axe and the two men split up.
Axe moves to his left, Luttrell to his right.
Tight on Axe. Shot up. Blood pouring from head wound. Tough. Grinding it out. Staying low. Deep breathing. Grunting as he crosses the mountain.
Gun fire erupts around him. Turning, spots half a dozen Taliban on him.
Axe pushes deeper into the woods. A hunted animal running out of options.
LUTTRELL
The same. Moving quiet in the other direction.
97.
This is all very silent. Tense....Taraq like a hunting dog, dead quiet, Luttrell and Axe, the hunted, desperately trying to stay quiet.
On Luttrell - trying to move towards a large rock...
His right foot digging in for traction, dislodges a small pebble... on that pebble picking up momentum, hitting smaller pebbles, dislodging more little rocks... A mini avalanche, hitting a bigger rock.
Tight on Luttrell.
Looking down at the small rock slide, hearing its noise....
Shit.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D)
And they open fire again, bullets firing all around Luttrell, both Luttrell and Axe return fire. This is much closer gun fighting...grenades and RPG’s at close quarters. Men behind rocks, guns blazing.

His hands around the fast rope....

50 CAL GUNNER
Tight on Kristensen and Patton looking down as the RPG round flies into the chopper right past them, literally into the 47.
99.
74 EXT. A MOMENT OF SILENCE, THEN... 74 The Chinook explodes.
Ripping apart, tilting, rotor blades immediately tearing into treetops then thick tree trunks - like massive buzz saws - the chopper turns and burns.

Rocks and trees churn, bodies break and burn and die as the big Chinook 47 rips apart exploding and tumbling down the mountain.

PILOT No fucking way.

SEAL LT.
As the SEALs on the chopper start breaking out the windows firing their M-4’s out the window, Airforce gunmen open up the 50 cals. Massive fire power blasting out from the choppers.
76 MOUNTAIN ABOVE VILLAGE - LATE DAY 76
Marcus looking cross mountain at Axe who has managed to transverse one hundred feet of the mountain and is leading a small pack of Shah’s men away from Luttrell.
Axe starts taking heavy fire. Shot twice through the throat. Falling backwards. Trying to get up. Back to his weapon.
AXE DYING.
Marcus watching helpless from across the mountain. Trying to cover Axe as the Taliban move in on him.
Not all of them have followed Axe because as Marcus turns back an RPG blows ten feet in front of him. Shrapnel and rock smashing into the side of his head.
His Helmet tears off his head.
100.
Tight on Marcus rolling backwards. Falling. Tumbling further down the mountain.
Tight on his helmet, Texas flag painted bold across it. Rolling and smashing down the mountain.
He comes to a hard stop slamming the back of his exposed head into a rock.
Tight on Marcus. Close to unconscious. Very dazed, Very confused.
MARCUS POV.

Taraq and his men hear the incoming Apaches.
Shah orders his men to take cover. The Taliban quickly becoming invisible from the sky.
83B DOWN HILL: 83B
Marcus deaf to the incoming Apaches. Has no idea how close they are. As he falls, gets up, off balance stumbles off a 30 ft drop.
This time not so lucky with his landing, comes down hard, shatters his right shin, bone tears through his skin, compound fracture.
Screaming in pain, Luttrell crawls into a rock crevasse. Hiding, he attempts to clear his head.
We play all of Luttrell’s audio perspective here as deaf. Abstract surges of sound. He’s basically deaf.
The Apaches fly high over head. Missing Luttrell. Disappearing over mountain tops as they keep moving to avoid enemy ground fire.
Struggling to silence his hysterical breathing, Luttrell hides as Taraq and his men move all around him. Luttrell sees shadows of the fighters. He silently starts covering himself with rocks and dirt.
Luttrell well hidden.
We slowly push in on him as his head starts to nod forward. He lifts it. Fighting the powerful urge for sleep. It falls again. He lifts it. Leaning his head back against the crevasse wall.
Taraq and his men back on the hunt. Searching rock to rock.
Tight on Luttrell. Head back. Breathing slower. As Luttrell falls to sleep.
FADE TO BLACK.

84 INT. LUTTRELL’S HIDE 84
TIGHT ON MARCUS. Looks DEAD. EYES TWITCH. SLOWLY OPEN. LUTTRELL wakes up.
Disoriented. First thing he notices is the bird sitting up on a rock above him. He hears it. Sort of. Faded. Loud then silent. His hearing has partially returned.
LUTTRELL very slowly clears himself from the dirt and rock hide.
Inventories himself, his weapons.
Two magazines, two grenades. No food. No water.
Bleeding has stopped from his gunshot. Leg is fucked up. Shin bone busting out.
Luttrell sits down. Examining his leg. Probing the bone. Rips off his pants exposing his broken leg in UA shorts. Tears welling he bites down on his lips as he resets the broken bone. Jamming it back inside his skin.
Tucking back the bone.
Luttrell packs the puncture wound with dirt. Starts massaging his dead legs. Forcing blood back into them. Deep powerful breathing as he starts to will his body back into life.
104.
85 EXT. LUTTRELL’S HIDE 85
Luttrell slowly moves out of the hide scanning the area for any sign of Taraq or Shah.
Luttrell sees nothing.
The village is close. Couple of hundred yards.
LUTTRELL moves out. Slowly picking his way down towards the village.
At fifty yards Luttrell pulls up. Takes cover behind some rocks. Stares down at the village through his M4 scope.

Male, large and powerful.
The wolf studies Luttrell.

Luttrell picks himself up.
Studies the wolf closely.
Water drips off the side of the Wolf’s face. His coat seems wet.
Luttrell turns. Listens.
HEARS the SOUND of falling water.
TRACK with Luttrell towards the sound of the water.
Luttrell moves to 20 ft. waterfall, pouring into a beautiful clear pool of crystal clear fresh water.
Luttrell tries to slide down the steep cliff sides of the water pool.
Too excited, moving too fast, Luttrell slips, falling, tumbling. He falls fast into the water.
UNDERWATER.
Luttrell cuts through the water. Like a baptism as the cool water surrounds him. Luttrell stays under water. Eyes closed. Feeling it.
Finally comes up.
SURFACES.
Swims to the shore on his hands and knees.
LUTTRELL drinks. And drinks......
Slurping like a broken animal.
Grabbing for hunks of water plants. Luttrell eats. Shoving the plants into his mouth. Desperate for any kind of energy.

Finally one of the Afghans. A 30 year old male GULAB, the leader, strong rugged handsome, steps forward. Hands up in peace.
GULAB Not Taliban.
Luttrell studies Gulab. Looks deep into his eyes.
Luttrell looks from Gulab to the other Afghan men. Their faces seem kind. Nothing like the death looks we have seen from the Taliban.

Come.
Gulab slowly stepping to and reaching for Luttrell. Voices heard from deeper into the woods.
Taraq and his crew getting closer.
One of Gulab’s men says something quiet to Gulab.

Gulab reaches his hand out to Luttrell... Luttrell looks deep into Gulab’s eyes.
Armed grenade in one hand, Luttrell slowly reaches his right bleeding hand out.
Tight on two hands grabbing each other.
As they pull him up, out of the stream, voices of Taraq and his men suddenly much closer.
Gulab whispers something to one of his men.
Luttrell is quickly pushed down into a crevasse between two rocks.
A young Afghan boy sits on top of Luttrell hiding him further.
Luttrell eyes wide, clutching his grenade.
The young boy gently patting Luttrell’s back, trying to calm him.

staring at Luttrell. Luttrell struggles to sit up.
Gulab hands him water. Luttrell drinks in massive gulps. Choking.
Gulab takes water bottle from Marcus.
GULAB (arabic)
Slow.
Gulab hands Luttrell a bowl of cooked Lamb.
Luttrell starts inhaling the meat. Fist fulls. As he starts choking.
GULAB (CONT’D) (arabic)
Slow.
Luttrell nods. Trying to slow down. Trying to show a semblance of control.
Gulab points to the Texas flag on Marcus’s vest.
America?

LUTTRELL More water. Please.
Gulab hands Marcus the bottle. Again he starts drinking in desperate, choking gulps. The little boy laughing at Luttrell’s ravenous thirst. Gulab a small smile.
The little boy and Gulab just stare. As Luttrell finishes all the meat and drinks all the water.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D)
I don’t know why your doing this
for me.
Gulab and the little boy staring at Marcus.
Thank you.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D)
The two men staring at each other as an incoming RPG slams into the house. Huge explosion.
Frantic screaming from outside. Gulab up and out first. Luttrell struggles to stand. The little boy moving to Luttrell helping him up. Luttrell grabbing his vest and gun moving out just as a 2nd RPG detonates destroying the rest of Gulab’s house.
106 EXT. VILLAGE 106 TARAQ attacks with his men.
Brutal fight. Hand to hand, gun on gun. Gulab shot, Marcus shot again. The Taliban is about to kill Marcus when the little boy calls out to Marcus.
121.
The Taliban is on top of Luttrell, choking him, killing him. Luttrell’s hands clawing at the man, digging into earth, grasping for wood, a stone, anything...when...a KNIFE, is slapped into Luttrell’s hand. Luttrell looks up, the little boy. Staring at Luttrell.
Marcus buries the knife into the neck of the fighter.
Rolling out as the building in front of them detonates. Heavy machine gunfire tearing it up. Luttrell and Shah fall back. A woman charges out grabbing the little boy. Eye contact with Luttrell as he is carried away.
Gulab and Marcus pinned down...Taraq moving in. Taraq is about to win.
When off camera, Luttrell looking up at the empty sky, he hears something.
THUMP THUMP THUMP Silent. Then.
Giant explosions all around Luttrell. Taliban blowing up as if HAND of GOD was attacking.

Apaches circling over head as two Blackhawks land behind them.
Air Force Search and Rescue Helicopter airmen charge out of the chopper towards Luttrell.
Luttrell?
CREW CHIEF
LUTTRELL Yes sir.
CREW CHIEF It’s time to go home.
The Airmen reach for Luttrell. Luttrell won’t let go of Gulab. They hold each other like life long brothers.
The US Airmen separate Marcus from Gulab. Marcus is too weak to resist.
107 INT. CHOPPER 107 Luttrell loaded in the chopper, looks back at Gulab, reaches
for him.
Gulab takes his hand.
LUTTRELL He comes with me.
Luttrell’s hand is gently separated from Gulab as Green Berets move into the village. Gulab steps back as the chopper takes off.
Tight on Luttrell, weak eyes open, glassed up.

The mighty Hindu Kush...
As the sun sets...
Back to opening. Doctor’s working franticly to save Luttrell.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D)
I died up on that mountain. There’s
no question a part of me will forever be up on that mountain dead as my brothers died.
Close on heart monitor.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D)
But, there is a part of me that lived. Because of my brothers, because of them, I am still alive, and I can never forget that no matter how much it hurts, how dark it gets, how far you fall...
From flatline to a heartbeat.
LUTTRELL(CONT’D)
You are never out of the fight.

Slammed your fingers in the door
Fought with kitchen knives and skewers

Messed around with gender roles
Line my eyes and call me pretty

					Revised First Draft Screenplay

							    by

						   Tom Mankiewicz

											   June 20, 1983


FADE IN:

SUPERIMPOSED ON A BLACK SCREEN:

WAYNE MANOR, NEAR GOTHAM CITY - 1960

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - SUNSET

A beautiful, sprawling suburban estate at sunset.  Classic wrought-iron
gates protect a winding driveway which snakes its way up through a
neatly manicured lawn.

INT. WAYNE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

ALFRED PENNYWORTH, the Wayne family butler, fluffs up a cushion in the
large, elegant living room.  A kind-looking man in his late forties
with dark moustache and hair, he epitomizes the proper British moor
domo, dressed in a morning coat and striped vest.

Alfred turns, straightens up a pile of thick-looking papers on the
living room table.  He picks up the top one, looks at it critically,
but with satisfaction.

INSERT SHOT - CAMPAIGN POSTER

The thick-looking papers are, in fact, political campaign posters.
They feature the face of a handsome, fortyish man, with the block
lettered caption: DR. THOMAS WAYNE FOR CITY COUNCIL - A BETTER TOMORROW
FOR GOTHAM.

DR. WAYNE'S VOICE
Bruce?  Hurry up, son, we're going
to be late.  Martha?

BACK TO SCENE

Alfred turns to look at DR. THOMAS WAYNE (the man on the poster) enters
the room.

DR. WAYNE (CONT'D)
Now where's Martha?  Alfred, have
you seen Mrs. Wayne?

ALFRED
I believe she was headed for Master
Bruce's laboratory. Sir.

Dr. Wayne checks his watch, exits, muttering.

DR. WAYNE
That nymphomaniacal hamster of his
must have given birth again...


INT. HALLWAY

Dr. Wayne heads down the hallway towards a door.

DR. WAYNE
Come on, everybody, the movie starts
in less than an hour.  Let's not
keep you next city councilman
waiting...

INT. BRUCE'S LAB

Dr. Wayne opens the door.  The makeshift lab room has a large work
table crammed with beakers, test tubes, and other scientific equipment.
BRUCE WYANE, aged ten, sits behind a microscope, peers down intently at
a specimen on a slide.  He does not look up as his father enters.

DR. WAYNE
(crossing)
Son, whatever you're looking at
couldn't possible be as pretty as
Audrey Hepburn, so...

Dr. Wayne puts his hand on Bruce's shoulder.  Incredibly enough - it
passes right through it!  He recoils, shocked, reaches out to touch the
body's head.  His hand cuts right through the skull.  Giggling is
HEARD, O.S.

Young Bruce stands behind the door with his mother, MARTHA, a beautiful
woman in her mid-thirties.

BRUCE
It's called a ""holograph,"" dad.  Two
Interconnecting laser beams...
(pointing)
There and there.  Pretty neat, huh?

Dr. Wayne stares at the laser tubes, totally nonplussed.

MARTHA
Well, don't look at me.  My side
of the family still can't figure out
why it gets dark at night.  Ready to
go?

DR. WAYNE
(eyes narrowing)
How can I be sure you're the real
thing?

Martha kisses him warmly.  He looks back, impressed.

DR. WAYNE (CONT'D)
Somewhat lifelike, I'll admit...

MARTH
That's all?  Then hold on to your
socks, buster...

She kisses him again with passion.  Bruce turns away with the typical
self-consciousness of a pre-adolescent.

BRUCE
Oh, guy...

His parents break.  Dr. Wayne looks down at him.

DR. WAYNE
Bruce, you may be the brightest ten
year old in Gotham City, or any-
where else, for that matter.  But I
feel I ought to let you in on some-
thing.
(at Martha)
This - is definitely not a guy.

INT. PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT

A huge 35mm motion picture projector springs to life.

INT. THEATER

The shifting colored rays of a projected film knife though the
blackness of the theater.

SCREEN VOICE
Sister, you make a beautiful nun.

ANGLE ON MOVIE SCREEN

The screen is filled by the face of AUDREY HEPBURN, dressed as a nun.
We are watched The Nun's Story, as are:

ANGLE ON WAYNE FAMILY IN SEATS

Dr. Wayne, Martha, and Bruce, who downs the remains of his box of Good
and Plenty.

EXT. GOTHAM MOVIE THEATER & STREET - NIGHT

Rumblings of distant thunder echo through the night sky.  The Wayne
family exits the theater, heads down a deserted street.  Suddenly - a
flash of lightning.  A closer, louder clap of thunder.  Dr. Wayne takes
Martha's arm.  Bruce straggles behind, staring at the pavement.

DR. WAYNE
I wish I hadn't parked so far away.
We're going to get soaked.

MARTHA
(over her shoulder)
Do try and keep up, Bruce.  What on
earth are you staring at, anyway?

BRUCE
The cracks, Mom.  It's bad luck to
step on one.
(does so)
Oh, darnit...

VOICE (O.S.)
Hold it, you people.  Freeze!

A large man (JOE CHILL) partially hidden by shadows, points a gun at
them.  He stands in the sunken entrance to a deserted brownstone house,
gestures with his weapon.

CHILL
Get down in here.  Now.

MARTHA
(terrified)
Thomas...

DR. WAYNE
You're welcome to our money.  Any-
thing we have.  Okay?

Chill stares coldly.  Dr. Wayne pulls out his money, takes off his
watch.  Martha and Bruce watch, petrified.

DR. WAYNE (CONT'D)
Here...just be careful with that
gun, will you?  It could go off...

CHILL
You know something, Doc?  You're
right.

DR. WAYNE
(expression changing)
Doc?  How did you know I was a...

There is a deafening roar as Chill fires the gun, lifting Dr. Wayne off
his feet, hurling him backwards.

BRUCE
Daddy!!

Martha screams.  A bolt of lightning flashes.  Chill turns.

CHILL
Let's have that necklace, lady...

MARTHA
Oh, my God!

Martha tries to escape but is jerked back by Chill's hand as it closes
on her necklace.  Bruce runs at Chill, grabs him by the leg, tries to
pull him down.

BRUCE
Leave my mommy alone!  Mommy!
Mommy!

Chill fires again!  The necklace snaps free as Martha is jerked
backwards, then crumples next to her husband.

CLOSE ON BRUCE

He kneels over his mother's body, pauses in shock, then looks up: the
barrel of Chill's gun comes into frame.

CLOSE ON CHILL

The necklace in one hand, his gun in the other.  He looks down at
Bruce, his expression suddenly changing.

BACK TO BRUCE

He stares at Chill, his jaw inadvertently twitching with rage.  A LOUD
CLAP OF THUNDER rolls across the sky.  Bruce's eyes have become steel,
visible fury shooting forth from them in an almost demonic fashion.

Chill's gun hand suddenly starts to tremble.  Incredibly, the savage
face of this young boy has unnerved him.

CHILL
Stop...lookin' at me like that, kid...
(no response)
Stop looking at me like that!

Suddenly - A FLASH OF LIGHTNING!  Rain begins to fall in sheets.
Chill, runs up to the street, disappears into the rain-swept darkness.

ANGLE ON APARTMENT BUILDING

LIGHTS have flicked on in the apartment building across the street.
FACELESS WITNESSES stand silhouetted in the windows, gazing down at the
tragedy across the street.

CAMERA PUSHES IN on one particular window.  A SHADOWY FIGURE half-
emerges from the darkness, his face still hidden from us.  All that is
visible is an oversized pair of striped pants and a large white daisy
stuck through the coat lapel.  The Shadowy Figure pauses, then reaches
out an arm and slowly lowers the window shade.

From behind the shade - an insane, maniacal giggle starts to rise.
Tiny at first, but gradually building to a sudden explosion of
cascading, frightening glee!

BACK TO BRUCE

Kneeling in the rain across the street, paralyzed with shock and grief.
He looks up from the bodies of his parents as a COUPLE approaches along
the pavement above.

BRUCE'S VOICE
Help...oh, please help me...

The couple stop, stare down at the scene.

BRUCE
It's...my mom and dad.  Please...I
think they're dead.

The couple exchange a quick, horrified glance, then hurry off down the
street.

BACK TO BRUCE

Sobbing uncontrollably now, tears mixing with the rain.  In the
distance: the low whine of an approaching siren.  CAMERA RISES into the
night sky:

A FLASHING BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS ACROSS THE SCREEN: the residue
remains in the night sky - a searing yellow dot.  ANOTHER BOLT OF
LIGHTNING - another yellow dot.  Then a deafening clap of thunder as
the gray-black clouds arrange themselves into a dark and eerie
silhouette.  The siren grows louder, piercing shrilly through the
rumblings of the storm.  The SILHOUETTE becomes more familiar now, as
the billowing clouds form themselves into a dark cape.  The dots of
lightning begin to pulsate as they evolve into two searing yellow eyes.

This then, is the signal of the future presence of the Dark Redeemer of
the Night.  The Black Wraith.  The Avenger of Countless Wrongs...

							 THE BATMAN

												DISSOLVE
THROUGH TO:

EXT. HILLSIDE CEMETERY NEAR GOTHAM - DAY

A beautiful rolling hill overlooking Gotham City.  As CAMERA TRACKS
through the trees, tombstones begin to appear.  We are in the middle of
an immaculate pastoral graveyard.  Down below in the distance an
endless line of black limousines snakes its way up a winding road.
CAMERA CONTINUES TO TRACK, finally HOLDING ON:

The unfilled graves of Thomas and Martha Wayne.  Dark-suited FUNERAL
ATTENDANTS wait silently by the caskets.

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT

A hot sun showers a blazing glow on the throbbing metropolis of Gotham
City, choked with cars, buses, PEDESTRIANS, and the attendant
pollution.  A great American city going through the routine
performances of its daily mundane chores.

EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

CAMERA CLOSE on an oversized pair of striped pants standing in front of
a corner newsstand.

VOICE
A copy of the Trib, please.

CLOSE ON GOTHAM TRIBUNE

An edition of the Gotham Tribune is handed over.  The headlines scream:
DR. & MRS. THOMAS WAYNE GUNNED DOWN IN SENSELESS ROBBERY/KILLING.
""Political hopeful was well ahead in latest polls.""

An insane giggle rises, O.S.  CAMERA PANS UP from the front page to the
horrified face of a NEWS VENDOR, staring in disbelief at the person
reading the Tribune.

CLOSE ON JOKER - HIS P.O.V.

We see the hideous face of THE JOKER.  A revolting perversion of a
human being with a chalk-white complexion, ruby red lips, and a
startling shock of green hair.  He continues to giggle as he reads.  A
CONFEDERATE stands behind.  The Vendor continues to stare as The Joker
suddenly notices.

JOKER
Something wrong?

VENDOR
Your...face.  It's...

JOKER
Familiar?  Maybe we met in Toledo.

VENDOR
I never been to Toledo.

JOKER
Neither have I.  Must have been two
other guys.
(taking one out)
Have a cigar?

VENDOR
Gee, thanks.

The Vendor takes the cigar, lights it.  The Joker and his Confederate
move off down the street.

JOKER
Want to hear a good one?  What's
black and white and dead all over?

CONFEDERATE
A newspaper, Boss, but ain't it
black and white and read all over?

Suddenly - there is a tremendous explosion!

ANGLE ON CORNER NEWSSTAND

The corner newsstand has virtually disappeared.  Thousands of pages
drift down through the air into the debris.

BACK TO JOKER

JOKER
No...

EXT. HILLSIDE CEMETERY - DAY

The procession of limousines has started back down the hill from the
funeral.  Alfred stands alone by a black Rolls Royce, looks off sadly
as:

Young Bruce Wayne gently places a flower on each of his parent's
graves, then turns.  His eyes are glassed over, but tears do not fall.
He crosses to Alfred who puts a protective arm around him.

ALFRED
It's unfair, of course.  But some-
times, Master Bruce, one simply has
to...accept conditions as they are,
and...make the best of them.

BRUCE
(softly)
Why?

ALFRED
Why?  Why, because...
(nice smile)
I don't know, really.

BRUCE
(deadly)
Neither do I.

Alfred helps the boy into the car.  The Rolls Royce heads back down the
hill toward Gotham City.

INT. THORNE CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Telephones RING!  Typewriters CLACK!  A campaign poster features the
face of RUPERT THORNE, an earnest-looking man with a granite-hard face.
Underneath is a logo: Rupert Thorne: He'll make our streets safe
again.""

The headquarters is a beehive of activity.  AIDES rush back and forth
as a door marked Private bursts open and Thorne appears.  Hr grins with
an oily manner.

THORNE
(to AIDE)
Are they all out there?

AIDE
We're waiting for The Evening
Sentinel, Mr. Thorne...

THORNE
Screw The Sentinel.  I gotta make
The six o'clock news.
(adjusts his tie)
What's the name of Wayne's kid?

AIDE
Bruce.

Thorne nods, heads for the door, mumbling to himself.

THORNE
Our hearts go out to the Wayne
Family, particularly their young
Son, Bruce...Bruce...Bruce...

EXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

A throng of REPORTERS and TV remote units snap to attention as Thorne
appears on the steps of his campaign headquarters.  He silences a
cacophony of overlapping questions with upraised hands, terminally
sincere.

THORNE
I didn't want to win like this.  Not
through tragedy.  But it's cruelly
ironic...

EXT. GOTHAM - DAY

A more downbeat section of Gotham's business district.  CAMERA CLOSES
on a specific building: The Monarch Playing Card Company.  THORNE'S
VOICE CONTINUES OVER:

THORNE'S VOICE
...that a good man like Thomas Wayne
who spoke up so forcefully for the
rights of criminals should himself
become the ultimate victim.

INT. JOKER'S LAIR - DAY

A huge room, garishly decorated in a clown motif.  The wallpaper is one
contiguous deck of cards.  There are harlequin chairs, jesters, and
open Jack-In-The-Box, etc.

A MAN sits in a chair at the end of the room, facing away from CAMERA.
He watches Thorne on a TV set.

THORNE
(from TV)
But his murderer will be caught and
executed, I promise you!  It's time
the scum of our society see that we
mean to have law and order on the
streets of Gotham City!

Suddenly - the set goes mute.  The Man in the chair swivels around
slowly: It is JOE CHILL!

The Joker stands at the entrance to the room, lowers a remote control
box.  He grins at Chill.  Chill stares back nervously, clearly
frightened by The Joker's maniacal presence.

CHILL
I was...headed for the airport.
They said you wanted to see me.
Something...wrong?

JOKER
Wrong?  I thought we'd celebrate.  I
thought you'd like to join me in a
drink.

CHILL
(visibly relieved)
Why not...

The Joker leads him to a table, suddenly glowers darkly.

JOKER
You know, I'm disappointed in you,
Joe.  Very disappointed.

CHILL
(swallowing)
You...are?

JOKER
I said, ""Would you like to join me
in a drink.""  Then you're supposed
to say, ""Sure there'll be room
enough for both of us?""
(giggle)
Get it?
(louder giggle)
""Room enough...""

CHILL
Yeah...sure...I get it now...

JOKER
You're a quick study, Joe.

The Joker claps him on the back as they sit at the table.  The
Confederate enters with two glasses on a tray.  One contains a clear
liquid.  The other - a bilious, thick yellow concoction.  The Joker
edges it across the table toward Chill who eyes it suspiciously.

JOKER (CONT'D)
Drink up.

Chill examines the yellow liquid, wary.

CHILL
How come...you ain't drinkin' this...

JOKER
Good question.  I like lemonade...

He takes it from Chill, hands him the clear liquid.  They both down
their drinks.  The Joker giggles insanely.

CHILL
What's...so funny...?

JOKER
Man walks into a doctor's office,
says, ""Are you the doctor's nurse?""
she says, ""Yes.""  He says, ""Oh, is
the doctor sick?""

The Joker slams the table in glee, out of control.

CHILL
No offense, Joker, but that's not
very...

Chill stops.  The corners of his mouth twitch, then rise involuntarily.
He snickers.  Again.  Starts to giggle.  The Joker's eyes narrow.  His
smile becomes cruel.

JOKER
The doctor says, ""I can sure you.  The
disease is hereditary.""  The patient
says, ""Then send the bill to my father.""

Chill instantly explodes with laughter!

JOKER (CONT'D)
He says, ""Help me, Doctor, I've got
amnesia.""  Doctor says, ""How long
have you had it?""  He says, ""How
long have I had what?""

Chill is on his feet now, convulsed in glee.  He sinks to his knees,
out of control, then collapses on the floor.

JOKER (CONT'D)
And this one will kill you!  I just got
back from a pleasure trip.  I drove my
mother-in-law to the airport...

CLOSE ON CHILL

Dead.  His mouth frozen in a grotesque grin.  The Joker stares down
blankly.

JOKER
But seriously, folks...

He looks off, presses the remote control box, activates the sound on
the television again.

CLOSE ON TV

Rupert Thorne leans in with an oily look.

THORNE ON TV
In the meantime, our hearts go out
to the Wayne family, particularly to
their young son, Bruce...

BACK TO JOKER

Watching Thorne.  His face twists into a cruel smile.

THORNE
(thoughtful pause)
And I'd like to think that one day
Thomas Wayne will look down on this
earth and this city and say...

As Thorne and The Joker speak simultaneously.

THORNE & JOKER
""You know what?  I was wrong.  That
Rupert Thorne is one heck of a city
councilman.""

The Joker explodes in laughter!  His terrifying guffaws propel him off
the chair onto the floor.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

A large truck with the logo ""GOTHAM GYMNASTICS"" starts down the
driveway to the gates, moving away from Wayne Manor.

INT. MANOR EXERCISE ROOM - DAT

Alfred and Bruce stand in a newly outfitted exercise room.  The
equipment has been expertly installed: rings, parallel bars, balancing
beam, weight machines, etc.  Bruce is in a T-shirt and shorts.  He
gazes at the impressive array.

ALFRED
One hardly knows where to begin.

BRUCE
Those rings seem simple enough.

Bruce crosses to the rings, leaps, catches hold, tries to hoist himself
up.  His eyes bulge!  He tries again, then drops to the floor in a
heap.

ALFRED
Perhaps if we lowered them.

BRUCE
(grim stare)
If you'll excuse me now, Alfred.
I'll see you at dinner.

ALFRED
Yes, Sir.

Alfred leaves, closing the door.  Bruce turns, glares up at the rings
like deadly enemies.  He jumps again, catches hold, starts to hoist
himself up, straining with the effort.  The veins standing out on his
forehead.  Slowly, painfully, he begins to inch himself higher and
higher.

INT KARATE STUDIO - DAY

Bruce is dressed in a martial arts outfit, tensely faces a thick pine
board being held by a Japanese INSTRUCTOR.

INSTRUCTOR
...but you must believe, really
believe you can do it.  The mind
is more powerful than the fist, and
the fist is more powerful than the
board.  Understood?

Bruce nods earnestly, sets himself.  With a blood-curdling SCREAM -- he
lashes out!  Then - an instantaneous second SCREAM as his fist crumples
against the unyielding board.

INSTRUCTOR (CONT'D)
Let's go over it again...

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - SUNRISE

A tree-lined winding road at dawn.  Bruce jogs along easily, his right
hand encased in a plaster cast.  Jogging next to him, huffing and
puffing: an exhausted FRENCH PROFESSOR.

BRUCE
I am happy...

FRENCH PROFESSOR
(panting)
Je suis heureux...

BRUCE
Je suis heureux...to make your
acquaintance.

FRENCH PROFESSOR
(gasping)
De...faire votre connaissance...

BRUCE
De faire votre connaissance...

Bruce looks ahead toward a bend in the road.  Alfred stands by the
Rolls Royce, checking his watch.  The spent Professor peels off to the
side as Bruce continues on.

BRUCE
Merci, mon Professeur!  Tommorrow at
Six again, okay?

The Professor manages a feeble wave, collapses by the side of the road
in front of Alfred who administers a thermos of hot coffee and a
croissant to the stricken man.

ANGLE AROUND OTHER SIDE OF BEND.

Another jogger has joined Bruce around the bend - an older man, his
bearded RUSSIAN PROFESSOR.

BRUCE
Dobroye utro, Boris...I am happy...

BORIS
Ochen priyatno...

BRUCE
Ochen priyatno...To make your
acquaintance.

BORIS
Vam...poznakomit...

The two of them jog off into the distance.

BORIS' VOICE
(already winded)
Bozhe moy!...

EXT. WAYNE MANOR LAWN - DAY

Bruce stands facing a large, brightly colored archery target on the
lawn of Wayne Manor.  From O.S., behind his back, WE HEAR A WHIRRING
SOUND.

CLOSE ON ARROW GUN

A gleaming STEEL ARROW ""clicks"" into the firing slot of an automatic-
fire Gatling Gun device.  Suddenly - it fires!

BACK TO BRUCE

Wheeling around to face the on-rushing whizzing arrow - lifting a
heavily padded hand to catch it in mid-air!

HE MISSES!  The arrow ""thunks"" into his chest, directly over his heart!
Bruce sighs, removes the arrow, jerking it out of his hidden protective
vest.

BRUCE
Darn...

ANOTHER ARROW whizzes at him!  Bruce drops to one knee, this time
almost catching it as the steel tip rips away a piece of the heavy
padding on his hand.

CLOSE ON ALFRED AT WINDOW

Alfred watches from a window, shaking his head, appalled, now returns
to his housekeeping.

INT. EXERCISE ROOM - DAY

Bruce is on the rings again.  By now using them with considerable
expertise, swinging his body in somersaults, then performing the
difficult ""Iron Cross"" maneuver.  He pauses at full extension, then
swings back, launches himself towards the parallel bars.

Catching the bars expertly, he performs a complicated routine, pausing
at the top to look across the room:

A thin balance beam sits below, ten feet away.

Bruce swings back one more time on the upper parallel bar, then flies
through the air for the beam!  His feet land on top for one split,
tenuous second.  He teeters - then crashes heavily to the floor.
Shaking his head to clear the cobwebs, he stares back at the beam,
determined.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

Alfred exits the rear of Wayne Manor onto the lawn, looks around,
mystified.

ALFRED
Master Bruce?  Luncheon is served!

Alfred hears a CUMBLING SOUND, looks up as a piece of brick falls,
narrowly missing him.

ANGLE ON BRUCE - ALFRED'S P.O.V.

Bruce is scaling the side of the house!  A thick rope encircles the
chimney of Wayne Manor as Bruce makes his way up the structure, hand
over hand.  Suddenly:  the old brick chimney STARTS TO CRUMBLE!  The
rope jerks free as bricks fly everywhere and Bruce tumbles heavily down
to the lawn at Alfred'' feet.

Bruce looks up, grins sheepishly.  Alfred glances back up at the
demolished chimney, then back down at Bruce again.

ALFRED
Santa will be heartbroken.

INT. KARATE STUDIO - DAY

A TERRIFYING SCREAM!  A PINE BOARD is smashed to smithereens by a
lightning-quick fist!

Bruce wheels to FACE CAMERA.  HE IS NOW SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD.  Cool,
clear eyes flick in the opposite direction as:

Two STUDENTS charge him!  He flips one over his head, flips the other
while simultaneously spinning around to face the Instructor who closes
ranks from behind.

The fight is furiously expert - hands and feet working like windmills.
Bruce is parrying every thrust the
Instructor has to offer, countering every move, but is nonetheless
being backed into a corner.

The Instructor moves in for the kill as Bruce suddenly vaults up and
over him in a seven-foot backflip!  Grabbing the man's black belt from
behind for leverage, he hoists the Instructor over his head, then sends
the bewildered man flying through the air, crashing onto the mat in a
heap.

Bruce looks over, suddenly concerned.  He holds the Instructor's black
belt in his hands.  The Instructor is half-dazed, in some pain.  His
eyes suddenly pop open - he grins broadly back at Bruce.

INSTRUCTOR
That's okay.  Keep it.

INT. BALLET STUDIO - DAY

A line of beautiful young would-be BALLERINAS perform the various
positions at the bar in a dance studio to the musical strains of Swan
Lake.  A stern INSTRUCTRESS supervises, barking out the numbers.

CAMERA TRACKS past the female figures at the bar.  In the middle of the
line, dressed in tight and a T-shirt - Bruce Wayne.  Perspiring
heavily, he performs the set routine with amazing grace.  A gorgeous
DANCER looks over her shoulder at him, whispers under her breath.

GIRL DANCER
Any of the guys ever make fun of
you?

BRUCE
(nice smile)
One guy.  Once.

INT. BROKERAGE FIRM - DAY

A stock ticker jumps to life.  CAMERA PANS the oak-panelled walls of a
room, PAST portrait paintings of sever-looking BROKERS in three-piece
suits.

BROKER'S VOICE
...the sizeable trust fund left you
by your father, the late Dr. Thomas
Wayne.  Now we admit that young
Bruce here has made a few lucky
guesses in the past..

CAMERA HOLDS on a board room conference table:  two impeccably turned-
out BROKERS face Alfred and Bruce.

BROKER (CONT'D)
...but the time has come for us to
insist on control.  We appeal to
you, Mr. Pennyworth, as the executor
of this estate.

ALFRED
It was Dr. Wayne's intention for his
son to achieve self-reliance at the
earliest possible age.  With that in
mind, I suggest you accept the lad's
""lucky guesses"" as instructions.

BRUCE
Let's hold on to our oil stocks for
now.  I see a chance of gasoline
prices rising to sixty, even seventy
cents a gallon.

BROKER
(tolerant smile)
Why not a dollar?

BRUCE
And I'd like to transfer our mutual
funds into the development of the
computer chip.  I've been experi-
menting with them, and...

BROKER
Computer...

BRUCE
Chip.

BROKER #2
Sounds like an after-school snack
for machines.  Anything else?

BRUCE
As a matter of fact, there is.
Yesterday, I had this most delicious
hamburger at this new little place
called MacDonald's...

The two Brokers exchange a totally exasperated look.

EXT. MONUMENT VALLEY - DAY

CAMERA PANS a campsite with pup tents and a burnt-out campfire to a van
featuring the logo: Gotham High School Mountaineering Club.

ANGLE ON ROCK NEEDLE

A towering needle-like rock shoots up from the desert floor.  CAMERA
PUSHES IN:  we see the outlines of THREE CLIMBERS connected by a rope,
halfway up he jagged face.

CLOSE ON CLIMBERS

The wind howls.  The FIRST CLIMBER drives a piton into the rock face,
attaches his line, looks down.

TWO CLIMBERS below struggle mightily.  The drop to the desert floor
beneath is dizzying.  Climber #2 looks up.

CLIMBER #2
Don't look down, for Chrissake!

CLIMBER #1
I'm trying to see if I can spot
Bruce...

CLIMBER #2
Will you forget about him?  He wan-
dered off, that's all - in one of
his famous moods.

CLIMBER #1
(drives in piton)
Who knows?  Maybe the great Bruce
Wayne finally found something he's
too scared to tackle...

ANGLE ON ROCK NEEDLE - HELICOPTER SHOT

HELICOPTER ZOOMS UP and around to the far side of the needle - one lone
figure struggles up the absolutely sheer opposite face of the cliff, a
few feet from the top.

CLOSE ON BRUCE

His jaw set - eyes clear.  The bitter wind whips through his hair.  He
drives in his final piton, hoists himself up onto the tiny circular
crest of the needle.

HELICOPTER CAMERA RISES.  The majestic valley spreads out below us.  In
the center - the lonely figure of Bruce Wayne - self-reliance and
victory personified.

INT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

It is late.  Alfred relaxes in an easy chair, reading an edition of the
Gotham Tribune.

The headline screams:  JOKER STEALS KALAHARI DIAMOND - Master of Mirth
Strikes Again.

Alfred puts down the paper, stifling a yawn.  He hears A MUTED VOICE
from upstairs, rises curiously.

INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bruce is spread-eagled on the bed, fully clothed - fast asleep.  A
VOICE drones from a bedside tape recorder.

TAPE VOICE
An atom with a magnetic dipole ex-
posed to a nonuniform magnetic field
undergoes a linear force in addition
to its tendency toward orientation...

Alfred stops in the doorway with a sympathetic look.

TAPE VOICE (CONT'D)
The use of an atomic beam makes
possible an observation of an
induced transition...

Alfred switches off the tape, adjusts a quilted coverlet over Bruce
with a paternal smile.

INT. EXERCISE ROOM - DAY

CAMERA PANS past the balancing beam, parallel bars, and exercise rings
to Bruce, who faces them confidently, but this time with a big
difference - HE IS BLINDFOLDED.  He takes a tentative step forward,
gauging his distance, then leaps up into the air - grabbing the rings
with perfect accuracy!  He performs a series of difficult routines with
clockwork precision, then swings through the air to the parallel bars,
latching on to the lower one, then propelling himself up to the higher
one.  His gyrations become faster, gaining speed and momentum.
Suddenly - he launches himself toward the balance beam!

Bruce lands on the end of the beam like a cat - keeping his balance,
having calculated the exact distance to the inch.  He steps forward
with total security, travels the length of the beam with the ease of a
pedestrian.  Reaching the end, he does a complete forward somersault,
lands solidly on his feet.  Bruce removes his blindfold, stares back at
the path he's just taken, amazed by himself.

ALFRED'S VOICE
Incredible!

Bruce turns.  A proud Alfred beams from the doorway.

ALFRED
Why, you were blind as a bat, Sir.

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Bruce's grinning face as WE HEAR:

PRINCIPAL'S VOICE
...many talented, successful gradu-
ates of Gotham High, but none like
this young man.  Holder of the
highest scholastic average in the
history of the school...

EXT. GOTHAM HIGH SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

CAMERA PANS the front lawn of Gotham High School.  It is Graduation
Day.  STUDENTS and proud PARENTS sit in chairs facing a rostrum, from
where the PRINCIPAL speaks:

PRINCIPAL
...eight athletic letters and
Captain of five teams, your Class
Valedictorian - Bruce Wayne!

Applause.  Bruce rises in his cap and gown, makes his way to the
rostrum.  A confident presence glows behind his clear eyes.  A self-
assuredness without ego.  A natural grace which exudes the maturity of
a man twice his age.  CAMERA PANS TO the figure of Alfred, who beams
with pride.

BRUCE
Thank you, Principal Peters.  Fellow
students, welcome parents, honored
faculty and guests...

EXT. BACK FO SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

Bruce hurries down the steps in his black cap and gown, diploma in
hand.  A pretty COED (CINDY) passes.

CINDY
Great speech, Bruce.  I sure hope
you're coming to Deedee's tonight...

BRUCE
Thanks, Cindy, but I don't think I
can make it.  Marshall McLuhan is
giving a talk at the University.

CINDY
Bruce...

He turns.  Cindy looks at him shyly, then moves closer.

CINDY (CONT'D)
I...hope you don't mind me saying
this, Bruce, but...well, I guess all
the girls feel the same way...

BRUCE
Feel...?

CINDY
It's just that everybody thinks
you're great...great looking and
everything...but you never seem to
have time for any...fun.

BRUCE
Fun?  What...kind of fun?

Cindy stares into his eyes with a mixture of hunger and innocence.  She
leans in, kisses him softly and deeply on the mouth.  Bruce's eyes
bulge with surprise, then slowly flutter shut.  They finally break.

CINDY
(passionate whisper)
275...7634...

Bruce smiles, slides by, heads down the steps.  Cindy watches
wistfully.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - DAY

The Rolls Royce makes its way through the crowded streets.

INT. ROLLS ROYCE - DAY

Bruce stares out the window.  Alfred drives on, takes a small notebook
from his pocket, reads.

ALFRED
You have your guitar lesson at four,
following which, you wanted time to
finish your article for The Scien-
tific American.  Tonight, Marshall
McLuhan lectures at...

Alfred stops.  Bruce is lost in another world.

ALFRED (CONT'D)
Are you all right, Sir?

BRUCE
Hmm?

Bruce turns from the window.  Alfred notices something.

ALFRED
Is that blood on your lip?

Bruce frowns curiously.  He wipes his lip with his finger, then licks
it thoughtfully.

BRUCE
Lipstick.

ALFRED
(shocked)
Lipstick?

BRUCE
Lipstick.

Alfred smiles uncomfortably.  The Rolls stops at a light.  Bruce
notices something out the window.

ANGLE OF SHOWROOM - HIS P.O.V.

An elegant foreign car showroom.  In the window, its front grill
grinning back at Bruce - a BRIGHT RED FERRARI.

BACK TO ROLLS ROYCE.

BRUCE
(muttering)
275-7634...

ALFRED
Beg pardon?

BRUCE
Do you know what's wrong with me,
Alfred?

ALFRED
I can't imagine a thing, Sir.

BRUCE
I never have time for any fun.

EXT. BEACH - DAWN

The first orange rays of the sun stab upwards through the clouds in a
brilliant sunrise.  The bright red Ferrari is parked in the sand on the
top of a high dune.  The VOICES of BRUCE and CINDY drift up from below.

BRUCE'S VOICE
(sleepy; affectionate)
Good morning...

CINDY'S VOICE
Mmm...

BRUCE'S VOICE
Want to go for a swim?

CINDY'S VOICE
(pleased)
I don't think I can walk...
(soft purr)
Where'd you learn to do all that?

BRUCE'S VOICE
Here.  Last night.  It's strange,
but once I get the hang of something
I just can't seem to stop.
(beat)
Sorry.

CINDY'S VOICE
(dreamy)
Oh...that's okay...

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Ferrari as the ROAR of a powerful racing engine is
heard, gather in intensity.

EXT. GOTHAM RACETRACK - DAY

A gleaming red Formula One racing car ROARS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE to
the waving of a black-checkered flag and the WILD CHEERS of the CROWD.

ANGLE ON WINNER'S CIRCLE

WE SEE THE ADULT BRUCE WAYNE sitting in his racing machine, holding up
a trophy under a banner:  WINNER - GOTHAM 500.

Flashbulbs pop!  FANS cheer!  A BUXOM MISS GOTHAM leans in to pose for
pictures with Bruce and share champagne from the trophy cup.  A
disgruntled MARIO ANDRETTI elbows his way through the throng to shake
hands with the winner.

MARIO ANDRETTI
Hell of a race, Bruce.

BRUCE
Thanks, Mario.

ANDRETTI
Remember how you told me this was
just a hobby?  Well keep it that way
and let the rest of us make a
living, okay?

Miss Gotham leans in, hugs Bruce tightly, giggles, then whispers
something in his ear.  Bruce looks up.

BRUCE
(at Miss Gotham)
That's your hobby?
(grins)
No kidding.

INSERT SHOT - GOTHAM TRIBUNE

The Gotham Tribune cartwheels INTO FRAME:  The headline reads:
PRESIDENT DECLARED - I AM NOT A CROOK!

Farther down the page is a smaller headline, reading:  BRUCE WAYNE
DECLARES - I AM NOT THE FATHER!  Millionaire playboy cleared in Miss
Gotham paternity suit.

EXT. GOTHAM COURTHOUSE - DAY

A throng a REPORTERS waits with a predominantly FEMALE CROWD at the
entrance to Gotham Courthouse.

Bruce suddenly appears in the Courthouse doorway as a LOUD CHEER rises
from the Female Crowd.  He elbows his way through them, Alfred at his
side.  FLASHBULBS POP!  The Women scream and reach out at him, trying
to tear off a souvenir.  REPORTERS yell overlapping questions.

BRUCE
Sorry, no comment.  Sorry...

ALFRED
(at hysterical Woman)
Madame, do try to compose yourself...

They reach the sidewalk and the car.  Alfred heads for the front door
as Bruce jostles his way inside the back.

INT. ROLLS - DAY

Bruce slams the door shut behind him, turns, stops, stares:  Already
sitting in the back seat is a beautiful FEMALE REPORTER, legs crossed,
perfectly composed, with a portable tape recorder settled on her lap.

REPORTER
Ann Daniel.  Gotham Tribune.

BRUCE
(reaching for door handle)
Bruce Wayne.  Nice to have met you.

He tries the door - there's another scream from the Female Crowd who
press around the car anticipating his exit.  Two ANGRY FEMINISTS raise
protesting placards threateningly as Bruce slams the door shut again.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
(at Alfred)
Go.

EXT. STREET - DAY

The Rolls lurches its way out of the Crowd into traffic.

INT. ROLLS - DAY

Bruce stares ahead in silence.  ANN studies him with a wry smile, then
pushes the ""record"" button on her machine.

BRUCE
Are you going to play some music?

ANN
You know what they say about Bruce
Wayne?
(no response)
That he's idle and jaded, with no
ambition left - because there's
nothing he hasn't done and been the
best at.

BRUCE
Sounds like a pretty boring guy.

ANN
What haven't you done, Mr. Wayne?
Cured cancer?  Climbed Everest?
(no response)
You climbed Everest?

Bruce smiles, reaches out, punches off the recorder.

ANN (CONT'D)
That's...not much of an exclusive.

BRUCE
What did you have in mind?

ANN
Something slightly more...in depth.

BRUCE
Sort of like - ""A Day in the Life
of Bruce Wayne?""

ANN
Exactly.  You just go ahead and do
whatever you'd be doing naturally -
only make me a part of it.

BRUCE
Miss Daniel - I'll do my level best
to accommodate you.

INT. ANN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

CAMERA CLOSE on Ann's sleeping face as she lies naked in bed, her
features locked in a dreamy smile.  She sighs contentedly as HER OWN
VOICE IS HEARD from across the room.

ANN'S VOICE
...because there's nothing he hasn't
done and been the best at...

Bruce stands at the bedroom window, staring down absent-mindedly into
the street as he finishes dressing.  A LOUD CLAP OF THUNDER rolls
across the city.

BRUCE'S VOICE
(from tape)
Sounds like a pretty boring guy.

Bruce punches off the recorder, then presses ""rewind.""  He looks over
at Ann's sleeping body, then down at the recorder again.  He stops it,
then presses ""play.""

ANN'S VOICE
(from tape)
...he's idle and jaded with no ambi-
tion left...

Bruce smiles to himself bitterly, exits silently.

EXT. APARTMENT STREET - NIGHT

Bruce crosses the street to a gleaming Aston-Martin sportscar.  ANOTHER
THUNDER CLAP!  Rain falls as he reaches into the car, takes out a
topcoat and hat.  He starts to pull the convertible top up, glances
down the street:

PEOPLE scurry to avoid the rain.  Down the block, across the street, a
COUPLE with a YOUNG DAUGHTER look over nervously as a tough-looking
BIKER on a huge Harley-Davidson rolls up parallel to them on the
street.

BACK TO BRUCE

Adjusting the convertible top.  Looking off again.

BACK TO BRUCE'S P.O.V.

Suddenly:  the Biker hops the curb in front of the Family!  Pulling a
gun, he herds them back into a dark alleyway.

BACK TO BRUCE

Eyes narrowing.  His jaw twitches.  A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT!  Bruce
explodes across the street for the alleyway.

As Bruce arrives:  the Young Girl bursts out screaming, runs past him.
Bruce hesitates, then runs inside the alley.

ANGLE IN ALLEYWAY

The Man lies in the alley, being cradled by the Woman.  Blood oozes
from the side of his head Bruce arrives.

WOMAN
I...think he'll be all right.  Our
daughter's run to call an ambulance.

Bruce hears the REVVING of a motorcycle.  He looks off down the alley,
eyes flashing with anger.

ANGLE DOWN ALLEY - HIS P.O.V.

The Biker grins at him from the far end of the alley, puts his Harley
in gear, rolls off through the pouring rain.

BACK TO BRUCE

He makes his decision, takes off in pursuit.

WOMAN
Careful!  He's got a gun!

EXT. END OF ALLEYWAY

Bruce arrives at the alley corner, looks off:

ANGLE ON BIKER - HIS P.O.V.

The Biker hovers by the side of an apartment building, still grinning
at Bruce through the rain.  He rolls forward slowly, almost as if
enticing Bruce to follow him, now disappears again.

BACK TO BRUCE

Bruce arrives at the rear of the building, which faces on a vacant dirt
lot.  He edges forward through the mud, turning the corner, suddenly
coming face to face with:

The Biker.  Still grinning.  Switching off his Harley.  Muscles bulging
through his wet T-shirt as he dismounts.

BIKER
Congratulations, man.
(wide smile)
You caught me.  Matter of fact...

The ROAR OF ENGINES is HEARD!  Bruce turns to see:  TWO MORE BIKERS,
rolling into position behind him.  Bruce is hopelessly trapped.

BIKER (CONT'D)
...you caught all of us...

The other two Bikers now dismount and close in.  The first Biker draws
his gun.  Biker #2 looks Bruce up and down critically, squinting at him
through the rain.

BIKER #2
That's my raincoat you're wearing.
Take it off.

Biker #2 snaps his arm forward - a switchblade appears in his hand.  He
flicks it at Bruce who stands his ground, slicing a button off the
front of his raincoat.

BIKER #2 (CONT'D)
Pick up the button, Wimpy.  Then
lick it clean and hand me my coat.

Bruce stares icily, then slowly bends down to retrieve the button from
the mud.  Suddenly:  Biker #1's foot flashes INTO FRAME, headed
straight at Bruce's face!  In a lightning-quick move, Bruce grabs the
swinging leg with both hands, rises, swings Biker #1 off the ground in
a circle, sends him crashing into the motorcycles as his gun goes
flying.

Biker #2, switchblade in hand, rushes Bruce.  Biker #3 unhooks chains
from his belt.  Bruce sidesteps:  the knife slashes through his
raincoat, sending it billowing out behind him like a cape!  Biker #3
whistles the chains past Bruce's ear:  He snatches them, karate-kicks
Biker #3 in the stomach, simultaneously belting Biker #2 across the
side of the head with the chains, knocking him unconscious.

Biker #3 lunges at Bruce from behind!  Bruce spins, grabbing his arm,
twisting the knife away, catching it in his other hand as he trips
Biker #3, sends him sprawling in the mud.  Bruce now straddles him,
knife in hand.

CLOSE ON BIKER #3

Blinking in fear, his head pressed into the mud next to the button.

BRUCE
Your turn to pick up the button,
scumbag...

Biker #3's arm slowly starts forward as Bruce steps on it.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
With your mouth.

Biker #3 shuts his eyes in humiliation as:  THE SOUND OF A SIREN IS
HEARD!

ANGLE ON SIDE OF BUILDING

TWO POLICEMEN round the corner of the apartment building, now stop,
stare in astonished silence at:

The Three Bikers, sprawled in the mud near their machines.  Bruce has
completely disappeared.

EXT. ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

A paramedic van is parked at the entrance.  Umbrella-holding ONLOOKERS
watch.  A gurney with the wounded Man is wheeled out.  The Woman and
the Young Girl follow.

Bruce appears at the edge of the crowd, collar still up, hat adjusted
low over his face  He stares.

The Paramedics stop.  One leans down, examines the Man, then covers his
face with the sheet.  The Woman turns away in silence.  The Young Girl
clings to her.

Bruce watches,  his eyes filled with tears.  He turns, walks off as
CAMERA RACKS FOCUS to the pouring rain.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

CAMERA RACKS BACK from the rain to Bruce, standing by the Aston-Martin
in front of Wayne Manor.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bruce enters the empty living room.  His expression is numb.  He
pauses, lost in thought.  Then, moving as if by instinct, he heads for
the stairs leading to the basement.

INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Bruce descends the stairs, walks down the hallway to a door.  He stops,
looks down at the heavy padlock which seals it shut.  His eyes close in
pain, remembering an earlier time.

INT. YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - NIGHT

Seen through dim half-light:  his childhood lab is coated with dust - a
room obviously left unused for years.  We hear A KEY TURNING IN THE
LOCK.  The door to the lab swings open.  Bruce trains a flashlight on
the interior of the musty room.  He enters, finds a light switch, flips
it on.

The lab table is much as we remember it, crammed with old test tubes,
beakers, etc.  Bruce crosses, stares down, lost in his past, then
switches on the holograph machine.  He stares - stunned and amazed as:

THE HOLOGRAPH FIGURE OF TEN-YEAR-OLD BRUCE WAYNE SPRINGS TO LIFE!  An
exact visual reproduction of the Child who used to be.  The Young Boy
peers down through a cobwebbed microscope in precisely the position we
first saw him.

Bruce's eyes fill with tears - he shuts them tightly as he hears a
VOICE from long ago.

YOUNG BRUCE'S VOICE
It's called a holograph, Dad.
Pretty neat, huh?

One laser beam suddenly shorts out with age:  the image of Young Bruce
disappears.  The second beam continues to burn, its energy directed at
a disintegrating basement wall.

Bruce slumps at the other side of the table, oblivious, his face buried
in his hands.

OVERLAPPING IMAGES AND VOICE START TO APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.

Martha Wayne			   - giggling with Young Bruce, then kissing
her husband passionately.

DR. WAYNE'S VOICE
This - is definitely not a guy.

Thomas Wayne			  - his face twisted in anguish as Chill's
bullet blows.

MARTHA'S VOICE
Oh, my God!  No!!

A SHARP CRACK!	    - As a piece of something crumbles away.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

Looking up.  Staring across the room:

The remaining laser beam has eaten away a piece of the basement wall -
there is a dull ECHOING THUD as the plaster hits the bottom of some
unseen cavernous space below.

BACK TO BRUCE

Rising.  Crossing curiously to the hole in the wall.  Training his
flashlight torch through it.

ANGLE DOWN HOLE - HIS P.O.V.

AN IMMENSE CAVERN trails down and away into the blackness.  A network
of aged timbers intersect themselves, shoring up the side of the
foundation.

BACK TO BRUCE

Staring.  Playing his flashlight against the visible parts of the
underground cavity.  He picks up a beaker from the lab table, then lets
it fall through the hole.  There is an interminable wait.  Finally -
the impact of SHATTERING GLASS.

ANGLE BACK THROUGH HOLE

Seen from inside:  the torch beam shines.  Suddenly - a long length of
rope is tossed through.  Bruce appears in the opening.  He wriggles
through, hanging on to the rope.

Bruce expertly shimmies down the rope, a man completely at home in an
action he knows well.  The beam from the torch dances across the walls
of the cavern:  high-ribbed, jagged walls, suggesting some sort of
labyrinth beyond.  The rope has played out.  Bruce hangs by the end,
looks down, lets himself fall to the cavern floor below.

He rises, plays the torch against the sides of the cave.

ANGLE ON BEAM - HIS P.O.V.

The beam searches into crannies, exploring dark gray walls.  It comes
across a large patch of solid black.

BACK TO BRUCE

Looking curiously.

BACK TO BLACK PATCH

As the beam hits the black patch fully - dozens of yellow eyes appear.
The entire mass LAUNCHES ITSELF INTO CAMERA with a terrifying screech
and the sound of beating wings.

BACK TO BRUCE

His jaw drops, stunned, as THE COLONY OF BATS swarm over him!  He
stumbles, protecting his face.  The torch drops to the floor.  Its
shaft of light dances crazily around the cavern.

From O.S. - a low moan is heard from Bruce.  It rises, gathers in
volume and intensity, gradually becoming a deep, booming guttural roar
- at once a scream of total pain and a cry of defiance.  The terrified
bats scream back in a maze of hot and cold light bouncing off beating
black wings.

INT. ALFRED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The wind and rain batter against Alfred's partially open bedroom
window.  Mixed with the sounds - a strong echo of the roar from the
cavern.  Alfred's eyes pop open.  He rises groggily, makes his way to
the window, closes it.  CAMERA HOLDS on window, PANS UP to the moon.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

EXT. CEMETERY - CLOSE ON MOON - NIGHT

A FLASHING LIGHTNING BOLT:  CAMERA PANS DOWN from the moon through the
raging storm to the graves of Thomas and Martha Wayne in the country
cemetery, high on the hill.

Kneeling between them is Bruce - fists clenched, head bowed, tiny
rivulets of water running off his face and body - totally lost in
silent prayer.

BRUCE'S VOICE
I've worked hard to make you proud of
me.  To become the kind of person
whose presence could make a difference
in the world.  But one man can only do
only so much, Father.  Mother, to-
night I saw the sign I thought would
never come.  Now - for the first time
I realize I must...be...more...than
a man.

A FLASHING LIGHTNING BOLT WIPES THE SCREEN!

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

EXT. GOTHAM SKY - NIGHT

The remaining gossamer wisp of a transparent cloud pulls away from a
glowing FULL MOON over Gotham City.

INT. GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

An express train roars through a seedy subway station.

INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

A well-scrubbed TEENAGE COUPLE sit together holding hands.  The BOY is
dressed in a dinner jacket, the GIRL is a chiffon party dress with a
prominent orchid corsage pinned to it.  They exchange a nervous glance,
looking across the car at:

A TOUGH-LOOKING THUG who sits opposite them, his muscular arms bulging
through a torn windbreaker.  He grins across at the nervous Teenagers
menacingly, exposing yellow teeth, then sneaks a sideways look at:  A
THICKLY-BUILT TRUCKDRIVER-TYPE who stares straight ahead.

These are the only four people in the car.

The subway slows for the next stop.  The Truckdriver-Type rises
disinterestedly, crosses the car, looks down at the Teenagers who are
none too happy with his departure.

TRUCKDRIVER-TYPE
Have a nice time at the prom, kids?

BOY
Yes, thank you, Sir.

The subway doors hiss open.  The Truckdriver-Type smiles and exits.
The Teenagers looks across the car worried.

The car pulls out of the station.  The Thug rises, crosses the car,
grabs hold of a vertical pole to steady himself, smirks down at the
Teenagers.

THUG
You smell good enough to eat, Sweet-
heart.

BOY
(nervous bravado)
If you've got something to say,
Mister, talk to me, okay?

THUG
I was talking to you - Sweetheart.

A knife drops out of the Thug's sleeve into his hand, its razor-sharp
blade glinting in the light.  The Teenagers freeze with terror.

THUG (CONT'D)
Maybe it's that flower that smells
so good.

The Thug plucks the corsage off the trembling Girl's bodice, holds it
up to his nose, inhales deeply, shaking his head.

THUG (CONT'D)
Nope.  Still can't place it.

VOICE
Funny.  I can smell you from way
over here.

The Thug wheels, stares off at the end of the car, his jaw dropping
open.  The Teenagers' eyes bulge in disbelief.

CLOSE ON CHEST

A golden circle with the black figure of a bat sits in the middle of a
steel-gray skin-tight fabric stretched across a massively muscled
chest.

VOICE
Give the lady back her flower.

BACK TO SCENE

The Thug looks his unseen adversary up and down cautiously, unsure of
whether to laugh or obey.

THUG
Okay...sure.  Just wanted to have a
little fun.  I...

With a sudden lightning move he flips the switchblade in his hand,
sending it whizzing in the direction of the Voice.

CLOSE ON KNIFE

The knife whistles through the air TOWARD CAMERA.  Suddenly a black-
gloved hand miraculously snatches it out of mid-air, spinning it, then
sends it flying back!
The switchblade pierces the corsage, jerking it out of the Thug's hand,
sticking it into the wall where it quivers behind him.  The Thug
freezes, turning white.

VOICE
Now then.  I think you said you
wanted to have a little fun.

EXT. GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

The express wheezes to a stop at the next station.  A MIDDLE-AGED
COUPLE waits for the doors to open, then enter the car.  They suddenly
stop, staring in amazement:

The Thug stands spread-eagled in the middle of the car, both wrists
cuffed to overhanging metal handholds.  The center vertical pole
disappears up one pants leg, finally reappearing out of the collar of
his shirt.

The teenage Boy passes the amazed Couple, confidently dusting his
hands.  He reaches back for the Girl who sniffs her corsage, then
follows him out of the car.

EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Gotham Police Headquarters.  CAMERA TRACKS PAST cubicles and offices,
CLACKING, RINGING, DETECTIVES interrogating SUSPECTS, etc., catching up
with DAVID GORDON, the Commissioner of Police, a gruff-looking man in
his middle fifties who pauses to light a cheap cigarette.

Heading toward him from the other direction:  SERGEANT HALEY, a smooth-
faced kissass in his thirties.

GORDON
What's up Haley?

HALEY
Pretty slow, Commissioner.  Half a
dozen muggings, some kids on PCP,
and...oh, yeah.  Looks like we got a
transvestite prowling the southside
subway system.

GORDON
Full moon tonight.  Pervo heaven.

Gordon walks through his office door, Haley following.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The extremely cluttered office of an immensely overworked civil
servant.

HALEY
From his description, this guy could
make it as a float in the Rose
Parade.  Big black cape, black
boots, black hood over his head...

A squawk box intercom crackles on Gordon's desk.

INTERCOM VOICE
Hostage situation, Commissioner.
Man holding two women near 3rd and
Grand.  SWAT's on the way.

HALEY
...and get this - a big yellow moon
on his chest with a cockamamy bat in
the middle.

GORDON
(into intercom)
Get my car.  I'm going down there.

HALEY
Funny thing is, the guy takes on
this big goon with a knife...

GORDON
(chomping cigar)
You come along too, Haley.  I may need
to swap someone for those women.

EXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY & STREET - NIGHT

Police cars barricade a major avenue, their spotlights trained on a
dead-end alley.  A SWAT LIEUTENANT speaks through a mike.

SWAT LT.
Come on out of there, Wells!  Come
out of we're coming in after you!

WELLS' VOICE
I got hostages!  You get one minute
to clear out or I blow'em away!

From behind:  Commissioner Gordon's car screeches to a stop.  Gordon
piles out, followed by Haley.

GORDON
How bad is it, Lieutenant?

SWAT LT.
We're screwed, Sir.  That's a dead-
end alley in there.  No way to get
behind him.

EXT. DEAD-END ALLEY

A pockmarked thug (WELLS) holds one YOUNG WOMAN roughly, trains his gun
on ANOTHER.  He squints out into the light.

WELLS
Thirty seconds, Pig!  Then I spill
one lady's brains on the street!
Twenty-five...

CAMERA PANS DOWN to the pavement behind Wells.

WELLS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Twenty!...

A manhole cover rises, moves aside silently.

WELLS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Fifteen!...

BACK TO WELLS

WELLS (CONT'D)
Ten!...

WOMAN
No!  Please!

Wells cocks the gun, sticks it at her head.

WELLS
Five!  Four!...

VOICE
Three...two...one...

Wells spins in astonishment:

An ominous hulking shadow looms in the darkness behind him.  TWO
PULSATING YELLOW EYES pierce through the blackness.

VOICE
I just counted you out, Wells.

Wells fires!  The Shadow swings the manhole cover up as the bullet
ricochets off it harmlessly.  Wells prepares to fire again.  The
manhole cover suddenly explodes out of the darkness!  One swing of a
massively muscled arm - one sickening ""clang"" - and it's over.

ANGLE ON STREET

SWAT LT.
Let's go!

The Police rush toward the alley, Gordon and Haley bringing up the
rear, as the two Women emerge.

WOMAN
WOMAN #2
He saved us!  A giant black							   Eight
fee tall!								   monster from the
sewers!

The Police storm into the alley as Gordon and Haley comfort the panting
Women.

WOMAN
WOMAN #3					    He had black wings...
And...and yellow eyes...

GORDON
Well, of course he did...You can
both calm down now, ladies.  The
nightmare's over...

WOMAN
Huge arms...thick black gloves...

HALEY
(suddenly)
With a bright yellow moon on his
chest?

WOMAN #2
That's right...

HALEY
And a black bat flying right in the
middle of it!

WOMAN
That's right!

The Women are led away by Paramedics.  Haley cocks his head
questioningly at Gordon as they proceed into the alley.

GORDON
Forget it.  That airhead from the
subway could never have made it to
the north side of town this fast.

HALEY
Maybe there's more than one of them.
Maybe we're dealing with some sort
of secret society of cross-dressers.

Wells is led past them, still groggy, as they arrive at the open
manhole and peer down into the forbidding blackness.

GORDON
Get after him, Haley.

HALEY
(gulping)
Me, Sir?

GORDON
Well, you're the only one with an
accurate description!

Haley reluctantly lowers himself into the open manhole as Gordon turns,
yells down the alleyway.

GORDON (CONT'D)
Comb the area!  I want every squad
car available!  We're looking for
the mother of all psychos in a party
costume!

Gordon turns back, looks down into the empty manhole where Haley has
now disappeared.

HALEY'S VOICE
(from manhole)
You don't think he...bites, do you,
Sir?

EXT. GOTHAM APARTMENT HOUSE - HIGH SHOT - NIGHT

CAMERA LOOKS DOWN from the roof of a Gotham skyscraper at the windows
of a forty-story apartment house below.

CAMERA HOLDS on a pair of glass doors leading out to a rosetta-carved
stone balcony.  Clearly visible through the doors:  AN ELDERLY COUPLE
lie face down on the floor of their living room, guarded by a masked
BURGLAR holding a shotgun.  ANOTHER BURGLAR has managed to open a wall
safe and begins stuffing valuables into a gunny sack.

CAMERA ZOOMS BACK!

We are some thirty stories higher across a wide avenue.

A black-gloved hand ENTERS FRAME, holding a thin, clear nylon cord with
a tiny barbed fishhook on the end.

The other gloved hand steadies a gleaming titanium rifle barrel with an
infrared scope.  The fishhook is threaded through the chamber.

A flap is opened in a thick, compartmentalized black belt.  The
moonlight glints off a cylindrical silver gas cartridge.

ANGLE ACROSS STREET THROUGH SCOPE

Seen through the magnified infrared scope:  the cross hairs of the
rifle sight settle in on the head of the Burglar holding the shotgun.

The cross hairs pause - then suddenly lower to the balcony.  The rifle
FIRES with an audible ""hiss"" of compressed gas.

ANGLE ON ROSETTA BALCONY

As the fishhook whistles through a hole in the rosetta stone framework
of the balcony.  On impact with the floor it pops open - expanding to
ten times its size, having now become an effective grappling hook.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

The Burglar with the shotgun turns at the muffled metallic NOISE, looks
through the glass doors at the empty balcony.

EXT. BALCONY FLOOR

The grappling hook inches across the balcony floor, catching a firm
hold against the stone.

EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOF - NIGHT

The nylon cord has been pulled taut - it disappears down into the
blackness at a dizzying height, some four hundred feet above the avenue
and crisscrossing traffic lights below.

Black-gloved hands take hold of the cord, testing it.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

An ominous BLACK SHADOW, cape billowing out behind in an eerie
silhouette, passes in front of the glowing yellow ball of the full
moon.

ANGLE DOWN CORD AT BALCONY

The balcony and double glass doors WHISTLE UP AT CAMERA at a dizzying
speed, growing larger by the millisecond!

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

The Burglar has finished his work at the safe.  He nods to the other
Burglar who grins, then cocks his shotgun, pointing it down at the
helpless Couple on the floor.

The flicker of an outside SHADOW flits across the room - the Burglar
blinks, wheels with his shotgun!

Suddenly:  the double doors explode with a hail of shattering glass!
Almost simultaneously - the shotgun FIRES!

INT. GORDON'S CAR - NIGHT

A surly Gordon looks over as his intercom crackles.

INTERCOM VOICE
Commissioner, this is Sergeant
Havemeyer.  I'm on the fortieth
floor of the Gotham Arms.  Our boy
has struck again.  Cape, boots, hood
-- the whole drill.

GORDON
(snatches intercom)
When?

HAVEMEYER'S VOICE
Just now.  The owners tripped a
silent alarm.  We responded and
heard a gunshot as we were running
down the hallway.  The victims are
fine.  Sonofabitch cold-cocked both
perpetrators.

GORDON
Atta boy, Havemeyer.  Hold him for
questioning till I get there.

HAVEMEYER'S VOICE
Can't do that, Sir.  He's...already
left.

GORDON
But you were right outside the door...

HAVEMEYER'S VOICE
He left...by the window, Sir.

GORDON
By the window?  Goddamnit, Man,
you're on the fortieth floor!

HAVEMEYER'S VOICE
That's...affirmative, Sir.

GORDON
You get back to headquarters pronto,
Mister!  I want your urine checked
for drugs!

HAVEMEYER'S VOICE
Yes, Sir.

Gordon slams down the intercom in disgust.

GORDON
Maybe it's something in the water.
Maybe the whole city's on drugs.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT

Police SIRENS everywhere.  A squad car rolls slowly down the street,
its spotlight searching the doorways and alleys.

INT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT

The COP DRIVER yawns, turns to his PARTNER who works the spotlight, now
notices something.

COP DRIVER
What's that?

PARTNER
Wino...
(out the window)
Go back to sleep, Ace!

Suddenly:  A WHISTLING SOUND through the air!  The two Cops blink, snap
their heads forward as the searchlight is trained on:

ANGLE ON BATMAN - THEIR  P.O.V.

THE BATMAN! - Seen in his majestic totality for the very first time.  A
truly awesome figure from his black cowl to his gleaming black boots.
His huge, dark cape billows out ominously behind him.

BACK TO SQUAD CAR

COP DRIVER
Holee shit...

PARTNER
Let's get him!

BACK TO SCENE

The squad car lurches forward!  Batman whirls, runs down an alley.  The
squad car swings, pulls in after him.

INT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Batman runs with the speed of an Olympic sprinter, but the squad car
gains rapidly.  He looks over his shoulder.

ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - HIS P.O.V.

The squad car fills the alleyway.

BACK TO BATMAN

He looks in front of him in horror - another squad car speed at him
from the other direction.  It too fills the alleyway.  There's no place
to hide.

ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR #1

Filling frame - the Cops grinning.

ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR #2

Filling frame - the Cops grinning.

BACK TO BATMAN

He stands his ground.  Then - curiously - runs directly at the first
squad car.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD - SQUAD CAR #1

COP #1
What the...?

BACK TO BATMAN - SLOW MOTION SHOT

With a perfectly timed leap, Batman vaults onto the hood of the car in
a somersault and does a complete 360 - up the windshield - over the
roof - off the trunk - lands on the pavement with the grave of a cat.

ANGLE ON TWO POLICE CARS

They crash head-on with a sickening sound of crunching metal and flying
glass.  Two groggy Police exit, front doors falling off, try to clear
their heads.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAWN

The first orange rays of the morning sun stab upwards through the
clouds over Wayne Manor.

INT. YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - DAY

Young Bruce Wayne's lab room remains much as we remember it, except
that the gaping hole in the wall caused by the laser has been
reinforced and shaped into a doorway.  A make-shift ladder-like
stairway leads down into the cavern below.

FOOTSTEPS are heard climbing the ladder from deep within the cave.
After a moment, Bruce appears, stripped to the waist, still wearing his
utility belt and the bottom half of his Batman suit.  His chest and
stomach are nicked with small cuts and bruises from his previous
night's work.  His forehead glistens with sweat born of utter
exhaustion.  He sits heavily on a cot, buries his face in his hands,
looks up suddenly as the door to the lab opens.

Alfred enters, stares silently, first appalled by Bruce's physical
condition, then shaking his head with sympathy.  Bruce stares back,
eyes heavy with lack of sleep.

BRUCE
You...think I'm crazy, don't you?
Certifiably insane.

ALFRED
(pause; smile)
A bit...eccentric, perhaps.

BRUCE
It's...what I have to do, Alfred.
After all those years of searching
-- it was always what I had to do.

ALFRED
If I may be permitted, Sir...
(with difficulty)
I've...never had any children of my
own.  Never saw the advantage in it,
considering my profession.  I've
always thought myself more talented
at raising flowers than people...

Bruce looks up with a warm smile of gratitude.

ALFRED
Oh, I didn't raise you, Sir, I
simply watched you grow.

INSERT SHOT - GOTHAM TRIBUNE

A Banner edition of the Gotham Tribune cartwheels INTO FRAME:  On the
front page:  fanciful artist's renditions drawn from eyewitness
recollections of the Batman.

One is of a menacing black vampire with long, pointed fangs.  Another
show a dark, furry giant with huge feathered wings.  Above them the
headline:  BAT-MAN INVADES CITY.  MASS HYSTERIA GRIPS GOTHAM.  POLICE
NO MATCH FOR WINGED INTRUDER.

CAMER HOLDS on the newspaper as we hear the jumbled and excited VOICES
of REPORTERS underneath:

REPORTER'S VOICE
Commissioner, how do you explain this
Fantastic phenomenon?

GORDON'S VOICE
I can't explain it.  I only hope for the
poor fellow's sake, he's sobered up by now.

EXT. GOTHAM COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

Bruce lies on a deck chair by the swimming pool of the Gotham Country
Club, his body coated with sun oil.  He listens to Gordon's TV press
conference on a tiny transistor set next to him.  His eyes flutter open
with amusement.

TV REPORTER
Well considering the fact he apprehended
four criminals last night, shouldn't we
be calling him...a good Samaritan?

GORDON
Sure.  If you feel like calling John
Hinkley a political activist.

Bruce's eyes suddenly bulge wider.  He gazes across the swimming pool,
transfixed by what he sees.

ANGLE ON SILVER - BRUCE'S P.O.V.

A stunning-looking woman (SILVER ST. CLOUD) steps out onto the high
board of the pool, dressed in a daringly-cut shiny white latex tank
suit.  A shining mane of glistening silver hair cascades down across
her shoulders.  She pauses, a shimmering white diamond in the sun.

REPORTER'S VOICE
Commissioner, it might surprise you
to know that several polls taken
today show more than eighty percent
of those interviewed approve of
this...vigilante and what he did...

Silver glances over in Bruce's direction.  Curiously enough, she seems
to smile at him and wave.

GORDON'S VOICE
Well I can't account for public
taste, bit I'd like to warn any
potential copy cats who may be out
there that...

BACK TO BRUCE

Bruce is stunned and confused, but starts to lift his hand to wave back
when:

THORNE'S VOICE
If brains were bodies, she'd look
just the same.  Can you believe it?

Bruce swivels, lowering his hand.  Thorne stands behind him, waves back
at Silver who executes a complicated but perfect dive into the pool.
She starts to swim across in their direction as Throne grins down at
Bruce.

THORNE
Name's Silver St. Cloud.  Phi Beta
Kappa, Masters Degree in Political
Science.  Just arrived in Gotham to
finish her doctorate on municipal
government and guess which City
councilman drew her as an intern?

BRUCE
(staring)
Taught her much so far?

THORNE
(chuckle)
Not as much as I plan to.

Silver reaches the edge of the pool.  Thorne starts to help her out as
Bruce continues to start.

SILVER
The water's glorious, Rupert.  Come
on in.

THORNE
Never had time to learn how to swim.
Too busy trying to make a living, I
guess.  Not like Mr. Wayne over
here...
(chuckle)
Right, Bruce?
(turns)
Silver St. Cloud - Bruce Wayne.

Bruce looks up, totally mesmerized by the sight of her.  She gazes down
with a devastating smile, the sun sparkling off the beads of water on
her face.  She is instantly and equally smitten as they lock eyes.

SILVER
Please don't get up.

BRUCE
(lost)
Hmm?

SILVER
I said - please don't get up.

BRUCE
Oh.
(starts to get up)
Sorry...

SILVER
That's all right.  I asked you not
to, remember?

BRUCE
(stops)
So you did.  Thanks.

SILVER
Don't mention it.

Rupert watches them watching each other.  The uncomfortable silence is
filled by Gordon's VOICE from the television.

GORDON'S VOICE
And now, if there are no other ques-
tions, it's my birthday tonight and
I have a formal party to get ready
for...

Thorne reaches down, turns off the TV in disgust.

THORNE
That clown has been a disgrace to
law enforcement his entire career.
This city's going to hell in a hand-
basket and some imbecile's giving
him a formal birthday party.

BRUCE
It should be fun.  I'm giving it.

Thorne raises his eyebrows.  Silver still stares.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
Perhaps the two of you would like to
come?

THORNE
SILVER
I'm busy, thanks.									   I'd
love to.

THORNE
(irritated)
Silver, I don't think...ah...

SILVER
If I'm not being too inquisitive,
Mr. Wayne - exactly what is it you
do?

BRUCE
Do?

SILVER
For a living?

THORNE
(chuckles)
You're looking at it.

BRUCE
Actually, Rupert's not being
entirely fair about his...
(nice smile)
Sometimes I go hang gliding.

SILVER
And that's it?

BRUCE
Not quite.

SILVER
I didn't think so.

BRUCE
I have a dog as well.

Silver manages a tiny, unsure smile.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
Wayne Manor.  Eight o'clock.  I'll
have my car pick you up.

THORNE
Why don't you take my car, Silver?
In case you want to leave early.

SILVER
I'm very flattered by the dueling
limos, gentlemen, but I can grab a
cab, thanks.
(nods)
Mr. Wayne...

Silver excuses herself.  Both men watch her departure avidly.

THORNE
Gotham City's no place for a beauti-
ful woman to be travelling alone.
I'm holding you personally responsi-
ble for her safety, Wayne.

BRUCE
Don't worry, Rupert.  I'll treat her
just as if I were in love with her
instead of you.

Thorne's eyes narrow.  Bruce smiles ingenuously.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

Dozens of expensive cars disgorge their passengers in front of stately
Wayne Manor.

INT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A lavish party is in progress.  A DANCE BAND plays off to the side,
under a banner reading ""Happy Birthday to the Finest of Gotham's
Finest.""

Bruce Wayne greets his arriving GUESTS, his neck craning around in vain
for a sight of Silver.

Gordon stands by the bar, downs a double scotch, scowls at GUESTS who
talks animatedly to him while flapping his arms like wings - doing a
crude imitation of the Batman.  The Guest howls with laughter, moves
off as Gordon orders another drink and Bruce joins him with a
sympathetic smile.

BRUCE
They're giving you a pretty hard time
about that Batman, aren't they...

Gordon nods, tosses back his drink angrily.

GORDON
I'd give up half my pension to be
standing face to face with that
caped fruitcake right now.
(looks off; stares)
Now there's a sight to make an old
man's eyes water.

Silver St. Cloud approaches them, threading her way through the
appreciative glances of the Guests, dressed in a sparkling, metallic
evening gown, the light bouncing off it like tiny bursts of shooting
stars.  She reaches Bruce, extends her hand with a warm smile.

SILVER
I hope I'm not too late.

GORDON
In my case, by twenty years.

BRUCE
Silver, St. Cloud - this is David
Gordon, Commissioner of Police.
Miss St. Cloud is picking up the
finer points of the city government from
Councilman Thorne.

SILVER
My ambition is to hold a job as
important as yours one day, Commis-
sioner.

GORDON
Then you and Mr. Thorne already have
much in common.

SILVER
(suddenly)
Would you care to dance, Mr. Wayne?

BRUCE
(locking eyes)
You're as clairvoyant as you are
beautiful, Miss St. Cloud.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

Now heading into the driveway is a brightly painted version of an old-
time twenties paddy wagon, with two look-alikes of the old KEYSTONE
KOPS riding on top.  They honk a comical horn loudly as laughing
PARKING ATTENDANTS greet them

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ANGLE ON DANCE FLOOR

Bruce and Silver glide smoothly across the floor - a perfect fit.
Bruce looks down curiously.

SILVER
Something wrong?

BRUCE
You're...leading.

SILVER
I asked you, remember?

Alfred arrives, interrupting them.

ALFRED
Excuse me, Sir, but there are some
oddly dressed gentlemen outside with a
singing telegram for the Commissioner.

BRUCE
Ask them to come in, will you,
Alfred?

Bruce makes his way to the bandstand, whispers some instructions to the
BANDLEADER.  A LOUD FANFARE is played.  All conversation stops as the
front door opens.

Now entering Wayne Manor:  the Two Keystone Kops, in their twenties'
costumes with handlebar moustaches.  They dance their way to the center
of the room in a prearranged routine, singing in harmony from Pirates
of Penzance.

KOPS
When a felon's not engaged in his
employment,
Or maturing his felonious little
plans,
His capacity for innocent enjoyment
Is just as great as any honest
man's...
Oh, a policeman's lot is not a happy
one...

The Guests applaud loudly.  Gordon joins Bruce and Silver as the Kops
break into a vaudeville routine.

KOP
Excuse me, Sir.  Have you seen a
policeman around here?

KOP #2
Why no, I haven't.

KOP
(drawing gun)
Good.  Then give me your watch.

Several Guests laugh.  Bruce winces at the bad joke.

KOP #2
But this watch isn't worth anything.
It only has a sentimental value.

KOP
Well give it to me anyway.  I feel
like a good cry.

Gordon laughs loudly as the Kop turns to him.

KOP (CONT'D)
Now, Commissioner, if we could
borrow your watch for a moment...

GORDON
(taking it off)
Sure.  Be careful with it, okay?

The Kop smiles, takes the watch, dangles it from his hand.  Kop #2
silently sidles in behind Bruce and Silver.

KOP
Here's a good one:  what's a police-
man's favorite way to kill time?

GORDON
(grinning)
I'll bite.  What is a policeman's
favorite way to kill time?

The Kop grins, pull his gun - FIRES!  Gordon's watch is smashed to
smithereens.  Kop #2's gun suddenly at the back of Silver's head,
hammer cocked.

KOP #2
Up against the wall, everybody!
Move!!

The Guests scream as six more Kops burst through the front door
carrying automatic weapons.  Bruce, Silver, and Gordon are herded back
against the wall with the others.

The KOP grins, then suddenly starts to giggle insanely.  He takes off
his helmet, as a shock of GREEN HAIR is exposed!  He wipes his lips
clean which now become ruby red.  Cackling in glee, THE JOKER faces his
victims, his gaze suddenly becoming cruel and cold.

JOKER
One at a time, your money and your
jewels, and no one's head'll wind
up looking like the Commissioner's
watch, capisce?

KOP #3
Hey, boss!  Look!

The Joker turns.  Kop #3 and a PARTNER have set Gordon's huge birthday
cake on the floor, now wade through it, stomping up and down, kicking
the insides across the room.

KOP #3
We're doing the cake walk!

The Joker giggles, then shoots a satanically maniacal look at the
Guests who instantly begin stripping off their jewelry, taking out
wallets, etc. as more Kops pass by with a gunny sack.  The Joker walks
down the line, stopping to level a searching and curious gaze into the
eyes of:

Bruce Wayne, between Gordon and Silver, his face set, eyes steely,
staring at the Joker.  His jaw twitches.

Silver watches him, noticing the twitch.  She gives him a tiny,
sympathetic smile, then turns to face:

Kop #2, who has moved down the line to Silver.  He looks her up and
down hungrily as she stares back in defiance.  His fingers slowly reach
up to grip her necklace, then linger.

KOP #2
In your case, lady, I'd like to
rip the rest off and leave this on.

Suddenly:  BRUCE'S FIST FLASHES INTO FRAME!  Kop #2 is knocked backward
through the air as another Kop lunges at Bruce who grabs the gunny sack
filled with jewelry and bashes him in the face!  The Kop crumples to
the floor as Bruce wheels to face the Joker and sees:

The Joker, grinning cruelly, the barrel of his gun pressing up under
Silver's chin.  Her eyes are welded shut with fear.

JOKER
Now that was extremely bad manners,
Mr. Wayne.  Especially from someone...
(gestures)
...to the Manor born...
(giggles)
So why don't you rejoin the lady here,
or if you like...
(cocks gun; glowers)
I can send part of her over to you.

Bruce hesitates, then rejoins the line.  The Joker lowers his gun,
turns to stare at a painting on the wall as a Kop holds out the open
gunny sack to Gordon.

GORDON
(to Joker)
I'll see you rot in the gas chamber
for this.

The Joker smiles, ignoring him, looking at the portrait painting which
is of a distinguished older man.  He removes it from the wall.  An
indignant Alfred speaks up from farther down the line of Guests.

ALFRED
Be careful, you clot!  That portrait
goes back to Mr. Wayne's grandfather!

JOKER
Why?  Is there something wrong with
it?

The Joker cackles, punching the painting out of its frame.

CLOSE ON BRUCE AND SILVER

Bruce stares silently.  His jaw twitches with anger born of
humiliation.  Silver notices again.

SILVER
(whisper)
Look on the bright side.  You're
adorable when your jaw twitches.

BACK TO SCENE

The Joker crosses to Gordon with the empty picture frame.  Another Kop
points a camera as the Joker holds the frame up to encircle his and
Gordon's face.

JOKER
(giggling)
I've always wanted to frame a Police
Commissioner...

CLOSE ON JOKER'S AND GORDON'S FACES

Gordon shuts his eyes in disgrace.  The Joker howls with glee.

THE FLASHBULB STROBE WIPES THE SCEEN!

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

The Kops exit Wayne Manor with their loot, climb back into the paddy
wagon, roar out of the driveway.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

The terrified and disgruntled Guests head for the door as Bruce and
Silver look over at a devastated Gordon.

BRUCE
I'm afraid the tabloids are going
to have a field day with this, David.
Not to mention Rupert Thorne.

ALFRED
(joining them)
I tried calling the police.  The
phone line seems to have been cut.

GORDON
I'll report it myself, Alfred.
Right before I cut my throat.

He tries to check his watch, stares at an empty wrist, sighs, then
joins the stream of departing Guests as Bruce looks over at Silver
glumly.

BRUCE
Well.  Good-night.  I guess...

SILVER
(sudden grin)
Why don't be silly.  I've only just
arrived.

BRUCE
(smile)
Would you care to dance, Miss St. Cloud?

SILVER
(offering her arm)
You're as clairvoyant as you are
gallant, Mr. Wayne...

EXT. GOTHAM POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

A crestfallen Gordon exits his car in front of Police Headquarters.

INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Gordon walks slowly and dejectedly down the nearly deserted hallway.
As he passes one DETECTIVE'S cubicle, the sound of SNICKERING is HEARD
from inside.

Gordon stops defiantly.  The snickering instantly dies away.  Muttering
disgustedly, Gordon enters his office.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The office is lit only be a small desk lamp.  Strung up behind the desk
is a crudely-made banner reading:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO OUT COMMISH - FROM
ALL YOUR BOYS IN BLUE.

Gordon shakes his head sadly, crosses to a cabinet, pours himself an
enormous glass of Scotch, then crosses with the bottle to the open
office window.  He takes a long swig, exhales, then slams the window
shut.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

The Wayne Manor driveway is deserted under the moonlight.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

The band plays a soft, dreamy number as Bruce and Silver dance together
dreamily, locked in each other's arm, drifting silently through the
vast living room.

CLOSER ON THEM

Silver's eyes flutter open, then lock into his.

SILVER
Maybe you'd better take me home...

BRUCE
I am home...

SILVER
(soft murmur)
You see...I don't do anything on
the first date...

BRUCE
Don't be so hard on yourself...You're
doing just fine...

He draws her in more tightly as hey glide across the floor.

EXT. SILVER'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

Bruce's Aston-Martin is parked in front of an unassuming apartment
house in middle-class Gotham.

INT. SILVER'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

Bruce escorts Silver down the modest, clean hallway.

SILVER
Thank you for a totally unexpected
evening, Bruce.  I like surprises...

She stops at a door, inserts her key, turns, smiles.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Including you.

BRUCE
Oh?  How did...
(smile)
Rupert Thorne describe me?

SILVER
As a rather ineffectual playboy.
But pleasant enough in a harmless
sort of way.

BRUCE
Like an affable grasshopper bouncing
around in the middle of all you
hard-working ants...

SILVER
Something like that.

Bruce takes her hand gently, stares deeply into her eyes.

BRUCE
And you?  How would you describe me?

SILVER
(staring back)
I don't think you're harmless.  And
I don't think anyone who's looked
straight in your eyes could say so.

Bruce's jaw twitches involuntarily.  Silver grins.  He leans in, kisses
her lingeringly on the mouth.  They break.  He gazes into her
disoriented eyes.

BRUCE
Frightened?

SILVER
Terrified...but don't worry...
(soft smile)
As a kid they always had to drag me
off the roller coaster.

They kiss again, passionately.  She looks up, confused.

SILVER (CONT'D)
I sleep I'll get some think now...

She turns key, slips through the door, closing it again.

Bruce sigh, slumps back heavily against the wall, realizing a dilemma
he may never be able to solve.

EXT. GOTHAM SKYLINE - NIGHT

The yellow moon glows brightly over Gotham City.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Gordon is slumped over his desk, mumbling to himself in a half-drunken
stupor.  The bottle of Scotch next to him has clearly been emptied.

Suddenly - a gust of cold wind ruffles his hair.  His eyes flutter,
then look over at the open office window.

GORDON
Thought I closed that Goddamn thing...

He staggers to the window, looks out sadly.

BATMAN'S VOICE
Whatever you do - don't jump.

Gordon whirls.  Batman looms up from a dark corner.

BATMAN (CONT'D)
We've been at odds, Commissioner,
and it's Gotham's loss.  My fight
isn't with you.  It's with the dis-
eased scum infesting this city.

Gordon backs up toward his desk, smiles nervously.

GORDON
Of course it is...

BATMAN
Criminals are a cowardly lot at heart.
But human garbage like the Joker is
taking over Gotham - in spite of
everything that you and other men of
good will can do about it.

GORDON
Don't you preach law and order to
me, you...

BATMAN
The people need a symbol.  Someone
to rally around.  Someone who isn't
hamstrung by the very laws he's
sworn to uphold, whose hands aren't
tied with red tape.  They have a
right to justice.

GORDON
That I happen to agree with...
(pulls gun from
drawer)
That's why you're under arrest.

Gordon levels the gun.  They are frozen for a moment.  Batman advances
slowly.  He speaks in measured tones, eyes clear, voice almost
hypnotic.

BATMAN
You won't pull that trigger because
you realize I'm your last chance.
You're fighting a war you've already
lost and you know it.

Batman stands inches away from the gun barrel now.  Gordon peers deeply
into his eyes through the cowl.

BATMAN (CONT'D)
With your blessing - with you
cooperation - together we could rid
the streets of Gotham of violence
and corruption.

Gordon blinks.  His gun hand wavers.

BATMAN (CONT'D)
We share the same dream, Gordon.
You know we do.  Trust you
intuition.  Join me.

Batman extends a black-gloved hand.

CLOSE ON HAND

The hand holds steady, the gun pointed directly at it.

BACK TO THEM

The Caped Crusader's gaze rivets Gordon to the spot.

BACK TO HANDS

A beat.  Gordon's gun drops to the floor.  His hand grasps the black
glove tightly.

EXT. GOTHAM POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

CAMERA ZOOMS up the building, WHIPPING INTO the night sky:

Seen for the first time:  THE GLOWING BATSIGNAL!  The silhouetted
yellow ball knifes up through the night over Gotham, seeming to glow
more brightly than the moon!

Underneath, WE HEAR a cacophony of REPORTERS' VOICES:

REPORTER #3
The Joker's gang was in for a rude
awakening early this morning when...

CAMERA PANS DOWN FROM the night sky to:

EXT. GIRDER BUILDING - NIGHT

We are on top of a partially constructed building - a maze of
interconnecting steel girders, jutting out over the black waters of
Gotham River.

A WIRY, WEASEL-FACED MAN (JIMMY MALONE) stands on a top girder some
forty floors above the water, seems to be aiming his gun into the
blackness.

MALONE
Stay away from me!

EXT. GIRDERS - NIGHT

Malone trembles,  squints into the dark, hears A VOICE:

BATMAN'S VOICE
I think we've run out of floors.

A black cape swirls around the side of a girder.  Malone panics,
squeezes the trigger RAPID FIRE!  Then - silence.

BATMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Floors - and bullets.

Now stepping out onto the girder, emerging from the blackness:  THE
BATMAN!  His huge black cape billows out ominously.

ANGLE ON GORDON

Gordon, Haley, and a mob of Reporters watch tensely from below where a
gang of handcuffed Crooks is being led off by the police.

BACK TO GIRDERS

Malone inches back on the uppermost girder which juts out over the
river.  He clicks his gun - empty - throws it at the Batman, missing
him.  The Batman advances coldly.

BATMAN
They say a cornered rat can be dan-
gerous.  You don't look so tough.

As Batman advances, suddenly:  HIS FOOT SLIPS!  He tumbles over the
side of the girder, hangs on, his fingers jammed into the rivet holes!

ANGLE ON BELOW

An audible GASP from the assembled audience.

BACK TO BATMAN

Straining to hold on, his fingers almost coming out of their sockets.
He looks down:  the network of girders dissolves dizzyingly into black.

Malone starts forward, grinning broadly.

MALONE
Here.  Lemme give you a hand...

Malone claps loudly.  Batman winces, hangs on.

MALONE (CONT'D)
Now a foot...

Malone brings one show down hard on Batman's hand, grinds it in.  Then,
the other foot on the remaining hand.  Batman grimaces in unbelievable
pain.

Suddenly:  Batman swings his leg back!  He bursts forward again in an
arc, propelling his feet under the girder and up again around the other
side.  His boots crash into the back of Malone's legs - launching him
out into space with an agonizing scream!

The Batman stands on the girder, looking down.  He gives a tiny salute,
then DIVES OUT INTO THE NIGHT!  Sailing down through the blackness for
more than a hundred feet, he hits the river with an enormous splash,
then disappears.

BACK TO GORDON

Gordon watches, stunned, as a Reporter comes up.

REPORTER
Incredible!  Who is he, Commis-
sioner?  Can you let us in on it?

GORDON
(suddenly crafty)
Id like to, but...I'm afraid that
information's classified.

The Reporter walks off, muttering angrily.  Haley looks sideways at
Gordon in disbelief.

GORDON
(exploding)
Goddamnit, Haley, do I have to tell
you every little thing?

INT. RUPERT THORNE'S OFFICE - DAY

CAMERA PANS DOWN from the Gotham City logo:  TRUTH, JUSTICE, INTERGRITY
to the face of Rupert Thorne, a cigar wedged between gritted teeth,
watching a TV across the room.

TV REPORTER'S VOICE
...reporting live from the Gotham
Museum where Batman has caught the
Penny Plunderers.  Criminals are
Rapidly becoming an endangered
Species here in Gotham, thanks to...

There is a KNOCK.  The door opens.  Silver enters with some papers for
Thorne, pauses to look at the set.

SILVER
That Batman's something, isn't he?
(hands over papers)
For once in our lives, a real,
honest-to-God hero.

THORNE
(forced smile)
Oh, he's some piece of work, all
right...

Thorne takes the papers.  Silver exits as he glares back at the set
from which we now HEAR BATMAN'S VOICE.

BATMAN'S VOICE
...but the credit really belongs
to the citizens of this city and
their elected officials, who've bent
over backwards...

THORNE
(chomping cigar)
Then kiss my ass.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

THE YELLOW BATSIGNAL explodes up into the night sky!

EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT

A dirty, stained tramp steamer lies at anchor in Gotham Harbor.  A
POCK-MARKED CAPTAIN whispers down to TWO CONFEDERATES in a dinghy
below.

CAPTAIN
You can tell the Joker his drugs are
on their way.  Now get the hell out
of here.

The dinghy putts off into the night.  The Captain turns.

CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
Weigh anchor!

ANGLE ON SIDE OF SHIP

The huge anchor chain rumbles up the side of the ship's prow.  Now
emerging from UNDER THE WATER - THE BATMAN!  He rides the anchor chain
up toward the deck.

INT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Silver peddles away on an exercycle in her apartment, dressed in a
nightie, avidly watching the Late News.

TV REPORTER
...the biggest drug bust in the
history of Gotham City!  Where will
The Dark Avenger appear next?  Who
knows?  Maybe everywhere!

SILVER
(churning away)
My door's unlocked, you big hunk...

EXT. FLAMING BUILDING - NIGHT

A TOWERING INFERNO engulfs a building in a poor section of town.
Flames shoot out of the upper floors as a DISTRAUGHT MOTHER pleads with
the FIREMEN.

MOTHER
But my baby!  My baby's still in
there!

FIRE CAPTAIN
It's impossible, lady!  I can't send
My men into that tinderbox!

FIREMAN
(staring up in awe)
Look!!

ANGLE ON BATMAN - THEIR P.O.V.

The Batman lands on top of the burning building!  Hooking his nylon
cord securely, he shields his face with his cape, then launches himself
downwards, swinging straight through a window in a SHOWER OF GLASS AND
FLAMES!

After an agonizing moment - he reappears!  He cradles a BAWLING BABY in
his arms, covers it with his cape, then quickly shimmies down into the
street.

INT. JOKER'S LAIR - DAY

The Joker paces angrily as the TV blares:

TV REPORTER'S VOICE
...here at Gotham Amusement Park
where - if you can believe it -
the Batman has subdued a mechanical
dinosaur, thus foiling the Joker's
plot to...

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

Once again:  THE GLOWING BATSIGNAL whips up into the night!

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

TWO CROOKS run across a rooftop, carrying a bag of loot, heading for a
helicopter which waits, blades whirring.  They reach the chopper, look
behind them as:

ANGLE ON BATMAN - THEIR P.O.V.

The Batman lands on the opposite side of the roof, some twenty yards
away.

CROOK #1
(looking back)
Sorry, Batman.  Gotta fly now...

The Crooks pile into the helicopter, laughing loudly.  It starts to
take off, rising quickly.

BACK TO BATMAN

His jaw twitches.  He unhooks the BATARANG from the front of his
utility belt.  (NOTE:  This is a black, bat-shaped boomerang, attached
to his nylon cord.

The helicopter rises as:  The Batman hurls his Batarang!

CLOSE ON ROTOR SHAFT

The Batarang whistles around the spinning rotor shaft which connects
the helicopter bubble cockpit to the rear rotor blades.  It hooks
tight.

WIDER ANGLE

The helicopter takes off into the night sky as the Batman is jerked
free of the building top, NOW DANGLES IN MID-AIR as the chopper
continues over Gotham!

ANGLE DOWN ON BATMAN

Suspended more than a thousand feet in the air, looking up at the
helicopter above him.

ANGLE ON ROTOR SHAFT

The rotor shaft spins, the Batarang cord encircling it.  The nylon cord
wraps itself around the shaft as the Batman is now being pulled up LIKE
A FISH ON THE LINE!

WIDER ANGLE

As the Batman rises toward the chopper through the night sky.

INT. HELICOPTER

The PILOT struggles with the controls.  A CROOK looks over.

CROOK
What the hell's wrong?

PILOT
Can't figure it...I have to compen-
sate for something on the port
side...

The Crook looks over to his left:  The night sky is clear through the
bubble cockpit.

Now suddenly rising into view:  THE FACE OF BATMAN, staring in coldly
from outside the cockpit!

Then:  WE HEAR THE SOUND OF TREMENDOUS OVATION!

INT. GOTHAM BALLROOM - NIGHT

Hundreds of Guests applaud heartily in a hotel ballroom.  Gotham's
MAYOR stands in front of a podium at the center of a dais which
includes Batman, Gordon, and Rupert Thorne.

MAYOR
...and so, in giving him the keys to
Gotham, I proclaim our Batman this
city's Man of The Year.  Year?
Hell!  The Man of a Lifetime!

A rousing ovation!  Batman rises to join the Mayor at the podium,
shaking hands with Dignitaries on his way by.

ANGLE ON SILVER

Silver stands by one of the front table, applauds heartily.

ANGLE ON BATMAN

Shaking hands with Gordon, then with an overly enthusiastic Rupert
Thorne, who claps him on the back, Knute Rockne-like.

INT. JOKER'S LAIR - NIGHT

A grim-faced Joker watches the festivities on television, slumped
behind a harlequin desk in his darkened lair.

BATMAN ON TV
Thank you, Mr. Mayor...
(at Crowd)
Let me be brief...

The Joker lifts what look like a remote control box, presses a button:

THE TELEVISION EXPLODES, WIPING THE SCREEN!

EXT. GOTHAM PARK ZOO - DAY

CAMERA CLOSE on a zoo enclosure filled with live penguins.  A KEEPER
tosses them sardines as ONLOOKERS watch.

SILVER'S VOICE
Aren't they adorable in their little
dinner jackets?

Silver, holding a big pink balloon, stands watching them in the crowd
with Bruce.

BRUCE
Actually, it looks like a convention
of maitre d's...

SILVER
Maitre d's?
(sideways look)
So you are familiar with eating out
at night...

She turns, smiling to herself.  Bruce catches her drift.

BRUCE
Silver, look...I know it must seem
very rude, my not asking you out to
dinner...

SILVER
But you've been terribly busy...

BRUCE
I have, as a matter of fact.  I...I...

SILVER
(hurt)
Bruce, my lunch hour's practically
over.  Exactly what is it you want
to say?

BRUCE
(swallowing hard)
That...you should forget about me.
Rupert was right.  I am a grass-
hopper.  You deserve somebody more
...worthwhile.  Somebody you could
wind up...respecting.

SILVER
(pause; smile)
Now tell me the truth.

BRUCE
The truth is...I can never be in
love with anyone.  I'm too selfish.
In fact, I'm all I need.
(pause)
That's the truth.

Silver looks up softly with eyes which could melt steel.

SILVER
Liar...

She kisses him passionately, hands him her balloon, then walks away.
Bruce stares, stunned and dejected.

CAMERA PANS across to one large penguin, ZOOMS IN as it preens its
flightless wings:

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

INT. PENGUIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

CAMERA PANS a spacious bedroom which is entirely decorated in black and
white.  A huge, four-poster bed dominates, covered by a piece of
drapery in the shape of an open umbrella, also in black and white.  It
frames the figure of THE PENGUIN who lies in bed, an ice pack on his
head, a thermometer sticking out of his mouth.

This is an elegant man, dressed in a white robe with a black collar,
propped up on black silk sheets against black-and-white checkered
pillows.  A COOING SOUND makes him glance at a partially opened window
where a pigeon has landed, now looks at him questioningly.  The Penguin
makes a clucking birdlike sound of welcome which the pigeon seems to
recognize.  It flies over to his bed, hops up into his lap.

A STATUESQUE WOMAN (EMPRESS) enters, carrying a tureen of shrimp
embedded in ice.  She wears a tight wool body stocking, a muffler
wrapped around her neck.

EMPRESS
Here, sweetie.  Eat them while they're
nice and frozen.  Feel better?

PENGUIN
A smidge.

The Penguin removes his thermometer, looks at it.

PENGUIN (O.S.)
Sixty-five degrees.  Normal.  I
can't understand it...

He takes a bite of frozen shrimp, removes the ice pack from his head,
slips it inside his robe.  He leans in, tugs on the Empress' muffler
gently, smiles.

PENGUIN (CONT'D)
Feel life...feathering the nest for
a while?

EMPRESS
If you'll let me turn the thermostat
up to forty.  That was our deal,
remember?

He strokes her face tenderly, makes his clucking sound.  Shivers runs
up and down her body.

PENGUIN
Confess.  Where you're with me, it's
always Honolulu in your heart.

EMPRESS
Are you kidding?  It's so cold in here
a flasher would have described himself.

There is a KNOCK from the doorway.  A seven-foot, sallow-looking BUTLER
(MARIBOU) with a vulture-like face appears.

MARIBOU
Excuse me, Mr. Penguin.  Your
luncheon guest has arrived.

PENGUIN
Thank you, Maribou...

MARIBOU
May I take your luncheon order now,
Sir?

The pigeon coos from the Penguin's lap.  He looks down.

PENGUIN
Why, yes, Maribou.  Yes, you may...

His hand wanders BELOW FRAME.  We hear the sound of a neck snapping.
The Empress turns away in disgust.

INT. PENGUIN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

An elegant dining room.  At one end of a checkered black-and-white
table:  the Penguin.  Dressed in white tie and tails, he pops an icy
codfish ball into his mouth.

PENGUIN
Even for a criminal as phenomenally
gifted as I - this is indeed an
honor, Sir.

At the other end - the Joker, teeth chattering, not touching his food.
Wrapped in a heavy overcoat with muffler and earmuffs, he blows into
his hands.  Four sets of candelabra are drawn in around him for warmth.

JOKER
Nice little meat locker you got here.
Who'd you buy it from, Bird's Eye?

A frozen giggle collapses.  The Penguin blinks stoically.

PENGUIN
I'm heart-broken you haven't touched
your food.  I had that clown fish
cooked especially for you.
(gestures)
Do you prefer codfish balls?

JOKER
I don't know.  I never attended any.

An insane chuckle rises, then dies, teeth chattering.

JOKER
But seriously, Big Bird...
(eyes narrowing)
I need a favor.

PENGUIN
Outside of possibly offering you a
brain scan - how may I be of help?

JOKER
(philosophical)
I've worked hard to make Gotham a city
we could all be proud of.  The kind of
place where an ambitious young hood
could come home after a hard day
dealing drugs and get some peaceful
sleep at night.  But all that was B.B.

PENGUIN
Before Batman.

JOKER
Rimshot.  I'd like to send that
cowled cop-lover on a little trip
tomorrow night.
(leans in)
But I'm going to need you to pro-
vide the flight insurance.
(giggle)
Which reminds me.  Do you know what
you get when you make love to the
wrong canary?

PENGUIN
(sigh)
I haven't a clue.

JOKER
Twerpes!

He explodes with laughter.  The Penguin stares blankly.

JOKER (CONT'D)
Not only that - but the disease is
completely untweetable!

The Penguin winces sadly, lowers his eyes as the Joker slams his semi-
frozen clown fish against his plate, his body wracked by uncontrollable
guffaws.

INT. BATCAVE - DAY

Alfred holds an aerosol wax can and a cloth.  He polishes an enormous
white animal tooth.

ALFRED
With all this extra cleaning to do,
Sir, do you mind if I engage addi-
tional staff for the mansion?

An acetylene torch whines in reply.

WIDE ANGLE - BATCAVE

We see the Batcave for the first time:  The gothic cavern walls are now
spotless.  Alfred stands on a ladder, polishing a tooth of a mechanical
Tyrannosaurus Rex.  Next to it is the giant penny.  This, along with
other exhibits, is the trophy section.

CAMERA PANS:  One area of the cave is devoted to exercise - weights,
Nautilus machines, rings - even a trapeze.  The acetylene torch whines.

CAMERA PANS:  Another section features a myriad of complicated machines
and a fully equipped crime lab.

PAST the crime lab:  Bruce lies on his back under a partially
constructed futuristic automobile.  He trains an acetylene torch
against one section as the sparks fly.  It's just the shell of a car
now - other sections and odd electronic devices are strewn about the
area.  Bruce shuts off his torch, removes a faceplate, reaches back for
a long cylindrical network of crisscrossing cables.  He starts to fit
it onto one underside edge of the chassis.

BRUCE
I'm sorry, Alfred.  Did you say
something?

ALFRED
(noticing cylinder)
What on earth is all that metallic
spaghetti in aid of?

BRUCE
There's a Magnum pistol in the table
drawer over there.  Take it out,
would you?

Alfred descends the ladder as Bruce rises, crosses to two larger
versions of the cabled cylinders.  They stand upright, some eight feet
apart from each other.  Bruce leans down, opens the top of a large
transformer box.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
I've connected two mega-transformer
leads to form a force field of a
million volts.

Bruce flips a switch - dazzling blue light begins to dance between the
cable cylinders.  Alfred turns with the gun in his hands as Bruce calls
to him from behind the sparkling wall of blue light.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
Shoot me.

ALFRED
Pardon?

BRUCE
Shoot to kill.  Aim for the heart.

ALFRED
I...assume this apparatus has been
thoroughly tested, Sir?

BRUCE
We're doing it right now.

Alfred stares incredulously, the gun shaking in his hand.

ALFRED
Sir...if you've miscalculated...

BRUCE
Be a good soldier, Alfred.
(pause)
Shoot.  Now!

Alfred straightens his arm, his finger squeezing the trigger.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
(suddenly)
Wait!

TOO LATE:  Alfred fires!  The bullet bounces off the blue wall of
light, then ricochets back at Alfred, pinging into the cavern wall next
to his head!  Alfred hits the deck as the lead cartridge continues a
seemingly endless path of ricochets until there is sudden silence.

Alfred rises, sweat dripping from his brow.  Bruce grins, turning off
the blue light.

BRUCE
I forgot to tell you to duck.

EXT. GOTHAM CITY HALL - NIGHT

A taxi pulls up to the darkened City Hall.  Silver exits, starts up the
steps.

INT. CITY HALL - NIGHT

Silver enters, crosses the lobby to the elevators.  A GUARD looks up
from his night desk.

GUARD
Just a minute, Miss...

SILVER
It's okay, Victor, it's...
(sees him)
Where's Victor?

GUARD
Victor's...sick tonight.  What's
your name?

SILVER
St. Cloud.  I'm on Councilman
Thorne's staff.  Just catching up on
a little back work.

GUARD
The doors are all locked up there,
Miss, and...I'm not authorized to
open them.

Silver dangles her key with a pleasant smile, passes by him, enters the
elevator.  The doors close.  The nervous Guard picks up a house phone.

GUARD
There's a girl named Silver St. Cloud on
her way up.  I tried to stop her...

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

CAMERA LOOKS DOWN from the main gears of the elevator at a seemingly
endless shaft of cables.  The car carrying Silver rises quickly, jerks
to a stop at one of the top floors.

INT. CITY HALL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Silver exits the elevator, starts down the corridor for her office
door.  She passes Thorne's office, then stops, hearing MUFFLED VOICES
from inside.

SILVER
Rupert?...

There is a sudden silence.  Silver cocks her head curiously.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Rupert, it's Silver...

Silver opens the door, suddenly recoils, aghast:

ANGLE ON THORNE - HER P.O.V.

Thorne sits behind his desk, bound and gagged, tied to the chair.  His
eyes bulge in terror as Silver rushes in.

SILVER
Rupert, what happened!

JOKER'S VOICE
You like that gag?

Silver wheels to face the Joker behind her!

JOKER
Well, here's an even better one!

A stream of clear liquid shoots out from a plastic flower on the
Joker's coat lapel, drenching Silver's face as she recoils, stunned,
then instantly drops to the floor.  The Joker giggles as Thorne rises
from behind the desk, the ropes dropping off him like spaghetti.  He
takes the gag out of his mouth, looks down at Silver, nervous and
agitated.

THORNE
I can't get her involved.  This
changes everything.

JOKER
This changes nothing.
(looks down; appre-
ciative smile)
In fact, it might even give that
black-caped creep an added incentive
to walk into our trap.

THORNE
(concerned)
How long before she wakes up?

JOKER
Half an hour.
(wicked grin)
Never, if you prefer...

THORNE
(glaring coldly)
This better work out.  I warn you,
Joker - don't disappoint me.

JOKER
(crossing to door)
Please.  If everyone in this country
worked as efficiently as I do, we'd
be back on the road to prosperity.
(turns; stops)
Oh.  And starting tomorrow - after
the Batman's funeral - don't you
disappoint me, understood?

The Joker smiles cruelly, giggles, then disappears.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

CAMERA PANS the cavernous Batcave.  We HEAR the low, powerful, whining
GRIND of what seem to be turbine engines.  It rises in pitch and
intensity, growing richer and more deafening than a 747.

The blasting SOUND is coming from behind a corner of the cave, its
source unseen.  But up against one wall, in a cubicle niche:

A RED TELEPHONE PULSATES WITH GLOWING LIGHT!

INT. WAYNE MANOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

Alfred walks down the hallway dressed for bed, stifles a yawn, notices
something through the open study door.

ANGLE ON STUDY DOOR - HIS P.O.V.

The light coming from the study seems to pulsate as well, first dying,
then rising.  Dying, then rising.

INT. STUDY - NIGHT

The pulsating light comes from a desk lamp.  Alfred enters, crosses,
presses a hidden button under the desk:

A bottom drawer pops open, revealing a glowing red extension of the
Batphone in the cave.

Alfred shoves the drawer back, hurries out of the study.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Alfred crosses the living room, heading for a tall grandfather's clock
at one end.  He reaches behind the clock.  We HEAR a switch ""CLICK.""
Alfred reaches behind, swivels the clock away from the wall.

The SOUND of the ENGINE WHINE becomes immediately audible.  Alfred
hurries through the opening in the wall.

EXT. GOTHAM SKY - NIGHT

Knifing up into the blackness over the skyline of Gotham City - THE
GLEAMING BATSIGNAL!

INT. THORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The office has been ransacked.  Drawers overturned, bookcases emptied,
with piles of paper and debris strewn across the floor.

Silver sits in a chair, conscious but still groggy.  Thorne paces
angrily in front of Gordon, kicking trash left and right as the Batman
watches from inside the doorway, his eyes darting back and forth.

THORNE
It's unbelievable!  The Joker!
Right here in my office!
(at Silver)
He could have killed her!
(realizes)
He could have killed me, for God's
sake!

BATMAN
I wonder why he didn't...

Batman crosses, eyes riveted on Silver.  She feels his magnetic gaze on
her, now stares back, fascinated by him.

THORNE
You sound disappointed!

GORDON
Calm down, Rupert!  We've got a long
night ahead of us.

THORNE
What's this we crap?

GORDON
Well, you're the only one who'd know
what was missing.
(turns)
I'll send for a squad car to drive
you home, Miss St. Cloud.

Silver nods at Gordon, then looks back into the dark, magnetically
intimidating gaze of the Batman.

SILVER
Perhaps...the Batman would be kind
enough to see me home.

THORNE
What?

Batman stares back at Silver with no apparent reaction.  She smiles
unsteadily, not sure of herself.

SILVER
If I'm not too far out of your way.

BATMAN
(pause)
I can't imagine such a place exists,
Miss St. Cloud.

THORNE
Oh, brother...

Silver blushes, then rises, offers Batman her arm.

SILVER
Good-night, Rupert...

THORNE
Wait!...

Batman leads Silver out the door.  Thorne's face trembles with rage and
frustration as Gordon looks over curiously.

GORDON
Relax, Rupert.  Who could she be
safer with?

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Thorne's troubled face.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Batman leads Silver to the elevator, presses the button.

SILVER
We're taking the elevator?

BATMAN
Doesn't everybody?

SILVER
Why did I have this feeling we'd be
dropping out a window together, or
something exotic like that...

The elevator arrives.  They enter.

INT. TOP OF ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

The main gears of the elevator shaft start to churn.  Suddenly:  the
beam from a welding torch appears, rapidly cutting away at one of the
cables.

CAMERA PANS:  The Penguin hangs suspended in the shaft, supported in
mid-air by the whirling ribs of a HUGE UMBRELLA hooked to the back of
his belt.  He trains the torch on the cable, looks down, ""clucks""
contently.

Suddenly:  THE CABLE SNAPS!

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

A jarring jolt.  The elevator suddenly drops!  Silver screams as she
and Batman are momentarily pushed up into the air.  Batman grabs onto a
light fixture in the roof, bashes the ceiling escape hatch away.

ANGLE ON ELEVATOR

Plummeting down the shaft.

BACK TO BATMAN

He reaches into his utility belt, pulls out a nail-like piece of curved
metal attached to a nylon cord.  It pops open into a large, four-
pronged fish hook.

BATMAN
Grab my belt!  Hang on!

ANGLE IN SHAFT

The hook flies out of the top of the sinking elevator heading for the
wall of the shaft.  It grazes down the shaft wall, catches on one set
of gears which allow the doors to open on each individual floor.  The
nylon cord goes taut.

BACK TO ELEVATOR

Silver hangs on as Batman hooks his arm around her.  The two of them
shoot upwards through the escape hatch.

ANGLE ON ELEVATOR

Still plummeting.  It hits the ground with an ear-splitting, sickening
crash.

INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

A WASHERWOMAN standing by the elevator doors, with her mop and pail,
presses the ""down"" button.  It opens.

ANGLE ON BATMAN

Batman and Silver hang by the cord in the shaft, her arms locked around
him in a death grip.  She stares, goggle-eyed.

BATMAN
(at Silver)
Next time - remind me to try the
window.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Batman and Silver walk down a deserted street.  She is a wreck -
trembling, ripped dress, with streaks of cable grease on her face and
hair.

BATMAN
I'm parked in the alleyway.  Didn't
want to attract attention.

SILVER
A bit late for that, isn't it?

Suddenly:  THE ROAR OF ENGINES IS HEARD FROM THE SKY!  Batman and
Silver's heads snap up:

ANGLE ON PENGUIN'S GANG - THEIR P.O.V.

THREE PENGUIN CONFEDERATES whizz down at them through the night sky
wearing jetpacks!  Orange flames shoot out from behind their propelling
rigs as they maneuver through the air, now heading into a synchronized
power dive.

The Penguin hovers above, still supported by his whirling umbrella-
copter.

A hail of MACHINE GUN BULLETS spews forth from guns mounted on top of
their packs - the flyers close in on Batman and Silver like attacking
fighter planes.

BACK TO BATMAN AND SILVER

Batman dives behind a row of garbage cans, pushing a screaming Silver
down in front of him as the fusillade ricochets off the cans and
building walls.

The flying formation zooms back up into the sky again, preparing to
make another pass.  Batman turns to a trembling Silver who is paralyzed
with fear.

BATMAN
Stay here!  It's me they want...

SILVER
Don't leave me!!

Batman turns and looks:  she is a quaking mess.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Oh, please?  I've been a pretty
cheap date so far.

BATMAN
(pause)
Let's go.

He takes her hand as they run into the alleyway.

ANGLE ON SKY

The Penguin's group have reassembled in a formation and start another
power dive.

INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

The screen is totally black.  Suddenly - one glaring yellow headlight
in the shape of an eye appears!  Then another.

ANGLE ON ENGINES

Twin turbine engines fire up - their glowing red exhaust filling the
screen.

ANGLE ON STREET

THE BATMOBILE screams from the alley out into the street.  A sleek,
powerful, futuristic panther of a car - jet black with a domed
interior.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

The interior is a glistening, intricate maze of computers, screens, and
complicated electrical systems.  Silver's eyes are frozen open in
astonishment.  Batman looks over.

BATMAN
Please don't touch anything.

SILVER
Like the cigarette lighter?

Batman smiles, points it out.  There is one.

ANGLE ON SKY

The Penguin and his three Jetpack Bandits zoom down at the car, their
mounted machine guns BLAZING.  Bandit #1 powers forward, spewing
bullets as he comes.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

A succession of RICOCHET HITS on the Batmobile roof causes Silver to
hunch over in terror as Batman flips a switch.

ANGLE ON BATMOBILE

The two coiled cylinders under either side of the car suddenly eject
intersecting streams of blue light (the force field we saw tested in
the Batcave) which now bathes the entire vehicle in a SOLID BLUE GLOW.

A new hail of bullets ricochets off the impregnable field of blue
light, zinging back up into the air in the direction from which they
came.

ANGLE ON BANDITS

Their face registering horror as several of their own bullets whizz by
them, narrowly missing!  They soar higher to avoid their own fire.

BACK ON BATMOBILE

Speeding down an avenue along the side of the park.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Silver looks over hopefully.

SILVER
I guess we frightened them off.

Batman shakes his head, flips another switch:  A small radar screen
lights up.  Three blinking LIGHT BLIPS are still following them.
Batman suddenly looks ahead, eyes widening.

ANOTHER CAR heads directly at them, guns blazing!

SILVER (CONT'D)
I think I'll keep my mouth shut.

ANGLE ON STREET

The HOOD CAR swerves off the street into the park.  The Batmobile
squeals into a 180 and roars after it.

ANGLE ON PENGUIN IN SKY

The Penguin watches from the sky with satisfaction.

PENGUIN
He's taken the bait...

He motions two Bandits to fly off in another direction, then:  swivels
in mid-air, points Bandit #3 down at the Batmobile.

PENGUIN (CONT'D)
The tires, you Cretin!  Go for the tires!

ANGLE ON PARK ROAD

The Batmobile pursues the Hood Car through the park as Bandit #3 looms
up from behind, guns blazing.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Batman looks over at a terrified Silver reassuringly.

BATMAN
Don't worry...

SILVER
Worry?
(trying nonchalance)
How's the...ah...mileage on this?

BATMAN
It doesn't use gasoline.

SILVER
Of course not.  Silly of me...

ANGLE ON BANDIT #3

Guns blazing down at the road behind the Batmobile.

ANGLE ON ROAD

A stream of bullets advances inexorably toward the rear tires of the
Batmobile.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Batman realizes what's happening and presses a button.

ANGLE ON REAR OF BATMOBILE

Steel casings drop down over the tires as the bullets make contact too
late, ping off them harmlessly.

ANGLE ON BANDIT #3

Whizzing along through the air behind the Batmobile, registering his
frustration.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

BATMAN
Do you know what the number one hazard
is on the American road these days?

SILVER
(weak smile)
Surprise me...

BATMAN
Tailgaters.

ANGLE ON REAR OF BATMOBILE

The trunk of the Batmobile suddenly pops open!  A giant horseshoe
magnet swivels, pointing out behind the car!

ANGLE ON BANDIT #3

Screaming, wide-eyed, as the force of the powerful magnet spins him in
mid-air and he is sucked into the trunk by his jetpack.  The trunk
closes on him, slamming shut.

ANGLE ON PENGUIN IN SKY

The Penguin looks down disgustedly, then lifts his gaze ahead and
below, into the park.

EXT. PARK - ANGLE ON CURVE - NIGHT

A Bandit watches near a curve in the park road as the Hood Car roars
by.  He gestures impatiently off into the darkness.

Bandit #2 settles in behind a jest of rocks, trains an automatic weapon
back down the road.

BACK TO BATMOBILE

Roaring through the park TOWARD CAMERA.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Batman looks ahead, suddenly worried.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Two blazing headlights seem to be speeding directly at him, growing
larger by the second!

BACK TO BATMOBILE

SILVER
Hit the brakes!  Hit the brakes!

Batman grimly steps on the accelerator!

ANGLE ON FRONT BUMPER

Now emerging from the front of the Batmobile:  a long, black battering
ram with a RAZOR SHARP GLEAMING STEEL TIP!

BACK TO VIEW THROUGH WINDSHIELD

The two oncoming headlights are about to make contact as:

WIDER ANGLE

The Batmobile EXPLODES though what was a GIANT MIRROR in a sea of
flying glass!

Bandit #2 lets off an ineffectual burst of automatic fire, now lowers
his weapon in disgust as the vehicle roars on.

BACK TO PENGUIN IN SKY

Gritting his teeth in frustration, looking up ahead.

EXT. PARK - ANGLE OF BRIDGE OVER LAKE - NIGHT

The Park road curves onto a bridge which spans the park lake.  The Hood
Car speeds quickly across it.

ANGLE BELOW BRIDGE

A Bandit stands by a plunger-detonator device.

BACK TO BRIDGE

The Batmobile starts across at full speed.  Suddenly - A HUGE EXPLOSION
collapses the section of the bridge directly in front of it!

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Plummeting down through the air toward the lake.  Batman works his
controls frantically as Silver screams!

ANGLE ON LAKE

The Batmobile plunges into the lake!  A brilliant SHOWER OF BLUE SPARKS
explode across the water's surface as the vehicle disappears.  For a
moment, all is still.

ANGLE ON PENGUIN IN AIR

The Penguin looks down, ""clucking"" contentedly.  His expression
suddenly starts to change.

ANGLE ON LAKE - HIS P.O.V.

Slowly re-emerging on the surface of the lake:  The Batmobile!  Its
roaring turbine engines propel it forward, now supported by TWO
HYDROFOIL PONTOONS!  The makeshift craft speeds over the water at
speedboat velocity.

The Batmobile reaches shore, churning up chunks of mud as the pontoons
contract and the car bounces onto the park road.  The protective blue
light has been extinguished.  From either side:  two Hood Cars
approach, machine guns blazing!

Batman swerves the Batmobile onto the grass, roars cross-country toward
a park exit as the hail of bullets begins to make CRACKS across its
protective dome.

ANGLE ON PARK EXIT AND STREET

The Batmobile speeds out into the street.  One Hood Car is in hot
pursuit - the other exits the park a block ahead and roars at the
Batmobile from the other direction!

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Silver looks over at Batman, trembling, as more bullets ""chunk"" into
the car dome, weakening it further.

SILVER
Listen...it was nice of you to offer
to take me home, but maybe I'd
better grab a cab...

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The Batmobile is about to become a sandwich as Batman suddenly squeals
the vehicle into a parking building!  The Hood Cars do respective 180's
and follow suit.

INT. PARKING BUILDING - NIGHT

The Batmobile roars around hairpin turns, ascending the levels of the
parking building like a sportscar.

The Hood Cars screech after him, gaining speed.  They pursue Batman
higher and higher, threading the narrow openings through the lines of
parked cars, tearing off side mirrors, doors, and fenders on their way
by.

ANGLE ON HIGHER LEVEL

The Batmobile, reaching the level just under the roof, squeals around a
corner, catches the fender of a parked car, and spins out of control!

Batman slams on the brakes as the Batmobile skids and turns to face:

The two Hood Cars, which have stopped so that they are completely
blocking off the exit ramps, up and down.  The OCCUPANTS stare in
amazement as the Batmobile suddenly roars at them!

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Batman's jaw sets as he looks forward.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD

A sign at the bottom of a narrow ramp leading to the roof screams in
red letters:  WRONG WAY - DO NOT ENTER - SEVERE TIRE DAMAGE!

BACK TO PARKING LEVEL

The Batmobile shoots up the wrong-way ramp!

CLOSE OF METAL TEETH

As the Batmobile's tires make contact with the viciously protruding
metal teeth - ALL FOUR TIRES BLOW!  The vehicle roars on, flub-a-
dubbing up toward the roof.

EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

The Batmobile exits onto the roof as the two Hood Cars, appearing from
the proper ramp, fan out to flank it.

ANGLE ON PENGUIN IN AIR

The Penguin takes up a position in mid-air just above and past the
roof, ""clucking"" with glee as he sees the Batman is hopelessly trapped.

BACK TO ROOF

The two Hood Cars close in on the Batmobile from either side.  Batman
is running out of room.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Silver looks through the windshield in despair!

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD

The edge of the roof looms up rapidly!

SILVER'S VOICE
Oh, my God!

She looks over at Batman whose JAW SUDDENLY TWITCHES!

EXTREME CLOSE ON SILVER

She has seen his jaw twitch!  She stares in disbelief, realizing the
implications.

SILVER
(whisper)
Oh, my God...

BATMAN
Hang on!

Batman presses a RED BUTTON!

EXTREME CLOSE ON EXHAUST

The Batmobile's twin turbine engines EXPLODE WITH A WHITE FLAME!  Jet-
propelled afterburners ignite!

WIDER ANGLE

The Batmobile has reached the edge of the roof, now LAUNCHES ITSELF
into space in an upwards arc!

The two Hood Cars are unable to cope with the sudden void between them
and crash head-on with a sickening crunch!

ANGLE ON PENGUIN IN MID-AIR

Staring in total shock - frozen in mid-air as the Batmobile arcs up
toward him.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

The figure of the Penguin grows rapidly larger through the windshield.
BATMAN HONKS AT HIM!

BACK TO MID-AIR

The Penguin takes a panicked, last-second evasive action, diving low as
the Batmobile streaks by:

The white-hot turbine flames from the vehicle's exhaust crease the top
of his umbrella-copter's whirling ribs, MELTING THEM INTO DISFIGURED
CURLEQUES!

The Penguin looks up in despair as his umbrella-copter begins to spin
out of control.  He gives a birdlike SCREECH, then zig-zags helplessly
through the air!

BACK TO BATMOBILE

The sleek vehicle completes its downward arc through the air and lands
on the roof of the building across the street.

EXT. GOTHAM SKY

The Penguin cartwheels end over end through the air, his umbrella-
copter sputtering.

INT. RICH APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dozens of GUESTS surround a lavishly decorated banquet table in an
expensive apartment.  A Bar Mitzvah celebration is in progress.  The
proud FATHER puts a loving arm around his thirteen-year-old son.

FATHER
And so, Marvin, on this most special
of all days, your mother and I have
prepared a big surprise for you...

ANGLE ON SIDE OF APARTMENT BUILDING

The spinning, rudderless Penguin careens through an open window on the
side of the apartment building.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

The Penguin crash-lands on the end of the banquet table, sending food
and Guests flying everywhere as he skids along, clearing it, finally
splattering to a stop through an enormous pile of chicken livers into a
mountain of cracked ice under a banner reading:  TODAY YOU ARE A MAN.

The stunned Guests hesitate a moment, then burst into wild,
unrestrained APPLAUSE!

EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

The Batmobile sits parked on the roof where it landed.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Batman looks over at Silver who has fainted dead away.  She murmurs as
he gently prods her.

BATMAN
Miss St. Cloud...Miss St. Cloud?

Silver's eyes flutter open, trying to regain focus.

BATMAN (CONT'D)
May I take you home now?

INT. SILVER'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

Batman and Silver stop at her apartment door.  She smiles at him
through smeared elevator cable grease.

BATMAN
I'm...very sorry for tonight.  You
must have been terrified.

SILVER
Well, I've thought of a way you can
make it up to me.

Batman looks at her curiously.  She suddenly kisses him, deeply.  He
allows it, unwilling or unable to pull away.

CLOSE-UP

Silver's eyes open.  She knows - or thinks she does.

They break.  Silver smiles mysteriously, whistles under her breath,
enters her apartment.

INT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She leans against the door, sighs.  Could it be true?

BACK TO BATMAN

On the other side of the door, worried.  Does she know?

INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

The quiz show The Joker Is Wild broadcasts before a live audience.  A
CONTESTANT stands by three large video panels in the shape of a slot
machine.

JACK BARRY
All right, Otto, you've got two
thousand dollars.  Spin the wheel!

Otto pulls a lever - the first panel screen lights up.

JACK BARRY (CONT'D)
Joker...
(next panel)
Joker...
(next panel)
Joker!

A burst of machine gun fire riddles the third panel to shreds.
Stepping through it - the Joker.  An armed Gang rushes in after him,
holds Jack Barry and the audience at bay.  The Joker steps to center
stage.

JOKER
Good evening, ladies and germs.  I
Just flew in from Lost Wages,
Nevada, and boy, are my arms tired!

He giggles.  There is a stony silence from the audience.

JOKER (CONT'D)
Gimme a break, folks, I'm a Veteran.
Man walks into a bar, says, ""Have
you got any Wild Turkey?""  Bartender
say, ""No, but I can get a tame one
and irritate it for you.""

He roars.  The audience stares back.  His eyes narrow.

JOKER (CONT'D)
But I digress.  You see, I'm in the
process of developing a new series...
(evil smile)
...of killings.  All original, all
different, believe me, folks, you're
gonna die laughing.  And there's only
one man who can cancel my little show
the Batman.  Because from now
on, each time he appears in public,
every time he's seen anywhere - one
prominent citizen of Gotham will die.
(to camera)
I'm tired of fighting you, Batman,
so the people are going to do it for
me.  Either you lose...
(at audience)
or they do.

INT. WAYNE MANOR STUDY - NIGHT

CAMERA CLOSE on a television screen - the crackling face of the Joker
disappears.

Bruce flips off a VCR, looks over at a worried Alfred.

BRUCE
When did you tape this?

ALFRED
Not quite an hour ago.

Bruce rises, begins to pace.

ALFRED (CONT'D)
Why can't you do what he did, Sir?
Go on television as the Batman, and
explain your case to the people.

BRUCE
And risk having an innocent human being
murdered for my sake?  I can't chance it.

Bruce turns away in disgust, his mind racing.

ALFRED
(sympathetic)
Well...perhaps a night on the town
as Bruce Wayne might be therapeutic
for you after all.  You do have
tickets for the gala opening of the
opera.  I was planning on using one
myself, but if you'd prefer a more
lively and decorative companion I
quite understand.

BRUCE
You know what?  It's been so long I
can't even think of whom to call
anymore.

ALFRED
Not even one name?

BRUCE
(sudden grin)
Well maybe just one.

EXT. GOTHAM OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

Dozens of shiny limousines disgorge Gotham's formally dressed ELITE in
front of the opera house.  Photographer's flashbulbs indicate that it
is indeed a gala opening.  The billboard marquee advertises:
I PAGLIACCI.

CAMERA PANS to one arriving limo and we hear a TELEPHONE RINGING over
the scene.  Silver's VOICE answers it.

SILVER'S VOICE
Hi.  This is Silver.  I'm not home
right now, but if you'd leave a
message at the ""beep,"" I'll get back
to you as soon as I can.

The limo pulls up to the front of the opera house.  Silver exits in a
shimmering evening gown.  AT THE SOUND OF THE ""BEEP"" we see her escort:
Rupert Thorne.  They make their way inside past a battery of
photographers.

INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

A maze of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE mingles in the lobby, exchanging greetings
and appreciative glances.  An ARMY ARCHERD-type comments on the passing
parade for local television.

ARMY ARCHERD
...I'm telling you, they're all
here tonight, folks!  Newsome two-
somes, tiresome twosomes, from show
biz, sports, politics...
(looks off)
There's millionaire socialite, Bruce
Wayne!

ANGLE ON BRUCE

As Bruce makes his way through the throng with Alfred.

BACK TO SCENE

ARMY ARCHERD
(turning)
And here's a man for all seasons -
Gotham's own City Councilman, Rupert
Thorne!

Thorne slides up to Archerd with a hearty smile.  Silver hangs back,
suddenly spotting Bruce, surprised.

CLOSE ON BRUCE

Having spotted Silver too.  Gazing in frustration.

BACK TO SILVER

She locks eyes with Bruce as Rupert slides his arm around Army
Archerd's shoulder.

ARMY ARCHERD
I didn't realize you were an opera
fan, Councilman...

THORNE
To tell the truth, I'm not, Army,
but any elected official with as
many Italian constituents as I have
would be darn well advised to give
it a try.

Rupert laughs heartily as suddenly:  A HUGE COMMOTION is heard outside!
MUFFLED GASPS give way to FRANTIC MURMURS, then local silence as:  The
Batman appears in the doorway!

Rupert stares, wide-eyed.  Archerd blinks in disbelief as the Crowd
parts and Batman enters the lobby.

CLOSE ON BRUCE

Frozen.  He exchanges an incredulous glance with Alfred.

CLOSE ON SILVER

Totally taken aback.  Her gaze flicks from Bruce to Batman to Bruce to
Batman like someone watching a tennis match.

ANGLE ON GORDON AT TOP OF STAIRS

Gordon stands in a group at the top of the stairs to the mezzanine,
looking down in dismay.

BACK TO SCENE

The Batman joins Rupert and Archerd at the microphone with a cold and
distant air.  (His resemblance to Bruce is uncanny.)  Archerd swallows
nervously.

ARCHERD
You're...taking quite a chance,
showing up in public like this,
aren't you, Batman?

BATMAN
The way I see it, we're all taking
quite a chance if we let a sick
criminal mind like the Joker paralyze
this entire community with fear.

An angry MUTTERING is heard from within the Crowd.

CROWD MEMBER
Sure.  He's not the one who's
going to get killed...

Batman's head snaps around angrily at the remark.

BATMAN
Step forward and say that to my
face, if you've got the guts!

The Crowd hangs back, confused and frightened.  More angry muttering is
heard, now mixed in with boos.

CROWD #2
CROWD #3
					 Get him out of here!
Go home, Batman!

The boos grow louder and defiant, as Gordon hurries to the fake
Batman's side and Thorne smiles thinly at the imposter.

THORNE
It seems you're not exactly the
people's choice anymore, Batman...

GORDON
(at Batman)
C'mon.  Let me get you out of here
before these gentle people tear you
up into little pieces...

Gordon leads a reluctant Batman away through the jeering Crowd.  Bruce
watches in horror with Alfred as the taunts continue.

CROWD #4
CROWD #5
		   Leave us alone!
I'm not getting killed for

you!

ALFRED
(grim whisper)
A rather cruel sort of joke,
wouldn't you say?

BRUCE
(nods coldly)
And I don't think we've heard the
punch line yet.

Gordon appears in the doorway, raises his arms to quiet the panicking
Crowd.

GORDON
Settle down, folks!  Take it easy
now!  I've got half the police in
this city on their way over here!
So if you'll all take your seats...

CROWD #6
CROWD #7
						 Is he crazy?
Let's get out of here!

THORNE
(into mike)
Wait!!

There is a hush.  A stern-faced Thorne plays to his audience for all
he's worth.

THORNE (CONT'D)
What the Batman just did was inex-
cusable.  Perhaps even criminal.
But he's right about one thing.  No
cheap hoodlum is going to intimidate
Rupert Thorne while I still have the
saliva to spit on him!  My ticket
says seat E-6, and that's where I'm
parking my keyster for the next
few hours!
(pause; low voice)
And I call upon His Honor, the
Mayor, to join me in the audience.

The Crowd looks over to the side of the lobby:

GOTHAM'S MAYOR emerges from a group of onlookers.  A grey-haired man
who is visibly terrified, he swallows hard.

MAYOR
Councilman Thorne is right, of
course.  And I expect every other
decent citizen of Gotham City to
stand up and be counted.

The Mayor silently starts up the stairs to the mezzanine.  After a
beat, Thorne theatrically extends his arm to Silver who hesitates, then
reluctantly joins him.  They start for the orchestra section as others
in the Crowd begin to follow.

CLOSE ON BRUCE

Watching Silver disappear.  His jaw twitches.

INT. OPERA MEZZANINE - NIGHT

Bruce and Alfred head for their box.  The Mayor approaches from the
other direction, now escorted by Gordon and a phalanx of Police.  The
Mayor sees Bruce and stops to shake hands.

MAYOR
It's good of you to stay, Bruce...

BRUCE
You've made a courageous decision,
Your Honor.  I hope it's the right
one.

The Mayor nods grimly, enters his box.  The Police form a guard by the
door.

INT. BRUCE'S BOX - NIGHT

As Bruce and Alfred enter.  Gordon stands in their box, a radio
receiver in his ear.  A loud ovation is heard.

WIDE SHOT - AUDIENCE

The audience is on its feet, facing away from the stage, applauding the
Mayor in his box.  The Mayor lifts his arms in a victory salute.  The
applause dies down.  The lights dim.  The Overture to I Pagliacci is
heard, O.S.   CAMERA RISES past the Mayor and his party to the hanging
chandelier directly above him.  The fixture consists of huge crystal
teardrops.

EXTREME CLOSE ON CHANDELIER

One of the crystals is filled with a clear liquid.

BACK TO BRUCE

Bruce and Alfred settle into their chairs.  Gordon mumbles into his
radio receiver, ever watchful.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

INT. OPERA HOUSE - ANGLE ON STAGE

The Leading Man (CANIO), dressed as a clown, sings the aria ""Vesti La
Giubba"".  A passionate, sad piece.  He kneels in front of a large
gaily-painted drum.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

Alfred nods off in his chair.  Bruce elbows him gently.

BACK TO CANIO

Approaching the high point of the aria.  With a magnificent voice, he
reaches for a ""High C"", hits it strongly and purely, holds on to the
note.

ANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX

The Mayor and his party exchange impressed glances.  CAMERA PUSHES IN
ON the chandelier teardrop.  It trembles from the force of the High C -
now cracks.  The liquid drips down into the box.

BACK TO STAGE

The sad aria is ending.  Canio is on his knees, sobbing.  He sings
pianissimo, milking every heart-breaking second.  Suddenly - O.S. - a
chuckle.  Then the sound of laughter.  Canio peers angrily into the
audience.

ANGLE ON AUDIENCE

Confused, then irritated, as the laughter grows louder.

ANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX

The Mayor and his Party guffaw loudly, pounding their chairs in glee.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

Bruce rises from his seat, concerned.

BACK TO MAYOR

Tears of laughter stream down the Mayor's cheeks.  He is on his feet
now, totally out of control.  The others flop over their chairs,
roaring helplessly.

BACK TO CANIO

He walks off the stage in disgust.

BACK TO MAYOR'S BOX

With a sudden, final burst of insane giggling - all four men collapse.
The Mayor hangs over the edge of his box, dead - a grotesque grin
frozen on his face.

ANGLE ON AUDIENCE

Gasping.  Panicking.  As:

ANGLE ON STAGE

The huge clown drum suddenly rips apart from the center.  The Joker
steps out, dressed as an obese soprano.

JOKER
Wait!  The opera's not over till the
fat lady sings!

The Joker hits his own version of a High C as:

GORDON'S VOICE
Open fire!

The lights go out.  Gunfire and screaming are heard in the darkness.
Total pandemonium.

INSERT SHOT - GOTHAM TRIBUNE

The Gotham Tribune cartwheels into frame:  CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME MAKES
GOOD ON BOAST.  Rupert Thorne appointed acting Mayor.  In the center of
the page:  a large photograph of the Batman with the caption:  A
KILLER?

INT. BATCAVE - WIDE ANGLE - DAY

Bruce paces dejectedly, a tiny figure lost in the vastness of the
enormous cavern.

ANGLE FROM STAIRS

Alfred watches sadly from the top of the stairs.

BACK TO BRUCE

Still pacing.  Thinking.  He passes the huge crime computer, pauses,
looks down, punches some keys.

ANGLE ON COMPUTER SCREEN

A series of CRIMINAL MUG SHOTS flashes across the screen, law-breakers
of every variety, finally stopping at:

The face of the Joker - grinning down menacingly.

BACK TO BRUCE

Staring back.  Face set.  Jaw twitching.

The screen suddenly goes blank.

WIDER ANGLE

Alfred has turned off the computer.  Bruce stares numbly.

ALFRED
Sir, I...
(swallows)
Perhaps...this isn't the only way.
Perhaps this is all meant to signal
a...a new beginning for you.  After
all, you're an intelligent, enter-
prising young man with every capa-
bility in the world to...

Bruce puts his hand on Alfred's shoulder.

BRUCE
I...know you love me very much, and I'm
deeply grateful, but I wish you'd get
out of here now, and leave me alone.

Alfred pauses, then nods, walks off dejectedly.

CLOSE ON BRUCE

He wanders through the cave with glassy eyes, passing a table near the
Batmobile.  On it - a new version of the battering ram.  Bruce picks it
up, smiles bitterly, carries it in one hand as he continues to wander,
passing the crime lab section.

Suddenly - he lashes out - sends the battering ram flying through a set
of glass beakers filled with chemicals.  Swinging it wildly now, he
destroys a section of the crime lab, then sinks heavily into a chair,
head bowed.

EXTREME WIDE ANGLE

The cavernous Batcave.  The tiny, slumped figure of Bruce.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - WIDE ANGLE - DAY

The hot noonday sun drenches the spacious grounds of Wayne Manor.  Seen
running along a track cut on the periphery of the estate:  the solitary
figure of Bruce Wayne.

INT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - DAY

Alfred watches from the window, concerned, as O.S., the TELEPHONE
starts to RING.

EXT. RUNNING TRACK - DAY

CAMERA CLOSE on Bruce's grimly determined face, oblivious to the
rivulets of sweat which pour down freely.  His body is encased in
several layers of exercise clothes, deeply stained by perspiration,
that turn him into a human pressure cooker.  His legs churn like
disassociated pistons.

BACK TO ALFRED

The telephone continues to RING.  Alfred turns, still distracted by the
sight of Bruce and answers it.

ALFRED
(into phone)
Mr. Wayne's residence...I'm sorry, he's
not available...No, as I told you previ-
ously, I don't know when that would be,
but if you'd care to leave another
message...

INT. CITY HALL OFFICE - DAY

CAMERA CLOSE on the door to an inner office marked:  Special Assistant
to the Mayor - Private.

The door opens as Silver exits into her outer office, followed by
several NEEDY-LOOKING CONSTITUENTS.

SILVER
...I'll take it up with Mayor
Thorne.  Gotham needs an effective
network of daycare centers, and
tomorrow night's charity opening of
the circus seems like a good place
to start.

The Constituents thank her profusely.  Silver crosses to her
SECRETARY's desk with a hopeful look.

SILVER
Any luck?

SECRETARY
Nada.  Mr. Wayne seems to be perma-
nently...unavailable.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

Wayne Manor seems deserted under the glow of the moon.

ANGLE ON BRUCE IN POOL

The Olympic-sized Wayne Manor swimming pool is illuminated by the glow
of outdoor lights.  In it:  Bruce swims laps, knifing through the water
with powerful strokes.

EXT. POOL - CLOSE ON BRUCE - NIGHT

Bruce churns through the water, eyes glazed with a total single-
mindedness.  His speed is Olympian.  As he tilts his head to take
another gulp of air, he suddenly stops dead in the water as he sees:

ANGLE ON SILVER - HIS P.O.V.

Silver emerges from the darkness, her glistening hair cascading down
over an evening dress.  She carries a wooden tray with two glasses of
champagne on it, smiles as she faces a stunned Bruce who stands waist-
high in the water.

SILVER
You know, Bruce, you simply must
pick up your phone messages.

BRUCE
(careful pause)
If I did - what would they say?

SILVER
That we were supposed to have dinner
tonight.

Silver smiles, kicks off her shoes.

SILVER (CONT'D)
For some strange reason, I thought you
might suddenly have an evening free.


BRUCE
Silver...look...
(with difficulty)
I...hope you won't misunderstand
what I'm about to say...

SILVER
There aren't going to be any more
Misunderstandings between us, Bruce.
And I warn you.

Silver slowly and calmly begins walking down the steps into the pool,
carrying the tray with her.  The water rises above the hemline of her
evening dress, heading up for her waist as she advance toward as
astonished Bruce.

SILVER (CONT'D)
I can be a very determined person.

Silver arrives at Bruce, the water now up to her chest, letting the
wooden tray with the champagne float on the surface next to them.  She
hands him a glass, takes the other herself, raises it, stares deeply
into his eyes.

SILVER (CONT'D)
To no more misunderstandings.

Bruce smiles in spite of himself, tosses back his champagne, then
studies her unwavering gaze carefully.  Flipping the glass over his
head, he suddenly pulls her toward him, locking her in a passionate,
hungry kiss.

They finally break.  Silver purrs, whispers into his ear.

SILVER (CONT'D)
There...see what I mean about mis-
understandings?

BRUCE
No.  What?

SILVER
Well just now - a moment ago - I
thought you were being rude, not
getting out of the pool to say hello.
(looks down; grins)
I didn't realize you weren't wearing
a bathing suit.

INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bruce lies naked under powder-blue silk sheets.  A lovely hand comes
INTO FRAME, gently strokes his cheek.

SILVER (O.S.)
When I think of how many nights I've
reached across an empty pillow, hoping
my hand would find that face...

Then - a shining mane of hair as Silver, also naked, wraps him in a
tight embrace.  They kiss.

BRUCE
There's so much to explain.  And I'm
not quite sure I ever can.

SILVER
I don't need explanations.  I just
want whatever it was to evaporate.
to simple disappear...

She rolls over, looks at him carefully.  A Police siren is heard
faintly in the distance.  Bruce blinks.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Did you ever meet him?

BRUCE
Who?

SILVER
The Batman.
(smiles)
Every time I hear a siren.  I think
of the Batman.

BRUCE
I...ran into him a few times.  Here
and there.

Silver smiles down tenderly, studying him.

SILVER
You know...that night at the opera.  I
never believed that the real Batman
would show up like that in public -
not when he knew someone else's life
was on the line.

BRUCE
(deadly stare)
You're right.  He wouldn't.

Bruce suddenly breaks eye contact, unsure if she thinks she's talking
about Batman or to Batman.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
You...met him too one night, didn't
you?  Commissiner Gordon told me he
took you home or something.

SILVER
(smiles; remembers)
Or something.
(pause)
What can I say?  He was dashing, re-
sourceful, strong - very sweet in
his own special way - all the
things you'd expect from the Batman.
(grins)
The next morning I told Rupert I'd
fallen madly in love with him.

BRUCE
You don't say.

SILVER
(penetrating gaze)
And what's more - I told Rupert I
was sure that the Batman...had
fallen in love with me.

They look deeply into each other's eyes.  Silver smiles.

BRUCE
I...think I'm jealous.

SILVER
I think I'm in love.

They wrap themselves in each other passionately.

EXT. GOTHAM CIRCUS GROUNDS - NIGHT

A billboard:  THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH.  Featuring - The Flying
Graysons.  All new spectacular extravaganza - THE GLORY THAT WAS ROME.
Past the billboard is a maze of smaller tents for sideshows, the
housing of animals, etc.  Past the - the big top itself.

CAMERA PANS the arriving SPECTATORS, Bruce and Silver among them.  They
are surrounded by mothers and children.

BRUCE
It's almost immoral, you know.
Going to the circus without bringing
your own children along.

SILVER
Don't worry.  I've made plans for
the next time.

Bruce looks over, alarmed.  Silver grins.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Lighten up.  My sister has two kids.

INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT

A major parade (The Glory That Was Rome) is filing out.  Pretty GIRLS
in togas ride elephants.  Handsome CHARIOTEERS drive by, GLADIATORS
with trained bears, etc.

RINGMASTER (V.O.)
And there you have it, ladies and
gentlemen, The Glory That Was Rome!

ANGLE ON AUDIENCE

Bruce and Silver sit in the audience applauding.  He eats popcorn.  She
munches on cotton candy.

ANGLE ON BIG TOP ENTRANCE

A dozen CLOWNS of every shape and variety run into the arena, squirting
water at each other through toy guns, roughhousing, doing pratfalls,
etc., all to the delight of the Crowd.

ANGLE INTO ARENA FROM TUNNEL

Inside an entrance tunnel, CAMERA HOLDS behind the outline of a black-
cowled head with pointed ears!  The head lowers OUT OF FRAME, then
reappears, this time covered by a CLOWN MASK!

The Clown Figure hurries out of the tunnel, wearing a floor-lengthed
granny dress.

BACK TO ARENA

Several of the other Clowns have dispersed, running up into the
audience as a DRUM ROLL is heard.  The Granny Clown edges over toward
the cage containing the big cats.

BACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER

One Clown runs up the aisle past them with what seems to be a bucket of
water, spots Silver, flings the contents of the bucket at her!  Bruce
and Silver flinch as a SHOWER OF CONFETTI blankets them to general
laughter and applause.

RINGMASTER (V.O.)
Now let me direct your attention to
the trapeze and high wire.  Out
stars of the evening - The Flying
Graysons!

ANGLE ON GRAYSONS

A family of aerialists.  The older Graysons, trim and athletic, stand
on one platform.  Their son, DICK, stands on the other.  He is in his
middle teens, a handsome young man in immaculate physical shape.  He
takes hold of a trapeze, swings down.

ANGLE ON STANDS

The Clown who poured the confetti on Bruce and Silver watches through
pancake makeup with more than a passing interest.  Protruding from
underneath a large silly hat:  we see the edges of a startling green
shock of hair.

ANGLE ON DICK

Dick Grayson swings on the trapeze in a long, powerful arc, executes a
difficult flip into the arms of his father.

BACK TO BRUCE

BRUCE
Remarkable.  That young boy's one of
the greatest natural aerialists I've
ever seen.

SILVER
Oh?  I didn't realize you were so
familiar with the sport.

Silver gives Bruce a sideways look which he avoids.

RINGMASTER (V.O.)
And now Dick Grayson will attempt to
perform the incredible ""Quadruple!""
Without a net!  He is the only flier
in the world to accomplish this feet!

ANGLE ON DICK

A DRUM ROLL is heard.  Dick swings down, picking up momentum, then back
up, then down again.  On his third pass, he tries it:  revolves
dizzyingly - MAKING FOUR COMPLETE SOMERSAULTS IN MID-AIR!  (Note:
There is, actually, only one person in the world who can do this, with
Ringling Bros.)  Dick completes the impossible feat to wild applause.

ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SILVER

On their feet, applauding enthusiastically with the Crowd.

ANGLE ON CLOWN (JOKER)

The Clown (Joker) giggles under his breath, lifts one billowing sleeve
of his oversized costume, begins to unbutton it.

RINGMASTER (V.O.)
The Graysons will now perform their
world-famous maneuver on the high-
wire - passing each other and
exchanging positions - all without
a net!

BACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER

Both starring up, wide-eyed.

ANGLE ON GRAYSONS

The older Graysons stand at either end of a high wire some seventy feet
off the ground.  They each hold a long balancing pole, now start
forward toward each other.

ANGLE ON DICK

Dick looks up from below, nervous but proud.

RINGMASTER (V.O.)
The slightest vibration - the
tiniest misstep - could send them
both plunging to their death.

BACK TO GRAYSONS

Inching forward toward each other along the taut wire, using their
balancing poles for support.

ANGLE ON JOKER

All eyes are riveted on the Graysons.  The Joker opens the billowing
sleeve of his clown costume.  Popping out:  A LIVE FALCON.  It
hesitates, then takes off!

BACK TO GRAYSONS

They're face to face now, on the wire, preparing to pass each other
above the hushed Crowd.  Suddenly - the falcon flies into view, lands
heavily on one end of the male Grayson's pole with a SHRIEK!  The
surprised man teeters - the wire trembles - the falcon suddenly flies
at his face!  Both Grayson's tumble off the wire together, plummet
downward.

ANGLE ON DICK

As his parents hit the ground heavily in front of him.

ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SILVER

Silver screams in horror.  Bruce stares unbelievingly.

ANGLE NEAR BIG CAT CAGE

Suddenly:  the Granny Clown standing by the big cat cage rips his mask
away!  The dress falls to the ground, revealing:

THE BATMAN!

QUICK CUTS

1. The Crowd gasps.

2. Bruce gapes in disbelief as Silver watches him.

3. Dick Grayson looks over from the bodies of his parents.

4. The Joker grins.

CLOSE ON BATMAN

The Batman stares coldly, speaks in a icily clear voice.

BATMAN
I've risked my life to help this
city.  I stood up for what I knew
was right because I thought you
people were willing to stand with
me.  Well, now you can pay for your
cowardice.  Now I don't care how
many have to die.

ANGLE ON BRUCE AND CROWD

An angry MURMURING rumbles through the Crowd.

CROWD #1
CROWD #2
		  Stop him!
Don't let him get away!

Bruce vaults into the aisle, lunges down the steps after the fake
Batman as:

CLOSE ON JOKER

The Joker takes off his huge clown nose, throws it into the arena - a
giant smoke bomb!

All over the arena, OTHER CLOWNS follow suit.  The big top has become a
scene of impenetrable chaos as:

THE FAKE BATMAN OPENS THE DOOR TO THE BIG CATS CAGE!  Lions, tigers, et
al., bound off their perches for freedom, rushing out of the cage to
the SCREAMS of the Crowd.

The fake Batman disappears into an enveloping wall of smoke.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

Knifing his way through the panicked Spectators, lunging through the
smoke after the fake Batman.

ANGLE ON SILVER

Silver stumbles after Bruce through the pandemonium, reaching the empty
cat cage, gasping for breath with teary eyes.

SILVER
Bruce...?  Bruce!

BACK TO BRUCE

Nearby.  Spotting her.  Eyes widening in horror!

BRUCE
Silver, look out!

ANGLE ON SILVER

A HUGE TIGER SNARLS, preparing to spring at her!  It launches itself
into mid-air as:

Bruce flies at Silver from the other direction, pulling her down to the
ground as the enormous cat sails over them, banging its head into the
cage bars, knocking itself senseless.

Bruce pulls Silver to her feet, wraps a protective arm around her,
leads her off through the smoky panic and confusion.

ANGLE ON DICK GRAYSON

Dick kneels protectively over the bodies of his parents, oblivious to
the insanity around him.  Spectators and Animals rush past in all
directions as he removes his aerialist's cape, then gently covers the
faces of his Mother and Father.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - NIGHT

CAMERA LOOKS DOWN on the aftermath.  Police cars and ambulances
everywhere.  Smoke still drifts from the big top.  Dazed PATRONS mill
around looking for lost family members.

ANGLE NEAR BIG TOP ENTRANCE

Silver emerges from a medical tent marked by a red cross, sporting a
heavily bandaged hand.  She spots Alfred and the Rolls Royce near the
entrance to the big top, walks over.

SILVER
The doctor says no more crap games
for a week or so, Alfred...
(stops; looks)
Where's Bruce?

ALFRED
(hesitantly)
Mr. Wayne wondered...if you'd be good
enough to let me drive you home.

SILVER
Drive me...

She looks off into the big top:

ANGLE ON BRUCE - HER P.O.V.

Bruce stands motionless in the dark shadows at one end of the tent.  He
stares across the arena:

ANGLE ON DICK - BRUCE'S P.O.V.

Dick Grayson sits alone in the corner, head bowed.

BACK TO BRUCE

Bruce's eyes are filled with tears.

BACK TO SILVER

Silver watches, somehow feeling the deep significance of the moment
without the specifics.  She turns to Alfred quietly, nods, gets in the
car.

INT. TENT - CLOSE ON DICK

Dick is slumped, his head still bowed.  Tears roll down his cheeks.
Suddenly - a dark shadow inches across his face, almost blacking it
out.  He looks up.

Bruce stands over him, peering down, looking deeply into him with a
mesmerizing stare.

BRUCE
What will you do now, son?

DICK
I...don't know.  They were my only
family.  I...I...

He bursts into tears.  Bruce grabs him, holds him tightly.

BRUCE
I know exactly how you feel, son.
You may not believe that - but I do.

Bruce gazes down darkly, almost hypnotically, his eyes revealing the
truth.  Dick looks up slowly, riveted.

Suddenly:  WE HEAR the sound of ANGRY MURMURING from a CROWD - then,
the RAPPING of a Judge's gavel, silencing them.

INT. GOTHAM COURTHOUSE - DAY

CAMERA PANS DOWN from the symbol of Justice with her scales, painted on
the Gotham Courthouse ceiling.

JUDGE (O.S.)
I find you guilty of wanton negli-
gence against society.  Of knowingly
causing the death of an innocent
human being.

A black-robbed JUDGE reads the verdict to a courthouse full of
SPECTATORS, but an empty defense table.  The witness chair is also
empty.  Alone at the prosecution table - Rupert Thorne.

JUDGE (CONT'D)
Of usurping the authority of those
legally sworn in to uphold law and
order.  The time has come to be rid
of you and your reckless vigilantism.

Bruce and Gordon sit in the front row.  Bruce's eyes reveal more
emotion than he would care to.  The Judge turns to face the empty
witness chair.

JUDGE (CONT'D)
Batman - you have been tried in
absentia and found guilty of murder.
You are sentenced to death.
(looks)
Mayor Thorne...

Thorne rises, pompous and grave.

THORNE
Your Honor, this is a tragic day in
the history of Gotham.  A once-
admired champion of the people has
now become a threat to their very
existence.  A lethal weapon dealing
in indiscriminate death.  Therefore,
to prevent further carnage, I've in-
structed Commissioner Gordon and his
department to bring in the Batman by
whatever means necessary.

Thorne sits.  The stunned Spectators begin to murmur loudly.

GORDON
The Batman.  A killer.  Who'd
believe it...?
BRUCE
I still don't.

GORDON
Bruce I deal in facts.  And the simple
fact is - you're looking at one poor
sonofabitch who made a deal with the
devil.

Bruce stares blankly at the witness chair.  The Judge pounds his gavel
for silence.  CAMERA ZOOMS IN on the gavel.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SECOND COURTROOM - DAY

CAMERA PULLS BACK from another gavel rapping in another courtroom,
revealing the face of a more benign JUDGE.

JUDGE #2
...therefore, by the power invested
in this Court...

WIDER ANGLE

Bruce and Dick Grayson stand facing the Judge.

JUDGE #2
I hereby declare Richard Grayson to
be the legally designated ward of
Mr. Bruce Wayne.
(smiles)
And may I add in passing - you're a
very fortunate young man.

BRUCE
Thank you, Your Honor.  I'm aware of that.

JUDGE #2
I meant...

Bruce turns to Dick, grins broadly.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

The Rolls Royce pulls up in front of Wayne Manor.  Alfred hurries to
open the front door as Bruce and Dick exit the car.  Dick stares up at
the sprawling residence in awe.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

As Dick enters with Bruce:  the towering hallway of Wayne Manor is
filled with balloons and a banner reading:  ""WELCOME HOME, DICK.""
Silver grins down from the staircase.

Dick drinks it all in, slightly uneasy and embarrassed.  He wanders
into the enormous living room, unsure, visually adjusting himself to
his new, outsized life.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

CAMERA PANS ACROSS a fully outfitted trapeze and ring set on the lawn
of Wayne Manor.  Bruce gazes up proudly at it, looks over to Dick for
his reaction.

Dick looks up at the apparatus somewhat apprehensively, then flashes
Bruce a self-conscious smile.  Bruce understands, claps a hand on his
shoulder, leads him away.

EXT. POOLSIDE - DAY

Dick lies sunning himself on a chaise by the pool.  Suddenly, a large,
wet beach ball lands on his stomach.  He pops up, looks off toward the
pool:

Bruce and Silver laugh from inside the pool, gesture at Dick to come
and join them.  He gives them a half-hearted smile, shakes his head,
then tosses the ball back.

Silver looks at Bruce with concern.

INT. WAYNE MANOR DINING ROOM - DAY

Dick toys with his food at lunch, looks over nicely at Bruce who is
talking non-stop from across the table.

BRUCE
...later on we'll pick up Silver and
go to that new magic musical every-
one's talking about.  We can't stay
out too later - don't forget we've
for that doubleheader tomorrow...

DICK
Sounds great.

BRUCE
(pause)
Is something wrong, Dick?

Dick lowers his eyes, not wanting to respond.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
We're all trying just a little too
hard around here to make you feel at
home, right?

DICK
(with difficulty)
It's not that.  You've been wonder-
ful to me.  It's my fault you've
had to try so hard.  It's...
(eyes misting)
It's just that I still hurt so much
sometimes...and then I remember, and
I get so filled with...hate again.

BRUCE
Hate?

Dick's eyes harden.  His face sets with a cold look, not unlike that of
a young Bruce Wayne when he faced Joe Chill.

DICK
I made a promise to myself the day my
parents died.  A promise that someday
-- somehow - I'm going to keep.

Bruce's eyes flick over carefully.

BRUCE
What did you promise?

DICK
I'm going to kill the Batman.

There is a long silence.  Bruce smiles tentatively.

BRUCE
That's a pretty tall order.

DICK
We'll see.  I have the rest of my
life to get it done.

BRUCE
What if he's...skipped town?  Given
the whole thing up?  Died, even.  No
one ever knew who he was in the
first place.  You can't dedicate
your whole life to killing a ghost.

DICK
I thought you'd understand when you
told me how your parents were
killed.  Didn't you feel the same way?

BRUCE
(avoiding his gaze)
Well I was younger than you are,
and...

DICK
(pressing him)
Didn't you hate?  Didn't you want
to do something about it?

BRUCE
(pause)
Yes.  For a while.  But then I...
(looks down)
...realized how fruitless it was.

DICK
Well that's not going to happen to
me!

Dick rises from the table, looks over with total, piercing sincerity,
his eyes misting over again.

DICK (CONT'D)
Listen, I'm...grateful for every-
thing you've done for me - and for
all you intend to do.  But if you
can't live with my promise, accept
it, support it, even - then maybe
we've both made a mistake.
(eyes glistening)
May I be excused now?

Bruce stares back, deeply moved, almost whispers.

BRUCE
Yes.  Of course you can.

Dick hurries out the door.  Bruce grits his teeth, crumples up his
napkin, squeezing it into a tiny ball.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
Damn.

EXT. GOTHAM INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Rupert Thorne walks briskly down the street, hat tipped low over his
face, coat collar turned up against the night wind.  He arrives at a
deserted intersection, checks the cross street signs, then glances down
at his watch impatiently.

ANGLE ON SIDE OF BUILDING

Tucked under a high ledge of a nearby building:  a mounted camera lens
swivels, the moonlight glinting off its surface.

BACK TO THORNE

Rubbing his hands together.  Looking around at the empty streets,
irritated.

JOKER'S VOICE
You're late.

Thorne's head snaps around at he VOICE.  He sees nothing.

JOKER'S VOICE
We shouldn't be seen together any-
more, Mr. Mayor.  You can't afford
the risk.

Thorne stares:  the Joker's Voice is coming from inside a short,
standing mailbox on the corner.

Thorne hesitates, then slowly moves to the mailbox, tilts back the
letter slot, mutters, looking around nervously.

THORNE
I feel like a Goddamn idiot...

INT. JOKER'S LAIR - NIGHT

The Joker speaks into a microphone attached to a tiny transmitting set.

A VIDEO SCREEN above shows Thorne standing by the mailbox.

NOTE:  THIS SCENE TO BE INTERCUT AS REQUIRED:

JOKER
That's what I felt like twenty years
ago, Thorne.  When I decided to start
off your political career with a
""bang.""  Remember Thomas Wayne?

THORNE
(cold pause)
Every time I see his son.

JOKER
No regrets now, Mr. Mayor.  It's
taken me too long to maneuver us
into a position of total control in
this city.  I've got the judges
lined up, the public at your feet...
(cold pause)
You owe me, Rupert Thorne.

THORNE
It's a two-way street.  Once I
relieve Commissioner Gordon of his
duties, you'll have a free rein in
Gotham - less my cut.  And now that
it's legal to shoot the Batman...

JOKER
We have to find him first.  So far,
it's been like looking for a virgin
in a maternity ward.

THORNE
Then don't find him.  Let him find
You.

JOKER
How?  If the real Batman wouldn't
even appear at the opera to save the
Mayor...

THORNE
The Batman wasn't in love with the
Mayor.  He is in love...with a
certain young lady.  Or so she tells
me and I've never known her to lie.

JOKER
What is she, a mute?

THORNE
(deadly)
Careful.  You may be talking about
the future Mrs. Thorne.  I...want
you to kidnap her.

JOKER
Now take my wife - please...

THORNE
The girl is not to be harmed.  Once
you've killed Batman and made your
escape - I'll call the police and
rescue her.

JOKER
Her knight in shining armor.

THORNE
Something like that.

JOKER
I underestimated you, Thorne.  I always
knew you were corrupt, but I had no
idea you'd turn out to be such a
delightfully repellent human being.

The Joker cackles insanely.  Thorne spots someone coming, closes the
slot, hurries off.

After a beat, an ANCIENT WOMAN approaches the mailbox with a handful of
letters.  She lowers the slot.

JOKER'S VOICE
(outraged)
Do you mind?  I'll never get these
pictures developed!

The Woman SCREAMS!  Her letters go flying up in the air as she hustles
down the street.  The insane giggle of the Joker trails off into the
night.

INT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Silver is dressed in a lacy, powder-blue slip, exits her dressing room,
combing her hair.  The DOORBELL RINGS.

SILVER
(crossing)
Who is it?

VOICE
(through door)
Gotham Florists, lady.  For a Miss
St. Cloud.

Silver looks through the peephole.

ANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE

A DELIVERY BOY waits, head down, holding a bouquet.

BACK TO SCENE

Silver opens the doors slightly, sticks her arm out.  The Delivery Boy
thrusts the bouquet in her hand.

DELIVERY BOY
Say it with flowers...

SILVER
What a surprise!...

She inhales the aroma of the bouquet deeply.  Her eyes become glassy.
She drops to the floor.

DELIVERY BOY
What a straight man!

He swings the door open.  It is the Joker.

INT. POLICE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Thorne strides purposefully down the hallway, followed by a reluctant
Sergeant Haley.

HALEY
...I don't know, Your Honor.  I
mean, you're the Mayor and all that
-- but I work for the Commissioner.

THORNE
As of tomorrow morning, no one works
for the Commissioner.  I'm relieving
him of his duties.

They have arrived at Gordon's door.  Haley is shocked.

THORNE (CONT'D)
I assume you'll be staying on, Ser-
geant - as a loyal member of the
force?

HALEY
I...hope to, Sir.

THORNE
Then open it.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Haley's key opens the door.  They enter.  Thorne looks around, spots
the red phone connected to the Batcave.

THORNE
Anyone have the bright idea to run a
trace on this.

HALEY
Yes, sir.  First day it was installed.
But all we ever got back was an echo
of our own number.  Guy's amazing,
isn't he?

THORNE
Oh, he's a crafty one, all right.
Thanks, Haley.  That's all.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

Dick Grayson descends the darkened staircase, dressed in his pajamas.
He hears a NOISE, sees a light coming from the study.

INT. WAYNE MANOR STUDY - NIGHT

Alfred is tidying up the study, turns as Dick appears.

DICK
All right if I make a sandwich in
the kitchen, Alfred?

ALFRED
Why certainly, Master Grayson.  If I
may be of help...

DICK
(grin)
I think I can handle it.  Thanks.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

Bruce sits at the computer, runs through a criminal history of the
Joker on the video screen.  He pauses, looks off.

ANGLE ON BATPHONE

The red Batphone lights up, then dies.  Lights up, then dies.

BACK TO BRUCE

Staring.  Unsure.

INT. WAYNE STUDY - NIGHT

Alfred reaches to turn off the desk lamp.  Suddenly, the light from the
lamp rises, then dies.  Rises, then dies.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Thorne sits, Batphone in hand, waits.

BACK TO BATCAVE

Bruce crosses to the phone.

BACK TO STUDY

Alfred presses the button under the desk.  The bottom drawer pops open.

BACK TO BATCAVE

Bruce picks up the phone, listens.

BACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE

THORNE
Batman?
(no reply)
Batman - if you're there - this is
Mayor Rupert Thorne.

BACK TO BATCAVE

Bruce listens silently, frowning.

BACK TO STUDY

Alfred holds the extension, listens in as well.

BACK TO THORNE

NOTE:  THIS CONVERSATION TO BE INTERCUT BETWEEN THORNE, BRUCE, AND
ALFRED AS REQUIRED:

THORNE
This...isn't easy for me, Batman,
considering what I've said and done
where you're concerned.  But I love
Silver St. Cloud very much - and I
have reason to believe you do too.

Bruce and Alfred react in their respective locations.

THORNE (CONT'D)
I...dropped by to have a drink with
her tonight.  The door was open,
there were signs of a struggle, and
she was gone.  The Joker left a
playing card - addressed to you.

Bruce's face sets darkly.

THORNE (CONT'D)
""Dear Batman.  Crime fighters may come
and go, but I carry on in the Great
American Tradition of violence.  I'm
calling my little caper, Slaughter In
Silver.  Sorry I have to run now.
Write if you get work.""

Bruce's eyes narrow, thinking.  Thorne's voice begins to crack
emotionally over the phone.

THORNE (CONT'D)
I...don't know where they took her
...or why the note was left for you.
I only know that Silver means more
than my life to me, and I beg you to
find her and save her.  You're her
only chance, Batman, I...

Thorne's voice dies away theatrically.  He hangs up.

BACK TO BATCAVE

Bruce hangs up, stares coldly.  His jaw twitches.

BACK TO STUDY

Alfred hangs up in the study, worried.

BACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE

Thorne takes a deep breath, smiles, rises, exits.

INT. WAYNE MANOR KITCHEN - NIGHT

Dick has made his sandwich, closes the refrigerator door, starts off
for the hallway.

ANGLE ON HALLWAY ENTRANCE

Dick enters the dark hallway, starts for the stairs as he sees:

ANGLE ON ALFRED - HIS P.O.V.

Alfred rushes out of the study, heading for the living room.  He slips,
falls heavily, picks himself up, oblivious to the pain, rushes into the
living room.

BACK TO DICK

Watching.  He starts for the stairs, then stops, now curiously heads
for the living room himself.

INT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Dick enters, look around in amazement:  Alfred is nowhere to be seen!
His eyes scan the room for any other exit.

ANGLE ON GRANDFATHER CLOCK - DICK'S P.O.V.

The tall grandfather clock stands against one wall.  A thin shaft of
light seems to be emanating from behind it.

Dick advances to the clock, looks down, puzzled.  It seems to be
standing at a slight angle away from the wall.  Exploring the edge of
the clock with his hand, he starts to pull back.  The clock swivels,
revealing:

ANGLE DOWN INTO BATCAVE - DICK'S P.O.V.

The Batcave - with all its trophies, computers - in all its regal
splendor.  Alfred is standing near the gleaming Batmobile, looks off
with concern.

Now emerging from the shadows - THE BATMAN!  Dressed in his full
regalia, heading quickly toward Alfred and the Batmobile.

BACK TO DICK

Staring down, his jaw slack.  Stunned.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

Batman crosses to Alfred, who stares with deadly concern.

ALFRED
Don't go, Sir.

BATMAN
Please get out of my way, Alfred.

ALFRED
Since when have you trusted Rupert
Thorne?  You don't even know where
you're meant to be going.

BATMAN
The clues in the note were obvious.
The ""Great American Tradition"" line?
That's the name of this year's series
of exhibits at the Gotham Museum.
And ""Write if you get work""?  This
month it's on American writers and
Writing.

ALFRED
If the clues are that obvious, they
must want you to come.  It's a
trap, can't you see that?

BATMAN
That boy up there thinks the Batman
killed his parents.  I told him he
couldn't live his whole life chasing
a ghost.  What I realize now is - I
can't live the rest of my life
being a ghost.

BACK TO DICK

Listening at the top of the stairs.  Thunderstruck.

BACK TO BATMAN

Batman puts an arm on Alfred's shoulder.

BATMAN
If I come back, old friend, I'll
explain things to Dick.  Tell him
the truth and have the Joker to
prove it.
(pause)
And if I don't - take care of him,
Alfred.  He'll be in much better
hands than he has been in mine.

Alfred silently steps aside as Batman enters the Batmobile, roars off
through the cave.

Alfred pauses sadly, then turns back, heading for the staircase again.
He looks up.

ANGLE ON DICK - ALFRED'S P.O.V.

Dick stands at the top of the stairs, staring down, grimly determined,
his face carved in granite.

EXT. GOTHAM ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

Batman's silhouette as he leaps and glides effortlessly across the tops
of buildings.

EXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - NIGHT

The deserted museum with the billboard:  GREAT AMERICAN TRADITIONS.
This month:  American Writers and Writing.

EXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT

The museum roof is a network of vaulted glass skylights.  TWO THUGS
stand on a surrounding catwalk.

CLOSE ON CATWALK

A sharp metallic ""ping"" is heard across the catwalk.

BACK TO SCENE

The Thugs look up.  One pulls a gun.

THUG
The Batman...

BATMAN'S VOICE
Count on it.

They wheel.  Batman stands directly behind them.  He grabs the first
Thug, swivels him as the second Thug fires - killing his partner.
Batman shoves the dead man into the second Thug, as both bodies crash
down through the glass skylight.

INT. MUSEUM - UP ANGLE - NIGHT

The bodies explode through the glass, falling some sixty feet to the
floor.  Then - total silence.

BACK TO BATMAN

Staring down through the broken glass.  Listening.  He pulls a tiny
revolver from his belt.  A barbed metal dart sticks out of the barrel.
Batman aims it through the hole, fires.

ANGLE ON MUSEUM RAFTERS

The dart embeds itself deeply into a rafter.  Attached to it is a white
nylon cord.

BACK TO BATMAN

Securing the other end of the cord.  He hooks himself to it with a
clip, glides through the opening in the glass.

BACK TO RAFTERS

Batman shoots silently along the cord to a rafter, lands gracefully,
looks down.

ANGLE DOWN ON MUSEUM - HIS P.O.V.

Through the dim, eerie light.  This exhibit (like the one including the
giant penny) consists of huge, outsized version of everyday items.  In
this case - the tools of a writer's trade:  enormous pencils, erasers,
quill pens, fountain pens, ink wells, a ten-foot-high pencil sharpener,
tall volumes of famous American novels, etc.

In the center of the display - a giant electric typewriter, some thirty
feet wide.  A huge sheet of blank white paper is rolled up on it.

BACK TO BATMAN

Staring down curiously through the silent darkness.  His gaze starts to
wander, then suddenly spots something.

BACK TO TYPEWRITER

A FIGURE attached to the typewriter now moves.  It is Silver, hooked
onto the ribbon near the center of the page.  She moans, still
recovering from the effects of the drugs.

BACK TO BATMAN

Eyes widening.  He hooks one end of a nylon cord to a rafter, launches
himself, swinging down toward Silver.

BACK TO RAFTER

A hand with a knife reaches out, slices through the cord!

BACK TO BATMAN

Now plummeting like a rock.  He falls into the typewriter in front of
Silver, his cape suddenly catching on something, partially ripping it,
jerking him to a stop.

WIDER ANGLE

The lights are turned on.  Emerging from behind or under the various
exhibits:  thirty or forty GOONS.

CLOSE ON BATMAN

Batman hangs helplessly from the circular element ball which prints out
the characters on the page.  His cape is caught on the projected edge
of one of the giant letters.  He stares ahead, unable to extricate
himself.

ANGLE ON SILVER

The glaring lights have brought Silver back to consciousness.  Hooked
to the huge ribbon near the center of the page, she suddenly spots
Batman across from her.

SILVER
(horrified)
Oh, my God...

WIDER ANGLE

Stepping out onto the end of the carriage - the Joker!

JOKER
I knew you'd drop in, Batman.
You're that type of guy.
(insane giggle)
Get it?  Type?

The forty Goons circle in around the typewriter.  The Joker nods to two
of them.

CLOSE ON SWITCH

Two Goons give a mighty heave, flip the ""ON"" lever.  A loud hum is
heard as the typewriter activates.

ANGLE ON THORNE

Rupert Thorne hides in the shadows behind a large pencil box, watches
the scene.

BACK TO JOKER

JOKER
You know, you're nothing to write
home about, Batman - but let's give
it a try.

The Joker points a gun down at the keyboard.

JOKER
What letter could be hiding under
your cape?  A ""D', maybe?

The Joker fires:

CLOSE ON LETTER ""D""

The bullet hits the letter ""D"", depressing it.

CLOSE ON BATMAN

The element ball carrying Batman shifts, hurtles toward the page with
blinding speed.  It ""cracks"" against the paper sharply, imprinting a
""D"".  Batman's head has stopped mere inches from the page.

ANGLE ON SILVER

Eyes welded shut - terrified.  The printing of the letter has advanced
the ribbon.  She is perilously close to the exact center of the page.

BACK TO JOKER

JOKER
Not the ""D"".  Hmm.  The most common
letter is ""E""...

BACK TO BATMAN

The Joker fires!  Batman flies toward the page, this time nearly
squashed on the other side.  A giant ""E"" has been imprinted.  Silver
advances one more position on the ribbon.

JOKER (CONT'D)
An ""A"", maybe...

The element ball spins, hurtles toward the paper again.  It splats into
the page, narrowly missing Batman, pushing Silver along again.
Immediately - another shot - the ball whizzes back, prints another ""D"".

JOKER (CONT'D)
I know I tried the ""D"" before, but I
simply couldn't resist.

WIDER ANGLE

The message on the page reads ""DEAD"".  The trembling Silver is only one
letter away from being obliterated.

BACK TO BATMAN

Struggling, but helpless.  His eyes flash nervously.

BACK TO THORNE

Alarmed as he sees what could happen to Silver.

BACK TO JOKER

JOKER
I know what letter is hidden under
your cape, by the way.  It's ""B"" -
for Batman.  But you see, I've got a
problem.  If I hit the letter ""B"",
Miss St. Cloud will die, and I pro-
mised not to kill her.

BACK TO THORNE

Grim.  Pulling a gun.

BACK TO JOKER

JOKER
To ""B"" or not to ""B""...That seems to
be the question.  Well, I suppose
promises - like laws - are made to
be broken.

VOICE
I made a promise, too, Joker.  The
night you killed my parents.

QUICK CUTS:

Thorne looks up.  Silver looks up.  Batman looks up.  The Joker looks
up.

ANGLE ON ROBIN - THEIR P.O.V.

Dick Grayson stands high in the rafters.

DICK
I promised to wipe filthy crud like
you off the face of the earth.

JOKER'S VOICE
Shoot him!

There is a hail of gunfire as Dick flies down through the air toward
the typewriter.

Dick lands on the ""TAB"" key.  The carriage releases, shoots across the
typewriter, carrying the Joker with it.  He flies off the end, crashes
sickeningly into the wall, drops to the floor, unconscious.

Dick bounces off the ""TAB"", flies across the keyboard, lands on the
""SHIFT"" key.

DICK
That ought to give you a lift,
Batman!

ANGLE ON BATMAN

The ""SHIFT"" swivels the element ball 180-degress to expose the capital
letters.  Batman is swung to the front, grabs the carriage, pulls
himself up, looks down as Dick launches himself into a pile of Goons
like a human dynamo.

BATMAN
Leave a few for me, son!

Batman leaps off the carriage, joins Dick in the fray.

NOTE:  The fight which follows will be outrageous and thrilling, but
should look physically believable.  The Dynamic Duo will overpower the
gang using the following elements and devices:

A. Dick flinging Goons back into the pointed tips of quill pens.

B. Batman lifting a fountain pen lever, firing a river of ink at an
onrushing group.

C. Both of them using springy, huge erasers as launching platforms.

D. Oversized volumes of literature slamming shut on the villains.

E. Enormous bookmarks and letter openers swung as clubs, knocking out
three or four crooks at a time.

F. Heavies being hurled into huge, deep ink wells, turning them sopping
black wet, unable to climb out again.

G. Dick bashing a pair of Thugs back into the side of the giant pencil
sharpener.  They slam back against the ""ON"" button, activating it.

During the chaos, Rupert Thorne has made his way down the typewriter's
steel bar which holds the paper to the roller.  He unhooks Silver,
lifts her to safety.

SILVER
Rupert?  What...

THORNE
Don't talk.  Let's go.

The fight continues as Rupert and Silver run down the bar, drop off the
typewriter, cross the floor through the furious melee, heading for the
door.  Batman rounds the corner of a giant book.  Silver spots him,
stops.

SILVER
Batman?...Batman!...

Thorne yanks at her.  She tries to pull away, sees two Goons coming up
behind Batman.

SILVER
Bruce!  Look out!

Batman ducks, rolls, trips the Goons, knocks their heads together.
Silver rushes toward him as Thorne pulls a gun, realizing.

THORNE
Bruce...Bruce Wayne...

BATMAN
Silver!  Get away!

Dick has bashed a Goon backwards - he careens across the floor, hits
Silver from the side, knocking her into Batman as Thorne fires.

CLOSE ON SILVER

Blood spurts quickly across the lacy back of Silver's powder-blue slip.
Batman hooks an arm around her, stares into her dying face, struck
dumb.

SILVER
(trembling)
I'm...right...aren't I...Bruce.

ANGLE ON THORNE

Horrified.  He turns, runs.

ANGLE ON DICK

Giving chase.  Dodging bullets as Thorne fires at him.

BACK TO BATMAN

Lowering Silver to the floor.  She's barely breathing.  Thorne's
gunfire echoes through the museum.  Batman's jaw twitches.  His eyes
flash with rage.

ANGLE ON DICK

Dick rounds the corner of a giant prop some ten feet high off the
floor.  Thorne waits for him on the next prop - gun poised and ready.
Dick spots him, freezes.

THORNE
I don't know what part you play in
all this, kid.  But it's turned out
to be a one-night stand.

BATMAN'S VOICE
(roaring with rage)
May God damn you, Rupert Thorne!

BACK TO BATMAN

Batman has placed a huge, viciously sharp thumbtack in a giant rubber
band pulled taut.  He lets it fly.

ANGLE ON THORNE

The thumbtack spears Thorne in the chest, topples him back across the
prop - which is the giant pencil sharpener - he falls into the hole:  A
disappearing scream is cut short as Thorne is ground to death.

ANGLE ON BATMAN

Batman kneels, cradles Silver's head in his lap.  Her eyes flutter open
painfully.  She tries to smile.

SILVER
Hello...Bruce...

He stares down, eyes filled with tears.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Maybe...it's better, you know?
I'd...just...get in the way...

BATMAN
(low whisper)
Don't...

SILVER
I could...never really have you, and
...I could never fall in love with
someone else.

Her eyelids tremble.  One of his tears hits her cheek softly.  She
reaches up, gently caresses his chin.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Poor...darling...you're the one...
who's...left behind...

Her eyes close.  Her face relaxes, dead.  Tears stream heavily down
Batman's cowl.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

Commissioner Gordon supervises the aftermath and cleanup,  The Joker,
still groggy, handcuffed, is yanked along by a COP.

JOKER
Take it easy, okay?  I get winded
opening clams.

He is led away.  Gordon stares across the room.

ANGLE ON BATMAN

Batman stands by Silver's body which has been placed on a gurney.  TWO
PARAMEDICS cover her face with a blanket.

BATMAN
Wait.

They stop.  He reaches in, pulls back the blanket, stares down at her
face.  Gordon has crossed to join him.

GORDON
What a Goddamn shame.  You know
who's going to be really broken up
about this - Bruce Wayne.

Batman turns, glances at Gordon blankly.

GORDON (CONT'D)
They were real close, you know.  Or
maybe you didn't.

Gordon turns, paces thoughtfully.

GORDON (CONT'D)
But at least you're back, I'm
back, and all's right with this
crazy world for a second.  Now I
don't know where the hell this kid
they're talking about went to,
but...

He turns, looks.  Batman has disappeared.

EXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - DAWN

The gurney carrying Silver's body is loaded into an ambulance.  It
takes off, red lights flashing, siren wailing.  The rising sun is just
beginning to crack the clouds on the horizon.  CAMERA WIDENS, STARTS TO
RISE:

The ambulance becomes a tiny red dot as we now view the magnificent
downtown section of Gotham.

CAMERA CONTINUES TO RISE, SHOOTING UP some eighty stories, then ninety,
then one hundred, finally revealing:

WE DISSOLVE AS:

The dark, majestic figure of the Batman, standing on the top edge of
the tallest building in Gotham.  He looks down silently, cape billowing
out behind him, a regal black prince surveying his steel and concrete
realm.

Now swinging up and across from a nearby lower building:

THE IMPOSING, GRIM-FACED, COLORFUL FIGURE OF ROBIN!  Dressed in his
green shirt, red vest, flowing yellow cape and black mask, he lands on
the roof noiselessly.

Batman's eyes acknowledge his presence without turning.  Robin
advances, then stops silently, several paces behind.

The DYNAMIC DUO has been joined.  Both for now, and for the future
adventures which await them in Gotham.

FADE TO BLACK.

297,Will You Be There (In The Morning),"I'm lying beside you, just thinking about us
To tired to go to sleep, I'm too much in love
I know I'm crazy, but I can't close my eyes
I'm scared you won't be there, in the morning when I rise

Will you be there..

Now who do you dreams about, when you're alone in your sleep
To who do you reach out, oh let it be me
Now baby, you're my obsession, my addiction, my drug
Don't wanna be without you, when I wake up
Oh no..

Chorus:
Will you be there in the morning
Will you be there when I want to
Will you be there when I wake up
I need you to be there
In the morning

Will you be there..

You're so close to me, but I feel so alone
The more that I touch you, the more I want
Don't know what to do, about me loving you
But I pray to God, that you feel it to

Now baby, you're my obsession, my addiction, my drug
So let the candle grow, into a great fire of love

Chorus:
Will you be there in the morning
Will you be there when I want to
Will you be there when I wake up
I need you to be there
In the morning

I wanna love you forever
Don't want a love that now or never
Can't you see you got me down on the floor
I want more, more

Chorus:
Will you be there in the morning
Will you be there when I want to
Will you be there when I wake up
Will you be there in the morning
Will you be there
Will you be there when I want to
Will you be there when I wake up",Heart,Heart,1994,"[91, 81, 70, 62, 61, 53, 48, 47, 41, 39, 39, 41, 44, 51, 64, 73, 73]",17

And just relax, relax, relax
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax

Here we are in the room together
Holding hands and it's gonna get better
And I know that you're in the mood, yes

So I put your purse down
And take off your jacket
Oh girl it's about to get nasty
You'll love what we gonna do

So lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax

Lay your head on my pillow

Lay your head on my pillow

Won't you pull back the sheets and lay down
Put your head upon my shoulders
Let me tell you how I wanna feel

You're the girl that knows my pleasure
So let me go down and find my treasure
Let me see where my pearl is at

So lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax

Lay your head on my pillow

Lay your head on my pillow

299,Funk Dat/Why Is It?,"[currently all lyrics except K-Fix are officiall]

[Verse 1: K-Fix]
Tool in my pocket, I act a fool and for cocking a shoot
I'm rocket shooting em, and my opposition won't stand a chance
All I'm doing is rockin' and get the loot and I'm bout to make stupid a posse of new niggas to stop with the sheneanigans
And clueless in logic, hit the booth with the confidence, they foolish gotta be smoking to be thinking they spittin' equivalent
Finna shoot up harder with the cannon like the Taliban
Opposition losing from it, you can see the ambulance
Diggin' the grave when i'm bustin' once I getting away
Been in the game and there no way i'ma give it away
It takes a little more to speak of me to spit with great
Gotta come to wreck it to listen and i'm spitting flames
Shout out to kVr and my lil brother Leech
Burner hit the greenlight so you know we run the streets
Haters turn to apostles then possums when they want the beef and they may be workin' with talent but they falling under me
So when you're rocking it's summed with illegibility
Hardly working on flow you're just showing your versatility
Thinking they really gon step to me but lack a proper utility
Necessarily give up on speaking incredibility
Gotta be on a mission with instrumentals a killer bee
Me, i'm mighty still sawing off niggas when killing beats
Riding into travellers swearing the niggas are pulling through, so I take em so caring about it couldn't they spit it in 'for I finna feast
Never been another just able to end up with the saucer and the way I be spitting flames i'm breaking em niggas off with the venom
Making it vivid, this illustration of killing the rhythm and no mistake, i be bucking fuck what you thought of me
And i'm bout to pivot not giving a shit about the competition i'm starting by stacking bitch i'm clapping i'm on a mission
As soon as i get this shit imma stick em up in the vault for fucking with the machinery get a call from another cough nigga
You rap fast well i rap fast too, now your fast round moves like a lot of fast food
When i'm in a bad mood imma chop it cock it back and then i blast too, man in other words i'm bad news
If i had to, i could a make pussy nigga disappear with the steel, sipping genius hoping I can forget the fear, with the key, looking like i'm painting a picture crystal clear with the skill, like it doubles on another hemisphere
Imma need to get it in, toss in like a change of ref, think i'm finna fine a nigga
Talking an anomaly, independent and imma be killing shit cause i'm properly one of the illest meaning these other niggas don't wanna beef
And everytime i wanna beef, promise imma hit, play the instrumental and i bet he flicks
Talking i'm a G don't compare me to a motherfucker saying nothing giving a fuck about your SPS

[Verse 2: Kaoz]
Better watch what the fuck you sayin
Put you in the dirt remind you who the fuck I am
Have no fear for fuckin man I'll put a hole in ya chest and then BUCK BUCK again
Trust me you don't really want to start a rivalry
You're bout to get acquainted with the evil side of me
And every single demon that's living inside of me
You talking all that fake bitch don't lie to me
I smell the pussy in ya pants from a mile away
You're like the bitch that gets kicked out and tries to stays
Mane I gotta teach you a lesson I'm a find a way I swear to God Imma find a way
I'll rip ya heart out pull your card out, you was faking from the start out, sub par sound I'm ready to jump out the car fresh from the bar now
With a look of insanity on my face yelling out WHO'S HARD NOW
I spit it too hot flaming blue fire
Tell me what the fuck that you got, frontin you hot my lyrics hit you like a jump shot only a few got
And hit em up like 2Pac now who shot ya
Better chill pop a xanax, or the plan next, has mechanics, of my anger expanding
And will leave you branded as a pansy that is better off dancing than rapping, I'm laughing
(Something is wrong with me)
Grip on the clip in my pocket just make it a watch out you'll be safe
Stacking a stack while I'm grippin the strap known for slapping em in the face
Sticking the mid finger up with the klique making em walk up out the way
Talking the talking and walking the walk are nothing like the same
Thinking of bleeding the blood out the block Talking ain't shit so I'm taking a shot Shakin the pavement the way that its breaking gonna knock em out the way
Fuckin around when I need to be taking my medicine
Telling myself that this is the best that it will ever get
Living in hell could somebody tell me what heaven is
Reppin kaotic and breaking bread with the bretheren
Sick of the head ache think I'll pop another excederine
Man he's just talking nothing is real like he says it is
Watching em faking I'll stick their face to the pavement mane do you wanna be famous cuz right now you're irrelevant

[Verse 3: BoneZ]
Motherfuckin animal no way to word it better whats the problem with the weather its my cold cold flow
No not bonez rap so slow, sps lord let it go
Cuz i could get it choppin if thats what you really want but id rather bring a better rhythm rip it off the top
You can fuckin skip it but i wish you’d rather not cuz i promise on or off, this shits still hot
I see you youtube keyboard warriors your countin words and every syllable per second that shits so absurd
So wheres the real rap, G-Funk and all that
Glockapella bring art of war back adrenaline rush 2Pac and ahh man, Dark Man X where the fuckin’ hood at?
Who that with a rhythm thats so fly, ohhh that little man bad no lie
Move out! Gonna be dat one die, no lie man me waste no time
Shoot that! Ammo at backbone spine
Prove that! Get it tatted thats for life
We could do that! don’t move past that line (lets get it then)
Spittin within rhythm a hater be checkin’ me out
Ya better be careful with your kisser get a dick in ya mouth
I got the paparazzi poppin’ pictures murderin’ time
Going kamikaze off my rocker rockets align
Bonez don’t, tell it to me dawg where the fuck you keep your damn money give it to me or!
Get your head blowed off by a sawed off shot got your broad lock-jawed cuz i don’t like talk naw ughhh
So cold and ugly those who thought that Bonez was funny Motivation only money C.R.E.A.M go and check it homie
Fuck em if they don’t listen fuck em if they do not agree
Fuck it I’m all outta time, fuck I did this shit for free

[Verse 4: Fluenci]

Focus on up for the camera, bang to the fullest my family out her like bruh
Desicivaluate every moment I been awake I been open to competition they silly like what?
See I'm gone like flip it to rest, can compete with the best
Sold like empathy words demons all in my chest
Open the guidelines, they pop eye tugging at best toatin  ammunition when I get it put em to the test, bitch
Solo the colo my homie denomination imma get it put intended
After the fact imma let em have it and damage em running right up on stage yelling dumbass silly rabbits
I don't mess with ether feed ya they label me a demon creature
I more then that fact fuck all your features and to be honest it wasn't nice to meet ya
Foot  to face we can just called that creature, motherfuckas need to shut up and leave it to Beaver
I'm a focus mind frame so I cannot teach ya
Deliverance individual circumstances irrelevant
Everybody be full of shit don't you know what's barbiturates
Out of my mind filling the diligence, this is the shit that I got to do because I don't give a fuck about any of your wits
I'm living off for the pain no one offers to gain not a feeling of the same
Tell em all to maintain duration of the same loyalty I'm able to stack up all of this manifest no reply it's obvious
Motherfuckas need to realise who started this I'm a cold piece of work and they feelings get hurt disaster bastard so they labeled me a jerk
My flow Richter write-offs kill Mufasa low range Mind Games got to show proper dance in the wind creep I'm a heat doctor ants in the pants mind just off my rocker
Time ain't  a factor that you can capture
Basic ain't a word that's a float cat turd you can't fuck with mine I'll beat you backwards flattering you say you rap I see actor

[Verse 5: Interchopper]
Hydrofluoric acid gonna eat your speakers as I slay
Beat whenever I’m coming to kill em all beat whatever they’re calling It I’m feeling and darkness raising and taking it over
Think I’m made of dark matter entirely, that’s why i’m charged with negativity, hyperactivity is the way I kill the beat, nevertheless I thought my verse would pull you down like a gravity making impossible to out rap me
Unless you’re fucking Savitar
Getting into the speed force annihilation is a matter of Corce
Shit i’m feeling the speed in my veins get your potion lip it dip it till you get your brain boiling motherfucker or back out motherfucker
Every time you trynna diss me imma be coming up 10 times harder imma me dominating over bitches who are trynna speed up their verses, I won’t be giving a shit how you fellaz claim to do 40 syllables in a single second, I’m at the intersection of being demon and OG of speedsters
Think I might be going in a killing mode. why the fuck can’t I get rid of voices? tell me lord. Guess I gotta cope with a demon inside my soul, I just beat the shit out of my demon, his turn comes on
See that’s the problem putting others first, you’ve taught them, you come second
ROUND 7
Murdering shredding up putting em in oven i’m ripping the flesh before cracking all bones just to die em all up fry em up finna eat them with a hot sauce with a ghost one
The only place you can get rid of me Is in a parallel universe where I suck and these motherfuckers are trynna top out the game with em condoms on faces
Imma hit em with a metal, shit em with a mental slaughter em like a phantom make this shit look like it was accidental
You better believe i’m coming to beat em all in a godspeed battle
I could run up on you put a gun up on you but I will fuck you up in like a minute, admit it you can never be sicker tham a wicked chopper
Imma be the mu'fucker who will knock you out of the beat you will never outbeat us if you think that speed is the key
And here I stand manifestation of pain with my brains popping revolution, it’s atomic superfusion i’m just brainsick fruit that grew too ripe for mainstream tree

Verse 6: [Kidshot] {Hindi}
Na me soch saku kabhi na me karu kabhi please me hu boss mera khudhi naa me pause karu kabhi
Na me rakhta umeed to fhir loss kaise hoga mere paas kaafhi khubi mena bana kabhi choosey
Jo bhi mila mujhe bhot meto chala mere raah pe kyuki mila mujhe khot

Kidshot

[Verse 7: kVr]
Everytime I wanna sit, write something lit, I feel like I'm blocked and 'bout to end up in heaven
Or hell as well, I'm tired of this shit, but I'm happy I can split seconds in part seven
And I'm shouting it out, years seventeen, as I'm here I just wonder where I've been
All of this time while being so keen on the rhyme, now with lyrics so clean
I'm eating the lettuce and drinking Sprite, gon' leave you electrified, if you know what I mean
Do I really have to fight for what's right, not getting left with the hook to kill and a ruptured spleen?
Setting off the rhyme scheme, tryna go so rough for the underground scene
And I thank y'all for the love you show, though it seems like some wanna act tough behind the screen
Not at all 'bout this stuff and I really wanna scream when I see that motherfucker with a brain of a bean
Thinking like he's above everybody but his team, cannot use his ears and grey matter between
Keyboard warrior causing authorial euphoria as I fulfill my dream
When I gotta pretend like I shut my eyes and I cut off them guys like a guillotine
(Like I've never seen it) Rise above the hate, join them when they keep on going almost half of a decade
So I kept in disguise, owing you what I do great, it's been really not a lie since the 8th damn grade
When I made the ""See Me Later"" and I'm really not afraid of any hater making greater everything I create
Dedicated 'til I'm faded away, better don't stay (it would be like wishing to catch your fade)
Thinking about the negativity coming upon everything I made
But I can tell it's pretty dope and I really hope you feel the same
I'd rather make it not breaking the edge, I would instead want to gather a packet of syllables
That'd be worth all the time, meaning more than a mumble
Now let's get ready to rumble
'Cause I won't consider myself any bit of humble
Chopping like karate, when it comes to music, buddy
I won't stop being rowdy 'til my body will crumble

[Verse 8: Mizury]

Startin everyday off feelin parched; crackin open a bottle of sprite and writing some bars from Mars
Gettin me amped up like a rockstar; Sprite Beatz be leavin Mizury in misery from sun up to sun down strung out like a g-g-guitar
Addicted to the bass when the speakers hit me in the face so i gotta glue em into place; strappin them monsters down wit chains
Cuz Sprite be makin me catch a case when showin off the music then puttin brusies and leavin everyone of my fans in pain
The uc series insane in the membrane twisted wit the words and mergin them into verses strainin when surfin thru ya brain
We playin it like a arcade; lyricism be the game engraving and markin ya mindframe when marchin it like a parade
Pulsating thru the veins put a motherfucker in a seizure; rappin that strobe light rap wit light speed choppin it up wit a cleaver
Dragon breathers spittin ether; mouthpieces be the heaters wit a god made delivery like every track is dropped on easter
Like how many sps was that bro? fuck i dont know shit man i just rap
Then set back and laugh watchin yall debate if i sped it up so- HHRRRRRAAAHHHHHH, how was that?
Cash me ousside, how bow dah mad whitey ill attack and bitch smack any one of you faggots and set yo ass strait
My name isnt Mac Lethal fuckers so you better know ya place and i dont speed up my videos like he does either so you better get the fuck outta my face
Rockin out wit the cock out so go'ne and bow down and suck it im custom wit the rhymes im bustin callin the flow seductive
Ridin the beat like percussion when im rushin em given a beat a concussion when i hit it up wit syllables by the dozen like its nothin
When im bustin gettin ya girls pussy gushin when im thrustin and fuckin
The production stuffin it and nuttin miz babies all over the beat; beat it up given it some mad whitey sensual lovin
When im runnin up stayin pumpin like a fuckin rhino porno whenever i be humpin
I make more moves; then a pornstar
Ive been on more tracks; then fuckin NASCAR
I stay in service more then at&t  wit them bars
Dream on

[Verse 9: Sensei]
Sono un persona pragramatica do lezioni di grammatica quindi parto da subito con la mia potenza massima
Ho dovuto fare la pratica, per questo che vado a raffica in automatica cambio la tattica e spacco la natica
Non dire che non sono bravo se non sai fare di meglio, se davvero tu fossi in grado di farlo tanto di cappello
So che ho trovato il risultato solo mettendoci l'impegno, vi distruggo drammaturgo molto più di Pirandello
Dicono tu sei onesto dopo che sentono un mio pezzo perché ho già visto buio pesto con la luce delle cicale
Testo più complesso bevo succo fresco e rappo tutto questo testo fino a quando tu ti senti male
Non me ne fotte un cazzo te l'ho già detto in ogni modo, te l'ho già detto in ogni luogo e pure in ogni situazione
Quando arrivo prendo lo spazio guarda quanto cazzo volo è diventato il mio lavoro far ballare le persone
Prendo posizione al contrario degli ignavi, se vuoi la mia prestazione te la faccio se mi paghi
Senza giubbotto in moto fuori meno sei gradi, duri poco quando sputo tutto il fuoco dei draghi
Sardo pazzo sanno quanto valgo la mia scimmia che fuma è un orangotango
Voglio un posto tipo da comando mangio mango ballo tango barcollando
Arrivo in paradiso facendo rime stupende, sono così preciso che non puoi dire più niente
Non ho un bunker ma comunque sono un tipo prudente, arrivo subito al dunque con un testo pungente
Senti una mia canzone dopo la rimetti in play, arrivo con Twisted Insane e con più fighe di Drake e con più stile di Ray, facciamo impazzire gli Dei
Voi ci arrivate in ritardo come dopo mille delay, dopo di me col fast rap non ce n'è, mister Flash on the track I'm back and blessed
Sono nato bianco con la testa black, Non sono mai stanco vivo senza stress, flex
Tutto quello che faccio non lo posso dimenticare, tutto quello che ho guadagnato me lo posso rimeritare
Questo programma l'ho craccato, cambiato, riprogrammato, se sbaglio lo faccio daccapo è il mio modo di registrare

[Verse 10: Sinizter]
Don't you ever come around and try to take me out my spot
Or in a box is where ya body gonna rest at
You wanna bet that, then im a do you like a crab
Pull ya limbs with my knee in ya back till ya chest crack
Hella insane when the main vein spray I don't gang bang
But I'm down to rumble if somebody want smoke
Let it blow till the barrel swinging outta control
Showing you that Sinizter is not a joke
I can rhyme with the best
Palm on ya neck squeeze till ya face turn blue and eyes start to sweat
I am live in the flesh you can die from the tec
Like butter how it slide through ya vest you a mess
Kinda new but I kick it like a vet
Running to the  studio to lace another track so I can flip check
Anybody sleeping on me better come at me correct
Every track that I put up I only hit nothing but net
PME, im a boss with a vision
Like I was enlisted walking through the desert on a mission
Am I dead or livin’, if I'm livin’ I’m a keep on kicking till my goal met
Tell me how u gonna keep ya head up with a broken neck
Motherfucker listen I got the light to ignite the propane
You'll die from slow pain I’ll slice a throat vein, you dying foe fame
But fail to see, that you gon’ take L’s and bleed you are still lame it won't change
I'm ready to ride, you ready to die, ready fly to the sky and see if heaven is live
Underground chopper with a chopper throwing lead in ya side
Spitting these devilish lines deep in my head I'm Divine
Who wanna scrap, who wanna rap I’ve been with the smoke
All of ya styles the same someone invented a clone
We are defending the throne walking on into ya home
Seeing how much pressure till you break while I'm bending ya bones
I will die for this I grind for this I'll rhyme till my tonsils split so stop ya shit
You gonna need binoculars when I ascend
And if I fall, I rise again I'll beat the odds I got to win
I go hard in paint, all in ya face, keep a metal arm on my waist
Won't hesitate to left it off and clear the back of a skull
There ain't no laughing it off, underground choppers clear a drum then we gone

[Verse 11: VBL]
You've awakened a dragon I'm spitting of the fire and Flame when I'm rapping and setting a blaze that will cover the canvas at last I will burn them and turn them to ashes that's that Raisin Hell from the under ground you sucker clowns are in trouble now I don't hear a single word in your verse all you do is !#%$^*&@$!%& making Mumble sounds better make way I be busting through untamable off the leash and I'm running loose vbl in the flesh there is no substitute I been doing this believe me it's nothing new on the track I be taken advantage like slipping a pill in your drink something like dr. Huxtable just when they thought they were safe and got comfortable istorm like Thunderbolts they are be trying to rap really fast and they say their time traveling I Quantum tunnel though I am a jumper don't you know I'm jumping through portals and get where I wanna go buzzing off Brew when I'm drinking Old English and this is my drunken flow but it's still wonderful Maximus Russell Crowe I'm a gladiator that will wrestle alligators show up at your territory attacking you like a Raider you cannot hold me like I'm a hot potato never want to be the greatest but I'm major I Got Rhythm and precision like a laser I'm a lyrical razor and I could separate the Earth at the equator you can't stop this apocalypse so you better say your prayers sayonara see you later laughing at you cuz you're just still a buster sorry you suck but your rhyme are filled with nothing but a bunch of filibusters and that is poor very trying to chop when you rhyme like Tech 9 but you're just sounding like Little Donny from the Thornberrys

[Verse 12: SplytSecond]
SplytSecond is synonymous with superior syllable slinging insinuating saliva stay smooth
Son of Sam sharp shooter soliloquy similarly slithering so saddiddy spitters say soothe
I’m a master with rappin it’s not a car accident when I crack the whip
You still wack and still ask me for respect you get NONE like a Catholic pacifist practicing abstinence
And Since you don’t screw imma neuter you as a chopper vet I guess it is my duty too
You haven’t the courage to bark at my dawgs so go and get a blues clue scooby doo
From every continent the choppers will be coming from number 7 never meant to be a one and done
Yeah better believe it and there is a reason that I am on every single one of em
Some of the people that’re creepin wit cannons affiliated with bonitas that’re speakin in Spanish
Trading a stack of the moolah for the weed and the canabis and be walkin around with a heater just to keep an advantage
But I was never viva la vida but lethal and famished unable to rest for a millisecond if you rest so many people could vanish
Not even the reaper could stand it a freakin insanity plea for the planet when I flee I’ll be leavin a can and then BOOM
Homicidal when hit em in the organs that’re vital you been invited to the recital when i be choppin it harder and harder
Scatterin parts of the body all over the party forget a bicardi you’re gonna want a bottle of water the moment I started to slaughter
Double S and Double helix equal to double the chromosomes I’m comin to put it down when you listen to the sound
Of an M1 Vulcan raring and ready to riddle you rappers with another round
Turn to the other way to earn what I double pay and learn that whatever’s gonna turn up another day
Part of me mechanical saliva that’s flammable everybody in the crowd is gonna burn up in front of me
Sickness is deadly this is the remedy I am just what all these posers pretend to be

300,Said I Loved You...But I Lied,"[Verse 1: Michael Bolton]
You are the candle, love's the flame
A fire that burns through wind and rain
Shine your light on this heart of mine
Till the end of time
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one

[Chorus: Michael Bolton]
Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied

[Verse 2: Michael Bolton]
With all my soul I've tried in vain
How can mere words my heart explain
This taste of heaven so deep so true
I've found in you
So many reasons in so many ways
My life has just begun
Need you forever, I need you to stay
You are the one, you are the one

[Chorus: Michael Bolton]
Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied

[Verse 3: Michael Bolton]
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one

Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside

Nowadays you gots’ ta walk the street and watch your back
Cause brothers with the gats don't be knowin’ how to act
They always pull the Glock when somebody rocks a knot
And if they get shot they often snitch to the cops
Now tell me this ain’t livin foul
She just had a baby child and she’s back to sellin’ cracks vials
On the Ave cause she’s addicted to the fast cash
How long will that last before the cops be up in that ass
But honey-dip dont wanna listen cause she’s in no position
Now nobody gives a pot to piss in
Her life is stuck and filled with bad luck
So she fucks and fucks to earn another buck
She don't really care about pride
And she jumps into another ride then comittin’ suicide

Hey Yo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing
From hookerin' to drug slang (repeat 2)

Verse Two (Shyheim):
Times is gettin' hard, word is bond I swear God
I even got caught tryin' to steal from the junkyard
A born terror, A rebel without a pause
Ain't nevah had a good Christmas so who is Santa Claus
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil’ town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a Glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parkin' lot
In front of my buildin' I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigga and tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shyheim]
Hey Yo, get a load of this guy you know the Mr. Hard-y
He the one who talk about gats but ain't' bustin nobody
He speaks the name game so he can just maintain
I'd blow him out the frame but his mom said he gang bang
But his rep was hi-tech in the projects
Pulled his knuckle-jacks so he got mad respect
The niggas in hoodies packed up their loaded gats
Met up in the back so they could plan the attack
Wasn't hard to tell that these kids was no joke
They let the pistol smoke and at nine was dopin’ and coked
I seen it happen everyday where I live
I know a few brothers, drug dealers, most of them fugitives

Last night I, I saw you standing
And I started, started pretending
That I knew you, and you knew me too

And just like a roni, you were too shy
But you weren't the only cause so was I
And I dreamed of you ever since
Now I built up my confidence
Girl next, next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say...

Can we talk for a minute?
Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl I want to know your name

But I wanted to be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you

Hey baby

But just like a baby I could not talk
And I tried to come closer, but could not walk
And I think of it every night
Oh I just could not get it right! Oh!
If we ever come close again
I'll know what I'll say then

Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talkin', one day I was walkin' down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Ha ha, yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye

I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affectin' me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go
Even though you treated me bad
But I don’t want to see my kids see me gettin' beat down by daddy smackin' mommy all around
You say I'm nothin' without ya but I'm nothing' with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya

I saw you wildin', actin' like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?

There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you tryna jump in front of the bullet (Young lady) ?

Don't let it burn
Don't let it fade

But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything
And I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

[Chorus]
But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

[Verse 2]
Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just want to be with you

But it's been a long, long time
Well I've got a good life now, I moved on
So when you cross my mind
I try not to think about what might have been
Cause that was then and
We have taken different roads
We can't go back again
There's no use giving in
And theres no way to know
What might have been

We can sit and talk about this all night long
And wonder why we didn't last
Yes, they might be the best days we will ever know
But we'll have to leave them in the past

So try not to think about what might have been
Cause that was then
And we have taken different roads
We can't go back again
There's no use giving in
And there's no way to know
What might have been

Same old look in your eyes
It's a beautiful night
I'm so tempted to stay
But too much time has gone by
We should just say goodbye
And turn and walk away

Try not to think about what might have been

We can't go back again

324,All About Soul,"She waits for me at night, she waits for me in silence
She gives me all her tenderness and takes away my pain
And so far she hasn't run, though I swear she's had her moments
She still believes in miracles while others cry in vain

It's all about soul
It's all about faith and a deeper devotion
It's all about soul
Cause under the love is a stronger emotion
She's got to be strong
Cause so many things getting out of control
Should drive her away
So why does she stay?
It's all about soul

She turns to me sometimes and she asks me what I'm dreaming
And I realize I must have gone a million miles away
And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me at that moment
And she smiles because it's understood there are no words to say

It's all about soul
It's all about knowing what someone is feeling
The woman's got soul
The power of love and the power of healing
This life isn't fair
It's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold
You've got to get tough, but that ain't enough
It's all about soul

There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness
There are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive
She comes to me at night and she tells me her desires
And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive

It's all about soul
It's all about joy that comes out of sorrow
It's all about soul
Who's standing now and who's standing tomorrow
You've got to be hard
Hard as the rock in that old rock 'n roll
But that's only part, you know in your heart
It's all about soul",Billy Joel,Billy Joel,1994,"[77, 65, 66, 56, 57, 51, 52, 46, 34, 38, 39, 32]",12

She's got a T-Top Camaro with a scoop on the hood
And two big speakers blasting Johnny B. Goode
Looking so sweet it ought to be a crime
She plays with my heart and messes with my mind
Acts like Madonna but she listens to Merle
Rock my world little Country girl

She wears snakeskin boots made by Calvin Klein
And cheap sunglasses from the five and dime
All the other girls in school they give her dirty looks
She got an ""A"" in math and never cracked a book
Sure looks good in her denim and pearls
Rock my world little Country girl

[Chorus]
Rock my world
Drag me out on the floor
Dance with me till I can't dance anymore
One-step, two-step, get in a line
I gotta find a way to make you mine

[Verse 2]
I tell her that I love her but it ain't enough
She says I got to learn to loosen up
Get a little wild on Saturday night
But make sure she's home before the morning light
Sunday she's all ribbons and curls

Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin

[Verse 1]
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

[Hook]
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

[Hook]
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

[Verse 3]
And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up

You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk

Policeman come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack, but you be doin' that
I'd rather say see ya, ‘cause I would never be ya
Be an officer? You wicked overseer!
You hotshot, wanna get props and be a savior
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
‘Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
‘Cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police

Now here's a likkle truth, open up your eye
While you're checkin' out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word overseer, like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew, for example
Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, officer, officer, officer
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity? Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
The overseer could stop you, ""What you're doing?""
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices
The police them have a likkle gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast

[Verse 3]
Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminal are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one P.D
But just a mere Black man, them wann check me
Them check out me car, for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed, ‘cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up 'til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary, him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My great-grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great—when it's gonna stop?!

[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police

I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that (OK)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
I'm bugging out but let me get back cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others 'cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Back in '89 I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand

336,John Deere Green,"[Verse 1]
They were farm kids way down in Dixie
Met in high school in the sixties
Everyone knew it was love from the start
One July, in the midnight hour
He climbed upon the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart

[Chorus]
In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said that he should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

[Verse 2]
They settled down on eighty acres
Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes
They went together like a hand and a glove
On a clear day from their front yard
If you look and know what to look for
Off to the east you can still read his words of love

[Chorus]
In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

[Verse 3]
Now more than once the town has discovered
Painting over it ain't no use
There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it
The heart keeps showing through

[Chorus]
In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the fool should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

Ah, paint it green boy

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene

338,One On One,"Mama always told me don't let myself get caught
Don't want to see me alone and turned out
Living dangerous has a gruesome price
Puts your soul into a lonesome light
Respect yourself because there's no one else who respect you
And if you don't then they won't

You get put into a mould, labelled a loosie, an avenue hoochie
I'm all about me, living my life right cause life is a treasure
Dis peer pressure, I gotta be me
Can't be the rest of them
Grow and show that I can flow with the best of them
Never try to be shady, a lady
Money go and [?] don't amaze me
I'm not living to be wed
Before I commit I'll establish a one on one with myself

One-by-one we can make it, [?]
If we are to be as one
One-to-one, it's not hard to relate to
If you open up your heart
Love one by one

Back in the day when I was in high school
Time was mine and my mind was a tool
All work and no play said Jack
Apply yourself said dad, but get back
I had to hang with the girls in the mall
Parties all night was yes yes y'all
Homework can't [?] me
After cramming all night
At school I would sleep

Wasn't thinking of life's pop quiz
Or the real world or school was preparing me to outgrow
Until senior year rolled up
And everything but my grades I'd rolled up
Now I come about life [?]
Suddenly hanging with the girls was no go
I started getting to class on time
Doing homework and using my mind and now
I'm fine

One-by-one we can make it, can't fake it
If we are to be as one
One-to-one, it's not hard to relate to
If you open up your heart
Love one by one

Thinking back to when coming up wasn't much brother
Rode the hood so in me you thought you couldn't trust
Steady talking to your friends dripping off what they say
Dripping off the he say she say babe
I think we would have a debate, kick back chill
And maybe we could set things straight
I'm not all about the hiding duck
You know the time honey quit with the games
I'm not [?]
Why you want to come off half-cocked out to me
You know I'm acting through to your record shop [?]
Kicking it, with benny making plenty, so honey
Dial my beeper or my corner when you wanna get with me
And you could chill like god be on the down low
Parlay, parlay like grand poobahs say anyway
So don't clip off your no-nonsense friends flow
Cause if you don't, I'mma have to let you know

One-by-one we can make it, can't fake it
If we are to be as one
One-to-one, it's not hard to relate to
If you open up your heart
Love one by one
Love one by one

We can make it if we try (love one by one)

Yo Jef, why don't you give me a hoopa beat or something
Something I can go to the park to
Yeah, there you go, alright
I like that, I like that
It sound dope
Bust 'em in the eye, Shaq!

[Verse 1: Shaq]
You wanna fight? Come fight me!
I'll hit ya with the ""Wa-psh-psh-psh-psh-psh!"" See, see?
I get dirty after dark
I'll treat you like Spielberg, you'll get your ass kicked in in a park (Ooh!)
You don't believe me? The proof is in the puddin'
Been a boy in the hood way before Cuba Gooding
I flip scripts with the mad pa-style, freeze
(Shhh) Music, please!
I dribble rhymes like Basketball-em's
People call me E.T. (What's that, Shaq man?), Extra-Tallem's
You better than Shaq-tack, fool, shut up, liar!
I lean on the Statue of Liberty when I get tired
Than I'll punch you in the stomach, I don't give a heck
(Hey yo, why you booger hook like that?) Yo, she breath on my neck!
People walk around like, yo, they got charged!
But I'm big like Gorilla, 6'7 ain't large!
I kick rhymes like Moo Duk Kwan Do
I smoke-smoke the mic-mic like Cheech and Chong do
You don't like Shaq? Frankly, I don't give a damn
I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Verse 2: Def Jef]
Surprise, look who's back, not a prize from a Cracker Jack
Look at that, it's Def Jef with the Shaq Attack
Flexin', I'll be crackin your back with the boom-boom bap
Pass that mic over here, you ain't gon' want it back
Everybody say I got fat, yep, but so did my wallet
Still ripping rhymes and dropping bombs like Khalid Muhammad
Do yourself a solid, don't flex, you go sex
You know the time, get the high-hat, the Rolex
The way I see, if I was wack like you, I'd be at me
The way I hold it down, you'd swear my name was Gravity
Def Jef with the funk, Def Jef don't front, you know how the name is spelt
I'm making it vital, and jackin' the title, fool, break yourself
Attack the track like Shaq on a whack broad
Coming up with the hits, and I'm coming down with the backboard
Don't fake the funk, just make the sound's up from the trunk
The reason your tape ain't hit the deck is because your hits don't bump
So get back, ain't no hassle, cause you ain't holding nothin'
Keep sticking around, you get beat down like you stole something
Sleep on me and the Shaq and jump your own hand
Cause I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Ad-lib]
Ah yeah, yeah, y'all don't know nothing about this
The Shaq Man and The Arsenal
What's up like that?

So check this out Shaq man, we gon' let this beat play right here, let all
The brothers and sister know.....

[Verse 3: Shaq Diesel]
Nah, nah, let me continue
I'm a be like Pete Rock and see what's next on the menu
Mic-checka, the rim and rhyme wrecka, rocks from here to Mecca
(Boom!) Boom shack-a-lack-a-lack-a
I got a hand that'll rock ya cradle
Cream you like cheese, spread you on my bagel
My Ford Explorer boomin' with the trunk of funk
All you jealous punks can't stop my dunks
The brand new like Heavy, built like Chevy, Impala
But Shaq's a smooth balla
(Yeah, but what about rhymin'?) I can hold my own
Knick-knack, Shaq-attack, give a dog a bone
Rhymin is like hoopin', I'm already a legend
Back in the days in the food stamp section
Used to kick rhymes like, ""Baby, baby, baby!""
""Every once, every twice, three times a lady""
Is what I listened to, ridin' with my moms
How you like me now? I drop bombs!
When you see me, please tap my hands
I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

342,Money In The Ghetto,"[Verse One]
In the ghetto, you think life is hard
Food stamps and to' up cars
Wall to wall dirty orange carpet
Sittin in a bucket, hopin you can start it
And ride around to the liquor store
Can't get a job get drunk some more
You betta stop trippin on dem stereotypes
Cause in the ghetto there's a good life
We ain't starvin like Marvin, won't see no roach
When ya chill wit the rich folks in the hood
You're sittin on leather watchin big screens
Bought by the dope fiends
Smokin, and what about the brother wit the good jobs
Savin money, and workin hard
Bought a house for his wife and kids
Ya only got one life to live
Another brother got some cocaine
You know his face, but don't know his name
You know he got the sack mayn
And he's sittin on a fat bank
Seven cars at his house in the driveway
Benz so clean don't roll it just fly away
Cause folks got money in the ghetto.. yeah you know

[Hook One]
Hey hey hey.. whatcha got to say (There's money in the ghetto)
Hollywoooooood! Havin money in the ghettooo

[Verse Two]
Money in the ghetto ain't nothin new
It's been like that, way before you
Was even born, get up from the down stroke
Chocolate City for the black folks
Say it loud in ya hot pants
Man child in the promised land
I take you back to Iceberg Slim
And all the players that came before him
If you a everyday hustler, get your money
Cause what they do to black man ain't funny
All the time tryin to put us the pen
You get paroled and then they send you again
All the homies in the hood gettin paid
You might have left but the money stayed
In the ghetto, it ain't all about drugs
Gettin paid doin all kinds of stuff
Only rule on the streets is don't get caught
Unless your hustle ain't breakin the law
And even though rich folks got it good
We sittin on 'em fat in the hood
I'm ridin on some gold ones
Smokin dank and it's potent
Ask them fools, cause they know
There's money in the ghetto

Chorus One

[Verse Three]
I got money baby, just tell me the price
Cause Short Dawg ain't nuttin nice
I always hit the town wit my boy Ben Franklin
Spend fo', get an ounce of dank then
Rich nigga get high relaxin
If I bust a Ben Frank' get some Andrew Jacksons
Five twenties for a hundred dollar bill
You know the math, let's make a deal
On the one dollar bill if you look on the front
You find the face of George Washington
Make money baby, that's all I do
That's how I know Thomas Jefferson is on the two
Abraham Lincoln got shot and died
Freed the slaves so they put him on the five
And Hamilton, my old time friend
They put his face on the front of the ten
These are the dead presidents
From the hood and they represent
The American dream for the average minority
Make your money, get some weed and a forty
I'm on the Eastside livin' like a king
Kick back watchin fifty-inch screens
Bounce to the Westside, hit the studio
And spend my money in the ghetto

[Hook Two]
Hey hey hey.. whatcha got to say (They got money in the ghetto)
Hollywoooooood! Havin money in the ghettooo

[Verse Four]
Nowadays if you can't say a rap, or play sports
You might just come up short
And they always say the same things
Don't be a gangster or a dopefiend
Get your high school diploma, go to college
Get a degree and start makin' dollars
Only one thing wrong, and it's a Trip
Inner city schools don't teach us shit
Got us stuck on stupid, Straight S.O.S
Can't get nothin, but they payin the rest
Of them fools
All Around the world in the other countries
They should be spendin that money right here
In the state of California
You graduate and can't spell ""diploma""
Dip to the hood and get rich
Slangin rocks to a smoked-out bitch
No school'll come close to that
A few transaction make my pockets fat
I make a lot of money and it ain't no lie
I'll probably ball 'til the day I die
And if I didn't, so what?
I bet you I'd still come up
Cause there's a whole lot of money in the ghetto.. yeah you know

A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
I'd like to keep steppin'

Take a drink, and I
Stop to think, and I
I know one day soon
We'll be- We'll be hangin' out

Tell him put down those dice for a second, Lord
Listen to his homie
Could you tell him

So his son will know
He don't have to cry no more
Cause God's got his back, I said God's got his back

A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
I'd like to keep steppin'
But I can't get past the pain

Take a drink, and I

Til the first time I laid eyes on the face of a new-born child

Chorus
I never knew love
No, I mean real love
I never knew that kind of love
Til this moment with you

I never understood the meaning of home
Til I pulled into that old dirt drive after being gone too long
I didn't know what serenity really was
Til I stopped one day to listen to that river gently run

Chorus
And I never knew love
No, I mean real love
I never knew that kind of love
Til this moment with you

I've known the hunger before tonight for other love
I felt the yearning I felt the fire, in their touch
This goes deeper than any thing i've ever known
Beyond my heart, clear down to my soul

I never knew what beauty could behold
Til you looked at me and I could see forever unfold
Oh you made me whole

Chorus
I never knew love
No I mean real love
I never knew that kind of love
Til this moment with you

Til I was loved by you",Doug Stone,Doug Stone,1994,"[96, 95, 87, 89, 94, 97, 89, 81, 87]",9

Compton, Compton, Compton
Ahh, real muthaphuckkin G's
Ahh, real muthaphuckkin G's
Ahh, real muthaphuckkin G's
Ahh, real muthaphuckkin G's

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Hey yo, Doctor, here's another proper track
And it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
See, you's a wannabe 'loc, and you'll get smoked, and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about sprayin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre! Motherfuck Snoop! Motherfuck Death Row!
Yo, and here comes my left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid, you found a pup, and now you're dapper
But tell me, where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper?
Talkin' 'bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
(Damn, E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day)
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his own album cover he was a she-thang
So, nigga please, nigga please
Don't step to these muthaphuckkin' real G's

[Hook]
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)
Boy, you should've known by now

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Every day it's a new rapper claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the master is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me, who's a witness to your fuckin' work?
So you never had no bid'ness, so save the drama, jerk!
Niggas straight kill me, knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangstas
See, I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
'Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talkin' about they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen the parts of the streets, G
Think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin' khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag tried to sag, but you're floodin' at the same time
And your set don't accept ya; scared to kick it with your homies
'Cause you know they don't respect ya
So, nigga please, check nuts
Before you step to these muthaphuckkin' real G's

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition ""Original baby gangsta""
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker, I'ma bank ya
Shank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
'Cause if you do, then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See, young niggas like me will break you off somethin'
Claimin' my city — but Dre, you ain't from Compton
Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real muthaphuckkin' G's

[Hook]
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
I never met a O.G. who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now, nigga, it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my Doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn, it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick to smokin' on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothin' but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you gettin' treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass pumped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real muthaphuckkin' G's

[Hook]
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)
Boy, you should've known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless

Through fields to feast my eyes upon

The loving cup of burning sun

In dreams I'll crave familiar taste
Of whispered rain on weary face
Of kisses sweet and warm embrace

Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town
Where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some stranger down
Sleeping with an empty bottle, he's a sad and an empty hearted man
All he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can

[Chorus 1]
We always need to hear both sides of the story
Both sides of the story

[Verse 2]
A neighbourhood peace is shattered it's the middle of the night
Young faces hide in the shadows, while they watch their mother and father fight
He says she's been unfaithful, she says her love for him has gone
And the brother shrugs to his sister and says ""looks like it's just us from now on""

[Chorus 1]
All we always need to hear both sides of the story
We need to hear both sides of the story

And the lights are all on, the world is watching now
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
Until you hear both sides

[Verse 3]
Here we are all gathered in what seems to be the center of the storm
Neighbors once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn
They've been fighting here for years, but now there's killing on the streets
While small coffins are lined up sadly, now united in defeat

[Chorus 1]
All we always need to hear both sides of the story

[Chorus 2]
And the lights are all on, the world is watching now
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
Until you see both sides

[Verse 4]
White man turns the corner, finds himself within a different world
Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder, throws him up against the wall
He says ""Would you respect me if I didn't have this gun""
""Because without it, I don't get it, and that's why I carry one""

We always need to hear both sides of the story
Both sides of the story

They ain't find me in the pentagon
Your money small like a leprechaun
If my money tall, well, y'all catchin' on
I'm still shinin', nobody flexin' on
Pray they dated, pray this haters hated
That mean they done play it, kinda really faded
Kinda really jaded, kinda really shaded

Sending applications to my foundation
They found Satan? Tell him I'm waiting

Paralyzing people, partners popping like pimples
Y'all know we way special, check the statistic
I'm obviously known to go ballistic
I knew this little boy, he was autistic
So he don't talk shit about my sadistic
No simplistic, that's unrealistic
I'm way too vicious to list all of your characteristics
Sending ballers to the therapist, terrorist sickness
To me, you rappers is hilarious, witness
My flow is extraordinary, sending rappers to the cemetery
Parental adversary, we ain't need no commentary
Necessary to tell you that I'm legendary
Very scary, had 11 bitches on my dictionary
Verses, my curses in cursive, curb and the urges
It's urging to be so urban, I'm swerving in the suburban
Pick up the bourbon, it's a burden to be a Tim Burton
I'm burping these babies, determined the service
Check the anatomy, you would have to be my majesty
To pass the academy, popping caps out the rhapsody!

I reach pristine, and punch you through your PC screen
You better run when you see me scream

I duck quickly during shootouts in the rough city
I ain’t goin' out like that, I ain’t Cypress Hill
And I ain’t gonna kill you, but you know that my snipers will
Put one through your forehead, leave you on the floor dead
And throw your blood across your car until the windshield wiper spills
Me & JC are going crazy, trench coats and M60s
Your chain, your pride, better get rid of them quickly
Don’t be a brain surgeon, don’t be a smart ass
Cause I’m a fucking insane person and I’ll shatter you like your part glass
Desert Eag in each hand, I'mma run up in your building
Ayo Eminem’s good, but G15 is for the children
Now it’s occurred to me that to kill evil, you’d have to murder me
Hell I’ll travel back in time and shoot my mom just so you haven’t heard of me
JC said this was braggadocios, but I have nothing to brag about
I want to get caught by police, that’s why I don’t mask my sounds
When I break in houses, so I can go out shooting
Suicide by cop or I get out by looting
I don’t have 50 Cents, but I do have a game plan
Peel your cap so bad that you're gonna need a brain scan

[Verse 1]
You wanna front—what? Jump up and get bucked
If you're feeling lucky duck then press your luck
I snatch fake-gangster emcees and make 'em faggot flambé
Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist that'll leave comp' defunct
The result's your remains stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn't come to the jungles of the East popping that yang
You won't survive, get live, catching wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
I'm a true master you can check my credentials
'Cause I choose to use my infinite potential
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky flow
Control the mic like Fidel Castro locked Cuba
So deep that you can't scuba dive
My jive's origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honeys all across the map
'Cause I'd rather bust a nut than bust a cap
In your back in fact my rap snaps your sacroiliac
I'm the mack so I don't need to tote a MAC
My attack is purely mental and its nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of your brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense, for if you persist
You'll get your snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip, hoes dip, none of the real niggas skip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I've ripped
Peep the Dirty Rotten scamp as his verbal weapons spit

[Sampled Hook]
Uh-oh! Heads up 'cause we're dropping some shit!
(Scratched x5)

[Verse 2]
Real, rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle
You're rattling on and on and ain't saying nothing
That's why you got snuffed when you bumped heads with Dirty Rotten
Have you forgotten I'll tap your jaw?
I also kick like kung fu flicks by Run Run Shaw
Made frauds bleed every time I G'd
'Cause I've perfected my drunken style like Sam Seed
Pseudo psychos, I play like Michael Jackson
When I'm busting ass and breaking backs
Inhale the putrified aroma
Breathe too deep and you'll wind up coma‒
Toast the king I'm hard like a fifth of vodka
And bring your clique 'cause I'm a hard rock knocker
I gotcha out on a limb, about to push you off the plank
Let you draw your chronz but your burner shot blanks
When the East is in the house you should come equipped

[Sampled Hook]
Uh-oh! Heads up 'cause we're dropping some shit!
(Scratched x9)

[Verse 3]
Fly like a jet, sting like a hornet
Knuckleheads get live and set it off if you want it
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is crushing crews, no joke
With styles more fatal than second hand smoke
Don't provoke the wrath of this rhyme inventor
'Cause I blow up spots like the World Trade Center
Come with the super trooper on his assault mission
The TEC's technique 'cause he's a technician
Wishing he'll go away won't help the weapons stop
The skills are shot 'cause any idiot can let off a Glock
Hard rocks melt in the clutch of the sun toucher
You claim you got beef on the streets, so what ya
Gonna do when real niggas roll up on you
And you don't got your crew
Pull your Glock, hmm...? But you don't got the heart
You was webbed straight from the start
Bought a tool and didn't learn how to use it
Got lost in Brooklyn so you had to lose it
Just for fronting you got that ass whipped

Uh-oh! Heads up 'cause we're dropping some shit!

358,I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That),"[Intro]
And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact

But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
- Oh no
- No way
And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that,
No I won't do that

Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that

[Verse 1]
And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end

And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before, or will again

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm crazy
Oh it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true-
You better believe it!

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love!
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love!
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact

But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way

But I just won't do that...

[Verse 2]
And some days I pray for Silence
And some days I pray for Soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll

And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it!

That I would do anything for love!
And you know it's true and thats a fact
I would do anything for love!

367,"Indo Smoke (From ""Poetic Justice"")","                                      MADAME SWANN AT HOME

A BREAK IN THE NARRATIVE: OLD FRIENDS IN NEW ASPECTS — THE MARQUIS DE NORPOIS — BERGOTTE — HOW I CEASE FOR THE TIME BEING TO SEE GILBERTE: A GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE SORROW CAUSED BY A PARTING AND OF THE IRREGULAR PROCESS OF OBLIVION

    My mother, when it was a question of our having M. de Norpois to dinner for the first time, having expressed her regret that Professor Cottard was away from home, and that she herself had quite ceased to see anything of Swann, since either of these might have helped to entertain the old Ambassador, my father replied that so eminent a guest, so distinguished a man of science as Cottard could never be out of place at a dinner-table, but that Swann, with his ostentation, his habit of crying aloud from the housetops the name of everyone that he knew, however slightly, was an impossible vulgarian whom the Marquis de Norpois would be sure to dismiss as — to use his own epithet — a ‘pestilent’ fellow. Now, this attitude on my father’s part may be felt to require a few words of explanation, inasmuch as some of us, no doubt, remember a Cottard of distinct mediocrity and a Swann by whom modesty and discretion, in all his social relations, were carried to the utmost refinement of delicacy. But in his case, what had happened was that, to the original ‘young Swann’ and also to the Swann of the Jockey Club, our old friend had added a fresh personality (which was not to be his last), that of Odette’s husband. Adapting to the humble ambitions of that lady the instinct, the desire, the industry which he had always had, he had laboriously constructed for himself, a long way beneath the old, a new position more appropriate to the companion who was to share it with him. In this he shewed himself another man. Since (while he continued to go, by himself, to the houses of his own friends, on whom he did not care to inflict Odette unless they had expressly asked that she should be introduced to them) it was a new life that he had begun to lead, in common with his wife, among a new set of people, it was quite intelligible that, in order to estimate the importance of these new friends and thereby the pleasure, the self-esteem that were to be derived from entertaining them, he should have made use, as a standard of comparison, not of the brilliant society in which he himself had moved before his marriage but of the earlier environment of Odette. And yet, even when one knew that it was with unfashionable officials and their faded wives, the wallflowers of ministerial ball-rooms, that he was now anxious to associate, it was still astonishing to hear him, who in the old days, and even still, would so gracefully refrain from mentioning an invitation to Twickenham or to Marlborough House, proclaim with quite unnecessary emphasis that the wife of some Assistant Under-Secretary for Something had returned Mme. Swann’s call. It will perhaps be objected here that what this really implied was that the simplicity of the fashionable Swann had been nothing more than a supreme refinement of vanity, and that, like certain other Israelites, my parents’ old friend had contrived to illustrate in turn all the stages through which his race had passed, from the crudest and coarsest form of snobbishness up to the highest pitch of good manners. But the chief reason — and one which is applicable to humanity as a whole — was that our virtues themselves are not free and floating qualities over which we retain a permanent control and power of disposal; they come to be so closely linked in our minds with the actions in conjunction with which we make it our duty to practise them, that, if we are suddenly called upon to perform some action of a different order, it takes us by surprise, and without our supposing for a moment that it might involve the bringing of those very same virtues into play. Swann, in his intense consciousness of his new social surroundings, and in the pride with which he referred to them, was like those great artists — modest or generous by nature — who, if at the end of their career they take to cooking or to gardening, display a childlike gratification at the compliments that are paid to their dishes or their borders, and will not listen to any of the criticism which they heard unmoved when it was applied to their real achievements; or who, after giving away a canvas, cannot conceal their annoyance if they lose a couple of francs at dominoes

    As for Professor Cottard, we shall meet him again and can study him at our leisure, much later in the course of our story, with the ‘Mistress,’ Mme. Verdurin, in her country house La Raspelière. For the present, the following observations must suffice; first of all, in the case of Swann the alteration might indeed be surprising, since it had been accomplished and yet was not suspected by me when I used to see Gilberte’s father in the Champs-Elysées, where, moreover, as he never spoke to me, he could not very well have made any display of his political relations. It is true that, if he had done so, I might not at once have discerned his vanity, for the idea that one has long held of a person is apt to stop one’s eyes and ears; my mother, for three whole years, had no more noticed the salve with which one of her nieces used to paint her lips than if it had been wholly and invisibly dissolved in some clear liquid; until one day a streak too much, or possibly something else, brought about the phenomenon known as super-saturation; all the paint that had hitherto passed unperceived was now crystallised, and my mother, in the face of this sudden riot of colour, declared, in the best Combray manner, that it was a perfect scandal, and almost severed relations with her niece. With Cottard, on the contrary, the epoch in which we have seen him assisting at the first introduction of Swann to the Verdurins was now buried in the past; whereas honours, offices and titles come with the passage of years; moreover, a man may be illiterate, and make stupid puns, and yet have a special gift, which no amount of general culture can replace — such as the gift of a great strategist or physician. And so it was not merely as an obscure practitioner, who had attained in course of time to European celebrity, that the rest of his profession regarded Cottard. The most intelligent of the younger doctors used to assert — for a year or two, that is to say, for fashions, being themselves begotten of the desire for change, are quick to change also — that if they themselves ever fell ill Cottard was the only one of the leading men to whom they would entrust their lives. No doubt they preferred, socially, to meet certain others who were better read, more artistic, with whom they could discuss Nietzsche and Wagner. When there was a musical party at Mme. Cottard’s, on the evenings when she entertained — in the hope that it might one day make him Dean of the Faculty — the colleagues and pupils of her husband, he, instead of listening, preferred to play cards in another room. Yet everybody praised the quickness, the penetration, the unerring confidence with which, at a glance, he could diagnose disease. Thirdly, in considering the general impression which Professor Cottard must have made on a man like my father, we must bear in mind that the character which a man exhibits in the latter half of his life is not always, even if it is often his original character developed or withered, attenuated or enlarged; it is sometimes the exact opposite, like a garment that has been turned. Except from the Verdurins, who were infatuated with him, Cottard’s hesitating manner, his excessive timidity and affability had, in his young days, called down upon him endless taunts and sneers. What charitable friend counselled that glacial air? The importance of his professional standing made it all the more easy to adopt. Wherever he went, save at the Verdurins’, where he instinctively became himself again, he would assume a repellent coldness, remain silent as long as possible, be peremptory when he was obliged to speak, and not forget to say the most cutting things. He had every opportunity of rehearsing this new attitude before his patients, who, seeing him for the first time, were not in a position to make comparisons, and would have been greatly surprised to learn that he was not at all a rude man by nature. Complete impassivity was what he strove to attain, and even while visiting his hospital wards, when he allowed himself to utter one of those puns which left everyone, from the house physician to the junior student, helpless with laughter, he would always make it without moving a muscle of his face, while even that was no longer recognisable now that he had shaved off his beard and moustache

    But who, the reader has been asking, was the Marquis de Norpois? Well, he had been Minister Plenipotentiary before the War, and was actually an Ambassador on the Sixteenth of May; in spite of which, and to the general astonishment, he had since been several times chosen to represent France on Extraordinary Missions — even as Controller of the Public Debt in Egypt, where, thanks to his great capability as a financier, he had rendered important services — by Radical Cabinets under which a reactionary of the middle classes would have declined to serve, and in whose eyes M. de Norpois, in view of his past, his connexions and his opinions, ought presumably to have been suspect. But these advanced Ministers seemed to consider that, in making such an appointment, they were shewing how broad their own minds were, when the supreme interests of France were at stake, were raising themselves above the general run of politicians, were meriting, from the Journal des Débats itself, the title of ‘Statesmen,’ and were reaping direct advantage from the weight that attaches to an aristocratic name and the dramatic interest always aroused by an unexpected appointment. And they knew also that they could reap these advantages by making an appeal to M. de Norpois, without having to fear any want of political loyalty on his part, a fault against which his noble birth not only need not put them on their guard but offered a positive guarantee. And in this calculation the Government of the Republic were not mistaken. In the first place, because an aristocrat of a certain type, brought up from his cradle to regard his name as an integral part of himself of which no accident can deprive him (an asset of whose value his peers, or persons of even higher rank, can form a fairly exact estimate), knows that he can dispense with the efforts (since they can in no way enhance his position) in which, without any appreciable result, so many public men of the middle class spend themselves — to profess only the ‘right’ opinions, to frequent only the ‘sound’ people. Anxious, on the other hand, to increase his own importance in the eyes of the princely or ducal families which take immediate precedence of his own, he knows that he can do so by giving his name that complement which hitherto it has lacked, which will give it priority over other names heraldically its equals: such as political power, a literary or an artistic reputation, or a large fortune. And so what he saves by avoiding the society of the ineffective country squires, after whom all the professional families run helter-skelter, but of his intimacy with whom, were he to profess it, a prince would think nothing, he will lavish on the politicians who (free-masons, or worse, though they be) can advance him in Diplomacy or ‘back’ him in an election, and on the artists or scientists whose patronage can help him to ‘arrive’ in those departments in which they excel, on everyone, in fact, who is in a position to confer a fresh distinction or to ‘bring off’ a rich marriage

    But in the character of M. de Norpois there was this predominant feature, that, in the course of a long career of diplomacy, he had become imbued with that negative, methodical, conservative spirit, called ‘governmental,’ which is common to all Governments and, under every Government, particularly inspires its Foreign Office. He had imbibed, during that career, an aversion, a dread, a contempt for the methods of procedure, more or less revolutionary and in any event quite incorrect, which are those of an Opposition. Save in the case of a few illiterates — high or low, it makes no matter — by whom no difference in quality is perceptible, what attracts men one to another is not a common point of view but a consanguinity of spirit. An Academician of the kind of Legouvé, and therefore an upholder of the classics, would applaud Maxime Ducamp’s or Mezière’s eulogy of Victor Hugo with more fervour than that of Boileau by Claudel. A common Nationalism suffices to endear Barrés to his electors, who scarcely distinguish between him and M. Georges Berry, but does not endear him to those of his brother Academicians who, with a similar outlook on politics but a different type of mind, will prefer to him even such open adversaries as M. Ribot and M. Deschanel, with whom, in turn, the most loyal Monarchists feel themselves more closely allied than with Maurras or Léon Daudet, although these also are living in the hope of a glorious Restoration. Miserly in the use of words, not only from a professional scruple of prudence and reserve, but because words themselves have more value, present more subtleties of definition to men whose efforts, protracted over a decade, to bring two countries to an understanding, are condensed, translated — in a speech or in a protocol — into a single adjective, colourless in all appearance, but to them pregnant with a world of meaning, M. de Norpois was considered very stiff, at the Commission, where he sat next to my father, whom everyone else congratulated on the astonishing way in which the old Ambassador unbent to him. My father was himself more astonished than anyone. For not being, as a rule, very affable, his company was little sought outside his own intimate circle, a limitation which he used modestly and frankly to avow. He realised that these overtures were an outcome, in the diplomat, of that point of view which everyone adopts for himself in making his choice of friends, from which all a man’s intellectual qualities, his refinement, his affection are a far less potent recommendation of him, when at the same time he bores or irritates one, than are the mere straightforwardness and good-humour of another man whom most people would regard as frivolous or even fatuous. “De Norpois has asked me to dinner again; it’s quite extraordinary; everyone on the Commission is amazed, as he never has any personal relations with any of us. I am sure he’s going to tell me something thrilling, again, about the ‘Seventy war.” My father knew that M. de Norpois had warned, had perhaps been alone in warning the Emperor of the growing strength and bellicose designs of Prussia, and that Bismarck rated his intelligence most highly. Only the other day, at the Opera, during the gala performance given for King Theodosius, the newspapers had all drawn attention to the long conversation which that Monarch had held with M. de Norpois. “I must ask him whether the King’s visit had any real significance,” my father went on, for he was keenly interested in foreign politics. “I know old Norpois keeps very close as a rule, but when he’s with me he opens out quite charmingly.”

    As for my mother, perhaps the Ambassador had not the type of mind towards which she felt herself most attracted. I should add that his conversation furnished so exhaustive a glossary of the superannuated forms of speech peculiar to a certain profession, class and period — a period which, for that profession and that class, might be said not to have altogether passed away — that I sometimes regret that I have not kept any literal record simply of the things that I have heard him say. I should thus have obtained an effect of old-fashioned courtesy by the same process and at as little expense as that actor at the Palais-Royal who, when asked where on earth he managed to find his astounding hats, answered, “I do not find my hats. I keep them.” In a word, I suppose that my mother considered M. de Norpois a trifle ‘out-of-date,’ which was by no means a fault in her eyes, so far as manners were concerned, but attracted her less in the region — not, in this instance, of ideas, for those of M. de Norpois were extremely modern — but of idiom. She felt, however, that she was paying a delicate compliment to her husband when she spoke admiringly of the diplomat who had shewn so remarkable a predilection for him. By confirming in my father’s mind the good opinion that he already had of M. de Norpois, and so inducing him to form a good opinion of himself also, she knew that she was carrying out that one of her wifely duties which consisted in making life pleasant and comfortable for her husband, just as when she saw to it that his dinner was perfectly cooked and served in silence. And as she was incapable of deceiving my father, she compelled herself to admire the old Ambassador, so as to be able to praise him with sincerity. Incidentally she could naturally, and did, appreciate his kindness, his somewhat antiquated courtesy (so ceremonious that when, as he was walking along the street, his tall figure rigidly erect, he caught sight of my mother driving past, before raising his hat to her he would fling away the cigar that he had just lighted); his conversation, so elaborately circumspect, in which he referred as seldom as possible to himself and always considered what might interest the person to whom he was speaking; his promptness in answering a letter, which was so astonishing that whenever my father, just after posting one himself to M. de Norpois, saw his handwriting upon an envelope, his first thought was always one of annoyance that their letters must, unfortunately, have crossed in the post; which, one was led to suppose, bestowed upon him the special and luxurious privilege of extraordinary deliveries and collections at all hours of the day and night. My mother marvelled at his being so punctilious although so busy, so friendly although so much in demand, never realising that ‘although,’ with such people, is invariably an unrecognised ‘because,’ and that (just as old men are always wonderful for their age, and kings extraordinarily simple, and country cousins astonishingly well-informed) it was the same system of habits that enabled M. de Norpois to undertake so many duties and to be so methodical in answering letters, to go everywhere and to be so friendly when he came to us. Moreover she made the mistake which everyone makes who is unduly modest; she rated everything that concerned herself below, and consequently outside the range of, other people’s duties and engagements. The letter which it seemed to her so meritorious in my father’s friend to have written us promptly, since in the course of the day he must have had ever so many letters to write, she excepted from that great number of letters, of which actually it was a unit; in the same way she did not consider that dining with us was, for M. de Norpois, merely one of the innumerable activities of his social life; she never guessed that the Ambassador had trained himself, long ago, to look upon dining-out as one of his diplomatic functions, and to display, at table, an inveterate charm which it would have been too much to have expected him specially to discard when he came to dine with us

    The evening on which M. de Norpois first appeared at our table, in a year when I still went to play in the Champs-Elysées, has remained fixed in my memory because the afternoon of the same day was that upon which I at last went to hear Berma, at a matinée, in Phèdre, and also because in talking to M. de Norpois I realised suddenly, and in a new and different way, how completely the feelings aroused in me by all that concerned Gilberte Swann and her parents differed from any that the same family could inspire in anyone else

    It was no doubt the sight of the depression in which I was plunged by the approach of the New Year holidays, in which, as she herself had informed me, I was to see nothing of Gilberte, that prompted my mother one day, in the hope of distracting my mind, to suggest, “If you are still so anxious to hear Berma, I think that your father would allow you perhaps to go; your grandmother can take you.”

    But it was because M. de Norpois had told him that he ought to let me hear Berma, that it was an experience for a young man to remember in later life, that my father, who had hitherto been so resolutely opposed to my going and wasting my time, with the added risk of my falling ill again, on what he used to shock my grandmother by calling ‘futilities,’ was now not far from regarding this manner of spending an afternoon as included, in some vague way, in the list of precious formulae for success in a brilliant career. My grandmother, who, in renouncing on my behalf the profit which, according to her, I should have derived from hearing Berma, had made a considerable sacrifice in the interests of my health, was surprised to find that this last had become of no account at a mere word from M. de Norpois. Reposing the unconquerable hopes of her rationalist spirit in the strict course of fresh air and early hours which had been prescribed for me, she now deplored, as something disastrous, this infringement that I was to make of my rules, and in a tone of despair protested, “How easily led you are!” to my father, who replied angrily “What! So it’s you that are not for letting him go, now. That is really too much, after your telling us all day and every day that it would be so good for him.”

    M. de Norpois had also brought about a change in my father’s plans in a matter of far greater importance to myself. My father had always meant me to become a diplomat, and I could not endure the thought that, even if I did have to stay for some years, first, at the Ministry, I should run the risk of being sent, later on, as Ambassador, to capitals in which no Gilberte dwelt. I should have preferred to return to the literary career that I had planned for myself, and had been abandoned, years before, in my wanderings along the Guermantes way. But my father had steadily opposed my devoting myself to literature, which he regarded as vastly inferior to diplomacy, refusing even to dignify it with the title of career, until the day when M. de Norpois, who had little love for the more recent generations of diplomatic agents, assured him that it was quite possible, by writing, to attract as much attention, to receive as much consideration, to exercise as much influence, and at the same time to preserve more independence than in the Embassies

    “Well, well, I should never have believed it. Old Norpois doesn’t at all disapprove of your idea of taking up writing,” my father had reported. And as he had a certain amount of influence himself, he imagined that there was nothing that could not be ‘arranged,’ no problem for which a happy solution might not be found in the conversation of people who ‘counted.’ “I shall bring him back to dinner, one of these days, from the Commission. You must talk to him a little, and let him see what he thinks of you. Write something good that you can shew him; he is an intimate friend of the editor of the Deux-Mondes; he will get you in there; he will arrange it all, the cunning old fox; and, upon my soul, he seems to think that diplomacy, nowadays ——!”

    My happiness in the prospect of not being separated from Gilberte made me desirous, but not capable, of writing something good which could be shewn to M. de Norpois. After a few laboured pages, weariness made the pen drop from my fingers; I cried with anger at the thought that I should never have any talent, that I was not ‘gifted,’ that I could not even take advantage of the chance that M. de Norpois’s coming visit was to offer me of spending the rest of my life in Paris. The recollection that I was to be taken to hear Berma alone distracted me from my grief. But just as I did not wish to see any storms except on those coasts where they raged with most violence, so I should not have cared to hear the great actress except in one of those classic parts in which Swann had told me that she touched the sublime. For when it is in the hope of making a priceless discovery that we desire to receive certain impressions from nature or from works of art, we have certain scruples about allowing our soul to gather, instead of these, other, inferior, impressions, which are liable to make us form a false estimate of the value of Beauty. Berma in Andromaque, in Les Caprices de Marianne, in Phèdre, was one of those famous spectacles which my imagination had so long desired. I should enjoy the same rapture as on the day when in a gondola I glided to the foot of the Titian of the Frari or the Carpaccios of San Giorgio dei Schiavoni, were I ever to hear Berma repeat the lines beginning

                         “On dit qu’un prompt départ vous éloigne de
                                 nous, Seigneur — —”

    I was familiar with them from the simple reproduction in black and white which was given of them upon the printed page; but my heart beat furiously at the thought — as of the realisation of a long-planned voyage — that I should at length behold them, bathed and brought to life in the atmosphere and sunshine of the voice of gold. A Carpaccio in Venice, Berma in Phèdre, masterpieces of pictorial or dramatic art which the glamour, the dignity attaching to them made so living to me, that is to say so indivisible, that if I had been taken to see Carpaccios in one of the galleries of the Louvre, or Berma in some piece of which I had never heard, I should not have experienced the same delicious amazement at finding myself at length, with wide-open eyes, before the unique and inconceivable object of so many thousand dreams. Then, while I waited, expecting to derive from Berma’s playing the revelation of certain aspects of nobility and tragic grief, it would seem to me that whatever greatness, whatever truth there might be in her playing must be enhanced if the actress imposed it upon a work of real value, instead of what would, after all, be but embroidering a pattern of truth and beauty upon a commonplace and vulgar web

    Finally, if I went to hear Berma in a new piece, it would not be easy for me to judge of her art, of her diction, since I should not be able to differentiate between a text which was not already familiar and what she added to it by her intonations and gestures, an addition which would seem to me to be embodied in the play itself; whereas the old plays, the classics which I knew by heart, presented themselves to me as vast and empty walls, reserved and made ready for my inspection, on which I should be able to appreciate without restriction the devices by which Berma would cover them, as with frescoes, with the perpetually fresh treasures of her inspiration. Unfortunately, for some years now, since she had retired from the great theatres, to make the fortune of one on the boulevards where she was the ‘star,’ she had ceased to appear in classic parts; and in vain did I scan the hoardings; they never advertised any but the newest pieces, written specially for her by authors in fashion at the moment. When, one morning, as I stood searching the column of announcements to find the afternoon performances for the week of the New Year holidays, I saw there for the first time — at the foot of the bill, after some probably insignificant curtain-raiser, whose title was opaque to me because it had latent in it all the details of an action of which I was ignorant — two acts ofPhèdre with Mme. Berma, and, on the following afternoons, Le Demi-Monde, Les Caprices de Marianne, names which, like that of Phèdre, were for me transparent, filled with light only, so familiar were those works to me, illuminated to their very depths by the revealing smile of art. They seemed to me to invest with a fresh nobility Mme. Berma herself when I read in the newspapers, after the programme of these performances, that it was she who had decided to shew herself once more to the public in some of her early creations. She was conscious, then, that certain stage-parts have an interest which survives the novelty of their first production or the success of a revival; she regarded them, when interpreted by herself, as museum pieces which it might be instructive to set before the eyes of the generation which had admired her in them long ago, or of that which had never yet seen her in them. In thus advertising, in the middle of a column of plays intended only to while away an evening, this Phèdre, a title no longer than any of the rest, nor set in different type, she added something indescribable, as though a hostess, introducing you, before you all go in to dinner, to her other guests, were to mention, casually, amid the string of names which are the names of guests and nothing more, and without any change of tone:—“M. Anatole France.”

    The doctor who was attending me — the same who had forbidden me to travel — advised my parents not to let me go to the theatre; I should only be ill again afterwards, perhaps for weeks, and should in the long run derive more pain than pleasure from the experience. The fear of this might have availed to stop me, if what I had anticipated from such a spectacle had been only a pleasure for which a subsequent pain could so compensate as to cancel it. But what I demanded from this performance — just as from the visit to Balbec, the visit to Venice for which I had so intensely longed — was something quite different from pleasure; a series of verities pertaining to a world more real than that in which I lived, which, once acquired, could never be taken from me again by any of the trivial incidents — even though it were the cause of bodily suffering — of my otiose existence. At best, the pleasure which I was to feel during the performance appeared to me as the perhaps inevitable form of the perception of these truths; and I hoped only that the illness which had been forecast for me would not begin until the play was finished, so that my pleasure should not be in any way compromised or spoiled. I implored my parents, who, after the doctor’s visit, were no longer inclined to let me go to Phèdre. I repeated, all day long, to myself, the speech beginning

                   “On dit qu’un prompt départ vous éloigne de nous                                    — —”

    seeking out every intonation that could be put into it, so as to be able better to measure my surprise at the way which Berma would have found of uttering the lines. Concealed, like the Holy of Holies, beneath the veil that screened her from my gaze, behind which I invested her, every moment, with a fresh aspect, according to which of the words of Bergotte — in the pamphlet that Gilberte had found for me — was passing through my mind; “plastic nobility,” “Christian austerity” or “Jansenist pallor,” “Princess of Troezen and of Cleves” or “Mycenean drama,” “Delphic symbol,” “Solar myth”; that divine Beauty, whom Berma’s acting was to reveal to me, night and day, upon an altar perpetually illumined, sat enthroned hi the sanctuary of my mind, my mind for which not itself but my stern, my fickle parents were to decide whether or not it was to enshrine, and for all time, the perfections of the Deity unveiled, in the same spot where was now her invisible form. And with my eyes fixed upon that inconceivable image, I strove from morning to night to overcome the barriers which my family were putting in my way. But when those had at last fallen, when my mother — albeit this matinée was actually to coincide with the meeting of the Commission from which my father had promised to bring M. de Norpois home to dinner — had said to me, “Very well, we don’t wish you to be unhappy; — if you think that you will enjoy it so very much, you must go; that’s all;” when this day of theatre-going, hitherto forbidden and unattainable, depended now only upon myself, then for the first time, being no longer troubled by the wish that it might cease to be impossible, I asked myself if it were desirable, if there were not other reasons than my parents’ prohibition which should make me abandon my design. In the first place, whereas I had been detesting them for their cruelty, their consent made them now so dear to me that the thought of causing them pain stabbed me also with a pain through which the purpose of life shewed itself as the pursuit not of truth but of loving-kindness, and life itself seemed good or evil only as my parents were happy or sad. “I would rather not go, if it hurts you,” I told my mother, who, on the contrary, strove hard to expel from my mind any lurking fear that she might regret my going, since that, she said, would spoil the pleasure that I should otherwise derive fromPhèdre, and it was the thought of my pleasure that had induced my father and her to reverse their earlier decision. But then this sort of obligation to find a pleasure in the performance seemed to me very burdensome. Besides, if I returned home ill, should I be well again in time to be able to go to the Champs-Elysées as soon as the holidays were over and Gilberte returned? Against all these arguments I set, so as to decide which course I should take, the idea, invisible there behind its veil, of the perfections of Berma. I cast into one pan of the scales “Making Mamma unhappy,” “risking not being able to go on the Champs-Elysées,” and the other, “Jansenist pallor,” “Solar myth,” until the words themselves grew dark and clouded in my mind’s vision, ceased to say anything to me, lost all their force; and gradually my hesitations became so painful that if I had now decided upon the theatre it would have been only that I might bring them to an end, and be delivered from them once and for all. It would have been to fix a term to my sufferings, and no longer in the expectation of an intellectual benediction, yielding to the attractions of perfection, that I would let myself be taken, not now to the Wise Goddess, but to the stern, implacable Divinity, featureless and unnamed, who had been secretly substituted for her behind the veil. But suddenly everything was altered. My desire to go and hear Berma received a fresh stimulus which enabled me to await the coming of the matinée with impatience and with joy; having gone to take up, in front of the column on which the playbills were, my daily station, as excruciating, of late, as that of a stylite saint, I had seen there, still moist and wrinkled, the complete bill of Phèdre, which had just been pasted up for the first time (and on which, I must confess, the rest of the cast furnished no additional attraction which could help me to decide). But it gave to one of the points between which my indecision wavered a form at once more concrete and — inasmuch as the bill was dated not from the day on which I read it but from that on which the performance would take place, and from the very hour at which the curtain would rise — almost imminent, well on the way, already, to its realisation, so that I jumped for joy before the column at the thought that on that day, and at that hour precisely, I should be sitting there in my place, ready to hear the voice of Berma; and for fear lest my parents might not now be in time to secure two good seats for my grandmother and myself, I raced back to the house, whipped on by the magic words which had now taken the place, in my mind, of “Jansenist pallor” and “Solar myth”; —“Ladies will not be admitted to the stalls in hats. The doors will be closed at two o’clock.”

    Alas! that first matinée was to prove a bitter disappointment. My father offered to drop my grandmother and me at the theatre, on his way to the Commission. Before leaving the house he said to my mother: “See that you have a good dinner for us to-night; you remember, I’m bringing de Norpois back with me.” My mother had not forgotten. And all that day, and overnight, Françoise, rejoicing in the opportunity to devote herself to that art of the kitchen — of which she was indeed a past-master, stimulated, moreover, by the prospect of having a new guest to feed, the consciousness that she would have to compose, by methods known to her alone, a dish of beef in jelly — had been living in the effervescence of creation; since she attached the utmost importance to the intrinsic quality of the materials which were to enter into the fabric of her work, she had gone herself to the Halles to procure the best cuts of rump-steak, shin of beef, calves’-feet, as Michelangelo passed eight months in the mountains of Carrara choosing the most perfect blocks of marble for the monument of Julius II— Françoise expended on these comings and goings so much ardour that Mamma, at the sight of her flaming cheeks, was alarmed lest our old servant should make herself ill with overwork, like the sculptor of the Tombs of the Medici in the quarries of Pietrasanta. And overnight Françoise had sent to be cooked in the baker’s oven, shielded with breadcrumbs, like a block of pink marble packed in sawdust, what she called a “Nev’-York ham.” Believing the language to be less rich than it actually was in words, and her own ears less trustworthy, the first time that she heard anyone mention York ham she had thought, no doubt — feeling it to be hardly conceivable that the dictionary could be so prodigal as to include at once a ‘York’ and a ‘New York’— that she had misheard what was said, and that the ham was really called by the name already familiar to her. And so, ever since, the word York was preceded in her ears, or before her eyes when she read it in an advertisement, by the affix ‘New’ which she pronounced ‘Nev’.’ And it was with the most perfect faith that she would say to her kitchen-maid: “Go and fetch me a ham from Olida’s. Madame told me especially to get a Nev’-York.” On that particular day, if Françoise was consumed by the burning certainty of creative genius, my lot was the cruel anxiety of the seeker after truth. No doubt, so long as I had not yet heard Berma speak, I still felt some pleasure. I felt it in the little square that lay in front of the theatre, in which, in two hours’ time, the bare boughs of the chestnut trees would gleam with a metallic lustre as the lighted gas-lamps shewed up every detail of their structure; before the attendants in the box-office, the selection of whom, their promotion, all their destiny depended upon the great artist — for she alone held power in the theatre, where ephemeral managers followed one after the other in an obscure succession — who took our tickets without even glancing at us, so preoccupied were they with their anxiety lest any of Mme. Berma’s instructions had not been duly transmitted to the new members of the staff, lest it was not clearly, everywhere, understood that the hired applause must never sound for her, that the windows must all be kept open so long as she was not on the stage, and every door closed tight, the moment that she appeared; that a bowl of hot water must be concealed somewhere close to her, to make the dust settle: and, for that matter, at any moment now her carriage, drawn by a pair of horses with flowing manes, would be stopping outside the theatre, she would alight from it muffled in furs, and, crossly acknowledging everyone’s salute, would send one of her attendants to find out whether a stage box had been kept for her friends, what the temperature was ‘in front,’ who were in the other boxes, if the programme sellers were looking smart; theatre and public being to her no more than a second, an outermost cloak which she would put on, and the medium, the more or less ‘good’ conductor through which her talent would have to pass. I was happy, too, in the theatre itself; since I had made the discovery that — in contradiction of the picture so long entertained by my childish imagination — there was but one stage for everybody, I had supposed that I should be prevented from seeing it properly by the presence of the other spectators, as one is when in the thick of a crowd; now I registered the fact that, on the contrary, thanks to an arrangement which is, so to speak, symbolical of all spectatorship, everyone feels himself to be the centre of the theatre; which explained to me why, when Françoise had been sent once to see some melodrama from the top gallery, she had assured us on her return that her seat had been the best in the house, and that instead of finding herself too far from the stage she had been positively frightened by the mysterious and living proximity of the curtain. My pleasure increased further when I began to distinguish behind the said lowered curtain such confused rappings as one hears through the shell of an egg before the chicken emerges, sounds which speedily grew louder and suddenly, from that world which, impenetrable by our eyes, yet scrutinised us with its own, addressed themselves, and to us indubitably, in the imperious form of three consecutive hammer-blows as moving as any signals from the planet Mars. And — once this curtain had risen — when on the stage a writing-table and a fireplace, in no way out of the ordinary, had indicated that the persons who were about to enter would be, not actors come to recite, as I had seen them once and heard them at an evening party, but real people, just living their lives at home, on whom I was thus able to spy without their seeing me — my pleasure still endured; it was broken by a momentary uneasiness; just as I was straining my ears in readiness before the piece began, two men entered the theatre from the side of the stage, who must have been very angry with each other, for they were talking so loud that in the auditorium, where there were at least a thousand people, we could hear every word, whereas in quite a small café one is obliged to call the waiter and ask what it is that two men, who appear to be quarrelling, are saying; but at that moment, while I sat astonished to find that the audience was listening to them without protest, drowned as it was in a universal silence upon which broke, presently, a laugh here and there, I understood that these insolent fellows were the actors and that the short piece known as the ‘curtain-raiser’ had now begun. It was followed by an interval so long that the audience, who had returned to their places, grew impatient and began to stamp their feet. I was terrified at this; for just as in the report of a criminal trial, when I read that some noble-minded person was coming, against his own interests, to testify on behalf of an innocent prisoner, I was always afraid that they would not be nice enough to him, would not shew enough gratitude, would not recompense him lavishly, and that he, in disgust, would then range himself on the side of injustice; so now attributing to genius, in this respect, the same qualities as to virtue, I was afraid lest Berma, annoyed by the bad behaviour of so ill-bred an audience — in which, on the other hand, I should have liked her to recognise, with satisfaction, a few celebrities to whose judgment she would be bound to attach importance — should express her discontent and disdain by acting badly. And I gazed appealingly round me at these stamping brutes who were about to shatter, in their insensate rage, the rare and fragile impression which I had come to seek. The last moments of my pleasure were during the opening scenes of Phèdre. The heroine herself does not appear in these first scenes of the second act; and yet, as soon as the curtain rose, and another curtain, of red velvet this time, was parted in the middle (a curtain which was used to halve the depth of the stage in all the plays in which the ‘star’ appeared), an actress entered from the back who had the face and voice which, I had been told, were those of Berma. The cast must therefore have been changed; all the trouble that I had taken in studying the part of the wife of Theseus was wasted. But a second actress now responded to the first. I must, then, have been mistaken in supposing that the first was Berma, for the second even more closely resembled her, and, more than the other, had her diction. Both of them, moreover, enriched their parts with noble gestures — which I could vividly distinguish, and could appreciate in their relation to the text, while they raised and let fall the lovely folds of their tunics — and also with skilful changes of tone, now passionate, now ironical, which made me realise the significance of lines that I had read to myself at home without paying sufficient attention to what they really meant. But all of a sudden, in the cleft of the red curtain that veiled her sanctuary, as in a frame, appeared a woman, and simultaneously with the fear that seized me, far more vexing than Berma’s fear could be, lest someone should upset her by opening a window, or drown one of her lines by rustling a programme, or annoy her by applauding the others and by not applauding her enough; — in my own fashion, still more absolute than Berma’s, of considering from that moment theatre, audience, play and my own body only as an acoustic medium of no importance, save in the degree to which it was favourable to the inflexions of that voice — I realised that the two actresses whom I had been for some minutes admiring bore not the least resemblance to her whom I had come to hear. But at the same time all my pleasure had ceased; in vain might I strain towards Berma’s eyes, ears, mind, so as not to let one morsel escape me of the reasons which she would furnish for my admiring her, I did not succeed in gathering a single one. I could not even, as I could with her companions, distinguish in her diction and in her playing intelligent intonations, beautiful gestures. I listened to her as though I were readingPhèdre, or as though Phaedra herself had at that moment uttered the words that I was hearing, without its appearing that Berma’s talent had added anything at all to them. I could have wished, so as to be able to explore them fully, so as to attempt to discover what it was in them that was beautiful, to arrest, to immobilise for a time before my senses every intonation of the artist’s voice, every expression of her features; at least I did attempt, by dint of my mental agility in having, before a line came, my attention ready and tuned to catch it, not to waste upon preparations any morsel of the precious time that each word, each gesture occupied, and, thanks to the intensity of my observation, to manage to penetrate as far into them as if I had had whole hours to spend upon them, by myself. But how short their duration was! Scarcely had a sound been received by my ear than it was displaced there by another. In one scene, where Berma stands motionless for a moment, her arm raised to the level of a face bathed, by some piece of stagecraft, in a greenish light, before a back-cloth painted to represent the sea, the whole house broke out in applause; but already the actress had moved, and the picture that I should have liked to study existed no longer. I told my grandmother that I could not see very well; she handed me her glasses. Only, when one believes in the reality of a thing, making it visible by artificial means is not quite the same as feeling that it is close at hand. I thought now that it was no longer Berma at whom I was looking, but her image in a magnifying glass. I put the glasses down, but then possibly the image that my eye received of her, diminished by distance, was no more exact; which of the two Bermas was the real? As for her speech to Hippolyte, I had counted enormously upon that, since, to judge by the ingenious significance which her companions were disclosing to me at every moment in less beautiful parts, she would certainly render it with intonations more surprising than any which, when reading the play at home, I had contrived to imagine; but she did not attain to the heights which Œnone or Aricie would naturally have reached, she planed down into a uniform flow of melody the whole of a passage in which there were mingled together contradictions so striking that the least intelligent of tragic actresses, even the pupils of an academy, could not have missed their effect; besides which, she ran through the speech so rapidly that it was only when she had come to the last line that my mind became aware of the deliberate monotony which she had imposed on it throughout

    Then, at last, a sense of admiration did possess me, provoked by the frenzied applause of the audience. I mingled my own with theirs, endeavouring to prolong the general sound so that Berma, in her gratitude, should surpass herself, and I be certain of having heard her on one of her great days. A curious thing, by the way, was that the moment when this storm of public enthusiasm broke loose was, as I afterwards learned, that in which Berma reveals one of her richest treasures. It would appear that certain transcendent realities emit all around them a radiance to which the crowd is sensitive. So it is that when any great event occurs, when on a distant frontier an army is in jeopardy, or defeated, or victorious, the vague and conflicting reports which we receive, from which an educated man can derive little enlightenment, stimulate in the crowd an emotion by which that man is surprised, and in which, once expert criticism has informed him of the actual military situation, he recognises the popular perception of that ‘aura’ which surrounds momentous happenings, and which may be visible hundreds of miles away. One learns of a victory either after the war is over, or at once, from the hilarious joy of one’s hall porter. One discovers the touch of genius in Berma’s acting a week after one has heard her, in the criticism of some review, or else on the spot, from the thundering acclamation of the stalls. But this immediate recognition by the crowd was mingled with a hundred others, all quite erroneous; the applause came, most often, at wrong moments, apart from the fact that it was mechanically produced by the effect of the applause that had gone before, just as in a storm, once the sea is sufficiently disturbed, it will continue to swell, even after the wind has begun to subside. No matter; the more I applauded, the better, it seemed to me, did Berma act. “I say,” came from a woman sitting near me, of no great social pretensions, “she fairly gives it you, she does; you’d think she’d do herself an injury, the way she runs about. I call that acting, don’t you?” And happy to find these reasons for Berma’s superiority, though not without a suspicion that they no more accounted for it than would for that of the Gioconda or of Benvenuto’s Perseus a peasant’s gaping “That’s a good bit of work. It’s all gold, look! Fine, ain’t it?”, I greedily imbibed the strong wine of this popular enthusiasm. I felt, all the same, when the curtain had fallen fer the last time, disappointed that the pleasure for which I had so longed had been no greater, but at the same time I felt the need to prolong it, not to depart for ever, when I left the theatre, from this strange life of the stage which had, for a few hours, been my own, from which I should be tearing myself away, as though I were going into exile, when I returned to my; own home, had I not hoped there to learn a great deal more about Berma from her admirer, to whom I was indebted already for the permission to go to Phèdre, M. de Norpois. I was introduced to him before dinner by my father, who summoned me into his study for the purpose. As I entered, the Ambassador rose, held out his hand, bowed his tall figure and fixed his blue eyes attentively on my face. As the foreign visitors who used to be presented to him, in the days when he still represented France abroad, were all more or less (even the famous singers) persons of note, with regard to whom he could tell, when he met them, that he would be able to say, later on, when he heard then — names mentioned in Paris or in Petersburg, that he remembered perfectly the evening he had spent with them at Munich or Sofia, he had formed the habit of impressing upon them, by his affability, the pleasure with which he was making their acquaintance; but in addition to this, being convinced that in the life of European capitals, in contact at once with all the interesting personalities that passed through them and with the manners and customs of the native populations, one acquired a deeper insight than could be gained from books into the intellectual movement throughout Europe, he would exercise upon each newcomer his keen power of observation, so as to decide at once with what manner of man he had to deal. The Government had not for some time now entrusted to him a post abroad, but still, as soon as anyone was introduced to him, his eyes, as though they had not yet been informed of their master’s retirement, began their fruitful observation, while by his whole attitude he endeavoured to convey that the stranger’s name was not unknown to him. And so, all the time, while he spoke to me kindly and with the air of importance of a man who is conscious of the vastness of his own experience, he never ceased to examine me with a sagacious curiosity, and to his own profit, as though I had been some exotic custom, some historic and instruct tive building or some ‘star’ upon his course. And in this way he gave proof at once, in his attitude towards me, of the majestic benevolence of the sage Mentor and of the zealous curiosity of the young Anacharsis

    He offered me absolutely no opening to the Revue des Deux-Mondes, but put a number of questions to me on what I had been doing and reading; asked what were my own inclinations, which I heard thus spoken of for the first time as though it might be a quite reasonable thing to obey their promptings, whereas hitherto I had always supposed it to be my duty to suppress them. Since they attracted me towards Literature, he did not dissuade me from that course; on the contrary, he spoke of it with deference, as of some venerable personage whose select circle, in Rome or at Dresden, one remembers with pleasure, and regrets only that one’s multifarious duties in life enable one to revisit it so seldom. He appeared to be envying me, with an almost jovial smile, the delightful hours which, more fortunate than himself and more free, I should be able to spend with such a Mistress. But the very terms that he employed shewed me Literature as something entirely different from the image that I had formed of it at Combray, and I realised that I had been doubly right in abandoning my intention. Until now, I had reckoned only that I had not the ‘gift’ for writing; now M. de Norpois took from me the ambition also. I wanted to express to him what had been my dreams; trembling with emotion, I was painfully apprehensive that all the words which I could utter would not be the sincerest possible equivalent of what I had felt, what I had never yet attempted to formulate; that is to say that my words had no clear significance. Perhaps by a professional habit, perhaps by virtue of the calm that is acquired by every important personage whose advice is commonly sought, and who, knowing that he will keep the control of the conversation in his own hands, allows the other party to fret, to struggle, to take his time; perhaps also to emphasize the dignity of his head (Greek, according to himself, despite his sweeping whiskers), M. de Norpois, while anything was being explained to him, would preserve a facial immobility as absolute as if you had been addressing some ancient and unhearing bust in a museum. Until suddenly, falling upon you like an auctioneer’s hammer, or a Delphic oracle, the Ambassador’s voice, as he replied to you, would be all the more impressive, in that nothing in his face had allowed you to guess what sort of impression you had made on him, or what opinion he was about to express

    “Precisely;” he suddenly began, as though the case were now heard and judged, and after allowing me to writhe in increasing helplessness beneath those motionless eyes which never for an instant left my face. “There is the case of the son of one of my friends, which, mutatis mutandis, is very much like yours.” He adopted in speaking of our common tendency the same reassuring tone as if it had been a tendency not to literature but to rheumatics, and he had wished to assure me that it would not necessarily prove fatal. “He too has chosen to leave the Quai d’Orsay, although the way had been paved for him there by his father, and without caring what people might say, he has settled down to write. And certainly, he’s had no reason to regret it. He published two years ago — of course, he’s much older than you, you understand — a book dealing with the Sense of the Infinite on the Western Shore of Victoria Nyanza, and this year he has brought out a little thing, not so important as the other, but very brightly, in places perhaps almost too pointedly written, on the Repeating Rifle in the Bulgarian Army; and these have put him quite in a class by himself. He’s gone pretty far already, and he’s not the sort of man to stop half way; I happen to know that (without any suggestion, of course, of his standing for election) his name has been mentioned several times, in conversation, and not at all unfavourably, at the Academy of Moral Sciences. And so, one can’t say yet, of course, that he has reached the pinnacle of fame, still he has made his way, by sheer industry, to a very fine position indeed, and success — which doesn’t always come only to agitators and mischief-makers and men who make trouble which is usually more than they are prepared to take — success has crowned his efforts.”

    My father, seeing me already, in a few years’ time, an Academician, was tasting a contentment which M. de Norpois raised to the supreme pitch when, after a momentary hesitation in which he appeared to be calculating the possible consequences of so rash an act, he handed me his card and said: “Why not go and see him yourself? Tell him I sent you. He may be able to give you some good advice,” plunging me by his words into as painful a state of anxiety as if he had told me that, next morning, I was to embark as cabin-boy on board a sailing ship, and to go round the world

    My Aunt Léonie had bequeathed to me, together with all sorts of other things and much of her furniture, with which it was difficult to know what to do, almost all her unsettled estate — revealing thus after her death an affection for me which I had hardly suspected in her lifetime. My father, who was trustee of this estate until I came of age, now consulted M. de Norpois with regard to several of the investments. He recommended certain stocks bearing a low rate of interest, which he considered particularly sound, notably English consols and Russian four per cents. “With absolutely first class securities such as those,” said M. de Norpois, “even if your income from them is nothing very great, you may be certain of never losing any of your capital.” My father then told him, roughly, what else he had bought. M. de Norpois gave a just perceptible smile of congratulation; like all capitalists, he regarded wealth as an enviable thing, but thought it more delicate to compliment people upon their possessions only by a half-indicated sign of intelligent sympathy; on the other hand, as he was himself immensely rich, he felt that he shewed his good taste by seeming to regard as considerable the meagre revenues of his friends, with a happy and comforting resilience to the superiority of his own. He made amends for this by congratulating my father, without hesitation, on the “composition” of his list of investments, selected “with so sure, so delicate, so fine a taste.” You would have supposed, to hear him, that he attributed to the relative values of investments, and even to investments themselves, something akin to aesthetic merit. Of one, comparatively recent and still little known, which my father mentioned, M. de Norpois, like the people who have always read the books of which, you imagine, you yourself alone have ever heard, said at once, “Ah, yes, I used to amuse myself for some time with watching it in the papers; it was quite interesting,” with the retrospective smile of a regular subscriber who has read the latest novel already, in monthly instalments, in his magazine. “It would not be at all a bad idea to apply for some of this new issue. It is distinctly attractive; they are offering it at a most tempting discount.” But when he came to some of the older investments, my father, who could not remember their exact names, which it was easy to confuse with others of the same kind, opened a drawer and shewed the securities themselves to the Ambassador. The sight of them enchanted me. They were ornamented with cathedral spires and allegorical figures, like the old, romantic editions that I had pored over as a child. All the products of one period have something in common; the artists who illustrate the poetry of their generation are the same artists who are employed by the big financial houses. And nothing reminds me so much of the monthly parts of Notre-Dame de Paris, and of various books by Gérard de Nerval, that used to hang outside the grocer’s door at Combray, than does, in its rectangular and flowery border, supported by recumbent river-gods, a ‘personal share’ in the Water Company

    The contempt which my father had for my kind of intelligence was so far tempered by his natural affection for me that, in practice, his attitude towards anything that I might do was one of blind indulgence. And so he had no qualm about telling me to fetch a little ‘prose poem’ which I had made up, years before, at Combray, while coming home from a walk. I had written it down in a state of exaltation which must, I felt certain, infect everyone who read it. But it was not destined to captivate M. de Norpois, for he handed it back to me without a word

    My mother, who had the most profound respect for all my father’s occupations, came in now, timidly, to ask whether dinner might be served. She was afraid to interrupt a conversation in which she herself could have no part. And indeed my father was continually reminding the Marquis of some useful suggestion which they had decided to make at the next meeting of the Commission; speaking in the peculiar tone always adopted, when in a strange environment by a pair of colleagues — as exclusive, in this respect, as two young men from the same college — whose professional routine has furnished them with a common fund of memories to which the others present have no access, and to which they are unwilling to refer before an audience

    But the absolute control over his facial muscles to which M. de Norpois had attained allowed him to listen without seeming to hear a word. At last my father became uneasy. “I had thought,” he ventured, after an endless preamble, “of asking the advice of the Commission . . . ” Then from the face of the noble virtuoso, who had been sitting inert as a player in an orchestra sits until the moment comes for him to begin his part, were uttered, with an even delivery, on a sharp note, and as though they were no more than the completion (but scored for a different voice) of the phrase that my father had begun, the words: “of which you will not hesitate, of course, to call a meeting; more especially as the present members are all known to you personally, and there may be a change any day.” This was not in itself a very remarkable ending. But the immobility that had preceded it made it detach itself with the crystal clarity, the almost malicious unexpectedness of those phrases in which the piano, silent until then,‘takes up at a given moment, the violoncello to which one has just been listening, in a Mozart concerto

    “Well, did you enjoy your matinée?” asked my father, as we moved to the dining-room; meaning me to ‘shew off,’ and with the idea that my enthusiasm would give M. de Norpois a good opinion of me. “He has just been to hear Berma. You remember, we were talking about it the other day,” he went on, turning towards the diplomat, in the same tone of retrospective, technical, mysterious allusiveness as if he had been referring to a meeting of the Commission

    “You must have been enchanted, especially if you had never heard her before. Your father was alarmed at the effect that the little jaunt might have upon your health, which is none too good, I am told, none too robust. But I soon set his mind at rest. Theatres to-day are not what they were even twenty years ago. You have more or less comfortable seats now, and a certain amount of ventilation, although we have still a long way to go before we come up to Germany or England, which in that respect as in many others are immeasurably ahead of us. I have never seen Mme. Berma in Phèdre, but I have always heard that she is excellent in the part. You were charmed with her, of course?”

    M. de Norpois, a man a thousand times more intelligent than myself, must know that hidden truth which I had failed to extract from Berma’s playing; he knew, and would reveal it to me; in answering his question I would implore him to let me know in what that truth consisted; and he would tell me, and so justify me in the longing that I had felt to see and hear the actress. I had only a moment, I must make what use I could of it and bring my cross-examination to bear upon the essential points. But what were they? Fastening my whole attention upon my own so confused impressions, with no thought of making M. de Norpois admire me, but only that of learning from him the truth that I had still to discover, I made no attempt to substitute ready-made phrases for the words that failed me — I stood there stammering, until finally, in the hope of provoking him into declaring what there was in Berma that was admirable, I confessed that I had been disappointed

    “What’s that?” cried my father, annoyed at the bad impression which this admission of my failure to appreciate the performance must make on M. de Norpois, “What on earth do you mean; you didn’t enjoy it? Why, your grandmother has been telling us that you sat there hanging on every word that Berma uttered, with your eyes starting out of your head; that everyone else in the theatre seemed quite bored, beside you.”

    “Oh, yes, I was listening as hard as I could, trying to find out what it was that was supposed to be so wonderful about her. Of course, she’s frightfully good, and all that . . . ”

    “If she is ‘frightfully good,’ what more do you want?”

    “One of the things that have undoubtedly contributed to the success of Mme. Berma,” resumed M. de Norpois, turning with elaborate courtesy towards my mother, so as not to let her be left out of the conversation, and in conscientious fulfilment of his duty of politeness to the lady of the house, “is the perfect taste that she shews in selecting her parts; thus she can always be assured of success, and success of the right sort. She hardly ever appears in anything trivial. Look how she has thrown herself into the part of Phèdre. And then, she brings the same good taste to the choice of her costumes, and to her acting. In spite of her frequent and lucrative tours in England and America, the vulgarity — I will not say of John Bull; that would be unjust, at any rate to the England of the Victorian era — but of Uncle Sam has not infected her. No loud colours, no rant. And then that admirable voice, which has been of such service to her, with which she plays so delightfully — I should almost be tempted to describe it as a musical instrument!”

    My interest in Berma’s acting had continued to grow ever since the fall of the curtain, because it was then no longer compressed within the limits of reality; but I felt the need to find explanations for it; moreover it had been fixed with the same intensity, while Berma was on the stage, upon everything that she offered, in the indivisibility of a living whole, to my eyes and ears; there was nothing separate or distinct; it welcomed, accordingly, the discovery of a reasonable cause in these tributes paid to the simplicity, to the good taste of the actress, it attracted them to itself by its power of absorption, seized hold of them, as the optimism of a drunken man seizes hold of the actions of his neighbour, in each of which he finds an excuse for emotion. “He is right!” I told myself. “What a charming voice, what an absence of shrillness, what simple costumes, what intelligence to have chosen Phèdre. No; I have not been disappointed!”

    The cold beef, spiced with carrots, made its appearance, couched by the Michelangelo of our kitchen upon enormous crystals of jelly, like transparent blocks of quartz

    “You have a chef of the first order, Madame,” said M. de Norpois, “and that is no small matter. I myself, who have had, when abroad, to maintain a certain style in housekeeping, I know how difficult it often is to find a perfect master-cook. But this is a positive banquet that you have set before us!”

    And indeed Françoise, in the excitement of her ambition to make a success, for so distinguished a guest, of a dinner the preparation of which had been obstructed by difficulties worthy of her powers, had given herself such trouble as she no longer took when we were alone, and had recaptured her incomparable Combray manner

    “That is a thing you can’t get in a chophouse — in the best of them, I mean; a spiced beef in which the jelly does not taste of glue and the beef has caught the flavour of the carrots; it is admirable! Allow me to come again,” he went on, making a sign to shew that he wanted more of the jelly. “I should be interested to see how your Vatel managed a dish of quite a different kind; I should like, for instance, to see him tackle a boeuf Stroganoff.”

    M. de Norpois, so as to add his own contribution to the gaiety of the repast, entertained us with a number of the stories with which he was in the habit of regaling his colleagues in “the career,” quoting now some ludicrous sentence uttered by a politician, an old offender, whose sentences were always long and packed with incoherent images, now some monumental epigram of a diplomat, sparkling with attic salt. But, to tell the truth, the criterion which for him set apart these two kinds of phrase in no way resembled that which I was in the habit of applying to literature.. Most of the finer shades escaped me; the words which he repeated with derision seemed to me not to differ very greatly from those which he found remarkable. He belonged to the class of men who, had we come to discuss the books that I liked, would have said: “So you understand that, do you? I must confess that I do not understand, I am not initiated;” but I could have matched his attitude, for I did not grasp the wit or folly, the eloquence or pomposity which he found in a statement or a speech, and the absence of any perceptible reason for one’s being badly and the other’s well expressed made that sort of literature seem more mysterious, more obscure to me than any other. I could distinguish only that to repeat what everybody else was thinking was, in politics, the mark not of an inferior but of a superior mind. When M. de Norpois made use of certain expressions which were ‘common form’ in the newspapers, and uttered them with emphasis, one felt that they became an official pronouncement by the mere fact of his having employed them, and a pronouncement which would provoke a string of comment

    My mother was counting greatly upon the pineapple and truffle salad. But the Ambassador, after fastening for a moment on the confection the penetrating gaze of a trained observer, ate it with the inscrutable discretion of a diplomat, and without disclosing to us what he thought of it. My mother insisted upon his taking some more, which he did, but saying only, in place of the compliment for which she was hoping: “I obey, Madame, for I can see that it is, on your part, a positive ukase!”

    “We saw in the ‘papers that you had a long talk with King Theodosius,” my father ventured

    “Why, yes; the King, who has a wonderful memory for faces, was kind enough to remember, when he noticed me in the stalls, that I had had the honour to meet him on several occasions at the Court of Bavaria, at a time when he had never dreamed of his oriental throne — to which, as you know, he was summoned by a European Congress, and indeed had grave doubts about accepting the invitation, regarding that particular sovereignty as unworthy of his race, the noblest, heraldically speaking, in the whole of Europe. An aide-de-camp came down to bid me pay my respects to his Majesty, whose command I hastened, naturally, to obey.”

    “And I trust, you are satisfied with the results of his visit?”

    “Enchanted! One was justified in feeling some apprehension as to the manner in which a Sovereign who is still so young would handle a situation requiring tact, particularly at this highly delicate juncture. For my own part, I reposed entire confidence in the King’s political sense. But I must confess that he far surpassed my expectations. The speech that he made at the Elysée, which, according to information that has come to me from a most authoritative source, was composed, from beginning to end, by himself, was fully deserving of the interest that it has aroused in all quarters. It was simply masterly; a trifle daring, I quite admit, but with an audacity which, after all, has been fully justified by the event. Traditional diplomacy is all very well in its way, but in practice it has made his country and ours live in an hermetically sealed atmosphere in which it was no longer possible to breathe. Very well! There is one method of letting in fresh air, obviously not one of the methods which one could officially recommend, but one which King Theodosius might allow himself to adopt — and that is to break the windows. Which he accordingly did, with a spontaneous good humour that delighted everybody, and also with an aptness in his choice of words in which one could at once detect the race of scholarly princes from whom he is descended through his mother. There can be no question that when he spoke of the ‘affinities’ that bound his country to France, the expression, rarely as it may occur in the vocabulary of the Chancellories, was a singularly happy one. You see that literary ability is no drawback, even in diplomacy, even upon a throne,” he went on, turning for a moment to myself. “The community of interests had long been apparent, I quite admit, and the relations of the two Powers were excellent. Still, it needed putting into words. The word was what we were all waiting for, it was chosen with marvellous aptitude; you have seen the effect it had. For my part, I must confess I applauded openly.”

    “Your friend M. de Vaugoubert will be pleased, after preparing for the agreement all these years.”

    “All the more so that his Majesty, who is quite incorrigible, really, in some ways, had taken care to spring it on him as a surprise. And it did come as a complete surprise, incidentally, to everyone concerned, beginning with the Foreign Minister himself, who — I have heard — did not find it at all to his liking. It appears that someone spoke to him about it and that he replied, pretty sharply, and loud enough to be overheard by the people on either side of them: ‘I have been neither consulted nor informed!’ indicating clearly by that that he declined to accept any responsibility for the consequences. I must own that the incident has given rise to a great deal of comment, and I should not go so far as to deny,” he went on with a malicious smile, “that certain of my colleagues, for whom the supreme law appears to be that of inertia, may have been shaken from their habitual repose. As for Vaugoubert, you are aware that he has been bitterly attacked for his policy of bringing that country into closer relations with France, which must have been more than ordinarily painful to him, he is so sensitive, such an exquisite nature. I can amply testify to that, since, for all that he is considerably my junior, I have had many dealings with him, we are friends of long standing and I know him intimately. Besides, who could help knowing him? His is a heart of crystal. Indeed, that is the one fault that there is to be found with him; it is not necessary for the heart of a diplomat to be as transparent as all that. Still, that does not prevent their talking of sending him to Rome, which would be a fine rise for him, but a pretty big plum to swallow. Between ourselves, I fancy that Vaugoubert, utterly devoid of ambition as he is, would be very well pleased, and would by no means ask for that cup to pass from him. For all we know, he may do wonders down there; he is the chosen candidate of the Consulta, and for my part I can see him very well placed, with his artistic leanings, in the setting of the Farnese Palace and the Caracci Gallery. At least you would suppose that it was impossible for any one to hate him; but there is a whole camarilla collected round King Theodosius which is more or less held in fief by the Wilhelmstrasse, whose inspiration its members dutifully absorb, and these men have done everything in their power to checkmate him. Not only has Vaugoubert had to face these backstairs intrigues, he has had to endure also the insults of a gang of hireling pamphleteers who later on, being like every subsidised journalist the most arrant cowards, have been the first to cry quits, but in the interval had not shrunk from hurling at our Representative the most fatuous accusations that the wit of irresponsible fools could invent. For a month and more Vaugoubert’s enemies had been dancing round him, howling for his scalp,” M. de Norpois detached this word with shacp emphasis. “But forewarned is forearmed; as for their insults, he spurned them with his foot!” he went on with even more determination, and with so fierce a glare in his eye that for a moment we forgot our food. “In the words of a fine Arab proverb, ‘The dogs may bark; the caravan goes on!’” After launching this quotation M. de Norpois paused and examined our faces, to see what effect it had had upon us. Its effect was great, the proverb being familiar to us already. It had taken the place, that year, among people who ‘really counted,’ of “He who sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind,” which was sorely in need of a rest, not having the perennial freshness of “Working for the King of Prussia.” For the culture of these eminent men was an alternate, if not a tripartite and triennial culture. Of course, the use of quotations such as these, with which M. de Norpois excelled in jewelling his articles in the Revue, was in no way essential to their appearing solid and well-informed. Even without the ornament which the quotations supplied, it sufficed that M. de Norpois should write at a given point (as he never failed to write): “The Court of St. James’s was not the last to be sensible of the peril,” or “Feeling ran high on the Singers’ Bridge, which with anxious eyes was following the selfish but skilful policy of the Dual Monarchy,” or “A cry of alarm sounded from Montecitorio,” or yet again, “That everlasting double-dealing which is so characteristic of the Ballplatz.” By these expressions the profane reader had at once recognised and had paid deference to the diplomat de carrière. But what had made people say that he was something more than that, that he was endowed with a superior culture, had been his careful use of quotations, the perfect example of which, at that date, was still: “Give me a good policy and I will give you good finances, to quote the favourite words of Baron Louis“: for we had not yet imported from the Far East: “Victory is on the side that can hold out a quarter of an hour longer than the other,as the Japanese say.” This reputation for immense literary gifts, combined with a positive genius for intrigue which he kept concealed beneath a mask of indifference, had secured the election of M. de Norpois to the Académie des Sciences Morales. And there were some who even thought that he would riot be out of place in the Académie Française, on the famous day when, wishing to indicate that it was only by drawing the Russian Alliance closer that we could hope to arrive at an understanding with Great Britain, he had not hesitated to write: “Be it clearly understood in the Quai d’Orsay, be it taught henceforward in all the manuals of geography, which appear to be incomplete in this respect, be his certificate of graduation remorselessly withheld from every candidate who has not learned to say, ‘If all roads lead to Rome, nevertheless the way from Paris to London runs of necessity through St. Petersburg.’”

    “In short,” M. de Norpois went on, addressing my father, “Vaugoubert has won himself considerable distinction from this affair, quite beyond anything on which he can have reckoned. He expected, you understand, a correctly worded speech (which, after the storm-clouds of recent years, would have been something to the good) but nothing more. Several persons who had the honour to be present have assured me that it is impossible, when one merely reads the speech, to form any conception of the effect that it produced when uttered — when articulated with marvellous clearness of diction by the King, who is a master of the art of public speaking and in that passage underlined every possible shade of meaning. I allowed myself, in this connexion, to listen to a little anecdote which brings into prominence once again that frank, boyish charm by which King Theo-dosius has won so many hearts. I am assured that, just as he uttered that word ‘affinities,’ which was, of course, the startling innovation of the speech, and one that, as you will see, will provoke discussion in the Chancellories for years to come, his Majesty, anticipating the delight of our Ambassador, who was to find in that word the seal, the crown set upon all his labours, on his dreams, one might almost say, and, in a word, his marshal’s baton, made a half turn towards Vaugoubert and fixing upon him his arresting gaze, so characteristic of the Oettingens, fired at him that admirably chosen word ‘affinities,’ a positive treasure-trove, uttering it in a tone which made it plain to all his hearers that it was employed of set purpose and with full knowledge of the circumstances. It appears that Vaugoubert found some difficulty in mastering his emotion, and I must confess that, to a certain extent, I can well understand it. Indeed, a person who is entirely to be believed has told me, in confidence, that the King came up to Vaugoubert after the dinner, when His Majesty was holding an informal court, and was heard to say, ‘Well, are you satisfied with your pupil, my dear Marquis?’

    “One thing, however,” M. de Norpois concluded, “is certain; and that is that a speech like that has done more than twenty years of negotiation towards bringing the two countries together, uniting their ‘affinities,’ to borrow the picturesque expression of Theodosius II. It is no more than a word, if you like, but look what success it has had, how the whole of the European press is repeating it, what interest it has aroused, what a new note it has struck. Besides it is distinctly in the young Sovereign’s manner. I will not go so far as to say that he lights upon a diamond of that water every day. But it is very seldom that, in his prepared speeches, or better still in the impulsive flow of his conversation, he does not reveal his character — I was on the point of saying ‘does not affix his signature’— by the use of some incisive word. I myself am quite free from any suspicion of partiality in this respect, for I am stoutly opposed to all innovations in terminology. Nine times out of ten they are most dangerous.”

    “Yes, I was thinking, only the other day, that the German Emperor’s telegram could not be much to your liking,” said my father

    M. de Norpois raised his eyes to heaven, as who should say, “Oh, that fellow!” before he replied: “In the first place, it is an act of ingratitude. It is more than a crime; it is a blunder, and one of a crassness which I can describe only as pyramidal! Indeed, unless some one puts a check on his activities, the man who has got rid of Bismarck is quite capable of repudiating by degrees the whole of the Bismarckian policy; after which it will be a leap in the dark.”

    “My husband tells me, sir, that you are perhaps going to take him to Spain one summer; that will be nice for him; I am so glad.”

    “Why, yes; it is an idea that greatly attracts me; I amuse myself, planning a tour. I should like to go there with you, my dear fellow. But what about you, Madame; have you decided yet how you are going to spend your holidays?”

    “I shall perhaps go with my son to Balbec, but I am not certain.”

    “Oh, but Balbec is quite charming, I was down that way a few years ago. They are beginning to build some very pretty little-villas there; I think you’ll like the place. But may I ask what has made you choose Balbec?”

    “My son is very anxious to visit some of the churches in that neighbourhood, and Balbec church in particular. I was a little afraid that the tiring journey there, and the discomfort of staying in the place might be too much for him. But I hear that they have just opened an excellent hotel, in which he will be able to get all the comfort that he requires.”

    “Indeed! I must make a note of that, for a certain person who will not turn up her nose at a comfortable hotel.”

    “The church at Balbec is very beautiful, sir, is it not?” I inquired, repressing my sorrow at learning that one of the attractions of Balbec consisted in its pretty little villas

    “No, it is not bad; but it cannot be compared for a moment with such positive jewels in stone as the Cathedrals of Rheims and Chartres, or with what is to my mind the pearl among them all, the Sainte-Chapelle here in Paris.”

    “But, surely, Balbec church is partly romanesque, is it not?”

    “Why, yes, it is in the romanesque style, which is to say very cold and lifeless, with no hint in it anywhere of the grace, the fantasy of the later gothic builders, who worked their stone as if it had been so much lace. Balbec church is well worth a visit, if you are in those parts; it is decidedly quaint; on a wet day, when you have nothing better to do, you might look inside; you will see the tomb of Tourville.”

    “Tell me, were you at the Foreign Ministry dinner last night?” asked my father. “I couldn’t go.”

    “No,” M. de Norpois smiled, “I must confess that I renounced it for a party of a very different sort. I was dining with a lady whose name you may possibly have heard, the beautiful Mme. Swann.” My mother checked an impulsive movement, for, being more rapid in perception than my father, she used to alarm herself on his account over things which only began to upset him a moment later. Anything unpleasant that might occur to him was discovered first by her, just as bad news from France is always known abroad sooner than among ourselves. But she was curious to know what sort of people the Swanns managed to entertain, and so inquired of M. de Norpois as to whom he had met there

    “Why, my dear lady, it is a house which (or so it struck me) is especially attractive to gentlemen. There were several married men there last night, but their wives were all, as it happened, unwell, and so had not come with them,” replied the Ambassador with a mordancy sheathed in good-humour, casting on each of us a glance the gentleness and discretion of which appeared to be tempering while in reality they deftly intensified its malice

    “In all fairness,” he went on, “I must add that women do go to the house, but women who belong rather — what shall I say — to the Republican world than to Swann’s” (he pronounced it “Svann’s”) “circle. Still, you can never tell. Perhaps it will turn into a political or a literary salon some day. Anyhow, they appear to be quite happy as they are. Indeed, I feel that Swann advertises his happiness just a trifle too blatantly. He told us the names of all the people who had asked him and his wife out for the next week, people with whom there was no particular reason to be proud of being intimate, with a want of reserve, of taste, almost of tact which I was astonished to remark in so refined a man. He kept on repeating, ‘We haven’t a free evening!’ as though that had been a thing to boast of, positively like a parvenu, and he is certainly not that. For Swann had always plenty of friends, women as well as men, and without seeming over-bold, without the least wish to appear indiscreet, I think I may safely say that not all of them, of course, nor even the majority of them, but one at least, who is a lady of the very highest rank, would perhaps not have shewn herself inexorably averse from the idea of entering upon relations with Mme. Swann, in which case it is safe to assume that more than one sheep of the social flock would have followed her lead. But it seems that there has been no indication on Swann’s part of any movement in that direction

    “What do I see? A Nesselrode pudding! As well! I declare, I shall need a course at Carlsbad after such a Lucullus-feast as this

    “Possibly Swann felt that there would be too much resistance to overcome. The marriage — so much is certain — was not well received. There has been some talk of his wife’s having money, but that is all humbug. Anyhow, the whole affair has been looked upon with disfavour. And then, Swann has an aunt who is excessively rich and in an admirable position socially, married to a man who, financially speaking, is a power. Not only has she refused to meet Mme. Swann, she has actually started a campaign to force her friends and acquaintances to do the same. I do not mean to say that anyone who moves in a good circle in Paris has shewn any actual incivility to Mme. Swann. . . . No! A hundred times no! Quite apart from her husband’s being eminently a man to take up the challenge. Anyhow, there is one curious thing about it, to see the immense importance that Swann, who knows so many and such exclusive people, attaches to a society of which the best that can be said is that it is extremely mixed. I myself, who knew him in the old days, must admit that I felt more astonished than amused at seeing a man so well-bred as he is, so much at home in the best houses, effusively thanking the Chief Secretary to the Minister of Posts for having come to them, and asking him whether Mme. Swann might take the liberty of calling upon his wife. He must feel something of an exile, don’t you know; evidently, it’s quite a different world. I don’t think, all the same, that Swann is unhappy. It is true that for some years before the marriage she was always trying to blackmail him in a rather disgraceful way; she would take the child away whenever Swann refused her anything. Poor Swann, who is as unsophisticated as he is, for all that, sharp, believed every time that the child’s disappearance was a coincidence, and declined to face the facts. Apart from that, she made such continual scenes that everyone expected that, from the day she attained her object and was safely married, nothing could possibly restrain her and that their life would be a hell on earth. Instead of which, just the opposite has happened. People are inclined to laugh at the way in which Swann speaks of his wife; it’s become a standing joke. Of course, one could hardly expect that, conscious, more or less of being a —(you remember Molière’s line) he would go and proclaim it urbi et orbi; still that does not prevent one from finding a tendency in him to exaggerate when he declares that she makes an excellent wife. And yet that is not so far from the truth as people imagine. In her own way — which is not, perhaps, what all husbands would prefer, but then, between you and me, I find it difficult to believe that Swann, who has known her for ever so long and is far from being an utter fool, did not know what to expect — there can be no denying that she does seem to have a certain regard for him. I do not say that she is not flighty, and Swann himself has no fault to find with her for that, if one is to believe the charitable tongues which, as you may suppose, continue to wag. But she is distinctly grateful to him for what he has done for her, and, despite the fears that were everywhere expressed of the contrary, her temper seems to have become angelic.”

    This alteration was perhaps not so extraordinary as M. de Norpois professed to find it. Odette had not believed that Swann would ever consent to marry her; each time that she made the suggestive announcement that some man about town had just married his mistress she had seen him stiffen into a glacial silence, or at the most, if she were directly to challenge him, asking: “Don’t you think it very nice, a very fine thing that he has done, for a woman who sacrificed all her youth to him?” had heard him answer dryly: “But I don’t say that there’s anything wrong in it. Everyone does what he himself thinks right.” She came very near, indeed, to believing that (as he used to threaten in moments of anger) he was going to leave her altogether, for she had heard it said, not long since, by a woman sculptor, that “You cannot be surprised at anything men do, they’re such brutes,” and impressed by the profundity of this maxim of pessimism she had appropriated it for herself, and repeated it on every possible occasion with an air of disappointment which seemed to imply: “After all, it’s not impossible in any way; it would be just my luck.” Meanwhile all the virtue had gone from the optimistic maxim which had hitherto guided Odette through life: “You can do anything with men when they’re in love with you, they’re such idiots!” a doctrine which was expressed on her face by the same tremor of an eyelid that might have accompanied such words as: “Don’t be frightened; he won’t break anything.” While she waited, Odette was tormented by the thought of what one of her friends, who had been married by a man who had not lived with her for nearly so long as Odette herself had lived with Swann, and had had no child by him, and who was now in a definitely respectable position, invited to the balls at the Elysée and so forth, must think of Swann’s behaviour. A consultant more discerning than M. de Norpois would doubtless have been able to diagnose that it was this feeling of shame and humiliation that had embittered Odette, that the devilish characteristics which she displayed were no essential part of her, no irremediable evil, and so would easily have foretold what had indeed come to pass, namely that a new rule of life, the matrimonial, would put an end, with almost magic swiftness, to these painful incidents, of daily occurrence but in no sense organic. Practically everyone was surprised at the marriage, and this, in itself, is surprising. No doubt very few people understand the purely subjective nature of the phenomenon that we call love, or how it creates, so to speak, a fresh, a third, a supplementary person, distinct from the person whom the world knows by the same name, a person most of whose constituent elements are derived from ourself, the lover. And so there are very few who can regard as natural the enormous proportions that a creature comes to assume in our eyes who is not the same as the creature that they see. It would appear, none the less, that so far as Odette was concerned people might have taken into account the fact that if, indeed, she had never entirely understood Swann’s mentality, at least she was acquainted with the titles, and with all the details of his studies, so much so that the name of Vermeer was as familiar to her as that of her own dressmaker; while as for Swann himself she knew intimately those traits of character of which the rest of the world must remain ignorant or merely laugh at them, and only a mistress or a sister may gain possession of the revealing, cherished image; and so strongly are we attached to such eccentricities, even to those of them which we are most anxious to correct, that it is because a woman comes in time to acquire an indulgent, an affectionately mocking familiarity, such as we ourselves have with them, or our relatives have, that amours of long standing have something of the sweetness and strength of family affection. The bonds that unite us to another creature receive their consecration when that creature adopts the same point of view as ourself in judging one of our imperfections. And among these special traits there were others, besides, which belonged as much to his intellect as to his character, which, all the same, because they had their roots in the latter, Odette had been able more easily to discern. She complained that when Swann turned author, when he published his essays, these characteristics were not to be found in them as they were in his letters, or in his conversation, where they abounded. She urged him to give them a more prominent place. She would have liked that because it was these things that she herself preferred in him, but since she preferred them because they were the things most typical of himself, she was perhaps not wrong in wishing that they might be found in his writings. Perhaps also she thought that his work, if endowed with more vitality, so that it ultimately brought him success, might enable her also to form what at the Verdurins’ she had been taught to value above everything else in the world — a salon

    Among the people to whom this sort of marriage appeared ridiculous, people who in their own case would ask themselves, “What will M. de Guermantes think, what will Bréauté say when I marry Mlle, de Montmorency?”, among the people who cherished that sort of social ideal would have figured, twenty years earlier, Swann himself, the Swarm who had taken endless pains to get himself elected to the Jockey Club, and had reckoned at that time on making a brilliant marriage which, by consolidating his position, would have made him one of the most conspicuous figures in Paris. Only, the visions which a marriage like that suggests to the mind of the interested party need, like all visions, if they are not to fade away and be altogether lost, to receive sustenance from without. Your most ardent longing is to humiliate the man who has insulted you. But if you never hear of him again, having removed to some other place, your enemy will come to have no longer the slightest importance for you. If one has lost sight for a score of years of all the people on whose account one would have liked to be elected to the Jockey Club or the Institute, the prospect of becoming a member of one or other of those corporations will have ceased to tempt one. Now fully as much as retirement, ill-health or religious conversion, protracted relations with a woman will substitute fresh visions for the old. There was not on Swann’s part, when he married Odette, any renunciation of his social ambitions, for from these ambitions Odette had long ago, in the spiritual sense of the word, detached him. Besides, had he not been so detached, his marriage would have been all the more creditable. It is because they imply the sacrifice of a more or less advantageous position to a purely private happiness that, as a general rule, ‘impossible’ marriages are the happiest of all. (One cannot very well include among the ‘impossible’ marriages those that are made for money, there being no instance on record of a couple, of whom the wife or even the husband has thus sold himself, who have not sooner or later been admitted into society, if only by tradition, and on the strength of so many precedents, and so as not to have two conflicting standards.) Perhaps, on the other hand, the artistic, if not the perverse side of Swann’s nature would in any event have derived a certain amount of pleasure from coupling with himself, in one of those crossings of species such as Mendelians practise and mythology records, a creature of a different race, archduchess or prostitute, from contracting a royal alliance or from marrying beneath him. There had been but one person in all the world whose opinion he took into consideration whenever he thought of his possible marriage with Odette; that was, and from no snobbish motive, the Duchesse de Guermantes. With whom Odette, on the contrary, was but little concerned, thinking only of those people whose position was immediately above her own, rather than in so vague an empyrean. But when Swann in his daydreams saw Odette as already his wife he invariably formed a picture of the moment in which he would take her — her, and above all her daughter — to call upon the Princesse des Laumes (who was shortly, on the death of her father-in-law, to become Duchesse de Guermantes). He had no desire to introduce them anywhere else, but his heart would soften as he invented — uttering their actual words to himself — all the things that the Duchess would say of him to Odette, and Odette to the Duchess, the affection that she would shew for Gilberte, spoiling her, making him proud of his child. He enacted to himself the scene of this introduction with the same precision in each of its imaginary details that people shew when they consider how they would spend, supposing they were to win it, a lottery prize the amount of which they have arbitrarily determined. In so far as a mental picture which accompanies one of our resolutions may be said to be its motive, so it might be said that if Swann married Odette it was in order to present her and Gilberte, without anyone’s else being present, without, if need be, anyone’s else ever coming to know of it, to the Duchesse de Guermantes. We shall see how this sole social ambition that he had entertained for his wife and daughter was precisely that one the realisation of which proved to be forbidden him by a veto so absolute that Swann died in the belief that the Duchess would never possibly come to know them. We shall see also that, on the contrary, the Duchesse de Guermantes did associate with Odette and Gilberte after the death of Swann. And doubtless he would have been wiser — seeing that he could attach so much importance to so small a matter — not to have formed too dark a picture of tie future, in this connexion, but to have consoled himself with the hope that the meeting of the ladies might indeed take place when he was no longer there to enjoy it. The laborious process of causation which sooner or later will bring about every possible effect, including (consequently) those which one had believed to be most nearly impossible, naturally slow at times, is rendered slower still by our impatience (which in seeking to accelerate only obstructs it) and by our very existence, and comes to fruition only when we have ceased to desire it — have ceased, possibly, to live. Was not Swann conscious of this from his own experience, had there not been already, in his life, as it were a préfiguration of what was to happen after his death, a posthumous happiness in this marriage with this Odette whom he had passionately loved — even if she had not been pleasing to him at first sight — whom he had married when he no longer loved her, when the creature that, in Swann, had so longed to live, had so despaired of living all its life in company with Odette, when that creature was extinct?

    I began next to speak of the Comte de Paris, to ask whether he was not one of Swann’s friends, for I was afraid lest the conversation should drift away from him. “Why, yes!” replied M. de Norpois, turning towards me and fixing upon my modest person the azure gaze in which floated, as in their vital element, his immense capacity for work and his power of assimilation. And “Upon my word,” he added, once more addressing my father, “I do not think that I shall be overstepping the bounds of the respect which I have always professed for the Prince (although without, you understand, maintaining any personal relations with him, which would inevitably compromise my position, unofficial as that may be), if I tell you of a little episode which is not without point; no more than four years ago, at a small railway station in one of the countries of Central Europe, the Prince happened to set eyes on Mme. Swann. Naturally, none of his circle ventured to ask his Royal Highness what he thought of her. That would not have been seemly. But when her name came up by chance in conversation, by certain signs — imperceptible, if you like, but quite unmistakable — the Prince appeared willing enough to let it be understood that his impression of her had, in a word, been far from unfavourable.”

    “But there could have been no possibility, surely, of her being presented to the Comte de Paris?” inquired my father

    “Well, we don’t know; with Princes one never does know,” replied M. de Norpois. “The most exalted, those who know best how to secure what is due to them, are as often as not the last to let themselves be embarrassed by the decrees of popular opinion, even by those for which there is most justification, especially when it is a question of their rewarding a personal attachment to themselves. Now it is certain that the Comte de Paris has always most graciously recognised the devotion of Swann, who is, for that matter, a man of character, in spite of it all.”

    “And what was your own impression, your Excellency? Do tell us!” my mother asked, from politeness as well as from curiosity

    All the energy of the old connoisseur broke through the habitual moderation of his speech as he answered: “Quite excellent!”

    And knowing that the admission that a strong impression has been made on one by a woman takes its place, provided that one makes it in a playful tone, in a certain category of the art of conversation that is highly appreciated, he broke into a little laugh that lasted for several seconds, moistening the old diplomat’s blue eyes and making his nostrils, with their network of tiny scarlet veins, quiver. “She is altogether charming!”

    “Was there a writer of the name of Bergotte at this dinner, sir?” I asked timidly, still trying to keep the conversation to the subject of the Swanns

    “Yes, Bergotte was there,” replied M. de Norpois, inclining his head courteously towards me, as though in his desire to be pleasant to my father he attached to everything connected with him a real importance, even to the questions of a boy of my age who was not accustomed to see such politeness shewn to him by persons of his. “Do you know him?” he went on, fastening on me that clear gaze, the penetration of which had won the praise of Bismarck

    “My son does not know him, but he admires his work immensely,” my mother explained

    “Good heavens!” exclaimed M. de Norpois, inspiring me with doubts of my own intelligence far more serious than those that ordinarily distracted me, when I saw that what I valued a thousand thousand times more than myself, what I regarded as the most exalted thing in the world, was for him at the very foot of the scale of admiration. “I do not share your son’s point of view. Bergotte is what I call a flute-player: one must admit that he plays on it very agreeably, although with a great deal of mannerism, of affectation. But when all is said, it is no more than that, and that is nothing very great. Nowhere does one find in his enervated writings anything that could be called construction. No action — or very little — but above all no range. His books fail at the foundation, or rather they have no foundation at all. At a time like the present, when the ever-increasing complexity of life leaves one scarcely a moment for reading, when the map of Europe has undergone radical alterations, and is on the eve, very probably, of undergoing others more drastic still, when so many new and threatening problems are arising on every side, you will allow me to suggest that one is entitled to ask that a writer should be something else than a fine intellect which makes us forget, amid otiose and byzantine discussions of the merits of pure form, that we may be overwhelmed at any moment by a double tide of barbarians, those from without and those from within our borders. I am aware that this is a blasphemy against the sacrosanct school of what these gentlemen term ‘Art for Art’s sake,’ but at this period of history there are tasks more urgent than the manipulation of words in a harmonious manner. Not that Bergotte’s manner is not now and then quite attractive. I have no fault to find with that, but taken as a whole, it is all very precious, very thin, and has very little virility. I can now understand more easily, when I bear in mind your altogether excessive regard for Bergotte, the few lines that you shewed me just now, which it would have been unfair to you not to overlook, since you yourself told me, in all simplicity, that they were merely a childish scribbling.” (I had, indeed, said so, but I did not think anything of the sort.) “For every sin there is forgiveness, and especially for the sins of youth. After all, others as well as yourself have such sins upon their conscience, and you are not the only one who has believed himself to be a poet in his day. But one can see in what you have shewn me the evil influence of Bergotte. You will not, of course, be surprised when I say that there was in it none of his good qualities, since he is a past-master in the art — incidentally quite superficial — of handling a certain style of which, at your age, you cannot have acquired even the rudiments. But already there is the same fault, that paradox of stringing together fine-sounding words and only afterwards troubling about what they mean. That is putting the cart before the horse, even in Bergotte’s books. All those Chinese puzzles of form, all these deliquescent mandarin subtleties seem to me to be quite futile. Given a few fireworks, let off prettily enough by an author, and up goes the shout of genius. Works of genius are not so common as all that! Bergotte cannot place to his credit — does not carry in his baggage, if I may use the expression — a single novel that is at all lofty in its conception, any of those books which one keeps in a special corner of one’s library. I do not discover one such in the whole of his work. But that does not exclude the fact that, with him, the work is infinitely superior to the author. Ah! there is a man who justifies the wit who insisted that one ought never to know an author except through his books. It would be impossible to imagine an individual who corresponded less to his — more pretentious, more pompous, less fitted for human society. Vulgar at some moments, at others talking like a book, and not even like one of his own, but like a boring book, which his, to do them justice, are not — such is your Bergotte. He has the most confused mind, alembicated, what our ancestors called a diseur de phébus, and he makes the things that he says even more unpleasant by the manner in which he says them. I forget for the moment whether it is Loménie or Sainte-Beuve who tells us that Vigny repelled people by the same eccentricity. But Bergotte has never given us a Cinq-Mars, or a Cachet Rouge, certain pages of which are regular anthology pieces.”

    Paralysed by what M. de Norpois had just said to me with regard to the fragment which I had submitted to him, and remembering at the same time the difficulties that I experienced when I attempted to write an essay or merely to devote myself to serious thought, I felt conscious once again of my intellectual nullity and that I was not born for a literary life. Doubtless in the old days at Combray certain impressions of a very humble order, or a few pages of Bergotte used to plunge me into a state of musing which had appeared to me to be of great value. But this state was what my poem in prose reflected; there could be no doubt that M. de Norpois had at once grasped and had seen through the fallacy of what I had discovered to be beautiful simply by a mirage that must be entirely false since the Ambassador had not been taken in by it. He had shewn me, on the other hand, what an infinitely unimportant place was mine when I was judged from outside, objectively, by the best-disposed and most intelligent of experts. I felt myself to be struck speechless, overwhelmed; and my mind, like a fluid which is without dimensions save those of the vessel that is provided for it, just as it had been expanded a moment ago so as to fill all the vast capacity of genius, contracted now, was entirely contained in the straitened mediocrity in which M. de Norpois had of a sudden enclosed and sealed it

    “Our first introduction — I speak of Bergotte and myself ——” he resumed, turning to my father, “was somewhat beset with thorns (which is, after all, only another way of saying that it was not lacking in points). Bergotte — some years ago, now — paid a visit to Vienna while I was Ambassador there; he was presented to me by the Princess Metternich, came and wrote his name, and expected to be asked to the Embassy. Now, being in a foreign country as the Representative of France, to which he has after all done some honour by his writings, to a certain extent (let us say, to be quite accurate, to a very slight extent), I was prepared to set aside the unfavourable opinion that I hold of his private life. But he was not travelling alone, and he actually let it be understood that he was not to be invited without his companion. I trust that I am no more of a prude than most men, and, being a bachelor, I was perhaps in a position to throw open the doors of the Embassy a little wider than if I had been married and the father of a family. Nevertheless, I must admit that there are depths of degradation to which I should hesitate to descend, while these are rendered more repulsive still by the tone, not moral, merely — let us be quite frank and say moralising — that Bergotte takes up in his books, where one finds nothing but perpetual and, between ourselves, somewhat wearisome analyses, torturing scruples, morbid remorse, and all for the merest peccadilloes, the most trivial naughtinesses (as one knows from one’s own experience), while all the time he is shewing such an utter lack of conscience and so much cynicism in his private life. To cut a long story short, I evaded the responsibility, the Princess returned to the charge, but without success. So that I do not suppose that I appear exactly in the odour of sanctity to the gentleman, and I am not sure how far he appreciated Swann’s kindness in inviting him and myself on the same evening. Unless of course it was he who asked for the invitation. One can never tell, for really he is not normal. Indeed that is his sole excuse.”

    “And was Mme. Swann’s daughter at the dinner?” I asked M. de Norpois, taking advantage, to put this question, of a moment in which, as we all moved towards the drawing-room, I could more easily conceal my emotion than would have been possible at table, where I was held fast in the glare of the lamplight

    M. de Norpois appeared to be trying for a moment to remember; then: “Yes, you mean a young person of fourteen or fifteen? Yes, of course, I remember now that she was introduced to me before dinner as the daughter of our Amphitryon. I may tell you that I saw but little of her; she retired to bed early. Or else she went out to see a friend — I forget. But I can see that you are very intimate with the Swann household.”

    “I play with Mlle. Swann in the Champs-Elysées, and she is delightful.”

    “Oh! so that is it, is it? But I assure you, I thought her charming. I must confess to you, however, that I do not believe that she will ever be anything like her mother, if I may say as much without wounding you in a vital spot.”

    “I prefer Mlle. Swann’s face, but I admire her mother, too, enormously; I go for walks in the Bois simply in the hope of seeing her pass.”

    “Ah! But I must tell them that; they will be highly flattered.”

    While he was uttering these words, and for a few seconds after he had uttered them, M. de Norpois was still in the same position as anyone else who, hearing me speak of Swann as an intelligent man, of his family as respectable stockbrokers, of his house as a fine house, imagined that I would speak just as readily of another man equally intelligent, of other stockbrokers equally respectable, of another house equally fine; it was the moment in which a sane man who is talking to a lunatic has not yet perceived that his companion is mad. M. de Norpois knew that there was nothing unnatural in the pleasure which one derived from looking at pretty women, that it was a social convention, when anyone spoke to you of a pretty woman with any fervour, to pretend to think that he was in love with her, and to promise to further his designs. But in saying that he would speak of me to Gilberte and her mother (which would enable me, like an Olympian deity who has taken on the fluidity of a breath of wind, or rather the aspect of the old greybeard whose form Minerva borrows, to penetrate, myself, unseen, into Mme. Swann’s drawing-room, to attract her attention, to occupy her thoughts, to arouse her gratitude for my admiration, to appear before her as the friend of an important person, to seem to her worthy to be invited by her in the future and to enter into the intimate life of her family), this important person who was going to make use, in my interests, of the great influence which he must have with Mme. Swann inspired in me suddenly an affection so compelling that I had difficulty in restraining myself from kissing his gentle hands, white and crumpled, which looked as though they had been left lying too long in water. I even sketched in the air an outline of that impulsive movement, but this I supposed that I alone had observed. For it is difficult for any of us to calculate exactly on what scale his words or his gestures are apparent to others. Partly from the fear of exaggerating our own importance, and also because we enlarge to enormous proportions the field over which the impressions formed by other people in the course of their lives are obliged to extend, we imagine that the accessories of our speech and attitudes scarcely penetrate the consciousness, still less remain in the memory of those with whom we converse, It is, we may suppose, to a prompting of this sort that criminals yield when they ‘touch up’ the wording of a statement already made, thinking that the new variant cannot be confronted with any existing version. But it is quite possible that, even in what concerns the millennial existence of the human race, the philosophy of the journalist, according to which everything is destined to oblivion, is less true than a contrary philosophy which would predict the conservation of everything. In the same newspaper in which the moralist of the ‘Paris column’ says to us of an event, of a work of art, all the more forcibly of a singer who has enjoyed her ‘crowded hour’: “Who will remember this in ten years’ time?” overleaf does not the report of the Académie des Inscriptions speak often of a fact, in itself of smaller importance, of a poem of little merit, which dates from the epoch of the Pharaohs and is now known again in its entirety? Is it not, perhaps, just the same in our brief life on earth? And yet, some years later, in a house in which M. de Norpois, who was also calling there, had seemed to me the most solid support that I could hope to find, because he was the friend of my father, indulgent, inclined to wish us all well, and besides, by his profession and upbringing, trained to discretion, when, after the Ambassador had gone, I was told that he had alluded to an evening long ago when he had seen the moment in which I was just going to kiss his hands, not only did I colour up to the roots of my hair but I was stupefied to learn how different from all that I had believed were not only the manner in which M. de Norpois spoke of me but also the constituents of his memory: this tittle-tattle enlightened me as to the incalculable proportions of absence and presence of mind, of recollection and forgetfulness which go to form the human intelligence; and I was as marvellously surprised as on the day on which I read for the first time, in one of Maspero’s books, that we had an exact list of the sportsmen whom Assurbanipal used to invite to his hunts, a thousand years before the Birth of Christ

    “Oh, sir,” I assured M. de Norpois, when he told me that he would inform Gilberte and her mother how much I admired them, “if you would do that, if you would speak of me to Mme. Swann, my whole life would not be long enough for me to prove my gratitude, and that life would be all at your service. But I feel bound to point out to you that I do not know Mme. Swann, and that I have never been introduced to her.”

    I had added these last words from a scruple of conscience, and so as not to appear to be boasting of an acquaintance which I did not possess. But while I was uttering them I felt that they were already superfluous, for from the beginning of my speech of thanks, with its chilling ardour, I had seen flitting across the face of the Ambassador an expression of hesitation and dissatisfaction, and in his eyes that vertical, narrow, slanting look (like, in the drawing of a solid body in perspective, the receding line of one of its surfaces), that look which one addresses to the invisible audience whom one has within oneself at the moment when one is saying something that one’s other audience, the person whom one has been addressing — myself, in this instance — is not meant to hear. I realised in a flash that these phrases which I had pronounced, which, feeble as they were when measured against the flood of gratitude that was coursing through me, had seemed to me bound to touch M. de Norpois and to confirm his decision upon an intervention which would have given him so little trouble and me so much joy, were perhaps (out of all those that could have been chosen, with diabolical malice, by persons anxious to do me harm) the only ones that could result in making him abandon his intention. Indeed, when he heard me speak, just as at the moment when a stranger with whom we have been exchanging — quite pleasantly — our impressions, which we might suppose to be similar to his, of the passers-by, whom we have agreed in regarding as vulgar, reveals suddenly the pathological abyss that divides him from us by adding carelessly, as he runs his hand over his pocket: “What a pity, I haven’t got my revolver here; I could have picked off the lot!” M. de Norpois, who knew that nothing was less costly or more easy than to be commended to Mme. Swann and taken to her house, and saw that to me, on the contrary, such favours bore so high a price and were consequently, no doubt, of great difficulty, thought that the desire, apparently normal, which I had expressed must cloak some different thought, some suspect intention, some pre-existent fault, on account of which, in the certainty of displeasing Mme. Swann, no one hitherto had been willing to undertake the responsibility for conveying a message to her from me. And I understood that this office was one which he would never discharge, that he might see Mme. Swann daily, for years to come, without ever mentioning my name. He did indeed ask her, a few days later, for some information which I required, and charged my father to convey it to me. But he had not thought it his duty to tell her at whose instance he was inquiring. So she would never discover that I knew M. de Norpois and that I hoped so greatly to be asked to her house; and this was perhaps a less misfortune than I supposed. For the second of these discoveries would probably not have added much to the efficacy, in any event uncertain, of the first. In Odette the idea of her own life and of her home awakened no mysterious disturbance; a person who knew her, who came to see her, did not seem to her a fabulous creature such as he seemed to me who would have flung a stone through Swann’s windows if I could have written upon it that I knew M. de Norpois; I was convinced that such a message, even when transmitted in so brutal a fashion, would have done far more to exalt me in the eyes of the lady of the house than it would have prejudiced her against me. But even if I had been capable of understanding that the mission which M. de Norpois did not perform must have remained futile, nay, more than that, might even have damaged my credit with the Swanns, I should not have had the courage, had he shewn himself consenting, to release the Ambassador from it, and to renounce the pleasure — however fatal its consequences might prove — of feeling that my name and my person were thus brought for a moment into Gilberte’s presence, in her unknown life and home

    After M. de Norpois had gone my father cast an eye over the evening paper; I dreamed once more of Berma. The pleasure which I had found in listening to her required to be made complete, all the more because it had fallen far short of what I had promised myself; and so it at once assimilated everything that was capable of giving it nourishment, those merits, for uir stance, which M. de Norpois had admitted that Berma possessed, and which my mind had absorbed at one draught, like a dry lawn when water is poured on it. Then my father handed me the newspaper, pointing me out a paragraph which ran more or less as follows:—-

    The performance of Phèdre, given this afternoon before an enthusiastic audience, which included the foremost representatives of society and the arts, as well as the principal critics, was for Mme. Berma, who played the heroine, the occasion of a triumph as brilliant as any that she has known in the course of her phenomenal career. We shall discuss more fully in a later issue this performance, which is indeed an event in the history of the stage; for the present we need only add that the best qualified judges are unanimous in the pronouncement that such an interpretation sheds an entirely new light on the part of Phèdre, which is one of the finest and most studied of Racine’s creations, and that it constitutes the purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art which it has been the privilege of our generation to witness

    Immediately my mind had conceived this new idea of “the purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art,” it, the idea, sped to join the imperfect pleasure which I had felt in the theatre, added to it a little of what was lacking, and their combination formed something so exalting that I cried out within myself: “What a great artist!” It may doubtless be argued that I was not absolutely sincere. But let us bear in mind, rather, the numberless writers who, dissatisfied with the page which they have just written, if they read some eulogy of the genius of Chateaubriand, or evoke the spirit of some great artist whose equal they aspire to be, by humming to themselves, for instance, a phrase of Beethoven, the melancholy of which they compare with what they have been trying to express in prose, are so filled with that idea of genius that they add it to their own productions, when they think of them once again, see them no longer in the light in which at first they appeared, and, hazarding an act of faith in the value of their work, say to themselves: “After all!” without taking into account that, into the total which determines their ultimate satisfaction, they have introduced the memory of marvellous pages of Chateaubriand which they assimilate to their own, but of which, in cold fact, they are not the authors; let us bear in mind the numberless men who believe in the love of a mistress on the evidence only of her betrayals; all those, too, who are sustained by the alternative hopes, either of an incomprehensible survival of death, when they think, inconsolable husbands, of the wives whom they have lost but have not ceased to love, or, artists, of the posthumous glory which they may thus enjoy; or else the hope of complete extinction which comforts them when their thoughts turn to the misdeeds that otherwise they must expiate after death; let us bear in mind also the travellers who come home enraptured by the general beauty of a tour of which, from day to day, they have felt nothing but the tedious incidents; and let us then declare whether, in the communal life that is led by our ideas in the enclosure of our minds, there is a single one of those that make us most happy which has not first sought, a very parasite, and won from an alien but neighbouring idea the greater part of the strength that it originally lacked

    My mother appeared none too well pleased that my father no longer thought of ‘the career’ for myself. I fancy that, anxious before all things that a definite rule of life should discipline the eccentricity of my nervous system, what she regretted was not so much seeing me abandon diplomacy as the prospect of my devoting myself to literature. But “Let him alone!” my father protested; “the main thing is that a man should find pleasure in his work. He is no longer a child. He knows pretty well now what he likes, it is not at all probable that he will change, and he is quite capable of deciding for himself what will make him happy in life.” That evening, as I waited for the time to arrive when, thanks to the freedom of choice which they allowed me, I should or should not begin to be happy in life, my father’s words caused me great uneasiness. At all times his unexpected kindnesses had, when they were manifested, prompted in me so keen a desire to kiss, above where his beard began, his glowing cheeks, that if I did not yield to that desire, it was simply because I was afraid of annoying him. And on that day, as an author becomes alarmed when he sees the fruits of his own meditation, which do not appear to him to be of great value since he does not separate them from himself, oblige a publisher to choose a kind of paper, to employ a fount of type finer, perhaps, than they deserve, I asked myself whether my desire to write was of sufficient importance to justify my father in dispensing so much generosity. But apart from that, when he spoke of my inclinations as no longer liable to change, he awakened in me two terrible suspicions. The first was that (at a time when, every day, I regarded myself as standing upon the threshold of a life which was still intact and would not enter upon its course until the following morning) my existence was already begun, and that, furthermore, what was yet to follow would not differ to any extent from what had already elapsed. The second suspicion, which was nothing more, really, than a variant of the first, was that I was not situated somewhere outside the realm of Time, but was subject to its laws, just like the people in novels who, for that reason, used to plunge me in such depression when I read of their lives, down at Combray, in the fastness of my wicker sentry-box. In theory one is aware that the earth revolves, but in practice one does not perceive it, the ground upon which one treads seems not to move, and one can live undisturbed. So it is with Time in one’s life. And to make its flight perceptible novelists are obliged, by wildly accelerating the beat of the pendulum, to transport the reader in a couple of minutes over ten, or twenty, or even thirty years. At the top of one page we have left a lover full of hope; at the foot of the next we meet him again, a bowed old man of eighty, painfully dragging himself on his daily walk about the courtyard of an almshouse, scarcely replying to what is said to him, oblivious of the past. In saying of me, “He is no longer a child,” “His tastes will not change now,” and so forth, my father had suddenly made me apparent to myself in my position in Time, and caused me the same kind of depression as if I had baen, not yet the enfeebled old pensioner, but one of those heroes of whom the author, in a tone of indifference which is particularly galling, says to us at the end of a book: “He very seldom comes up now from the country. He has finally decided to end his days there.”

    Meanwhile my father, so as to forestall any criticism that we might feel tempted to make of our guest, said to my mother: “Upon my word, old Norpois was rather ‘typical,’ as you call it, this evening, wasn’t he? When he said that it would not have been ‘seemly’ to ask the Comte de Paris a question, I was quite afraid you would burst out laughing.”

    “Not at all!” answered my mother. “I was delighted to see a man of his standing, and age too, keep that sort of simplicity, which is really a sign of straightforwardness and good-breeding.”

    “I should think so, indeed! That does not prevent his having a shrewd and discerning mind; I know him well, I see him at the Commission, remember, where he is very different from what he was here,” exclaimed my father, who was glad to see that Mamma appreciated M. de Norpois, and anxious to persucde her that he was even superior to what she supposed, because a cordial nature exaggerates a friend’s qualities with as much pleasure as a mischievous one finds in depreciating them. “What was it that he said, again —‘With Princes one never does know.’ . . .?”

    “Yes, that was it. I noticed it at the time; it was very neat. You can see that he has a vast experience of life.”

    “The astonishing thing is that he should have been dining with the Swanns, and that he seems to have found quite respectable people there, officials even. How on earth can Mme. Swann have managed to catch them?”

    “Did you notice the malicious way he said: ‘It is a house which is especially attractive to gentlemen!’?”

    And each of them attempted to reproduce the manner in which M. de Norpois had uttered these words, as they might have attempted to capture some intonation of Bressant’s voice or of Thiron’s in L’Aventurière or in theGendre de M. Poirier. But of all his sayings there was none so keenly relished as one was by Françoise, who, years afterwards, even, could not ‘keep a straight face’ if we reminded her that she had been qualified by the Ambassador as ‘a chef of the first order,’ a compliment which my mother had gone in person to transmit to her, as a War Minister publishes the congratulations addressed to him by a visiting Sovereign after the grand review. I, as it happened, had preceded my mother to the kitchen. For I had extorted from Françoise, who though opposed to war was cruel, that she would cause no undue suffering to the rabbit which she had to kill, and I had had no report yet of its death. Françoise assured me that it had passed away as peacefully as could be desired, and very swiftly. “I have never seen a beast like it; it died without uttering a word; you would have thought it was dumb.” Being but little versed in the language of beasts I suggested that the rabbit had not, perhaps, a cry like the chicken’s. “Just wait till you see,” said Françoise, filled with contempt for my ignorance, “if rabbits don’t cry every bit as much as chickens. Why, they are far noisier.” She received the compliments of M. de Norpois with the proud simplicity, the joyful and (if but for the moment) intelligent expression of an artist when someone speaks to him of his art. My mother had sent her when she first came to us to several of the big restaurants to see how the cooking there was done. I had the same pleasure, that evening, in hearing her dismiss the most famous of them as mere cookshops that I had had long ago, when I learned with regard to theatrical artists that the hierarchy of their merits did not at all correspond to that of their reputations. “The Ambassador,” my mother told her, “assured me that he knows no place where he can get cold beef and soufflés as good as yours.” Françoise, with an air of modesty and of paying just homage to the truth, agreed, but seemed not at all impressed by the title ‘Ambassador’; she said of M. de Norpois, with the friendliness due to a man who had taken her for a chef: “He’s a good old soul, like me.” She had indeed hoped to catch sight of him as he arrived, but knowing that Mamma hated their standing about behind doors and in windows, and thinking that Mamma would get to know from the other servants or from the porter that she had been keeping watch (for Françoise saw everywhere nothing but ‘jealousies’ and ‘tale-bearings,’ which played the same grim and unending part in her imagination as do for others of us the intrigues of the Jesuits or the Jews), she had contented herself with a peep from the kitchen window, ‘so as not to have words with Madame,’ and beneath the momentary aspect of M. de Norpois had ‘thought it was Monsieur Legrand,’ because of what she called his ‘agelity’ and in spite of their having not a single point in common. “Well,” inquired my mother, “and how do you explain that nobody else can make a jelly as well as you — when you choose?” “I really couldn’t say how that becomes about,” replied Françoise, who had established no very clear line of demarcation between the verb ‘to come,’ in certain of its meanings at least, and the verb ‘to become.’ She was speaking the truth, if not the whole truth, being scarcely more capable — or desirous — of revealing the mystery which ensured the superiority of her jellies or her creams than a leader of fashion the secrets of her toilet or a great singer those of her song. Their explanations tell us little; it was the same with the recipes furnished by our cook. “They do it in too much of a hurry,” she went on, alluding to the great restaurants, “and then it’s not all done together. You want the beef to become like a sponge, then it will drink up all the juice to the last drop. Still, there was one of those Cafés where I thought they did know a little bit about cooking. I don’t say it was altogether my jelly, but it was very nicely done, and the soufflés had plenty of cream.” “Do you mean Henry’s?” asked my father (who had now joined us), for he greatly enjoyed that restaurant in the Place Gaillon where he went regularly to club dinners. “Oh, dear no!” said Françoise, with a mildness which cloaked her profound contempt. “I meant a little restaurant. At that Henry’s it’s all very good, sure enough, but it’s not a restaurant, it’s more like a — soup-kitchen.” “Weber’s, then?” “Oh, no, sir, I meant a good restaurant. Weber’s, that’s in the Rue Royale; that’s not a restaurant, it’s a drinking-shop. I don’t know that the food they give you there is even served. I think they don’t have any tablecloths; they just shove it down in front of you like that, with a take it or leave it.” “Giro’s?” “Oh! there I should say they have the cooking done by ladies of the world.” (‘World’ meant for Françoise the under-world.) “Lord! They need that to fetch the boys in.” We could see that, with all her air of simplicity, Françoise was for the celebrities of her profession a more disastrous ‘comrade’ than the most jealous, the most infatuated of actresses. We felt, all the same, that she had a proper feeling for her art and a respect for tradition; for she went on: “No, I mean a restaurant where they looked as if they kept a very good little family table. It’s a place of some consequence, too. Plenty of custom there. Oh, they raked in the coppers there, all right.” Françoise, being an economist, reckoned in coppers, where your plunger would reckon in gold. “Madame knows the place well enough, down there to the right along the main boulevards, a little way back.” The restaurant of which she spoke with this blend of pride and good-humoured tolerance was, it turned out, the Café Anglais

    When New Year’s Day came, I first of all paid a round of family visits with Mamma who, so as not to tire me, had planned them beforehand (with the aid of an itinerary drawn up by my father) according to districts rather than to degrees of kinship. But no sooner had we entered the drawing-room of the distant cousin whose claim to being visited first was that her house was at no distance from ours, than my mother was horrified to see standing there, his present of marrons glacés or déguisés in his hand, the bosom friend of the most sensitive of all my uncles, to whom he would at once go and report that we had not begun our round with him. And this uncle would certainly be hurt; he would have thought it quite natural that we should go from the Madeleine to the Jardin des Plantes, where he lived, before stopping at Saint-Augustin, on our way to the Rue de l’Ecole de Médecine

    Our visits ended (my grandmother had dispensed us from the duty of calling on her, since we were to dine there that evening), I ran all the way to the Champs-Elysées to give to our own special stall-keeper, with instructions to hand it over to the person who came to her several times a week from the Swanns to buy gingerbread, the letter which, on the day when my friend had caused me so much anxiety, I had decided to send her at the New Year, and in which I told her that our old friendship was vanishing with the old year, that I would forget, now, my old sorrows and disappointments, and that, from this first day of January, it was a new friendship that we were going to cement, one so solid that nothing could destroy it, so wonderful that I hoped that Gilberte would go out of her way to preserve it in all its beauty, and to warn me in time, as I promised to warn her, should either of us detect the least sign of a peril that might endanger it. On our way home Françoise made me stop at the corner of the Rue Royale, before an open-air stall from which she selected for her own stock of presents photographs of Pius IX and Raspail, while for myself I purchased one of Berma. The innumerable admiration which that artist excited gave an air almost of poverty to this one face that she had to respond with, unalterable and precarious as are the garments of people who have not a ‘change,’ this face on which she must continually expose to view only the tiny dimple upon her upper lip, the arch of her eyebrows, a few other physical peculiarities always the same, which, when it came to that, were at the mercy of a burn or a blow. This face, moreover, could not in itself have seemed to me beautiful, but it gave me the idea, and consequently the desire to kiss it by reason of all the kisses that it must have received, for which, from its page in the album, it seemed still to be appealing with that coquettishly tender gaze, that artificially ingenuous smile. For our Berma must indeed have felt for many young men those longings which she confessed under cover of the personality of Phaedra, longings of which everything, even the glamour of her name which enhanced her beauty and prolonged her youth, must render the gratification so easy to her. Night was falling; I stopped before a column of playbills, on which was posted that of the piece in which she was to appear on January 1. A moist and gentle breeze was blowing. It was a time of day and year that I knew; I suddenly felt a presentiment that New Year’s Day was not a day different from, the rest, that it was not the first day of a new world, in which, I might, by a chance that had never yet occurred, that was still intact, make Gilberte’s acquaintance afresh, as at the Creation of the World, as though the past had no longer any existence, as though there had been obliterated, with the indications which I might have preserved for my future guidance, the disappointments which she had sometimes brought me; a new world in which nothing should subsist from the old — save one thing, my desire that Gilberte should love me. I realised that if my heart hoped for such a reconstruction, round about it, of a universe that had not satisfied it before, it was because my heart had not altered, and I told myself that there was no reason why Gilberte’s should have altered either; I felt that this new friendship was the same, just as there is no boundary ditch between their forerunners and those new years which our desire for them, without being able to reach and so to modify them, invests, unknown to themselves, with distinctive names. I might dedicate this new year, if I chose, to Gilberte, and as one bases a religious system upon the blind laws of nature, endeavour to stamp New Year’s Day with the particular image that I had formed of it; but in vain, I felt that it was not aware that people called it New Year’s Day, that it was passing in a wintry dusk in a manner that was not novel to me; in the gentle breeze that floated about the column of playbills I had recognised, I had felt reappear the eternal, the universal substance, the familiar moisture, the unheeding fluidity of the old days and years

    I returned to the house. I had spent the New Year’s Day of old men, who differ on that day from their juniors, not because people have ceased to give them presents but because they themselves have ceased to believe in the New Year. Presents I had indeed received, but not that present which alone could bring me pleasure, namely a line from Gilberte. I was young still, none the less, since I had been able to write her one, by means of which I hoped, in telling her of my solitary dreams of love and longing, to arouse similar dreams in her. The sadness of men who have grown old lies in their no longer even thinking of writing such letters, the futility of which their experience has shewn

    After I was in bed, the noises of the street, unduly prolonged upon this festive evening, kept me awake. I thought of all the people who were ending the night in pleasure, of the lover, the troop, it might be, of debauchees who would be going to meet Berma at the stage-door after the play that I had seen announced for this evening. I was not even able, so as to calm the agitation which that idea engendered in me during my sleepless night, to assure myself that Berma was not, perhaps, thinking about love, since the lines that she was reciting, which she had long and carefully rehearsed, reminded her at every moment that love is an exquisite thing, as of course she already knew, and knew so well that she displayed its familiar pangs — only enriched with a new violence and an unsuspected sweetness — to her astonished audience; and yet each of them had felt those pangs himself. I lighted my candle again, to look once more upon her face. At the thought that it was, no doubt, at that very moment being caressed by those men whom I could not prevent from giving to Berma and receiving from her joys superhuman but vague, I felt an emotion more cruel than voluptuous, a longing that was aggravated presently by the sound of a horn, as one hears it on the nights of the Lenten carnival and often of other public holidays, which, because it then lacks all poetry, is more saddening, coming from a toy squeaker, than “at evening, in the depth of the woods.” At that moment, a message from Gilberte would perhaps not have been what I wanted. Our desires cut across one another’s paths, and in this confused existence it is but rarely that a piece of good fortune coincides with the desire that clamoured for it

    I continued to go to the Champs-Elysées on fine days, along streets whose stylish pink houses seemed to be washed (because exhibitions of water-colours were then at the height of fashion) in a lightly floating atmosphere. It would be untrue to say that in those days the palaces of Gabriel struck me as being of greater beauty, or even of another epoch than the adjoining houses. I found more style, and should have supposed more antiquity if not in the Palais de l’Industrie at any rate in the Troca-déro. Plunged in a restless sleep, my adolescence embodied in one uniform vision the whole of the quarter through which it might be strolling, and I had never dreamed that there could be an eighteenth century building in the Rue Royale, just as I should have been astonished to learn that the Porte-Saint-Martin and the Porte-Saint-Denis, those glories of the age of Louis XIV, were not contemporary with the most recently built tenements in the sordid regions that bore their names. Once only one of Gabriel’s palaces made me stop for more than a moment; that was because, night having fallen, its columns, dematerialised by the moonlight, had the appearance of having been cut out in pasteboard, and by recalling to me a scene in the operetta Orphée aux Enfers gave me for the first time an impression of beauty

    Meanwhile Gilberte never came to the Champs-Elysées. And yet it was imperative that I should see her, for I could not so much as remember what she was like. The questing, anxious, exacting way that we have of looking at the person we love, our eagerness for the word which shall give us or take from us the hope of an appointment for the morrow, and, until that word is uttered, our alternative if not simultaneous imaginings of joy and of despair, all these make our observation, in the beloved object’s presence, too tremulous to be able to carry away a clear impression of her. Perhaps, also, that activity of all the senses at once which endeavours to learn from the visible aspect alone what lies behind it is over-indulgent to the thousand forms, to the changing fragrance, to the movements of the living person whom as a rule, when we are not in love, we regard as fixed in one permanent position. Whereas the beloved model does not stay still; and our mental photographs of her are always blurred. I did not rightly know how Gilberte’s features were composed, save in the heavenly moments when she disclosed them to me; I could remember nothing but her smile. And not being able to see again that beloved face, despite every effort that I might make to recapture it, I would be disgusted to find, outlined in my memory with a maddening precision of detail, the meaningless, emphatic faces of the man with the wooden horses and of the barley-sugar woman; just as those who have lost a dear friend whom they never see even while they are asleep, are exasperated at meeting incessantly in their dreams any number of insupportable creatures whom it is quite enough to have known in the waking world. In their inability to form any image of the object of their grief they are almost led to assert that they feel no grief. And I was not far from believing that, since I could not recall the features of Gilberte, I had forgotten Gilberte herself, and no longer loved her. At length she returned to play there almost every day, setting before me fresh pleasures to desire, to demand of her for the morrow, indeed making my love for her every day, in this sense, a new love. But an incident was to change once again, and abruptly, the manner in which, at about two o’clock every afternoon, the problem of my love confronted me. Had M. Swann intercepted the letter that I had written to his daughter, or was Gilberte merely confessing to me long after the event, and so that I should be more prudent in future, a state of things already long established? As I was telling her how greatly I admired her father and mother, she assumed that vague air, full of reticence and kept secrets, which she invariably wore when anyone spoke to her of what she was going to do, her walks, drives, visits — then suddenly expressed it with: “You know, they can’t abide you!” and, slipping from me like the Undine that she was, burst out laughing. Often her laughter, out of harmony with her words, seemed, as music seems, to be tracing an invisible surface on another plane. M. and Mme. Swann did not require Gilberte to give up playing with me, but they would have been just as well pleased, she thought, if we had never begun. They did not look upon our relations with a kindly eye; they believed me to be a young person of low moral standard and imagined that my influence over their daughter must be evil. This type of unscrupulous young man whom the Swanns thought that I resembled, I pictured him to myself as detesting the parents of the girl he loved, flattering them to their faces but, when he was alone with her, making fun of them, urging her on to disobey them and, when once he had completed his conquest, not allowing them even to set eyes on her again. With these characteristics (though they are never those under which the basest of scoundrels recognises himself) how vehemently did my heart contrast the sentiments that did indeed animate it with regard to Swann, so passionate, on the contrary, that I never doubted that, were he to have the least suspicion of them, he must repent of his condemnation of me as of a judicial error. All that I felt about him I made bold to express to him in a long letter which I entrusted to Gilberte, with the request that she would deliver it. She consented. Alas! so he saw in me an even greater impostor than I had feared; those sentiments which I had supposed myself to be portraying, in sixteen pages, with such amplitude of truth, so he had suspected them; in short, the letter that I had written him, as ardent and as sincere as the words that I had uttered to M. de Norpois, met with no more success. Gilberte told me next day, after taking me aside behind a clump of laurels, along a little path by which we sat down on a couple of chairs, that as he read my letter, which she had now brought back to me, her father had shrugged his shoulders, with: “All this means nothing; it only goes to prove how right I was.” I, who knew the purity of my intentions, the goodness of my soul, was furious that my words should not even have impinged upon the surface of Swann’s ridiculous error. For it was an error; of that I had then no doubt. I felt that I had described with such accuracy certain irrefutable characteristics of my generous sentiments that, if Swann had not at once reconstructed these from my indications, had not come to ask my forgiveness and to admit that he had been mistaken, it must be because these noble sentiments he had never himself experienced, which would make him incapable of understanding the existence of them in other people

    Well, perhaps it was simply that Swann knew that generosity is often no more than the inner aspect which our egotistical feelings assume when we have not yet named and classified them. Perhaps he had recognised in the sympathy that I expressed for him simply an effect — and the strongest possible proof — of my love for Gilberte, by which, and not by any subordinate veneration of himself, my subsequent actions would be irresistibly controlled. I was unable to share his point of view, since I had not succeeded in abstracting my love from myself, in forcing it back into the common experience of humanity, and thus suffering, experimentally, its consequences; I was in despair. I was obliged to leave Gilberte for a moment; Françoise had called me. I must accompany her into a little pavilion covered in a green trellis, not unlike one of the disused toll-houses of old Paris, in which had recently been installed what in England they call a lavatory but in France, by an ill-informed piece of anglomania, ‘water-closets.’ The old, damp walls at the entrance, where I stood waiting for Françoise, emitted a chill and fusty smell which, relieving me at once of the anxieties that Swann’s words, as reported by Gilberte, had just awakened in me, pervaded me with a pleasure not at all of the same character as other pleasures, which leave one more unstable than before, incapable of retaining them, of possessing them, but, on the contrary, with a consistent pleasure on which I could lean for support, delicious, soothing, rich with a truth that was lasting, unexplained and certain. I should have liked, as long ago in my walks along the Guermantes way, to endeavour to penetrate the charm of this impression which had seized hold of me, and, remaining there motionless, to interrogate this antiquated emanation which invited me not to enjoy the pleasure which it was offering me only as an ‘extra,’ but to descend into the underlying reality which it had not yet disclosed to me. But the tenant of the establishment, an elderly dame with painted cheeks and an auburn wig, was speaking to me. Françoise thought her ‘very well-to-do indeed.’ Her ‘missy’ had married what Françoise called ‘a young man of family,’ which meant that he differed more, in her eyes, from a workman than, in Saint-Simon’s, a duke did from a man ‘risen from the dregs of the people.’ No doubt the tenant, before entering upon her tenancy, had met with reverses. But Françoise was positive that she was a ‘marquise,’ and belonged to the Saint-Ferréol family. This ‘marquise’ warned me not to stand outside in the cold, and even opened one of her doors for me, saying: “Won’t you go inside for a minute? Look, here’s a nice, clean one, and I shan’t charge you anything.” Perhaps she just made this offer in the spirit in which the young ladies at Gouache’s, when we went in there to order something, used to offer me one of the sweets which they kept on the counter under glass bells, and which, alas, Mamma would never allow me to take; perhaps with less innocence, like an old florist whom Mamma used to have in to replenish her flower-stands, who rolled languishing eyes at me as she handed me a rose. In any event, if the ‘marquise’ had a weakness for little boys, when she threw open to them the hypogean doors of those cubicles of stone in which men crouch like sphinxes, she must have been moved to that generosity less by the hope of corrupting them than by the pleasure which all of us feel in displaying a needless prodigality to those whom we love, for I have never seen her with any other visitor except an old park-keeper

    A moment later I said good-bye to the ‘marquise,’ and went out accompanied by Françoise, whom I left to return to Gilberte. I caught sight of her at once, on a chair, behind the clump of laurels. She was there so as not to be seen by her friends: they were playing at hide-and-seek. I went and sat down by her side. She had on a flat cap which drooped forwards over her eyes, giving her the same ‘underhand,’ brooding, crafty look which I had remarked in her that first time at Comb ray. I asked her if there was not some way for me to have it out with her father, face to face. Gilberte said that she had suggested that to him, but that he had not thought it of any use. “Look,” she went on, “don’t go away without your letter; I must run along to the others, as they haven’t caught me.”

    Had Swann appeared on the scene then before I had recovered it, this letter, by the sincerity of which I felt that he had been so unreasonable in not letting himself be convinced, perhaps he would have seen that it was he who had been in the right. For as I approached Gilberte, who, leaning back in her chair, told me to take the letter but did not hold it out to me, I felt myself so irresistibly attracted by her body that I said to her: “Look! You try to stop me from getting it; we’ll see which is the stronger.”

    She thrust it behind her back; I put my arms round her neck, raising the plaits of hair which she wore over her shoulders, either because she was still of an age for that or because her mother chose to make her look a child for a little longer so that she herself might still seem young; and we wrestled, locked together. I tried to pull her towards me, she resisted; her cheeks, inflamed by the effort, were as red and round as two cherries; she laughed as though I were tickling her; I held her gripped between my legs like a young tree which I was trying to climb; and, in the middle of my gymnastics, when I was already out of breath with the muscular exercise and the heat of the game, I felt, as it were a few drops of sweat wrung from me by the effort, my pleasure express itself in a form which I could not even pause for a moment to analyse; immediately I snatched the letter from her. Whereupon Gilberte said, good-naturedly:

    “You know, if you like, we might go on wrestling for a little.”

    Perhaps she was dimly conscious that my game had had another object than that which I had avowed, but too dimly to have been able to see that I had attained it. And I, who was afraid that she had seen (and a slight recoil, as though of offended modesty which she made and checked a moment later made me think that my fear had not been unfounded), agreed to go on wrestling, lest she should suppose that I had indeed no other object than that, after which I wished only to sit quietly by her side

    On my way home I perceived, I suddenly recollected the impression, concealed from me until then, towards which, without letting me distinguish or recognise it, the cold, almost sooty smell of the trellised pavilion had borne me. It was that of my uncle Adolphe’s little sitting-room at Combray, which had indeed exhaled the same odour of humidity. But I could not understand, and I postponed the attempt to discover why the recollection of so trivial an impression had given me so keen a happiness. It struck me, however, that I did indeed deserve the contempt of M. de Norpois; I had preferred, hitherto, to all other writers, one whom he styled a mere ‘flute-player’ and a positive rapture had been conveyed to me, not by any important idea, but by a mouldy smell

    For some time past, in certain households, the name of the Champs-Elysées, if a visitor mentioned it, would be greeted by the mother of the family with that air of contempt which mothers keep for a physician of established reputation whom they have (or so they make out) seen make too many false diagnoses to have any faith left in him; people insisted that these gardens were not good for children, that they knew of more than one sore throat, more than one case of measles and any number of feverish chills for which the Champs must be held responsible. Without venturing openly to doubt the maternal affection of Mamma, who continued to let me play there, several of her friends deplored her inability to see what was as plain as daylight

    Neurotic subjects are perhaps less addicted than any, despite the time-honoured phrase, to ‘listening to their insides’: they can hear so many things going on inside themselves, by which they realise later that they did wrong to let themselves be alarmed, that they end by paying no attention to any of them. Their nervous systems have so often cried out to them for help, as though from some serious malady, when it was merely because snow was coming, or because they had to change their rooms, that they have acquired the habit of paying no more heed to these warnings than a soldier who in the heat of battle perceives them so little that he is capable, although dying, of carrying on for some days still the life of a man in perfect health. One morning, bearing arranged within me all my regular disabilities, from whose constant, internal circulation I kept my mind turned as resolutely away as from the circulation of my blood, I had come running into the dining-room where my parents were already at table, and — having assured myself, as usual, that to feel cold may mean not that one ought to warm oneself but that, for instance, one has received a scolding, and not to feel hungry that it is going to rain, and not that one ought not to eat anything — had taken my place between them when, in the act of swallowing the first mouthful of a particularly tempting cutlet, a nausea, a giddiness stopped me, the feverish reaction of a malady that had already begun, the symptoms of which had been masked, retarded by the ice of my indifference, but which obstinately refused the nourishment that I was not in a fit state to absorb. Then, at the same moment, the thought that they would stop me from going out if they saw that I was unwell gave me, as the instinct of self-preservation gives a wounded man, the strength to crawl to my own room, where I found that I had a temperature of 104, and then to get ready to go to the Champs-Elysées. Through the languid and vulnerable shell which encased them, my eager thoughts were urging me towards, were clamouring for the soothing delight of a game of prisoner’s base with Gilberte, and an hour later, barely able to keep on my feet, but happy in being by her side, I had still the strength to enjoy it

    Françoise, on our return, declared that I had been ‘taken bad,’ that I must have caught a ‘hot and cold,’ while the doctor, who was called in at once, declared that he ‘preferred’ the ‘severity,’ the ‘virulence’ of the rush of fever which accompanied my congestion of the lungs, and would be no more than ‘a fire of straw,’ to other forms, more ‘insidious’ and ‘septic.’ For some time now I had been liable to choking fits, and our doctor, braving the disapproval of my grandmother, who could see me already dying a drunkard’s death, had recommended me to take, as well as the caffeine which had been prescribed to help me to breathe, beer, champagne or brandy when I felt an attack coming. These attacks would subside, he told me, in the ‘euphoria’ brought about by the alcohol. I was often obliged, so that my grandmother should allow them to give it to me, instead of dissembling, almost to make a display of my state of suffocation. On the other hand, as soon as I felt an attack coming, never being quite certain what proportions it would assume, I would grow distressed at the thought of my grandmother’s anxiety, of which I was far more afraid than of my own sufferings. But at the same time my body, either because it was too weak to keep those sufferings secret, or because it feared lest, in their ignorance of the imminent disaster, people might demand of me some exertion which it would have found impossible or dangerous, gave me the need to warn my grandmother of my attacks with a punctiliousness into which I finally put a sort of physiological scruple. Did I perceive in myself a disturbing symptom which I had not previously observed, my body was in distress so long as I had not communicated it to my grandmother. Did she pretend to pay no attention, it made me insist. Sometimes I went too far; and that dear face, which was no longer able always to control its emotion as in the past, would allow an expression of pity to appear, a painful contraction. Then my heart was wrung by the sight of her grief; as if my kisses had had power to expel that grief, as if my affection could give my grandmother as much joy as my recovery, I flung myself into her arms. And its scruples being at the same time calmed by the certainty that she now knew the discomfort that I felt, my body offered no opposition to my reassuring her. I protested that this discomfort had been nothing, that I was in no sense to be pitied, that she might be quite sure that I was now happy; my body had wished to secure exactly the amount of pity that it deserved, and, provided that someone knew that it ‘had a pain’ in its right side, it could see no harm in my declaring that this pain was of no consequence and was not an obstacle to my happiness; for my body did not pride itself on its philosophy; that was outside its province. Almost every day during my convalescence I passed through these crises of suffocation. One evening, after my grandmother had left me comparatively well, she returned to my room very late and, seeing me struggling for breath, “Oh, my poor boy,” she exclaimed, her face quivering with sympathy, “you are in dreadful pain.” She left me at once; I heard the outer gate open, and in a little while she came back with some brandy which she had gone out to buy, since there was none in the house. Presently I began to feel better. My grandmother, who was rather flushed, seemed ‘put out’ about something, and her eyes had a look of weariness and dejection

    “I shall leave you alone now, and let you get the good of this improvement,” she said, rising suddenly to go. I detained her, however, for a kiss, and could feel on her cold cheek something moist, but did not know whether it was the dampness of the night air through which she had just passed. Next day, she did not come to my room until the evening, having had, she told me, to go out. I considered that this shewed a surprising indifference to my welfare, and I had to restrain myself so as not to reproach her with it

    As my chokings had persisted long after any congestion remained that could account for them, my parents asked for a consultation with Professor Cottard. It is not enough that a physician who is called in to treat cases of this sort should be learned. Brought face to face with symptoms which may or may not be those of three or four different complaints, it is in the long run his instinct, his eye that must decide with which, despite the more or less similar appearance of them all, he has to deal. This mysterious gift does not imply any superiority in the other departments of the intellect, and a creature of the utmost vulgarity, who admires the worst pictures, the worst music, in whose mind there is nothing out of the common, may perfectly well possess it. In my case, what was physically evident might equally well have been due to nervous spasms, to the first stages of tuberculosis, to asthma, to a toxi-alimentary dyspnoea with renal insufficiency, to chronic bronchitis, or to a complex state into which more than one of these factors entered. Now, nervous spasms required to be treated firmly, and discouraged, tuberculosis with infinite care and with a ‘feeding-up’ process which would have been bad for an arthritic condition such as asthma, and might indeed have been dangerous in a case of toxi-alimentary dyspnoea, this last calling for a strict diet which, in return, would be fatal to a tuberculous patient. But Cottard’s hesitations were brief and his prescriptions imperious. “Purges; violent and drastic purges; milk for some days, nothing but milk. No meat. No alcohol.” My mother murmured that I needed, all the same, to be ‘built up,’ that my nerves were already weak, that drenching me like a horse and restricting my diet would make me worse. I could see in Cottard’s eyes, as uneasy as though he were afraid of missing a train, that he was asking himself whether he had not allowed his natural good-humour to appear. He was trying to think whether he had remembered to put on his mask of coldness, as one looks for a mirror to see whether one has not forgotten to tie one’s tie. In his uncertainty, and, so as, whatever he had done, to put things right, he replied brutally: “I am not in the habit of repeating my instructions. Give me a pen. Now remember, milk! Later on, when we have got the crises and the agrypnia by the throat, I should like you to take a little clear soup, and then a little broth, but always with milk; au lait! You’ll enjoy that, since Spain is all the rage just now; ollé, ollé!” His pupils knew this joke well, for he made it at the hospital whenever he had to put a heart or liver case on a milk diet. “After that, you will gradually return to your normal life. But whenever there is any coughing or choking — purges, injections, bed, milk!” He listened with icy calm, and without uttering a word, to my mother’s final objections, and as he left us without having condescended to explain the reasons for this course of treatment, my parents concluded that it had no bearing on my case, and would weaken me to no purpose, and so they did not make me try it. Naturally they sought to conceal their disobedience from the Professor, and to succeed in this avoided all the houses in which he was likely to be found. Then, as my health became worse, they decided to make me follow out Cottard’s prescriptions to the letter; in three days my ‘rattle’ and cough had ceased, I could breathe freely. Whereupon we realised that Cottard, while finding, as he told us later on, that I was distinctly asthmatic, and still more inclined to ‘imagine things,’ had seen that what was really the matter with me at the moment was intoxication, and that by loosening my liver and washing out my kidneys he would get rid of the congestion of my bronchial tubes and thus give me back my breath, my sleep and my strength. And we realised that this imbecile was a clinical genius. At last I was able to get up. But they spoke of not letting me go any more to the Champs-Elysées. They said that it was because the air there was bad; but I felt sure that this was only a pretext so that I should not see Mlle. Swann, and I forced myself to repeat the name of Gilberte all the time, like the native tongue which peoples in captivity endeavour to preserve among themselves so as not to forget the land that they will never see again. Sometimes my mother would stroke my forehead with her hand, saying: “So little boys don’t tell Mamma their troubles any more?” And Françoise used to come up to me every day with: “What a face, to be sure! If you could just see yourself I Anyone would think there was a corpse in the house.” It is true that, if I had simply had a cold in the head, Françoise would have assumed the same funereal air. These lamentations pertained rather to her ‘class’ than to the state of my health. I could not at the time discover whether this pessimism was due to sorrow or to satisfaction. I decided provisionally that it was social and professional

    One day, after the postman had called, my mother laid a letter upon my bed. I opened it carelessly, since it could not bear the one signature that would have made me happy, the name of Gilberte, with whom I had no relations outside the Champs-Elysées. And lo, at the foot of the page, embossed with a silver seal representing a man’s head in a helmet, and under him a scroll with the device Per viam rectam, beneath a letter written in a large and flowing hand, in which almost every word appeared to be underlined, simply because the crosses of the ‘t’s’ ran not across but over them, and so drew a line beneath the corresponding letters of the word above, it was indeed Gilberte’s signature and nothing else that I saw. But because I knew that to be impossible upon a letter addressed to myself, the sight of it, unaccompanied by any belief in it, gave me no pleasure. For a moment it merely struck an impression of unreality on everything round about me. With lightning rapidity the impossible signature danced about my bed, the fireplace, the four walls. I saw everything sway, as one does when one falls from a horse, and I asked myself whether there was not an existence altogether different from the one I knew, in direct contradiction of it, but itself the true existence, which, being suddenly revealed to me, filled me with that hesitation which sculptors, in representing the Last Judgment, have given to the awakening dead who find themselves at the gates of the next world. “My dear Friend,” said the letter, “I hear that you have been very ill and have given up going to the Champs-Eîysées. I hardly ever go there either because there has been such an enormous lot of illness. But I’m having my friends to tea here every Monday and Friday. Mamma asks me to tell you that it will be a great pleasure to us all if you will come too, as soon as you are well again, and we can have some more nice talks here, just like the Champs-Elysées. Good-bye, dear friend; I hope that your parents will allow you to come to tea very often. With all my kindest regards. GILBERTE.”

    While I was reading these words, my nervous system was receiving, with admirable promptitude, the news that a piece of great good fortune had befallen me. But my mind, that is to say myself, and in fact the party principally concerned, was still in ignorance. Such good fortune, coming from Gilberte, was a thing of which I had never ceased to dream; a thing wholly in my mind, it was, as Leonardo says of painting, cosa mentale. Now, a sheet of paper covered with writing is not a thing that the mind assimilates at once. But as soon as I had finished reading the letter, I thought of it, it became an object of my dreams, became, it also, cosa mentale, and I loved it so much already that every few minutes I must read it, kiss it again. Then at last I was conscious of my happiness

    Life is strewn with these miracles, for which people who are in love can always hope. It is possible that this one had been artificially brought about by my mother who, seeing that for some time past I had lost all interest in life, may have suggested to Gilberte to write to me, just as, when I was little and went first to the sea-side, so as to give me some pleasure in bathing, which I detested because it took away my breath, she used secretly to hand to the man who was to ‘dip’ me marvellous boxes made of shells, and branches of coral, which I believed that I myself had discovered lying at the bottom of the sea. However, with every occurrence which, in our life and among its contrasted situations, bears any relation to love, it is best to make no attempt to understand it, since in so far as these are inexorable, as they are unlooked-for, they appear to be governed by magic rather than by rational laws. When a multi-millionaire — who for all his millions is quite a charming person — sent packing by a poor and unattractive woman with whom he has been living, calls to his aid, in his desperation, all the resources of wealth, and brings every worldly influence to bear without succeeding in making her take him back, it is wiser for him, in the face of the implacable obstinacy of his mistress, to suppose that Fate intends to crush him, and to make him die of an affection of the heart, than to seek any logical explanation. These obstacles, against which lovers have to contend, and which their imagination, over-excited by suffering, seeks in vain to analyse, are contained, as often as not, in some peculiar characteristic of the woman whom they cannot bring back to themselves, in her stupidity, in the influence acquired over her, the fears suggested to her by people whom the lover does not know, in the kind of pleasures which, at the moment, she is demanding of life, pleasures which neither her lover nor her lover’s wealth can procure for her. In any event, the lover is scarcely in a position to discover the nature of these obstacles, which her woman’y cunning hides from him and his own judgment, falsified by love, prevents him from estimating exactly. They may be compared with those tumours which the doctor succeeds in reducing, but without having traced them to their source. Like them these obstacles remain mysterious but are temporary. Only they last, as a rule, longer than love itself. And as that is not a disinterested passion, the lover who is no longer in love does not seek to know why the woman, neither rich nor virtuous, with whom he was in love refused obstinately for years to let him continue to keep her

    Now the same mystery which often veils from our eyes the reason for a catastrophe, when love is in question, envelops just as frequently the suddenness of certain happy solutions, such as had come to me with Gilberte’s letter. Happy, or at least seemingly happy, for there are few solutions that can really be happy when we are dealing with a sentiment of such a kind that every satisfaction which we can bring to it does no more, as a rule, than dislodge some pain. And yet sometimes a respite is granted us, and we have for a little while the illusion that we are healed

    So far as concerns this letter, at the foot of which Françoise declined to recognise Gilberte’s name, because the elaborate capital ‘G’ leaning against the undotted ‘i’ looked more like an ‘A,’ while the final syllable was indefinitely prolonged by a waving flourish, if we persist in looking for a rational explanation of the sudden reversal of her attitude towards me which it indicated, and which made me so radiantly happy, we may perhaps find that I was to some extent indebted for it to an incident which I should have supposed, on the contrary, to be calculated to ruin me for ever in the sight of the Swann family. A short while back, Bloch had come to see me at a time when Professor Cottard, whom, now that I was following his instructions, we were again calling in, happened to be in my room. As his examination of me was over, and he was sitting with me simply as a visitor because my parents had invited him to stay to dinner, Bloch was allowed to come in. While we were all talking, Bloch having mentioned that he had heard it said that Mme. Swann was very fond of me, by a lady with whom he had been dining the day before, who was herself very intimate with Mme. Swann, I should have liked to reply that he was most certainly mistaken, and to establish the fact (from the same scruple of conscience that had made me proclaim it to M. de Norpois, and for fear of Mme. Swann’s taking me for a liar) that I did not know her and had never spoken to her. But I had not the courage to correct Bloch’s mistake, because I could see quite well that it was deliberate, and that, if he invented something that Mme. Swann could not possibly have said, it was simply to let us know (what he considered flattering to himself, and was not true either) that he had been dining with one of that lady’s friends. And so it fell out that, whereas M. de Norpois, on learning that I did not know but would very much like to know Mme. Swann, had taken great care to avoid speaking to her about me, Cottard, who was her doctor also, having gathered from what he had heard Bloch say that she knew me quite well and thought highly of me, concluded that to remark, when next he saw her, that I was a charming young fellow and a great friend of his could not be of the smallest use to me and would be of advantage to himself, two reasons which made him decide to speak of me to Odette whenever an opportunity arose

    Thus at length I found my way into that abode from which was wafted even on to the staircase the scent that Mme. Swann used, though it was embalmed far more sweetly still by the peculiar, disturbing charm that emanated from the life of Gilberte. The implacable porter, transformed into a benevolent Eumenid, adopted the custom, when I asked him if I might go upstairs, of indicating to me, by raising his cap with a propitious hand, that he gave ear to my prayer. Those windows which, seen from outside, used to interpose between me and the treasures within, which were not intended for me, a polished, distant and superficial stare, which seemed to me the very stare of the Swanns themselves, it fell to my lot, when in the warm weather I had spent a whole afternoon with Gilberte in her room, to open them myself, so as to let in a little air, and even to lean over the sill of one of them by her side, if it was her mother’s ‘at home’ day, to watch the visitors arrive who would often, raising their heads as they stepped out of their carriages, greet me with a wave of the hand, taking me for some nephew of their hostess. At such moments Gilberte’s plaits used to brush my cheek. They seemed to me, in the fineness of their grain, at once natural and supernatural, and in the strength of their constructed tracery, a matchless work of art, in the composition of which had been used the very grass of Paradise. To a section of them, even infinitely minute, what celestial herbary would I not have given as a reliquary. But since I never hoped to obtain an actual fragment of those plaits, if at least I had been able to have their photograph, how far more precious than one of a sheet of flowers traced by Vinci’s pencil! To acquire one of these, I stooped — with friends of the Swanns, and even with photographers — to servilities which did not procure for me what I wanted, but tied me for life to a number of extremely tiresome people

    Gilberte’s parents, who for so long had prevented me from seeing her, now — when I entered the dark hall in which hovered perpetually, more formidable and more to be desired than, at Versailles of old, the apparition of the King, the possibility of my encountering them, in which too, invariably, after butting into an enormous hat-stand with seven branches, like the Candlestick in Holy Writ, I would begin bowing confusedly before a footman, seated among the skirts of his long grey coat upon the wood-box, whom in the dim light I had mistaken for Mme. Swann — Gilberte’s parents, if one of them happened to be passing at the moment of my arrival, so far from seeming annoyed would come and shake hands with a smile, and say:

    “How d’e do?” (They both pronounced it in the same clipped way, which, you may well imagine, once I was back at home, I made an incessant and delightful practice of copying.) “Does Gilberte know you’re here? She does? Then I’ll leave you to her.”

    Better still, the tea-parties themselves to which Gilberte invited her friends, parties which for so long had seemed to me the most insurmountable of the barriers heaped up between her and myself, became now an opportunity for uniting us of which she would inform me in a few lines, written (because I was still a comparative stranger) upon sheets that were always different. One was adorned with a poodle embossed in blue, above a fantastic inscription in English with an exclamation mark after it; another was stamped with an anchor, or with the monogram G. S. preposterously elongated in a rectangle which ran from top to bottom of the page, or else with the name Gilberte, now traced across one corner in letters of gold which imitated my friend’s signature and ended in a flourish, beneath an open umbrella printed in black, now enclosed in a monogram in the shape of a Chinaman’s hat, which contained all the letters of the word in capitals without its being possible to make out a single one of them. At last, as the series of different writing-papers which Gilberte possessed, numerous as it might be, was not unlimited, after a certain number of weeks I saw reappear the sheet that bore (like the first letter she had written me) the motto Per vaim rectam, and over it the man’s head in a helmet, set in a medallion of tarnished silver. And each of them was chosen, on one day rather than another, by virtue of a certain ritual, as I then supposed, but more probably, as I now think, because she tried to remember which of them she had already used, so as never to send the same one twice to any of her correspondents, of those at least whom she took special pains to please, save at the longest possible intervals. As, on account of the different times of their lessons, some of the friends whom Gilberte used to invite to her parties were obliged to leave just as the rest were arriving, while I was still on the stairs I could hear escaping from the hall a murmur of voices which, such was the emotion aroused in me by the imposing ceremony in which I was to take part, long before I had reached the landing, broke all the bonds that still held me to my past life, so that I did not even remember that I was to take off my muffler as soon as I felt too hot, and to keep an eye on the clock so as not to be late in getting home. That staircase, besides, aîl of wood, as they were built about that time in certain houses, in keeping with that Henri II style which had for so long been Odette’s ideal though she was shortly to lose interest in it, and furnished with a placard, to which there was no equivalent at home, on which one read the words: “NOTICE. The lift must not be taken downstairs,” seemed to me a thing so marvellous that I told my parents that it was an ancient staircase brought from ever so far away by M. Swann. My regard for the truth was so great that I should not have hesitated to give them this information even if I had known it to be false, for it alone could enable them to feel for the dignity of the Swanns’ staircase the same respect that I felt myself. It was just as, when one is talking to some ignorant person who cannot understand in what the genius of a great physician consists, it is as well not to admit that he does not know how to cure a cold in the head. But since I had no power of observation, since, as a general rule, I never knew either the name or the nature of things that were before my eyes, and could understand only that when they were connected with the Swanns they must be extraordinary, I was by no means certain that in notifying my parents of the artistic value and remote origin of the staircase I was guilty of falsehood. It did not seem certain; but it must have seemed probable, for I felt myself turn very red when my father interrupted me with: “I know those houses; I have been in one; they are all alike; Swann just has several floors in one; it was Berlier built them all.” He added that he had thought of taking a flat in one of them, but that he had changed his mind, finding that they were not conveniently arranged, and that the landings were too dark. So he said; but I felt instinctively that my mind must make the sacrifices necessary to the glory of the Swanns and to my own happiness, and by a stroke of internal authority, in spite of what I had just heard, I banished for ever from my memory, as a good Catholic banishes Renan’s Vie de Jésus, the destroying thought that their house was just an ordinary flat in which we ourselves might have been living

    Meanwhile on those tea-party days, pulling myself up the staircase step by step, reason and memory already cast off like outer garments, and myself no more now than the sport of the basest reflexes, I would arrive in the zone in which the scent of Mme. Swann greeted my nostrils. I felt that I could already behold the majesty of the chocolate cake, encircled by plates heaped with little cakes, and by tiny napkins of grey damask with figures on them, as required by convention but peculiar to the Swanns. But this unalterable and governed whole seemed, like Kant’s necessary universe, to depend on a supreme act of free will. For when we were all together in Gilberte’s little sitting-room, suddenly she would look at the clock and exclaim:

    “I say! It’s getting a long time since luncheon, and we aren’t having dinner till eight. I feel as if I could eat something. What do you say?”

    And she would make us go into the dining-room, as sombre as the interior of an Asiatic Temple painted by Rembrandt, in which an architectural cake, as gracious and sociable as it was imposing, seemed to be enthroned there in any event, in case the fancy seized Gilberte to discrown it of its chocolate battlements and to hew down the steep brown slopes of its ramparts, baked in the oven like the bastions of the palace of Darius. Better still, in proceeding to the demolition of that Babylonitish pastry, Gilberte did not consider only her own hunger; she inquired also after mine, while she extracted for me from the crumbling monument a whole glazed slab jewelled with scarlet fruits, in the oriental styje. She asked me even at what o’clock my parents were dining, as if I still knew, as if the disturbance that governed me had allowed to persist the sensation of satiety or of hunger, the notion of dinner or the picture of my family in my empty memory and paralysed stomach. Alas, its paralysis was but momentary. The cakes that I took without noticing them, a time would come when I should have to digest them. But that time was still remote. Meanwhile Gilberte was making ‘my’ tea. I went on drinking it indefinitely, whereas a single cup would keep me awake for twenty-four hours. Which explains why my mother used always to say: “What a nuisance it is; he can never go to the Swarms’ without coming home ill.” But was I aware even, when I was at the Swanns’, that it was tea that I was drinking? Had I known, I should have taken it just the same, for even supposing that I had recovered for a moment the sense of the present, that would not have restored to me the memory of the past or the apprehension of the future. My imagination was incapable of reaching to the distant tune in which I might have the idea of going to bed, and the need to sleep

    Gilberte’s girl friends were not all plunged in that state of intoxication in which it is impossible to make up one’s mind. Some of them refused tea! Then Gilberte would say, using a phrase highly fashionable that year: “I can see I’m not having much of a success with my tea!” And to destroy more completely any idea of ceremony, she would disarrange the chairs that were drawn up round the table, with: “We look just like a wedding breakfast. Good lord, what fools servants are!”

    She nibbled her cake, perched sideways upon a cross-legged seat placed at an angle to the table. And then, just as though she could have had all those cakes at her disposal without having first asked leave of her mother, when Mme. Swann, whose ‘day’ coincided as a rule with Gilberte’s tea-parties, had shewn one of her visitors to the door, and came sweeping in, a moment later, dressed sometimes in blue velvet, more often in a black satin gown draped with white lace, she would say with an air of astonishment: “I say, that looks good, what you’ve got there. It makes me quite hungry to see you all eating cake.”

    “But, Mamma, do! We invite you!” Gilberte would answer

    ####

    “Thank you, no, my precious; what would my visitors say? I’ve still got Mme. Trombert and Mme. Cottard and Mme. Bontemps; you know dear Mme. Bontemps never pays very short visits, and she has only just come. What would all those good people say if I never went back to them? If no one else calls, I’ll come in again and have a chat with you (which will be far more amusing) after they’ve all gone. I really think I’ve earned a little rest; I have had forty-five different people to-day, and forty-two of them told me about Gérôme’s picture! But you must come alone one of these days,” she turned to me, “and take ‘your’ tea with Gilberte. She will make it for you just as you like it, as you have it in your own little ‘studio,’” she went on, flying off to her visitors, as if it had been something as familiar to me as my own habits (such as the habit that I should have had of taking tea, had I ever taken it; as for my ‘studio,’ I was uncertain whether I had one or not) that I had come to seek in this mysterious world. “When can you come? To-morrow? We will make you ‘toast’ every bit as good as you get at Colombin’s. No? You are horrid!”— for, since she also had begun to form a salon, she had borrowed Mme. Verdurin’s mannerisms, and notably her tone of petulant autocracy. ‘Toast’ being as incomprehensible to me as ‘Colombin’s,’ this further promise could not add to my temptation. It will appear stranger still, now that everyone uses such expressions — and perhaps even at Combray they are creeping in — that I had not at first understood of whom Mme. Swann was speaking when I heard her sing the praises of our old ‘nurse.’ I did not know any English; I gathered, however, as she went on that the word was intended to denote Françoise. I who, in the Champs-Elysées, had been so terrified of the bad impression that she must make, I now learned from Mme. Swann that it was all the things that Gilberte had told them about my ‘nurse’ that had attracted her husband and her to me. “One feels that she is so devoted to you; she must be nice!” (At once my opinion of Françoise was diametrically changed. By the same token, to have a governess equipped with a waterproof and a feather in her hat no longer appeared quite so essential.) Finally I learned from some words which Mme. Swann let fall with regard to Mme. Blatin (whose good nature she recognised but dreaded her visits) that personal relations with that lady would have been of less value to me than I had supposed, and would not in any way have improved my standing with the Swanns

    If I had now begun to explore, with tremors of reverence and joy the faery domain which, against all probability, had opened to me its hitherto locked approaches, this was still only in my capacity as a friend of Gilberte. The kingdom into which I was received was itself contained within another, more mysterious still, in which Swann and his wife led their supernatural existence and towards which they made their way, after taking my hand in theirs, when they crossed the hall at the same moment as myself but in the other direction. But soon I was to penetrate also to the heart of the Sanctuary. For instance, Gilberte might be out when I called, but M. or Mme. Swann was at home. They would ask who had rung, and on being told that it was myself would send out to ask me to come in for a moment and talk to them, desiring me to use in one way or another, and with this or that object in view, my influence over their daughter. I reminded myself of that letter, so complete, so convincing, which I had written to Swann only the other day, and which he had not deigned even to acknowledge. I marvelled at the impotence of the mind, the reason and the heart to effect the least conversion, to solve a single one of those difficulties which, in the sequel, life, without one’s so much as knowing what steps it has taken, so easily unravels. My new position as the friend of Gilberte, endowed with an excellent influence over her, entitling me now to enjoy the same favours as if, having had as a companion at some school where they had always put me at the head of my class the son of a king, I had owed to that accident the right of informal entry into the palace and to audiences in the throne-room, Swann, with an infinite benevolence and as though he were not over-burdened with glorious occupations, would make me go into his library and there let me for an hour on end respond in stammered monosyllables, timid silences broken by brief and incoherent bursts of courage, to utterances of which my emotion prevented me from understanding a single word; would shew me works of art and books which he thought likely to interest me, things as to which I had no doubt, before seeing them, that they infinitely surpassed in beauty anything that the Louvre possessed or the National Library, but at which I found it impossible to look. At such moments I should have been grateful to Swann’s butler, had he demanded from me my watch, my tie-pin, my boots, and made me sign a deed acknowledging him as my heir: in the admirable words of a popular expression of which, as of the most famous epics, we do not know who was the author, although, like those epics, and with all deference to Wolff and his theory, it most certainly had an author, one of those inventive, modest souls such as we come across every year, who light upon such gems as ‘putting a name to a face,’ though their own names they never let us learn, I did not know what I was doing. All the greater was my astonishment, when my visit was prolonged, at finding to what a zero of realisation, to what an absence of happy ending those hours spent in the enchanted dwelling led me. But my disappointment arose neither from the inadequacy of the works of art that were shewn to me nor from the impossibility of fixing upon them my distracted gaze. For it was not the intrinsic beauty of the objects themselves that made it miraculous for me to be sitting in Swann’s library, it was the attachment to those objects — which might have been the ugliest in the world — of the particular feeling, melancholy and voluptuous, which I had for so many years localised in that room and which still impregnated it; similarly the multitude of mirrors, of silver-backed brushes, of altars to Saint Anthony of Padua, carved and painted by the most eminent artists, her friends, counted for nothing in the feeling of my own unworthiness and of her regal benevolence which was aroused in me when Mme. Swann received me for a moment in her own room, in which three beautiful and impressive creatures, her principal and second and third maids, smilingly prepared for her the most marvellous toilets, and towards which, on the order conveyed to me by the footman in knee-breeches that Madame wished to say a few words to me, I would make my way along the tortuous path of a corridor all embalmed, far and near, by the precious essences which exhaled without ceasing from her dressing-room a fragrance exquisitely sweet

    When Mme. Swann had returned to her visitors, we could still hear her talking and laughing, for even with only two people in the room, and as though she had to cope with all the ‘good friends’ at once, she would raise her voice, ejaculate her words, as she had so often in the ‘little clan’ heard its ‘Mistress’ do, at the moments when she ‘led the conversation.’ The expressions which we have borrowed from other people being those which, for a time at least, we are fondest of using, Mme. Swann used to select at one time those which she had learned from distinguished psople whom her husband had not managed to prevent her from getting to know (it was from them that she derived the mannerism which consists in suppressing the article or demonstrative pronoun, in French, before an adjective qualifying a person’s name), at another time others more plebeian (such as “It’s a mere nothing!” the favourite expression of one of her friends), and used to make room for them in all the stories which, by a habit formed among the ‘little clan,’ she loved to tell about people. She would follow these up automatically with, “I do love that story!” or “Do admit, it’s a verygood story!” which came to her, through her husband, from the Guermantes, whom she did not know

    Mme. Swann had left the dining-room, but her husband, who had just returned home, made his appearance among us in turn.’ “Do you know if your mother is alone, Gilberte?” “No, Papa, she has still some people.” “What, still? At seven o’clock! It’s appalling! The poor woman must be absolutely dead. It’s odious.” (At home I had always heard the first syllable of this word pronounced with a long ‘o,’ like ‘ode,’ but M. and Mme. Swann made it short, as in ‘odd.’) “Just think of it; ever since two o’clock this afternoon!” he went on, turning to me. “And Camille tells me that between four and five he let in at least a dozen people. Did I say a dozen? I believe he told me fourteen. No, a dozen; I don’t remember. When I came home I had quite forgotten it was her ‘day,’ and when I saw all those carriages outside the door I thought there must be a wedding in the house. And just now, while I’ve been in the library for a minute, the bell has never stopped ringing; upon my word, it’s given me quite a headache. And are there a lot of them in there still?” “No; only two.” “Who are they, do you know?” “Mme. Cottard and Mme. Bontemps.” “Oh! the wife of the Chief Secretary to the Minister of Posts.” “I know her husband’s a clerk in some Ministry or other, but I don’t know what he does.” Gilberte assumed a babyish manner

    “What’s that? You silly child, you talk as if you were two years old. What do you mean; ‘a clerk in some Ministry or other’ indeed! He is nothing less than Chief Secretary, chief of the whole show, and what’s more — what on earth am I thinking of? Upon my word, I’m getting as stupid as yourself; he is not the Chief Secretary, he’s the Permanent Secretary.”

    “I don’t know, I’m sure; does that mean a lot, being Permanent Secretary?” answered Gilberte, who never let slip an opportunity of displaying her own indifference to anything that gave her parents cause for vanity. (She may, of course, have considered that she only enhanced the brilliance of such an acquaintance by not seeming to attach any undue importance to it.)

    “I should think it did ‘mean a lot’!” exclaimed Swann, who preferred to this modesty, which might have left me in doubt, a more explicit mode of speech. “Why it means simply that he’s the first man after the Minister. In fact, he’s more important than the Minister, because it is he that does all the work. Besides, it appears that he has immense capacity, a man quite of the first rank, a most distinguished individual. He’s an Officer of the Legion of Honour. A delightful man, he is, and very good-looking too.”

    (This man’s wife, incidentally, had married him against everyone’s wishes and advica because he was a ‘charming creature.’ He had, what may be sufficient to constitute a rare and delicate whole, a fair, silky beard, good features, a nasal voice, powerful lungs and a glass eye.)

    “I may tell you,” he added, turning again to me, “that I am greatly amused to see that lot serving in the present Government, because they are Bontemps of the Bontemps-Chenut family, typical old-fashioned middle-class people, reactionary, clerical, tremendously strait-laced. Your grandfather knew quite well — at least by name and by sight he must have known old Chenut, the father, who never tipped the cabmen more than a ha’penny, though he was a rich enough man for those days, and the Baron Bréau-Chenut. All their money went in the Union Générale smash — you’re too young to remember that, of course — and, gad! they’ve had to get it back as best they could.”

    “He’s the uncle of a little girl who used to come to my lessons, in a class a long way below mine, the famous ‘Albertine.’ She’s certain to be dreadfully ‘fast’ when she’s older, but just now she’s the quaintest spectacle.”

    “She is amazing, this daughter of mine. She knows everyone.”

    “I don’t know her. I only used to see her going about, and hear them calling ‘Albertine’ here, and ‘Albertine’ there. But I do know Mme. Bontemps, and I don’t like her much either.”

    “You are quite wrong; she is charming, pretty, intelligent. In fact, she’s quite clever. I shall go in and say how d’e do to her, and ask her if her husband thinks we’re going to have war, and whether we can rely on King Theodosius. He’s bound to know, don’t you think, since he’s in the counsels of the gods.”

    It was not thus that Swann used to talk in days gone by; but which of us cannot call to mind some royal princess of limited intelligence who let herself be carried off by a footman, and then, ten years later, tried to get back into society, and found that people were not very willing to call upon her; have we not found her spontaneously adopting the language of all the old bores, and, when we referred to some duchess who was at the height of fashion, heard her say: “She came to see me only yesterday,” or “I live a very quiet life.” So that it is superfluous to make a study of manners, since we can deduce them all from psychological laws

    The Swanns shared this eccentricity of people who have not many friends; a visit, an invitation, a mere friendly word from some one ever so little prominent were for them events to which they aspired to give full publicity. If bad luck would have it that the Verdurins were in London when Odette gave a rather smart dinner-party, arrangements were made by which some common friend was to ‘cable’ a report to them across the Channel. Even the complimentary letters and telegrams received by Odette the Swanns were incapable of keeping to themselves. They spoke of them to their friends, passed them from hand to hand. Thus the Swanns’ drawing-room reminded one of a seaside hotel where telegrams containing the latest news are posted up on a board

    Still, people who had known the old Swann not merely outside society, as I had known him, but in society, in that Guermantes set which, with certain concessions to Highnesses and Duchesses, was almost infinitely exacting in the matter of wit and charm, from which banishment was sternly decreed for men of real eminence whom its members found boring or vulgar — such people might have been astonished to observe that their old Swann had ceased to be not only discreet when he spoke of his acquaintance, but difficult when he was called upon to enlarge it. How was it that Mme. Bontemps, so common, so ill-natured, failed to exasperate him? How could he possibly describe her as attractive? The memory of the Guermantes set must, one would suppose, have prevented him; as a matter of fact it encouraged him. There was certainly among the Guermantes, as compared with the great majority of groups in society, taste, indeed a refined taste, but also a snobbishness from which there arose the possibility of a momentary interruption in the exercise of that taste. If it were a question of some one who was not indispensable to their circle, of a Minister for Foreign Affairs, a Republican and inclined to be pompous, or of an Academician who talked too much, their taste would be brought to bear heavily against him, Swann would condole with Mme. de Guermantes on having had to sit next to such people at dinner at one of the Embassies, and they would a thousand times rather have a man of fashion, that is to say a man of the Guermantes kind, good for nothing, but endowed with the wit of the Guermantes, some one who was ‘of the same chapel’ as themselves. Only, a Grand Duchess, a Princess of the Blood, should she dine often with Mme. de Guermantes, would soon find herself enrolled in that chapel also, without having any right to be there, without being at all so endowed. But with the simplicity of people in society, from the moment they had her in their houses they went out of their way to find her attractive, since they were unable to say that it was because she was attractive that they invited her. Swann, coming to the rescue of Mme. de Guermantes, would say to her after the Highness had gone: “After all, she’s not such a bad woman; really, she has quite a sense of the comic. I don’t suppose for a moment that she has mastered the Critique of Pure Reason; still, she is not unattractive.” “Oh, I do so entirely agree with you!” the Duchess would respond. “Besides, she was a little frightened of us all; you will see that she can be charming.” “She is certainly a great deal less devastating than Mme. X——” (the wife of the talkative Academician, and herself a remarkable woman) “who quotes twenty volumes at you.” “Oh, but there isn’t any comparison between them.” The faculty of saying such things as these, and of saying them sincerely, Swann had acquired from the Duchess, and had never lost. He made use of it now with reference to the people who came to his house. He forced himself to distinguish, and to admire in them the qualities that every human being will display if we examine him with a prejudice in his favour, and not with the distaste of the nice-minded; he extolled the merits of Mme. Bon-temps, as he had once extolled those of the Princesse de Parme, who must have been excluded from the Guermantes set if there had not been privileged terms of admission for certain Highnesses, and if, when they presented themselves for election, no consideration had indeed been paid except to wit and charm. We have seen already, moreover, that Swann had always an inclination (which he was now putting into practice, only in a more lasting fashion) to exchange his social position for another which, in certain circumstances, might suit him better. It is only people incapable of analysing, in their perception, what at first sight appears indivisible who believe that one’s position is consolidated with one’s person. One and the same man, taken at successive points in his life, will be found to breathe, at different stages on the social ladder, in atmospheres that do not of necessity become more and more refined; whenever, in any period of our existence, we form or re-form associations with a certain environment, and feel that we can move at ease in it and are made comfortable, we begin quite naturally to make ourselves fast to it by putting out roots and tendrils

    In so far as Mme. Bontemps was concerned, I believe also that Swann, in speaking of her with so much emphasis, was not sorry to think that my parents would hear that she had been to see his wife. To tell the truth, in our house the names of the people whom Mme. Swann was gradually getting to know pricked our curiosity more than they aroused our admiration. At the name of Mme. Trombert, my mother exclaimed: “Ah! That’s a new recruit, and one who will bring in others.” And as though she found a similarity between the somewhat summary, rapid and violent manner in which Mme. Swann acquired her friends, as it were by conquest, and a Colonial expedition, Mamma went on to observe: “Now that the Tromberts have surrendered, the neighbouring tribes will not be long in coming in.” If she had passed Mme. Swann in the street, she would tell us when she came home: “I saw Mme. Swann in all her war-paint; she must have been embarking on some triumphant offensive against the Massachutoes, or the Cingalese, or the Tromberts.” And so with all the new people whom I told her that I had seen in that somewhat composite and artificial society, to which they had often been brought with great difficulty and from widely different surroundings, Mamma would at once divine their origin, and, speaking of them as of trophies dearly bought, would say: “Brought back from an Expedition against the so-and-so!”

    As for Mme. Cottard, my father was astonished that Mme. Swann could find anything to be gained by getting so utterly undistinguished a woman to come to her house, and said: “In spite of the Professor’s position, I must say that I cannot understand it.” Mamma, on the other hand, understood quite well; she knew that a great deal of the pleasure which a woman finds in entering a class of society different from that in which she has previously lived would be lacking if she had no means of keeping her old associates informed of those others, relatively more brilliant, with whom she has replaced them. Therefore, she requires an eye-witness who may be allowed to penetrate this new, delicious world (as a buzzing, browsing insect bores its way into a flower) and will then, as the course of her visits may carry her, spread abroad, or so at least one hopes, with the tidings, a latent germ of envy and of wonder. Mme. Cottard, who might have been created on purpose to fill this part, belonged to that special category in a visiting list which Mamma (who inherited certain facets of her father’s turn of mind) used to call the ‘Tell Sparta’ people. Besides — apart from another reason which did not come to our knowledge until many years later — Mme. Swann, in inviting this good-natured, reserved and modest friend, had no need to fear lest she might be introducing into her drawing-room, on her brilliant ‘days,’ a traitor or a rival. She knew what a vast number of homely blossoms that busy worker, armed with her plume and card-case, could visit in a single afternoon. She knew the creature’s power of dissemination, and, basing her calculations upon the law of probability, was led to believe that almost certainly some intimate of the Verdurins would be bound to hear, within two or three days, how the Governor of Paris had left cards upon her, or that M. Verdurin himself would be told how M. Le Hault de Pressagny, the President of the Horse Show, had taken them, Swann and herself, to the King Theodosius gala; she imagined the Verdurins as informed of these two events, both so flattering to herself and of these alone, because the particular materialisations in which we embody and pursue fame are but few in number, by the default of our own minds which are incapable of imagining at one time all the forms which, none the less, we hope — in a general way — that fame will not fail simultaneously to assume for our benefit

    Mme. Swann had, however, met with no success outside what was called the ‘official world.’ Smart women did not go to her house. It was not the presence there of Republican ‘notables’ that frightened them away. In the days of my early childhood, conservative society was to the last degree worldly, and no ‘good’ house would ever have opened its doors to a Republican. The people who lived in such an atmosphere imagined that the impossibility of ever inviting an ‘opportunist’— still more, a ‘horrid radical’— to their parties was something that would endure for ever, like oil-lamps and horse-drawn omnibuses. But, like a kaleidoscope which is every now and then given a turn, society arranges successively in different orders elements which one would have supposed to be immovable, and composes a fresh pattern. Before I had made my first Communion, ladies on the ‘right side’ in politics had had the stupefaction of meeting, while paying calls, a smart Jewess. These new arrangements of the kaleidoscope are produced by what a philosopher would call a ‘change of criterion.’ The Dreyfus case brought about another, at a period rather later than that in which I began to go to Mme. Swann’s, and the kaleidoscope scattered once again its little scraps of colour. Everything Jewish, even the smart lady herself, fell out of the pattern, and various obscure nationalities appeared in its place. The most brilliant drawing-room in Paris was that of a Prince who was an Austrian and ultra-Catholic. If instead of the Dreyfus case there had come a war with Germany, the base of the kaleidoscope would have been turned in the other direction, and its pattern reversed. The Jews having shewn, to the general astonishment, that they were patriots also, would have kept their position, and no one would have cared to go any more, or even to admit that he had ever gone to the Austrian Prince’s. All this does not, however, prevent the people who move in it from imagining, whenever society is stationary for the moment, that no further change will occur, just as in spite of having witnessed the birth of the telephone they decline to believe in the aeroplane. Meanwhile the philosophers of journalism are at work, castigating the preceding epoch, and not only the kind of pleasures in which it indulged, which seem to them to be the last word in corruption, but even the work of its artists and philosophers, which have no longer the least value in their eyes, as though they were indissolubly linked to the successive moods of fashionable frivolity. The one thing that does not change is that at any and every time it appears that there have been ‘great changes.’ At the time when I went to Mme. Swann’s the Dreyfus storm had not yet broken, and some of the more prominent Jews were extremely powerful. None more so than Sir Rufus Israels, whose wife, Lady Israels, was Swann’s aunt. She had not herself any intimate acquaintance so distinguished as her nephew’s, while he, since he did not care for her, had never much cultivated her society, although he was, so far as was known, her heir. But she was the only one of Swann’s relatives who had any idea of his social position, the others having always remained in the state of ignorance, in that respect, which had long been our own. When, from a family circle, one of its members emigrates into ‘high society’— which to him appears a feat without parallel until after the lapse of a decade he observes that it has been performed in other ways and for different reasons by more than one of the men whom he knew as boys — he draws round about himself a zone of shadow, a terra incognita, which is clearly visible in its minutest details to all those who inhabit it with him, but is darkest night and nothingness to those who may not penetrate it but touch its fringe without the least suspicion of its existence in their midst. There being no news agency to furnish Swann’s lady cousins with intelligence of the people with whom he consorted, it was (before his appalling marriage, of course) with a smile of condescension that they would tell one another, over family dinner-tables, that they had spent a ‘virtuous’ Sunday in going to see ‘cousin Charles,’ whom (regarding him as a ‘poor relation’ who was inclined to envy their prosperity,) they used wittily to name, playing upon the title of Balzac’s story, Le Cousin Bête. Lady Israels, however, was letter-perfect in the names and quality of the people who lavished upon Swann a friendship of which she was frankly jealous. Her husband’s family, which almost equalled the Rothschilds in importance, had for several generations managed the affairs of the Orleans Princes. Lady Israels, being immensely rich, exercised a wide influence, and had employed it so as to ensure that no one whom she knew should be ‘at home’ to Odette. One only had disobeyed her, in secret, the Comtesse de Marsantes. And then, as ill luck would have it, Odette having gone to call upon Mme. de Marsantes, Lady Israels had entered the room almost at her heels. Mme. de Marsantes was on tenter-hooks. With the craven impotence of those who are at liberty to act as they choose, she did not address a single word to Odette, who thus found little encouragement to press further the invasion of a world which, moreover, was not at all that into which she would have liked to be welcomed. In this complete detachment of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, Odette continued to be regarded as the illiterate ‘light woman,’ utterly different from the respectable ladies, ‘well up’ in all the minutest points of genealogy, who endeavoured to quench by reading biographies and memoirs their thirst for the aristocratic relations with which real life had omitted to provide them. And Swann, for his part, continued no doubt to be the lover in whose eyes all these peculiarities of an old mistress would appear lovable or at least inoffensive, for I have often heard his wife profess what were really social heresies, without his attempting (whether from lingering affection for her, loss of regard for society or weariness of the effort to make her perfect) to correct them. It was perhaps also another form of the simplicity which for so long had misled us at Combray, and which now had the effect that, while he continued to know, on his own account at least, many highly distinguished people, he did not make a point, in conversation in his wife’s drawing-room, of our seeming to feel that they were of the smallest importance. They had, indeed, less than ever for Swann, the centre of gravity of his life having been displaced. In any case, Odette’s ignorance of social distinctions was so dense that if the name of the Princesse de Guermantes were mentioned in conversation after that of the Duchess, her cousin, “So those ones are Princes, are they?” she would exclaim; “Why, they’ve gone up a step.” Were anyone to say “the Prince,” in speaking of the Duc de Chartres, she would put him right with, “The Duke, you mean; he is Duc de Chartres, not Prince.” As for the Duc d’Orléans, son of the Comte de Paris: “That’s funny; the son is higher than the father!” she would remark, adding, for she was afflicted with anglomania, “ThoseRoyalties are so dreadfully confusing!”— while to someone who asked her from what province the Guermantes family came she replied, “From the Aisne.”

    But, so far as Odette was concerned, Swann was quite blind, not merely to these deficiencies in her education but to the general mediocrity of her intelligence. More than that; whenever Odette repeated a silly story Swann would sit listening to his wife with a complacency, a merriment, almost an admiration into which some survival of his desire for her must have entered; while in the same conversation, anything subtle, anything deep even that he himself might say would be listened to by Odette with an habitual lack of interest, rather curtly, with impatience, and would at times be sharply contradicted. And we must conclude that this enslavement of refinement by vulgarity is the rule in many households, when we think, conversely, of all the superior women who yield to the blandishments of a boor, merciless in his censure of their most delicate utterances, while they go into ecstasies, with the infinite indulgence of love, over the feeblest of his witticisms. To return to the reasons which prevented Odette, at this period, from making her way into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, it must be observed that the latest turn of the social kaleidoscope had been actuated by a series of scandals. Women to whose houses one had been going with entire confidence had been discovered to be common prostitutes, if not British spies. One would, therefore, for some time to come expect people (so, at least, one supposed) to be, before anything else, in a sound position, regular, settled, accountable. Odette represented simply everything with which one had just severed relations, and was incidentally to renew them at once (for men, their natures not altering from day to day, seek in every new order a continuance of the old) but to renew them by seeking it under another form which would allow one to be innocently taken in, and to believe that it was no longer the same society as before the disaster. However, the scapegoats of that society and Odette were too closely alike. People who move in society are very short-sighted; at the moment in which they cease to have any relations with the Israelite ladies whom they have known, while they are asking themselves how they are to fill the gap thus made in their lives, they perceive, thrust into it as by the windfall of a night of storm, a new lady, an Israelite also; but by virtue of her novelty she is not associated in their minds with her predecessors, with what they are convinced that they must abjure. She does not ask that they shall respect her God. They take her up. There was no question of anti-semitism at the time when I used first to visit Odette. But she was like enough to it to remind people of what they wished, for a while, to avoid

    As for Swann himself, he was still a frequent visitor of several of his former acquaintance, who, of course, were all of the very highest rank. And yet when he spoke to us of the people whom he had just been to see I noticed that, among those whom he had known in the old days, the choice that he made was dictated by the same kind of taste, partly artistic, partly historic, that inspired him as a collector. And remarking that it was often some great lady or other of waning reputation, who interested him because she had been the mistress of Liszt or because one of Balzac’s novels was dedicated to her grandmother (as he would purchase a drawing if Chateaubriand had written about it) I conceived a suspicion that we had, at Combray, replaced one error, that of regarding Swann as a mere stockbroker, who did not go into society, by another, when we supposed him to be one of the smartest men in Paris. To be a friend of the Comte de Paris meant nothing at all. Is not the world full of such ‘friends of Princes,’ who would not be received in any house that was at all ‘exclusive’? Princes know themselves to be princes, and are not snobs; besides, they believe themselves to be so far above everything that is not of their blood royal that great nobles and ‘business men’ appear, in the depths beneath them, to be practically on a level

    But Swann went farther than this; not content with seeking in society, such as it was, when he fastened upon the names which, inscribed upon its roll by the past, were still to be read there, a simple artistic and literary pleasure, he indulged in the slightly vulgar diversion of arranging as it were social nosegays by grouping heterogeneous elements, bringing together people taken at hazard, here, there and everywhere. These experiments in the lighter side (or what was to Swann the lighter side) of sociology did not stimulate an identical reaction, with any regularity, that is to say, in each of his wife’s friends. “I’m thinking of asking the Cottards to meet the Duchesse de Vendôme,” he would laughingly say to Mme. Bontemps, in the appetised tone of an epicure who has thought of, and intends to try the substitution, in a sauce, of cayenne pepper for cloves. But this plan, which was, in fact, to appear quite humorous, in an archaic sense of the word, to the Cottards, had also the power of infuriating Mme. Bontemps. She herself had recently been presented by the Swanns to the Duchesse de Vendôme, and had found this as agreeable as it seemed to her natural. The thought of winning renown from it at the Cottards’, when she related to them what had happened, had been by no means the least savoury ingredient of her pleasure. But like those persons recently decorated who, their investiture once accomplished, would like to see the fountain of honour turned off at the main, Mme. Bontemps would have preferred that, after herself, no one else in her own circle of friends should be made known to the Princess. She denounced (to herself, of course) the licentious taste of Swann who, in order to gratify a wretched aesthetic whim, was obliging her to scatter to the winds, at one swoop, all the dust that she would have thrown in the eyes of the Cottards when she told them about the Duchesse de Vendôme. How was she even to dare to announce to her husband that the Professor and his wife were in their turn to partake of this pleasure, of which she had boasted to him as though it were unique. And yet, if the Cottards could only be made to know that they were being invited not seriously but for the amusement of their host! It is true that the Bontemps had been invited for the same reason, but Swann, having acquired from the aristocracy that eternal ‘Don Juan’ spirit which, in treating with two women of no importance, makes each of them believe that it is she alone who is seriously loved, had spoken to Mme. Bontemps of the Duchesse de Vendôme as of a person whom it was clearly laid down that she must meet at dinner. “Yes, we’re determined to have the Princess here with the Cottards,” said Mme. Swann a few weeks later; “My husband thinks that we might get something quite amusing out of that conjunction.” For if she had retained from the ‘little nucleus’ certain habits dear to Mme. Verdurin, such as that of shouting things aloud so as to be heard by all the faithful, she made use, at the same time, of certain expressions, such as ‘conjunction,’ which were dear to the Guermantes circle, of which she thus felt unconsciously and at a distance, as the sea is swayed by the moon, the attraction, though without being drawn perceptibly closer to it. “Yes, the Cottards and the Duchesse de Vendôme. Don’t you think that might be rather fun?” asked Swann. “I think they’ll be exceedingly ill-assorted, and it can only lead to a lot of bother; people oughtn’t to play with fire, is what I say!” snapped Mme. Bontemps, furious. She and her husband were, all the same, invited, as was the Prince d’Agrigente, to this dinner, which Mme. Bontemps and Cottard had each two alternative ways of describing, according to whom they were telling about it. To one set Mme. Bontemps for her part, and Cottard for his would say casually, when asked who else had been of the party: “Only the Prince d’Agrigente; it was all quite intimate.” But there were others who might, alas, be better informed (once, indeed, some one had challenged Cottard with: “But weren’t the Bontemps there too?” “Oh, I forgot them,” Cottard had blushingly admitted to the tactless questioner whom he ever afterwards classified among slanderers and speakers of evil). For these the Bontemps and Cottards had each adopted, without any mutual arrangement, a version the framework of which was identical for both parties, their own names alone changing places. “Let me see;” Cottard would say, “there were our host and hostess, the Due and Duchesse de Vendôme —” (with a satisfied smile) “Professor and Mme. Cottard, and, upon my soul, heaven only knows how they got there, for they were about as much in keeping as hairs in the soup, M. and Mme. Bontemps!” Mme. Bontemps would recite an exactly similar ‘piece,’ only it was M. and Mme. Bontemps who were named with a satisfied emphasis between the Duchesse de Vendôme and the Prince d’Agrigente, while the ‘also ran,’ whom finally she used to accuse of having invited themselves, and who completely spoiled the party, were the Cottards

    When he had been paying calls Swann would often come home with little time to spare before dinner. At that point in the evening, six o’clock, when in the old days he had felt so wretched, he no longer asked himself what Odette might be about, and was hardly at all concerned to hear that she had people still with her, or had gone out. He recalled at times that he had once, years ago, tried to read through its envelope a letter addressed by Odette to Forcheville. But this memory was not pleasing to him, and rather than plumb the depth of shame that he felt in it he preferred to indulge in a little grimace, twisting up the corners of his mouth and adding, if need be, a shake of the head which signified “What does it all matter?” In truth, he considered now that the hypothesis by which he had often been brought to a standstill in days gone by, according to which it was his jealous imagination alone that blackened what was in reality the innocent life of Odette — that this hypothesis (which after all was beneficent, since, so long as his amorous malady had lasted, it had diminished his sufferings by making them seem imaginary) was not the truth, that it was his jealousy that had seen things in the right light, and that if Odette had loved him better than he supposed, she had deceived him more as well. Formerly, while his sufferings were still keen, he had vowed that, as soon as he should have ceased to love Odette, and so to be afraid either of vexing her or of making her believe that he loved her more than he did, he would afford himself the satisfaction of elucidating with her, simply from his love of truth and as a historical point, whether or not she had had Forcheville in her room that day when he had rung her bell and rapped on her window without being let in, and she had written to Forcheville that it was an uncle of hers who had called. But this so interesting problem, of which he was waiting to attempt the solution only until his jealousy should have subsided, had precisely lost all interest in Swann’s eyes when he had ceased to be jealous. Not immediately, however. He felt no other jealousy now with regard to Odette than what the memory of that day, that afternoon spent in knocking vainly at the little house in the Rue La Pérouse, had continued to excite in him; as though his jealousy, not dissimilar in that respect from those maladies which appear to have their seat, their centre of contagion less in certain persons than in certain places, in certain houses, had had for its object not so much Odette herself as that day, that hour in the irrevocable past when Swann had beaten at every entrance to her house in turn. You would have said that that day, that hour alone had caught and preserved a few last fragments of the amorous personality which had once been Swann’s, and that there alone could he now recapture them. For a long time now it had made no matter to him that Odette had been false to him, and was false still. And yet he had continued for some years to seek out old servants of Odette, so strongly in him persisted the painful curiosity to know whether on that day, so long ago, at six o’clock, Odette had been in bed with Forcheville. Then that curiosity itself had disappeared, without, however, his abandoning his investigations. He continued the attempt to discover what no longer interested him, because his old ego though it had shrivelled to the extreme of decrepitude still acted mechanically, following the course of preoccupations so utterly abandoned that Swann could not now succeed even in forming an idea of that anguish — so compelling once that he had been unable to foresee his ever being delivered from it, that only the death of her whom he loved (death which, as will be shewn later on in this story, by a cruel example, in no way diminishes the sufferings caused by jealousy) seemed to him capable of making smooth the road, then insurmountably barred to him, of his life

    But to bring to light, some day, those passages in the life of Odette to which he owed his sufferings had not been Swann’s only ambition; he had in reserve that also of wreaking vengeance for his sufferings when, being no longer in love with Odette, he should no longer be afraid of her; and the opportunity of gratifying this second ambition had just occurred, for Swann was in love with another woman, a woman who gave him — grounds for jealousy, no, but who did all the same make him jealous, because he was not capable, now, of altering his way of making love, and it was the way he had used with Odette that must serve him now for another. To make Swann’s jealousy revive it was not essential that this woman should be unfaithful, it sufficed that for any reason she was separated from him, at a party for instance, where she was presumably enjoying herself. That was enough to reawaken in him the old anguish, that lamentable and inconsistent excrescence of his love, which held Swann ever at a distance from what she really was, like a yearning to attain the impossible (what this young woman really felt for him, the hidden longing that absorbed her days, the secret places of her heart), for between Swann and her whom he loved this anguish piled up an unyielding mass of already existing suspicions, having their cause in Odette, or in some other perhaps who had preceded Odette, allowing this now ageing lover to know his mistress of the moment only in the traditional and collective phantasm of the ‘woman who made him jealous,’ in which he had arbitrarily incarnated his new love. Often, however, Swann would charge his jealousy with the offence of making him believe in imaginary infidelities; but then he would remember that he had given Odette the benefit of the same argument and had in that been wrong. And so everything that the young woman whom he loved did in those hours when he was not with her appeared spoiled of its innocence in his eyes. But whereas at that other time he had made a vow that if ever he ceased to love her whom he did not then imagine to be his future wife, he would implacably exhibit to her an indifference that would at length be sincere, so as to avenge his pride that had so long been trampled upon by her — of those reprisals which he might now enforce without risk to himself (for what harm could it do him to be taken at his word and deprived of those intimate moments with Odette that had been so necessary to him once), of those reprisals he took no more thought; with his love had vanished the desire to shew that he was in love no longer. And he who, when he was suffering at the hands of Odette, would have looked forward so keenly to letting her see one day that he had fallen to a rival, now that he was in a position to do so took infinite precautions lest his wife should suspect the existence of this new love

    * * *

    It was not only in those tea-parties, on account of which I had formerly had the sorrow of seeing Gilberte leave me and go home earlier than usual, that I was henceforth to take part, but the engagements that she had with her mother, to go for a walk or to some afternoon party, which by preventing her from coming to the Champs-Elysées had deprived me of her, on those days when I loitered alone upon the lawn or stood before the wooden horses — to these outings M. and Mme. Swann henceforth admitted me, I had a seat in their landau, and indeed it was me that they asked if I would rather go to the theatre, to a dancing lesson at the house of one of Gilberte’s friends, to some social gathering given by friends of her parents (what Odette called ‘a little meeting’) or to visit the tombs at Saint-Denis

    On days when I was going anywhere with the Swanns I would arrive at the house in time for déjeuner, which Mme. Swann called ‘le lunch’; as one was not expected before half-past twelve, while my parents in those days had their meal at a quarter past eleven, it was not until they had risen from the table that I made my way towards that sumptuous quarter, deserted enough at any hour, but more particularly just then, when everyone had gone indoors. Even on winter days of frost, if the weather held, tightening every few minutes the knot of a gorgeous necktie from Charvet’s and looking to see that my varnished boots were not getting dirty, I would roam to and fro among the avenues, waiting until twenty-seven minutes past the hour. I could see from afar in the Swanns’ little garden-plot the sunlight glittering like hoar frost from the bare-boughed trees. It is true that the garden boasted but a pair of them. The unusual hour presented the scene in a new light. Into these pleasures of nature (intensified by the suppression of habit and indeed by my physical hunger) the thrilling prospect of sitting down to luncheon with Mme. Swann was infused; it did not diminish them, but taking command of them trained them to its service; so that if, at this hour when ordinarily I did not perceive them, I seemed now to be discovering the fine weather, the cold, the wintry sunlight, it was all as a sort of preface to the creamed eggs, as a patina, a cool and coloured glaze applied to the decoration of that mystic chapel which was the habitation of Mme. Swann, and in the heart of which there were, by contrast, so much warmth, so many scents and flowers

    At half-past twelve I would finally make up my mind to enter that house which, like an immense Christmas stocking, seemed ready to bestow upon me supernatural delights. (The French name ‘Noël’ was, by the way, unknown to Mme. Swann and Gilberte, who had substituted for it the English ‘Christmas,’ and would speak of nothing but ‘Christmas pudding,’ what people had given them as ‘Christmas presents’ and of going away — the thought of which maddened me with grief —‘for Christmas.’ At home even, I should have thought it degrading to use the word ‘Noël,’ and always said ‘Christmas,’ which my father considered extremely silly.)

    I encountered no one at first but a footman who after leading me through several large drawing-rooms shewed me into one that was quite small, empty, its windows beginning to dream already in the blue light of afternoon; I was left alone there in the company of orchids, roses and violets, which, like people who are kept waiting in a room beside you but do not know you, preserved a silence which their individuality as living things made all the more impressive, and received coldly the warmth of a glowing fire of coals, preciously displayed behind a screen of crystal, in a basin of white marble over which it spilled, now and again, its perilous rubies

    I had sat down, but I rose hurriedly on hearing the door opened; it was only another footman, and then a third, and the minute result chat their vainly alarming entrances and exits achieved was to put a little more coal on the fire or water in the vases. They departed, I found myself alone, once that door was shut which Mme. Swann was surely soon going to open. Of a truth, I should have been less ill at ease in a magician’s cave than in this little waiting-room where the fire appeared to me to be performing alchemical transmutations as in Klingsor’s laboratory. Footsteps sounded afresh, I did not rise, it was sure to be just another footman; it was M. Swann. “What! All by yourself? What is one to do; that poor wife of mine has never been able to remember what time means! Ten minutes to one. She gets later every day. And you’ll see, she will come sailing in without the least hurry, and imagine she’s in heaps of time.” And as he was still subject to neuritis, and as he was becoming a trifle ridiculous, the fact of possessing so unpunctual a wife, who came in so late from the Bois, forgot everything at her dressmaker’s and was never in time for luncheon made Swann anxious for his digestion but flattered his self-esteem

    He shewed me his latest acquisitions and explained their interest to me, but my emotion, added to the unfamiliarity of being still without food at this hour, sweeping through my mind left it void, so that while able to speak I was incapable of hearing. Anyhow, so far as the works of art in Swann’s possession were concerned, it was enough for me that they were contained in his house, formed a part there of the delicious hour that preceded luncheon. The Gioconda herself might have appeared there without giving me any more pleasure than one of Mme. Swann’s indoor gowns, or her scent bottles

    I continued to wait, alone or with Swann, and often with Gilberte, come in to keep us company. The arrival of Mme. Swann, prepared for me by all those majestic apparitions, must (so it seemed to me) be something truly immense. I strained my ears to catch the slightest sound. But one never finds quite as high as one has been expecting a cathedral, a wave in a storm, a dancer’s leap in the air; after those liveried footmen, suggesting the chorus whose processional entry upon the stage leads up to and at the same time diminishes the final appearance of the queen, Mme. Swann, creeping furtively in, with a little otter-skin coat, her veil lowered to cover a nose pink-tipped by the cold, did not fulfil the promises lavished, while I had been waiting, upon my imagination

   But if she had stayed at home all morning, when she arrived in the drawing-room she would be clad in a wrapper of crêpe-de-Chine, brightly coloured, which seemed to me more exquisite than any of her dresses

    Sometimes the Swanns decided to remain in the house all afternoon, and then, as we had had luncheon so late, very soon I must watch setting, beyond the garden-wall, the sun of that day which had seemed to me bound to be different from other days; then in vain might the servants bring in lamps of every size and shape, burning each upon the consecrated altar of a console, a card-table, a corner-cupboard, a bracket, as though for the celebration of some strange and secret rite; nothing extraordinary transpired in the conversation, and I went home disappointed, as one often is in one’s childhood after the midnight mass

    But my disappointment was scarcely more than mental. I was radiant with happiness in this house where Gilberte, when she was still not with us, was about to appear and would bestow on me in a moment, and for hours to come, her speech, her smiling and attentive gaze, just as I had caught it, that first time, at Combray. At the most I was a trifle jealous when I saw her so often disappear into vast rooms above, reached by a private staircase. Obliged myself to remain in the drawing-room, like a man in love with an actress who is confined to his stall ‘in front’ and wonders anxiously what is going on behind the scenes, in the green-room, I put to Swann, with regard to this other part of the house questions artfully veiled, but in a tone from which I could not quite succeed in banishing the note of uneasiness. He explained to me that the place to which Gilberte had gone was the linen-room, offered himself to shew it to me, and promised me that whenever Gilberte Had occasion to go there again he would insist upon her taking me with her. By these last words and the relief which they brought me Swann at once annihilated for me one of those terrifying interior perspectives at the end of which a woman with whom we are in love appears so remote. At that moment I felt for him an affection which I believed to be deeper than my affection for Gilberte. For he, being the master over his daughter, was giving her to me, whereas she, she withheld herself now and then, I had not the same direct control over her as I had indirectly through Swann. Besides, it was she whom I loved and could not, therefore look upon without that disturbance, without that desire for something more which destroys in us, in the presence of one whom we love, the sensation of loving

    As a rule, however, we did not stay indoors, we went out. Sometimes, before going to dress, Mme. Swann would sit down at the piano. Her lovely hands, escaping from the pink, or white, or, often, vividly coloured sleeves of her crêpe-de-Chine wrapper, drooped over the keys with that same melancholy which was in her eyes but was not in her heart. It was on one of those days that she happened to play me the part of Vinteuil’s sonata that contained the little phrase of which Swann had been so fond. But often one listens and hears nothing, if it is a piece of music at all complicated to which one is listening for the first time. And yet when, later on, this sonata had been played over to me two or three times I found that I knew it quite well. And so it is not wrong to speak of hearing a thing for the first time. If one had indeed, as one supposes, received no impression from the first hearing, the second, the third would be equally ‘first hearings’ and there would be no reason why one should understand it any better after the tenth. Probably what is wanting, the first time, is not comprehension but memory. For our memory, compared to the complexity of the impressions which it has to face while we are listening, is infinitesimal, as brief as the memory of a man who in his sleep thinks of a thousand things and at once forgets them, or as that of a man in his second childhood who cannot recall, a minute afterwards, what one has just been saying to him. Of these multiple impressions our memory is not capable of furnishing us with an immediate picture. But that picture gradually takes shape, and, with regard to works which we have heard more than once, we are like the schoolboy who has read several times over before going to sleep a lesson which he supposed himself not to know, and finds that he can repeat it by heart next morning. It was only that I had not, until then, heard a note of the sonata, whereas Swann and his wife could make out a distinct phrase that was as far beyond the range of my perception as a name which one endeavours to recall and in place of which one discovers only a void, a void from which, an hour later, when one is not thinking about them, will spring of their own accord, in one continuous flight, the syllables that one has solicited in vain. And not only does one not seize at once and retain an impression of works that are really great, but even in the content of any such work (as befell me in the case of Vinteuil’s sonata) it is the least valuable parts that one at first perceives. Thus it was that I was mistaken not only in thinking that this work held nothing further in store for me (so that for a long time I made no effort to hear it again) from the moment in which Mme. Swann had played over to me its most famous passage; I was in this respect as stupid as people are who expect to feel no astonishment when they stand in Venice before the front of Saint Mark’s, because photography has already acquainted them with the outline of its domes. Far more than that, even when I had heard the sonata played from beginning to end, it remained almost wholly invisible to me, like a monument of which its distance or a haze in the atmosphere allows us to catch but a faint and fragmentary glimpse. Hence the depression inseparable from one’s knowledge of such works, as of everything that acquires reality in time. When the least obvious beauties of Vinteuil’s sonata were revealed to me, already, borne by the force of habit beyond the reach of my sensibility, those that I had from the first distinguished and preferred in it were beginning to escape, to avoid me. Since I was able only in successive moments to enjoy all the pleasures that this sonata gave me, I never possessed it in its entirety: it was like life itself. But, less disappointing than life is, great works of art do not begin by giving us all their best. In Vinteuil’s sonata the beauties that one discovers at once are those also of which one most soon grows tired, and for the same reason, no doubt, namely that they are less different from what one already knows. But when those first apparitions have withdrawn, there is left for our enjoyment some passage which its composition, too new and strange to offer anything but confusion to our mind, had made indistinguishable and so preserved intact; and this, which we have been meeting every day and have not guessed it, which has thus been held in reserve for us, which by the sheer force of its beauty has become invisible and has remained unknown, this comes to us last of all. But this also must be the last that we shall relinquish. And we shall love it longer than the rest because we have taken longer to get to love it. The time, moreover, that a person requires — as I required in the matter of this sonata — to penetrate a work of any depth is merely an epitome, a symbol, one might say, of the years, the centuries even that must elapse before the public can begin to cherish a masterpiece that is really new. So that the man of genius, to shelter himself from the ignorant contempt of the world, may say to himself that, since one’s contemporaries are incapable of the necessary detachment, works written for posterity should be read by posterity alone, like certain pictures which one cannot appreciate when one stands too close to them. But, as it happens, any such cowardly precaution to avoid false judgments is doomed to failure; they are inevitable. The reason for which a work of genius is not easily admired from the first is that the man who has created it is extraordinary, that few other men resemble him. It was Beethoven’s Quartets themselves (the Twelfth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth) that devoted half a century to forming, fashioning and enlarging a public for Beethoven’s Quartets, marking in this way, like every great work of art, an advance if not in artistic merit at least in intellectual society, largely composed to-day of what was not to be found when the work first appeared, that is to say of persons capable of enjoying it. What artists call posterity is the posterity of the work of art. It is essential that the work (leaving out of account, for brevity’s sake, the contingency that several men of genius may at the same time be working along parallel lines to create a more instructed public in the future, a public from which other men of genius shall reap the benefit) shall create its own posterity. For if the work were held in reserve, were revealed only to posterity, that audience, for that particular work, would be not posterity but a group of contemporaries who were merely living half-a-century later in time. And so it is essential that the artist (and this is what Vinteuil had done), if he wishes his work to be free to follow its own course, shall launch it, wherever he may find sufficient depth, confidently outward bound towards the future. And yet this interval of time, the true perspective in which to behold a work of art, if leaving it out of account is the mistake made by bad judges, taking it into account is at times a dangerous precaution of the good. No doubt one can easily imagine, by an illusion similar to that which makes everything on the horizon appear equidistant, that all the revolutions which have hitherto occurred in painting or in music did at least shew respect for certain rules, whereas that which immediately confronts us, be it impressionism, a striving after discord, an exclusive use of the Chinese scale, cubism, futurism or what you will, differs outrageously from all that have occurred before. Simply because those that have occurred before we are apt to regard as a whole, forgetting that a long process of assimilation has melted them into a continuous substance, varied of course but, taking it as a whole, homogeneous, in which Hugo blends with Molière. Let us try to imagine the shocking incoherence that we should find, if we did not take into account the future, and the changes that it must bring about, in a horoscope of our own riper years, drawn and presented to us in our youth. Only horoscopes are not always accurate, and the necessity, when judging a work of art, of including the temporal factor in the sum total of its beauty introduces, to our way of thinking, something as hazardous, and consequently as barren of interest, as every prophecy the non-fulfilment of which will not at all imply any inadequacy on the prophet’s part, for the power to summon possibilities into existence or to exclude them from it is not necessarily within the competence of genius; one may have had genius and yet not have believed in the future of railways or of flight, or, although a brilliant psychologist, in the infidelity of a mistress or of a friend whose treachery persons far less gifted would have foreseen

    If I did not understand the sonata, it enchanted me to hear Mme. Swann play. Her touch appeared to me (like her wrappers, like the scent of her staircase, her cloaks, her chrysanthemums) to form part of an individual and mysterious whole, in a world infinitely superior to that in which the mind is capable of analysing talent. “Attractive, isn’t it, that Vinteuil sonata?” Swann asked me. “The moment when night is darkening among the trees, when the arpeggios of the violin call down a cooling dew upon the earth. You must admit that it is rather charming; it shews all the static side of moonlight, which is the essential part. It is not surprising that a course of radiant heat such as my wife is taking, should act on the muscles, since moonlight can prevent the leaves from stirring. That is what he expresses so well in that little phrase, the Bois de Boulogne plunged in a cataleptic trance. By the sea it is even more striking, because you have there the faint response of the waves, which, of course, you can hear quite distinctly, since nothing else dares to move. In Paris it is the other way; at the most, you may notice unfamiliar lights among the old buildings, the sky brightened as though by a colourless and harmless conflagration, that sort of vast variety show of which you get a hint here and there. But in Vinteuil’s little phrase, and in the whole sonata for that matter, it is not like that; the scene is laid in the Bois; in the gruppetto you can distinctly hear a voice saying: ‘I can almost see to read the paper!’” These words from Swann might have falsified, later on, my impression of the sonata, music being too little exclusive to inhibit absolutely what other people suggest that we should find in it. But I understood from other words which he let fall that this nocturnal foliage was simply that beneath whose shade in many a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris he had listened on many an evening to the little phrase. In place of the profound significance that he had so often sought in it, what it recalled now to Swann were the leafy boughs, arranged, wreathed, painted round about it (which it gave him the desire to see again because it seemed to him to be their inner, their hidden self, as it were their soul); was the whole of one spring season which he had not been able to enjoy before, not having had — feverish and moody as he then was — enough strength of body and mind for its enjoyment, which, as one puts by for an invalid the dainties that he has not been able to eat, it had kept in store for him. The charm that he had been made to feel by certain evenings in the Bois, a charm of which Vinteuil’s sonata served to remind him, he could not have recaptured by questioning Odette, although she, as well as the little phrase, had been his companion there. But Odette had been merely his companion, by his side, not (as the phrase had been) within him, and so had seen nothing — nor would she, had she been a thousand times as comprehending, have seen anything of that vision which for no one among us (or at least I was long under the impression that this rule admitted no exception) can be made externally visible. “It is rather charming, don’t you think,” Swann continued, “that sound can give a reflection, like water, or glass. It is curious, too, that Vinteuil’s phrase now shews me only the things to which I paid no attention then. Of my troubles, my loves of those days it recalls nothing, it has altered all my values.” “Charles, I don’t think that’s very polite to me, what you’re saying.” “Not polite? Really, you women are superb! I was simply trying to explain to this young man that what the music shews — to me, at least — is not for a moment ‘Free-will’ or ‘In Tune with the Infinite,’ but shall we say old Verdurin in his frock coat in the palm-house at the Jardin d’Acclimatation. Hundreds of times, without my leaving this room, the little phrase has carried me off to dine with it at Armenonville. Gad, it is less boring, anyhow, than having to go there with Mme. de Cambremer.” Mme. Swann laughed. “That is a lady who is supposed to have been violently in love with Charles,” she explained, in the same tone in which, shortly before, when we were speaking of Vermeer of Delft, of whose existence I had been surprised to find her conscious, she had answered me with: “I ought to explain that M. Swann was very much taken up with that painter at the time he was courting me. Isn’t that so, Charles dear?” “You’re not to start saying things about Mme. de Cambremer!” Swann checked her, secretly flattered. “But I’m only repeating what I’ve been told. Besides, it seems that she’s an extremely clever woman; I don’t know her myself. I believe she’s very pushing, which surprises me rather in a clever woman. But everyone says that she was quite mad about you; there’s no harm in repeating that.” Swann remained silent as a deaf-mute which was in a way a confirmation of what she had said, and a proof of his own fatuity. “Since what I’m playing reminds you of the Jardin d’Acclimatation,” his wife went on, with a playful semblance of being offended, “we might take him there some day in the carriage, if it would amuse him. It’s lovely there just now, and you can recapture your fond impressions! Which reminds me, talking of the Jardin d’Acclimatation, do you know, this young man thought that we were devotedly attached to a person whom I cut, as a matter of fact, whenever I possibly can, Mme. Blatin! I think it is rather crushing for us, that she should be taken for a friend of ours. Just fancy, dear Dr. Cottard, who never says a harsh word about anyone, declares that she’s positively contagious.” “A frightful woman! The one thing to be said for her is that she is exactly like Savonarola. She is the very image of that portrait of Savonarola, by Fra Bartolomeo.” This mania which Swann had for finding likenesses to people in pictures was defensible, for even what we call individual expression is — as we so painfully discover when we are in love and would fain believe in the unique reality of the beloved — something diffused and general, which can be found existing at different periods. But if one had listened to Swann, the processions of the Kings of the East, already so anachronistic when Benozzo Gozzoli introduced in their midst various Medici, would have been even more so, since they would have included the portraits of a whole crowd of men, contemporaries not of Gozzoli but of Swann, subsequent, that is to say not only by fifteen centuries to the Nativity but by four more to the painter himself. There was not missing from those trains, according to Swann, a single living Parisian of any note, any more than there was from that act in one of Sardou’s plays, in which, out of friendship for the author and for the leading lady, and also because it was the fashion, all the best known men in Paris, famous doctors, politicians, barristers, amused themselves, each on a different evening, by ‘walking on.’ “But what has she got to do with the Jardin d’Acclimatation?” “Everything!” “What? You don’t suggest that she’s got a sky-blue behind, like the monkeys?” “Charles, you really are too dreadful! I was thinking of what the Cingalese said to her. Do tell him, Charles; it really is a gem.” “Oh, it’s too silly. You know, Mme. Blatin loves asking people questions, in a tone which she thinks friendly, but which is really overpowering.” “What our good friends on the Thames call ‘patronising,’” interrupted Odette. “Exactly. Well, she went the other day to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, where they have some blackamoors — Cingalese, I think I heard my wife say; she is much ‘better up’ in ethnology than I am.” “Now, Charles, you’re not to make fun of poor me.”

    “I’ve no intention of making fun, I assure you. Well, to continue, she went up to one of these black fellows with ‘Good morning, nigga!’ . . . ” “Oh, it’s too absurd!” “Anyhow, this classification seems to have displeased the black. ‘Me nigga,’ he shouted (quite furious, don’t you know), to Mme. Blatin, ‘me nigga; you, old cow!’” “I do think that’s so delightful! I adore that story. Do say it’s a good one. Can’t you see old Blatin standing there, and hearing him: ‘Me nigga; you, old cow’?” I expressed an intense desire to go there and see these Cingalese, one of whom had called Mme. Blatin an old cow. They did not interest me in the least. But I reflected that in going to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, and again on our way home, we should pass along that Allée des Acacias in which I had loved so, once, to gaze on Mme. Swann, and that perhaps Coquelin’s mulatto friend, to whom I had never managed to exhibit myself in the act of saluting her, would see me there, seated at her side, as the victoria swept by

    During those minutes in which Gilberte, having gone to ‘get ready,’ was not in the room with us, M. and Mme. Swann would take delight in revealing to me all the rare virtues of their child. And everything that I myself observed seemed to prove the truth of what they said. I remarked that, as her mother had told me, she had not only for her friends but for the servants, for the poor, the most delicate attentions carefully thought out, a desire to give pleasure, a fear of causing annoyance, translated into all sorts of trifling actions which must often have meant great inconvenience to her. She had done some ‘work’ for our stall-keeper in the Champs-Elysées, and went out in the snow to give it to her with her own hands, so as not to lose a day. “You have no idea how kind-hearted she is, she won’t let it be seen,” her father assured me. Young as she was, she appeared far more sensible already than her parents. When Swann boasted of his wife’s grand friends Gilberte would turn away, and remain silent, but without any air of reproaching him, for it seemed inconceivable to her that her father could be subjected to the slightest criticism. One day, when I had spoken to her of Mlle. Vinteuil, she said to me:

    “I shall never know her, for a very good reason, and that is that she was not nice to her father, by what one hears, she gave him a lot of trouble. You can’t understand that any more than I, can you; I’m sure you could no more live without your papa than I could, which is quite natural after all. How can one ever forget a person one has loved all one’s life?”

    And once when she was making herself particularly endearing to Swann, as I mentioned this to her when he was out of the room:

    “Yes, poor Papa, it is the anniversary of his father’s death, just now. You can understand what he must be feeling; you do understand, don’t you; you and I feel the same about things like that. So I just try to be a little less naughty than usual.” “But he doesn’t ever think you naughty. He thinks you’re quite perfect.” “Poor Papa, that’s because he’s far too good himself.”

    But her parents were not content with singing the praises of Gilberte — that same Gilberte, who, even, before I had set eyes on her, used to appear to me standing before a church, in a landscape of the He de France, and later, awakening in me not dreams now but memories, was embowered always in a hedge of pink hawthorn, in the little lane that I took when I was going the Méséglise way. Once when I had asked Mme. Swann (and had made an effort to assume the indifferent tone of a friend of the family, curious to know the preferences of a child), which among all her playmates Gilberte liked the best, Mme. Swann replied: “But you ought to know a great deal better than I do. You are in her confidence, her great favourite, her ‘chum,’ as the English say.”

    It appears that in a coincidence as perfect as this was, when reality is folded over to cover the ideal of which we have so long been dreaming, it completely hides that ideal, absorbing it in itself, as when two geometrical figures that are congruent are made to coincide, so that there is but one, whereas we would rather, so as to give its full significance to our enjoyment, preserve for all those separate points of our desire, at the very moment in which we succeed in touching them, and so as to be quite certain that they are indeed themselves, the distinction of being intangible. And our thought cannot even reconstruct the old state so as to confront the new with it, for it has no longer a clear field: the acquaintance that we have made, the memory of those first, unhoped-for moments, the talk to which we have listened are there now to block the passage of our consciousness, and as they control the outlets of our memory far more than those of our imagination, they react more forcibly upon our past, which we are no longer able to visualise without taking them into account, than upon the form, still unshaped, of our future. I had been able to believe, year after year, that the right to visit Mme. Swann was a vague and fantastic privilege to which I should never attain; after I had spent a quarter of an hour in her drawing-room, it was the period in which I did not yet know her that was become fantastic and vague like a possibility which the realisation of an alternative possibility has made impossible. How was I ever to dream again of her dining-room as of an inconceivable place, when I could not make the least movement in my mind without crossing the path of that inextinguishable ray cast backwards to infinity, even ino my own most distant past, by the lobster à l’Américaine which I had just been eating? And Swann must have observed in his own case a similar phenomenon; for this house in which he entertained me might be regarded as the place into which had flowed, to coincide and be lost in one another, not only the ideal dwelling that my imagination had constructed, but another still, that which his jealous love, as inventive as any fantasy of mine, had so often depicted to him, that dwelling common to Odette and himself which had appeared so inaccessible once, on evenings when Odette had taken him home with Forcheville to drink orangeade with her; and what had flowed in to be absorbed, for him, in the walls and furniture of the dining-room in which we now sat down to luncheon was that unhoped-for paradise in which, in the old days, he could not without a pang imagine that he would one day be saying to their butler those very words, “Is Madame ready yet?” which I now heard him utter with a touch of impatience mingled with self-satisfaction. No more than, probably, Swann himself could I succeed in knowing my own happiness, and when Gilberte once broke out: “Who would ever have said that the little girl you watched playing prisoners’ base, without daring to speak to her, would one day be your greatest friend, and you would go to her house whenever you liked?” she spoke of a change the occurrence of which I could verify only by observing it from without, finding no trace of it within myself, for it was composed of two separate states on both of which I could not, without their ceasing to be distinct from one another, succeed in keeping my thoughts fixed at one and the same time

    And yet this house, because it had been so passionately desired by Swann, must have kept for him some of its attraction, if I was to judge by myself for whom it had not lost all its mystery. That singular charm in which I had for so long supposed the life of the Swanns to be bathed I had not completely exorcised from their house on making my own way into it; I had made it, that charm, recoil, overpowered as it must be by the sight of the stranger, the pariah that I had been, to whom now Mme. Swann pushed forward graciously for him to sit in it an armchair exquisite, hostile, scandalised; but all round me that charm, in my memory, I can still distinguish. Is it because, on those days on which M. and Mme. Swann invited me to luncheon, to go out afterwards with them and Gilberte, I imprinted with my gaze — while I sat waiting for them there alone — on the carpet, the sofas, the tables, the screens, the pictures, the idea engraved upon my mind that Mme. Swann, or her husband, or Gilberte was about to enter the room? Is it because those objects have dwelt ever since in my memory side by side with the Swanns, and have gradually acquired something of their personal character? Is it because, knowing that the Swanns passed their existence among all those things, I made of all of them as it were emblems of the private lives, of those habits of the Swanns from which I had too long been excluded for them not to continue to appear strange to me, even when I was allowed the privilege of sharing in them? However it may be, always when I think of that drawing-room which Swann (not that the criticism implied on his part any intention to find fault with his wife’s taste) found so incongruous — because, while it was still planned and carried out in the style, half conservatory, half studio, which had been that of the rooms in which he had first known Odette, she had, none the less, begun to replace in its medley a quantity of the Chinese ornaments, which she now felt to be rather gimcrack, a trifle dowdy, by a swarm of little chairs and stools and things upholstered in old Louis XIV silks; not to mention the works of art brought by Swann himself from his house on the Quai d’Orléans — it has kept in my memory, on the contrary, that composite, heterogeneous room, a cohesion, a unity, an individual charm never possessed even by the most complete, the least spoiled of such collections that the past has bequeathed to us, or the most modern, alive and stamped with the imprint of a living personality; for we alone can, by our belief that they have an existence of their own, give to certain of the things that we see a soul which they afterwards keep, which they develop in our minds. All the ideas that I had formed of the hours, different from those that exist for other men, passed by the Swanns in that house which was to their life what the body is to the soul, and must give expression to its singularity, all those ideas were rearranged, amalgamated — equally disturbing and indefinite throughout — in the arrangement of the furniture, the thickness of the carpets, the position of the windows, the ministrations of the servants. When, after luncheon, we went in the sunshine to drink our coffee in the great bay window of the drawing-room, while Mme. Swann was asking me how many lumps of sugar I took, it was not only the silk-covered stool which she pushed towards me that emitted, with the agonising charm that I had long ago felt — first among the pink hawthorn and then beside the clump of laurels — in the name of Gilberte, the hostility that her parents had shewn to me, which this little piece of furniture seemed to have so well understood, to have so completely shared that I felt myself unworthy, and found myself almost reluctant to set my feet on its defenceless cushion; a personality, a soul was latent there which linked it secretly to the light of two o’clock in the afternoon, so different from any other light, in the gulf in which there played about our feet its sparkling tide of gold out of which the bluish crags of sofas and vaporous carpet beaches emerged like enchanted islands; and there was nothing, even to the painting by Rubens hung above the chimney-piece, that was not endowed with the same quality and almost the same intensity of charm as the laced boots of M. Swann, and that hooded cape, the like of which I had so dearly longed to wear, whereas now Odette would beg her husband to go and put on another, so as to appear more smart, whenever I did them the honour of driving out with them. She too went away to change her dress — not heeding my protestations that no ‘outdoor’ clothes could be nearly so becoming as the marvellous garment of crêpe-de-Chine or silk, old rose, cherry-coloured, Tiepolo pink, white, mauve, green, red or yellow, plain or patterned, in which Mme. Swann had sat down to luncheon and which she was now going to take off. When I assured her that she ought to go out in that costume, she laughed, either in scorn of my ignorance or from delight in my compliment. She apologised for having so many wrappers, explaining that they were the only kind of dress in which she felt comfortable, and left us, to go and array herself in one of those regal toilets which imposed their majesty on all beholders, and yet among which I was sometimes summoned to decide which of them I preferred that she should put on

    In the Jardin d’Acclimatation, how proud I was when we had left the carriage to be walking by the side of Mme. Swann! While she strolled carelessly on, letting her cloak stream on the air behind her, I kept eyeing her with an admiring gaze to which she coquettishly responded in a lingering smile. And now, were we to meet one or other of Gilberte’s friends, boy or girl, who saluted us from afar, I would in my turn be looked upon by them as one of those happy creatures whose lot I had envied, one of those friends of Gilberte who knew her family and had a share in that other part of her life, the part which was not spent in the Champs-Elysées

    Often upon the paths of the Bois or the Jardin we passed, we were greeted by some great lady who was Swann’s friend, whom he perchance did not see, so that his wife must rally him with a “Charles! Don’t you see Mme. de Montmorency?” And Swann, with that amicable smile, bred of a long and intimate friendship, bared his head, but with a slow sweeping gesture, with a grace peculiarly his own. Sometimes the lady would stop, glad of an opportunity to shew Mme. Swann a courtesy which would involve no tiresome consequences, by which they all knew that she would never seek to profit, so thoroughly had Swann trained her in reserve. She had none the less acquired all the manners of polite society, and however smart, however stately the lady might be, Mme. Swann was invariably a match for her; halting for a moment before the friend whom her husband had recognised and was addressing, she would introduce us, Gilberte and myself, with so much ease of manner, would remain so free, so tranquil in her exercise of courtesy, that it would have been hard to say, looking at them both, which of the two was the aristocrat. The day on which we went to inspect the Cingalese, on our way home we saw coming in our direction, and followed by two others who seemed to be acting as her escort, an elderly but still attractive woman cloaked in a dark mantle and capped with a little bonnet tied beneath her chin with a pair of ribbons. “Ah! Here is someone who will interest you!” said Swann. The old lady, who had come within a few yards of us, now smiled at us with a caressing sweetness. Swann doffed his hat. Mme. Swann swept to the ground in a curtsey and made as if to kiss the hand of the lady, who, standing there like a Winterhalter portrait, drew her up again and kissed her cheek. “There, there; will you put your hat on, you!” she scolded Swann in a thick and almost growling voice, speaking like an old and familiar friend. “I am going to present you to Her Imperial Highness,” Mme. Swann whispered. Swann drew me aside for a moment while his wife talked of the weather and of the animals recently added to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, with the Princess. “That is the Princesse Mathilde,” he told me; “you know who’ I mean, the friend of Flaubert, Sainte-Beuve, Dumas. Just fancy, she’s the niece of Napoleon I. She had offers of marriage from Napoleon III and the Emperor of Russia. Isn’t that interesting? Talk to her a little. But I hope she won’t keep us standing here for an hour! . . . I met Taine the other day,” he went on, addressing the Princess, “and he told me that your Highness was vexed with him.” “He’s behaved like a perfect peeg!” she said gruffly, pronouncing the word cochon as though she referred to Joan of Arc’s contemporary, Bishop Cauchon. “After his article on the Emperor I left my card on him with p. p. c. on it.” I felt the surprise that one feels on opening the Correspondence of that Duchesse d’Orléans who was by birth a Princess Palatine. And indeed Princesse Mathilde, animated by sentiments so entirely French, expressed them with a straightforward bluntness that recalled the Germany of an older generation, and was inherited, doubtless, from her Wuerttemberg mother. This somewhat rude and almost masculine frankness she softened, as soon as she began to smile, with an Italian languor. And the whole person was clothed in a dress so typically ‘Second Empire’ that — for all that the Princess wore it simply and solely, no doubt, from attachment to the fashions that she had loved when she was young — she seemed to have deliberately planned to avoid the slightest discrepancy in historic colour, and to be satisfying the expectations of those who looked to her to evoke the memory of another age. I whispered to Swann to ask her whether she had known Musset. “Very slightly, sir,” was the answer, given in a tone which seemed to feign annoyance at the question, and of course it was by way of a joke that she called Swann ‘Sir,’ since they were intimate friends. “I had him to dine once. I had invited him for seven o’clock. At half-past seven, as he had not appeared, we sat down to dinner. He arrived at eight, bowed to me, took his seat, never opened his lips, went off after dinner without letting me hear the sound of his voice. Of course, he was dead drunk. That hardly encouraged me to make another attempt.” We were standing a little way off, Swann and I. “I hope this little audience is not going to last much longer,” he muttered, “the soles of my feet are hurting. I cannot think why my wife keeps on making conversation. When we get home it will be she that complains of being tired, and she knows I simply cannot go on standing like this.” For Mme. Swann, who had had the news from Mme. Bontemps, was in the course of telling the Princess that the Government, having at last begun to realise the depth of its depravity, had decided to send her an invitation to be present on the platform in a few days’ time, when the Tsar Nicholas was to visit the Invalides. But the Princess who, in spite of appearances, in spite of the character of her circle, which consisted mainly of artists and literary people, had remained at heart and shewed herself, whenever she had to take action, the niece of Napoleon, replied: “Yes, Madame, I received it this morning, and I sent it back to the Minister, who must have had it by now. I told him that I had no need of an invitation to go to the Invalides. If the Government desires my presence there, it will not be on the platform, it will be in our vault, where the Emperor’s tomb is. I have no need of a card to admit me there. I have my keys. I go in and out when I choose. The Government has only to let me know whether it wishes me to be present or not. But if I do go to the Invalides, it will be down below there or nowhere at all.” At that moment we were saluted, Mme. Swann and I, by a young man who greeted her without stopping, and whom I was not aware that she knew; it was Bloch. I inquired about him, and was told that he had been introduced to her by Mme. Bontemps, and that he was employed in the Minister’s secretariat, which was news to me. Anyhow, she could not have seen him often — or perhaps she had not cared to utter the name, hardly ‘smart’ enough for her liking, of Bloch, for she told me that he was called M. Moreul. I assured her that she was mistaken, that his name was Bloch. The Princess gathered up the train that flowed out behind her, while Mme. Swann gazed at it with admiring eyes. “It is only a fur that the Emperor of Russia sent me,” she explained, “and as I have just been to see him I put it on, so as to shew him that I’d managed to have it made up as a mantle.” “I hear that Prince Louis has joined the Russian Army; the Princess will be very sad at losing him,” went on Mme. Swann, not noticing her husband’s signals of distress. “That was a fine thing to do. As I said to him, ‘Just because there’s been a soldier, before, in the family, that’s no reason!’” replied the Princess, alluding with this abrupt simplicity to Napoleon the Great. But Swann could hold out no longer. “Ma’am, it is I that am going to play the Prince, and ask your permission to retire; but, you see, my wife has not been so well, and I do not like her to stand still for any time.” Mme. Swann curtseyed again, and the Princess conferred upon us all a celestial smile, which she seemed to have summoned out of the past, from among the graces of her girlhood, from the evenings at Compiègne, a smile which glided, sweet and unbroken, over her hitherto so sullen face; then she went on her way, followed by the two ladies in waiting, who had confined themselves, in the manner of interpreters, of children’s or invalids’ nurses, to punctuating our conversation with insignificant sentences and superfluous explanations. “You should go and write your name in her book, one day this week,” Mme. Swann counselled me. “One doesn’t leave cards upon these ‘Royalties,’ as the English call them, but she will invite you to her house if you put your name down.”

    Sometimes in those last days of winter we would go, before proceeding on our expedition, into one of the small picture-shows that were being given at that time, where Swann, as a collector of mark, was greeted with special deference by the dealers in whose galleries they were held. And in that still wintry weather the old longing to set out for the South of France and Venice would be reawakened in me by those rooms in which a springtime, already well advanced, and a blazing sun cast violet shadows upon the roseate Alpilles and gave the intense transparency of emeralds to the Grand Canal. If the weather were inclement, we would go to a concert or a theatre, and afterwards to one of the fashionable tearooms. There, whenever Mme. Swann had anything to say to me which she did not wish the people at the next table, or even the waiters who brought our tea, to understand, she would say it in English, as though that had been a secret language known to our two selves alone. As it happened everyone in the place knew English — I only had not yet learned the language, and was obliged to say so to Mme. Swann in order that she might cease to make, on the people who were drinking tea or were serving us with it, remarks which I guessed to be uncomplimentary without either my understanding or the person referred to losing a single word

    Once, in the matter of an afternoon at the theatre, Gilberte gave me a great surprise. It was precisely the day of which she had spoken to me some time back, on which fell the anniversary of her grandfather’s death. We were to go, she and I, with her governess, to hear selections from an opera, and Gilberte had dressed with a view to attending this performance, and wore the air of indifference with which she was in the habit of treating whatever we might be going to do, with the comment that it might be anything in the world, no matter what, provided that it amused me and had her parents’ approval. Before luncheon, her mother drew us aside to tell us that her father was vexed at the thought of our going to a theatre on that day. This seemed to me only natural. Gilberte remained impassive, but grew pale with an anger which she was unable to conceal; still she uttered not a word. When M. Swann joined us his wife took him to the other end of the room and said something in his ear. He called Gilberte, and they went together into the next room. We could hear their raised voices. And yet I could not bring myself to believe that Gilberte, so submissive, so loving, so thoughtful, would resist her father’s appeal, on such a day and for so trifling a matter. At length Swann reappeared with her, saying: “You heard what I said. Now you may do as you like.”

    Gilberte’s features remained compressed in a frown throughout luncheon, after which we retired to her room. Then suddenly, without hesitating and as though she had never at any point hesitated over her course of action: “Two o’clock!” she exclaimed. “You know the concert begins at half past.” And she told her governess to make haste

    “But,” I reminded her, “won’t your father be cross with you?”

    “Not the least little bit!”

    “Surely, he was afraid it would look odd, because of the anniversary.”

    “What difference can it make to me what people think? I think it’s perfectly absurd to worry about other people in matters of sentiment. We feel things for ourselves, not for the public. Mademoiselle has very few pleasures; she’s been looking forward to going to this concert. I am not going to deprive her of it just to satisfy public opinion.”

    “But, Gilberte,” I protested, taking her by the arm, “it is not to satisfy public opinion, it is to please your father.”

    “You are not going to pass remarks upon my conduct, I hope,” she said sharply, plucking her arm away

    * * *

    A favour still more precious than their taking me with them to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, the Swanns did not exclude me even from their friendship with Bergotte, which had been at the root of the attraction that I had found in them when, before I had even seen Gilberte, I reflected that her intimacy with that godlike elder would have made her, for me, the most passionately enthralling of friends, had not the disdain that I was bound to inspire in her forbidden me to hope that she would ever take me, in his company, to visit the towns that he loved. And lo, one day, came an invitation from Mme. Swann to a big luncheon-party. I did not know who else were to be the guests. On my arrival I was disconcerted, as I crossed the hall, by an alarming incident. Mme. Swann seldom missed an opportunity of adopting any of those customs which pass as fashionable for a season, and then, failing to find support, are speedily abandoned (as, for instance, many years before, she had had her ‘private hansom,’ or now had, printed in English upon a card inviting you to luncheon, the words, ‘To meet,’ followed by the name of some more or less important personage). Often enough these usages implied nothing mysterious and required no initiation. Take, for instance, a minute innovation of those days, imported from England; Odette had made her husband have some visiting cards printed on which the name Charles Swann was preceded by ‘Mr.’. After the first visit that I paid her, Mme. Swann had left at my door one of these ‘pasteboards,’ as she called them. No one had ever left a card on me before; I felt at once so much pride, emotion, gratitude that, scraping together all the money I possessed, I ordered a superb basket of camellias and had it sent to Mme. Swann. I implored my father to go and leave a card on her, but first, quickly, to have some printed on which his name should bear the prefix ‘Mr.’. He vouchsafed neither of my prayers; I was in despair for some days, and then asked myself whether he might not after all have been right. But this use of ‘Mr.,’ if it meant nothing, was at least intelligible. Not so with another that was revealed to me on the occasion of this luncheon-party, but revealed without any indication of its purport. At the moment when I was about to step from the hall into the drawing-room the butler handed me a thin, oblong envelope upon which my name was inscribed. In my surprise I thanked him; but I eyed the envelope with misgivings. I no more knew what I was expected to do with it than a foreigner knows what to do with one of those little utensils that they lay by his place at a Chinese banquet. I noticed that it was gummed down; I was afraid of appearing indiscreet, were I to open it then and there; and so I thrust it into my pocket with an air of knowing all about it. Mme. Swann had written to me a few days before, asking me to come to luncheon with ‘just a few people.’ There were, however, sixteen of us, among whom I never suspected for a moment that I was to find Bergotte. Mme. Swann, who had already ‘named’ me, as she called it, to several of her guests, suddenly, after my name, in the same tone that she had used in uttering it (in fact, as though we were merely two of the guests at her party, who ought each to feel equally flattered on meeting the other), pronounced that of the sweet Singer with the snowy locks. The name Bergotte made me jump like the sound of a revolver fired at me point blank, but instinctively, for appearance’s sake, I bowed; there, straight in front of me, as by one of those conjurers whom we see standing whole and unharmed, in their frock coats, in the smoke of a pistol shot out of which a pigeon has just fluttered, my salute was returned by a young common little thick-set peering person, with a red nose curled like a snail-shell and a black tuft on his chin. I was cruelly disappointed, for what had just vanished in the dust of the explosion was not only the feeble old man, of whom no vestige now remained; there was also the beauty of an immense work which I had contrived to enshrine in the frail and hallowed organism that I had constructed, like a temple, expressly for itself, but for which no room was to be found in the squat figure, packed tight with blood-vessels, bones, muscles, sinews, of the little man with the snub nose and black beard who stood before me. All the Bergotte whom I had slowly and delicately elaborated for myself, drop by drop, like a stalactite, out of the transparent beauty of his books, ceased (I could see at once) to be of any use, the moment I was obliged to include in him the snail-shell nose and to utilise the little black beard; just as we must reject as worthless the solution of a problem the terms of which we have not read in full, having failed to observe that the total must amount to a specified figure. The nose and beard were elements similarly ineluctable, and all the more aggravating in that, while forcing me to reconstruct entirely the personage of Bergotte, they seemed further to imply, to produce, to secrete incessantly a certain quality of mind, alert and self-satisfied, which was not in the picture, for such a mind had no connexion whatever with the sort of intelligence that was diffused throughout those books, so intimately familiar to me, which were permeated by a gentle and godlike wisdom. Starting from them, I should never have arrived at that snail-shell nose; but starting from the nose, which did not appear to be in the slightest degree ashamed of itself, but stood out alone there like a grotesque ornament fastened on his face, I must proceed in a diametrically opposite direction from the work of Bergotte, I must arrive, it would seem, at the mentality of a busy and preoccupied engineer, of the sort who when you accost him in the street thinks it correct to say: “Thanks, and you?” before you have actually inquired of them how they are, or else, if you assure them that you have been charmed to make their acquaintance, respond with an abbreviation which they imagine to be effective, intelligent and up-to-date, inasmuch as it avoids any waste of precious time on vain formalities: “Same here!” Names are, no doubt, but whimsical draughtsmen, giving us of people as well as of places sketches so little like the reality that we often experience a kind of stupor when we have before our eyes, in place of the imagined, the visible world (which, for that matter, is not the true world, our senses being little more endowed than our imagination with the art of portraiture, so little, indeed, that the final and approximately lifelike pictures which we manage to obtain of reality are at least as different from the visible world as that was from the imagined). But in Bergotte’s case, my preconceived idea of him from his name troubled me far less than my familiarity with his work, to which I was obliged to attach, as to the cord of a balloon, the man with the little beard, without knowing whether it would still have the strength to raise him from the ground. It seemed quite clear, however, that it really was he who had written the books that I had so greatly enjoyed, for Mme. Swann having thought it incumbent upon her to tell him of my admiration for one of these, he shewed no surprise that she should have mentioned this to him rather than to any other of the party, nor did he seem to regard her action as due to a misapprehension, but, swelling out the frock coat which he had put on in honour of all these distinguished guests with a body distended in anticipation of the coming meal, while his mind was completely occupied by other, more real and more important considerations, it was only as at some finished episode in his early life, as though one had made an illusion to a costume of the Duc de Guise which he had worn, one season, at a fancy dress ball, that he smiled as he bore his mind back to the idea of his books; which at once began to fall in my estimation (dragging down with them the whole value of Beauty, of the world, of life itself), until they seemed to have been merely the casual amusement of a man with a little beard. I told myself that he must have taken great pains over them, but that, if he had lived upon an island surrounded by beds of pearl-oysters, he would instead have devoted himself to, and would have made a fortune out of, the pearling trade. His work no longer appeared to me so inevitable. And then I asked myself whether originality did indeed prove that great writers were gods, ruling each one over a kingdom that was his alone, or whether all that was not rather make-believe, whether the differences between one man’s book and another’s were not the result of their respective labours rather than the expression of a radical and essential difference between two contrasted personalities

    Meanwhile we had taken our places at the table. By the side of my plate I found a carnation, the stalk of which was wrapped in silver paper. It embarrassed me less than the envelope that had been handed to me in the hall, which, however, I had completely forgotten. This custom, strange as it was to me, became more intelligible when I saw all the male guests take up the similar carnations that were lying by their plates and slip them into the buttonholes of their coats. I did as they had done, with the air of spontaneity that a free-thinker assumes in church, who is not familiar with the order of service but rises when everyone else rises and kneels a moment after everyone else is on his knees. Another usage, equally strange to me but less ephemeral, disquieted me more. On the other side of my plate was a smaller plate, on which was heaped a blackish substance which I did not then know to be caviare. I was ignorant of what was to be done with it but firmly determined not to let it enter my mouth

    Bergotte was sitting not far from me and I could hear quite well everything that he said. I understood then the impression that M. de Norpois had formed of him. He had indeed a peculiar ‘organ’; there is nothing that so much alters the material qualities of the voice as the presence of thought behind what one is saying; the resonance of one’s diphthongs, the energy of one’s labials are profoundly affected — in fact, one’s whole way of speaking. His seemed to me to differ entirely from his way of writing, and even the things that he said from those with which he filled his books. But the voice issues from behind a mask through which it is not powerful enough to make us recognise, at first sight, a face which we have seen uncovered in the speaker’s literary style. At certain pobts in the conversation, when Bergotte, by force of habit, began to talk in a way which no one but M. de Norpois would have thought affected or unpleasant, it was a long time before I discovered an exact correspondence with the parts of his books in which his form became so poetic and so musical. At those points I could see in what he was saying a plastic beauty independent of whatever his sentences might mean, and as human speech reflects the human soul, though without expressing it as does literary style, Bergotte appeared almost to be talking nonsense, intoning certain words and, if he were secretly pursuing, beneath them, a single image, stringing them together uninterruptedly on one continuous note, with a wearisome monotony. So that a pretentious, emphatic and monotonous opening was a sign of the rare aesthetic value of what he was saying, and an effect, in his conversation, of the same power which, in his books, produced that harmonious flow of imagery. I had had all the more difficulty in discovering this at first since what he said at such moments, precisely because it was the authentic utterance of Bergotte, had not the appearance of being Bergotte’s. It was an abundant crop of clearly defined ideas, not included in that ‘Bergotte manner’ which so many story-tellers had appropriated to themselves; and this dissimilarity was probably but another aspect — made out with difficulty through the stream of conversation, as an eclipse is seen through a smoked glass — of the fact that when one read a page of Bergotte it was never just what would have been written by any of those lifeless imitators who, nevertheless, in newspapers and in books, adorned their prose with so many ‘Bergottish’ images and ideas. This difference in style arose from the fact that what was meant by ‘Bergottism’ was, first and foremost, a priceless element of truth hidden in the heart of everything, whence it was extracted by that great writer, by virtue of his genius, and that this extraction, and not simply the perpetration of ‘Bergottisms,’ was my sweet Singer’s aim in writing. Though, it must be added, he continued to perpetrate them in spite of himself, and because he was Bergotte, so that, in one sense, every fresh beauty in his work was the little drop of Bergotte buried at the heart of a thing which he had distilled from it. But if, for that reason, each of those beauties was related to all the rest, and had a ‘family likeness,’ yet each remained separate and individual, as was the act of discovery that had brought it to the light of day; new, and consequently different from what was called the Bergotte manner, which was a loose synthesis of all the ‘Bergottisms’ already invented and set forth by him in writing, with no indication by which men who lacked genius might forecast what would be his next discovery. So it is with all great writers, the beauty of their language is as incalculable as that of a woman whom we have never seen; it is creative, because it is applied to an external object of which, and not of their language or its beauty, they are thinking, to which they have not yet given expression. An author of memorials of our time, wishing to write without too obviously seeming to be writing like Saint-Simon, might, on occasion, give us the first line of his portrait of Villars: “He was a rather tall man, dark . . . with an alert, open, expressive physiognomy,” but what law of determinism could bring him to the discovery of Saint-Simon’s next line, which begins with “and, to tell the truth, a trifle mad”? The true variety is in this abundance of real and unexpected elements, in the branch loaded with blue flowers which thrusts itself forward, against all reason, from the spring hedgerow that seemed already overcharged with blossoms, whereas the purely formal imitation of variety (and one might advance the same argument for all the other qualities of style) is but a barren uniformity, that is to say the very antithesis of variety, and cannot, in the work of imitators, give the illusion or recall other examples of variety save to a reader who has not acquired the sense of it from the masters themselves

    And so — just as Bergotte’s way of speaking would no doubt have been charming if he himself had been merely an amateur repeating imitations of Bergotte, whereas it was attached to the mind of Bergotte, at work and in action, by essential ties which the ear did not at once distinguish — so it was because Bergotte applied that mind with precision to the reality which pleased him that his language had in it something positive, something over-rich, disappointing those who expected to hear him speak only of the ‘eternal torrent of forms,’ and of the ‘mystic thrills of beauty.’ Moreover the quality, always rare and new, of what he wrote was expressed in his conversation by so subtle a manner of approaching a question, ignoring every aspect of it that was already familiar, that he appeared to be seizing hold of an unimportant detail, to be quite wrong about it, to be speaking in paradox, so that his ideas seemed as often as not to be in confusion, for each of us finds lucidity only in those ideas which are in the same state of confusion as his own. Besides, as all novelty depends upon the elimination, first, of the stereotyped attitude to which we have grown accustomed, and which has seemed to us to be reality itself, every new conversation, as well as all original painting and music, must always appear laboured and tedious. It is founded upon figures of speech with which we are not familiar, the speaker appears to us to be talking entirely in metaphors; and this wearies us, and gives us the impression of a want of truth. (After all, the old forms of speech must in their time have been images difficult to follow when the listener was not yet cognisant of the universe which they depicted. But he has long since decided that this must be the real universe, and so relies confidently upon it.) So when Bergotte — and his figures appear simple enough to-day — said of Cottard that he was a mannikin in a bottle, always trying to rise to the surface, and of Brichot that “to him even more than to Mme. Swann the arrangement of his hair was a matter for anxious deliberation, because, in his twofold preoccupation over his profile and his reputation, he had always to make sure that it was so brushed as to give him the air at once of a lion and of a philosopher,” one immediately felt the strain, and sought a foothold upon something which one called more concrete, meaning by that more ordinary. These unintelligible words, issuing from the mask that I had before my eyes, it was indeed to the writer whom I admired that they must be attributed, and yet they could not have been inserted among his books, in the form of a puzzle set in a series of different puzzles, they occupied another plane and required a transposition by means of which, one day, when I was repeating to myself certain phrases that I had heard Bergotte use, I discovered in them the whole machinery of his literary style, the different elements of which I was able to recognise and to name in this spoken discourse which had struck me as being so different

    >From a less immediate point of view the special way, a little too meticulous, too intense, that he had of pronouncing certain words, certain adjectives which were constantly recurring in his conversation, and which he never uttered without a certain emphasis, giving to each of their syllables a separate force and intoning the last syllable (as for instance the word visage, which he always used in preference to figure, and enriched with a number of superfluous v’s and s’s and g’s, which seemed all to explode from his outstretched palm at such moments) corresponded exactly to the fine passages in which, in his prose, he brought those favourite words into the light, preceded by a sort of margin and composed in such a way in the metrical whole of the phrase that the reader was obliged, if he were not to make a false quantity, to give to each of them its full value. And yet one did not find in the speech of Bergotte a certain luminosity which in his books, as in those of some other writers, often modified in the written phrase the appearance of its words. This was doubtless because that light issues from so profound a depth that its rays do not penetrate to our spoken words in the hours in which, thrown open to others by the act of conversation, we are to a certain extent closed against ourselves. In this respect, there were more intonations, there was more accent in his books than in his talk; an accent independent of the beauty of style, which the author himself has possibly not perceived, for it is not separable from his most intimate personality. It was this accent which, at the moments when, in his books, Bergotte was entirely natural, gave a rhythm to the words — often at such times quite insignificant — that he wrote. This accent is not marked on the printed page, there is nothing there to indicate it, and yet it comes of its own accord to his phrases, one cannot pronounce them in any other way, it is what was most ephemeral and at the same time most profound in the writer, and it is what will bear witness to his true nature, what will say whether, despite all the austerity that he has expressed he was gentle, despite all his sensuality sentimental

    Certain peculiarities of elocution, faint traces of which were to be found in Bergotte’s conversation, were not exclusively his own; for when, later on, I came to know his brothers and sisters, I found those peculiarities much more accentuated in their speech. There was something abrupt and harsh in the closing words of a light and spirited utterance, something faint and dying at the end of a sad one. Swann, who had known the Master as a boy, told me that in those days one used to hear on his lips, just as much as on his brothers’ and sisters’, those inflexions, almost a family type, shouts of violent merriment interspersed with murmurings of a long-drawn melancholy, and that in the room in which they all played together he used to perform his part, better than any of them, in their symphonies, alternately deafening and subdued. However characteristic it may be, the sound that escapes from human lips is fugitive and does not survive the speaker. But it was not so with the pronunciation of the Bergotte family. For if it is difficult ever to understand, even in the Meistersinger, how an artist can invent music by listening to the twittering of birds, yet Bergotte had transposed and fixed in his written language that manner of dwelling on words which repeat themselves in shouts of joy, or fall, drop by drop, in melancholy sighs. There are in his books just such closing phrases where the accumulated sounds are prolonged (as in the last chords of the overture of an opera which cannot come to an end, and repeats several times over its supreme cadence before the conductor finally lays down his baton), in which, later on, I was to find a musical equivalent for those phonetic ‘brasses’ of the Bergotte family. But in his own case, from the moment in which he transferred them to his books, he ceased instinctively to make use of them in his speech. From the day on which he had begun to write — all the more markedly, therefore, in the later years in which I first knew him — his voice had lost this orchestration for ever

    These young Bergottes — the future writer and his brothers and sisters — were doubtless in no way superior, far from it, to other young people, more refined, more intellectual than themselves, who found the Bergottes rather ‘loud that is to say a trifle vulgar, irritating one by the witticisms which characterised the tone, at once pretentious and puerile, of their household. But genius, and even what is only great talent, springs less from seeds of intellect and social refinement superior to those of other people than from the faculty of transposing, and so transforming them. To heat a liquid over an electric lamp one requires to have not the strongest lamp possible, but one of which the current can cease to illuminate, can be diverted so as instead of light to give heat. To mount the skies it is not necessary to have the most powerful of motors, one must have a motor which, instead of continuing to run along the earth’s surface, intersecting with a vertical line the horizontal which it began by following, is capable of converting its speed into ascending force. Similarly the men who produce works of genius are not those who live in the most delicate atmosphere, whose conversation is most brilliant or their culture broadest, but those who have had the power, ceasing in a moment to live only for themselves, to make use of their personality as of a mirror, m such a way that their life, however unimportant it may be socially, and even, in a sense, intellectually speaking, is reflected by it, genius consisting in the reflective power of the writer and not in the intrinsic quality of the scene reflected. The day on which young Bergotte succeeded in shewing to the world of his readers the tasteless household in which he had passed his childhood, and the not very amusing conversations between himself and his brothers, on that day he climbed far above the friends of his family, more intellectual and more distinguished than himself; they in their fine Rolls Royces might return home expressing due contempt for the vulgarity of the Bergottes; but he, with his modest engine which had at last left the ground, he soared above their heads

    But there were other characteristics of his elocution which it was not with the members of his family, but with certain contemporary writers, that he must share. Younger men, who were beginning to repudiate him as a master and disclaimed any intellectual affinity to him in themselves, displayed their affinity without knowing it when they made use of the same adverbs, the same prepositions that he incessantly repeated, when they constructed their sentences in the same way, spoke in the same quiescent, lingering tone, by a reaction from the eloquent, easy language of an earlier generation. Perhaps these young men — we shall come across some of whom this may be said — had never known Bergotte. But his way of thinking, inoculated into them, had led them to those alterations of syntax and of accent which bear a necessary relation to originality of mind. A relation which, incidentally, requires to be traced. Thus Bergotte, if he owed nothing to any man for his manner of writing, derived his manner of speaking from one of his early associates, a marvellous talker to whose ascendancy he had succumbed, whom he imitated, unconsciously, in his conversation, but who himself, being less gifted, had never written any really outstanding book. So that if one had been in quest of originality in speech, Bergotte must have been labelled a disciple, a writer at second-hand, whereas, influenced by his friend only so far as talk went, he had been original and creative in his writings. Doubtless again, so as to distinguish himself from the previous generation, too fond as it had been of abstractions, of weighty commonplaces, when Bergotte wished to speak favourably of a book, what he would bring into prominence, what he would quote with approval would always be some scene that furnished the reader with an image, some picture that had no rational significance. “Ah, yes!” he would exclaim, “it is quite admirable! There is a little girl in an orange shawl. It is excellent!” or again, “Oh, yes, there is a passage in which there is a regiment marching along the street; yes, it is excellent!” As for style, he was not altogether of his time (though he remained quite exclusively of his race, abominating Tolstoy, George Eliot, Ibsen and Dostoievsky), for the word that always came to his lips when he wished to praise the style of any writer was ‘mild.’ “Yes, you know I like Chateaubriand better in Atalathan in René; he seems to me to be ‘milder.’” He said the word like a doctor who, when his patient assures him that milk will give him indigestion, answers, “But, you know, it’s very ‘mild’.” And it is true that there was in Bergotte’s style a kind of harmony similar to that for which the ancients used to praise certain of their orators in terms which we now find it hard to understand, accustomed as we are to our own modern tongues in which effects of that kind are not sought

    He would say also, with a shy smile, of pages of his own for which some one had expressed admiration: “I think it is more or less true, more or less accurate; it may be of some value perhaps,” but he would say this simply from modesty, as a woman to whom one has said that her dress, or her daughter, is charming replies, “It is comfortable,” or “She is a good girl.” But the constructive instinct was too deeply implanted in Bergotte for him not to be aware that the sole proof that he had built usefully and on the lines of truth lay in the pleasure that his work had given, to himself first of all and afterwards to his readers. Only many years later, when he no longer had any talent, whenever he wrote anything with which he was not satisfied, so as not to have to suppress it, as he ought to have done, so as to be able to publish it with a clear conscience he would repeat, but to himself this time: “After all, it is more or less accurate, it must be of some value to the country.” So that the phrase murmured long ago among his admirers by the insincere voice of modesty came in the end to be whispered in the secrecy of his heart by the uneasy tongue of pride. And the same words which had served Bergotte as an unwanted excuse for the excellence of his earliest works became as it were an ineffective consolation to him for the hopeless mediocrity of the latest

    A kind of austerity of taste which he had, a kind of determination to write nothing of which he could not say that it was ‘mild,’ which had made people for so many years regard him as a sterile and precious artist, a chiseller of exquisite trifles, was on the contrary the secret of his strength, for habit forms the style of the writer just as much as the character of the man, and the author who has more than once been patient to attain, in the expression of his thoughts, to a certain kind of attractiveness, in so doing lays down unalterably the boundaries of his talent, just as if he yields too often to pleasure, to laziness, to the fear of being put to trouble, he will find himself describing in terms which no amount of revision can modify, the forms of his own vices and the limits of his virtue

    If, however, despite all the analogies which I was to perceive later on between the writer and the man, I had not at first sight, in Mme. Swann’s drawing-room, believed that this could be Bergotte, the author of so many divine books, who stood before me, perhaps I was not altogether wrong, for he himself did not, in the strict sense of the word, ‘believe’ it either. He did not believe it because he shewed a great assiduity in the presence of fashionable people (and yet he was not a snob), of literary men and journalists who were vastly inferior to himself. Of course he had long since learned, from the suffrage of his readers, that he had genius, compared to which social position and official rank were as nothing. He had learned that he had genius, but he did not believe it because he continued to simulate deference towards mediocre writers in order to succeed, shortly, in becoming an Academician, whereas the Academy and the Faubourg Saint-Germain have no more to do with that part of the Eternal Mind which is the author of the works of Bergotte than with the law of causality or the idea of God. That also he knew, but as a kleptomaniac knows, without profiting by the knowledge, that it is wrong to steal. And the man with the little beard and snail-shell nose knew and used all the tricks of the gentleman who pockets your spoons, in his efforts to reach the coveted academic chair, or some duchess or other who could dispose of several votes at the election, but while on his way to them he would endeavour to make sure that no one who would consider the pursuit of such an object a vice in him should see what he was doing. He was only half-successful; one could hear, alternating with the speech of the true Bergotte, that of the other Bergotte, ambitious, utterly selfish, who thought it not worth his while to speak of any but his powerful, rich or noble friends, so as to enhance his own position, he who in his books, when he was really himself, had so well portrayed the charm, pure as a mountain spring, of poverty

    As for those other vices to which M. de Norpois had alluded, that almost incestuous love, which was made still worse, people said, by a want of delicacy in the matter of money, if they contradicted, in a shocking manner, the tendency of his latest novels, in which he shewed everywhere a regard for what was right and proper so painfully rigid that the most innocent pleasures of their heroes were poisoned by it, and that even the reader found himself turning their pages with a sense of acute discomfort, and asked himself whether it was possible to go on living even the quietest of lives, those vices did not at all prove, supposing that they were fairly imputed to Bergotte, that his literature was a lie and all his sensitiveness mere play-acting. Just as in pathology certain conditions similar in appearance are due, some to an excess, others to an insufficiency of tension, of secretion and so forth, so there may be vice arising from supersensitiveness just as much as from the lack of it. Perhaps it is only in really vicious lives that the moral problem can arise in all its disquieting strength. And of this problem the artist finds a solution in the terms not of his own personal life but of what is for him the true life, a general, a literary solution. As the great Doctors of the Church began often, without losing their virtue, by acquainting themselves with the sins of all mankind, out of which they extracted their own personal sanctity, so great artists often, while being thoroughly wicked, make use of their vices in order to arrive at a conception of the moral law that is binding upon us all. It is the vices (or merely the weaknesses and follies) of the circle in which they live, the meaningless conversation, the frivolous or shocking lives of their daughters, the infidelity of their wives, or their own misdeeds that writers have most often castigated in their books, without, however, thinking it necessary to alter their domestic economy or to improve the tone of their households. And this contrast had never before been so striking as it was in Bergotte’s time, because, on the one hand, in proportion as society grew more corrupt, our notions of morality were increasingly exalted, while on the other hand the public were now told far more than they had ever hitherto known about the private lives of literary men; and on certain evenings in the theatre people would point out the author whom I had so greatly admired at Combray, sitting at the back of a box the mere composition of which seemed an oddly humorous, or perhaps keenly ironical commentary upon — a brazen-faced denial of — the thesis which he had just been maintaining in his latest book. Not that anything which this or that casual informant could tell me was of much use in helping me to settle the question of the goodness or wickedness of Bergotte. An intimate friend would furnish proofs of his hardheartedness; then a stranger would cite some instance (touching, since he had evidently wished it to remain hidden) of his real depth of feeling. He had behaved cruelly to his wife. But in a village inn, where he had gone to spend the night, he had stayed on to watch over a poor woman who had tried to drown herself, and when he was obliged to continue his journey had left a large sum of money with the landlord, so that he should not turn the poor creature out, but see that she got proper attention. Perhaps the more the great writer was developed in Bergotte at the expense of the little man with the beard, so much the more his own personal life was drowned in the flood of all the lives that he imagined, until he no longer felt himself obliged to perform certain practical duties, for which he had substituted the duty of imagining those other lives. But at the same time, because he imagined the feelings of others as completely as if they had been his own, whenever he was obliged, for any reason, to talk to some person who had been unfortunate (that is to say in a casual encounter) he would, in doing so, take up not his own personal standpoint but that of the sufferer himself, a standpoint in which he would have been horrified by the speech of those who continued to think of their own petty concerns in the presence of another’s grief. With the result that he gave rise everywhere to justifiable rancour and to undying gratitude

    Above all, he was a man who in his heart of hearts loved nothing really except certain images and (like a miniature set in the floor of a casket) the composing and painting of them in words. For a trifle that some one had sent him, if that trifle gave him the opportunity of introducing one or two of these images, he would be prodigal in the expression of his gratitude, while shewing none whatever for an expensive present. And if he had had to plead before a tribunal, he would inevitably have chosen his words not for the effect that they might have on the judge but with an eye to certain images which the judge would certainly never have perceived

    That first day on which I met him with Gilberte’s parents, I mentioned to Bergotte that I had recently been to hear Berma in Phèdre; and he told me that in the scene in which she stood with her arm raised to the level of her shoulder — one of those very scenes that had been greeted with such applause — she had managed to suggest with great nobility of art certain classical figures which, quite possibly, she had never even seen, a Hesperid carved in the same attitude upon a metope at Olympia, and also the beautiful primitive virgins on the Erechtheum

    “It may be sheer divination, and yet I fancy that she visits the museums. It would be interesting to ‘establish’ that.” (‘Establish’ was one of those regular Bergotte expressions, and one which various young men who had never met him had caught from him, speaking like him by some sort of telepathic suggestion.)

    “Do you mean the Cariatides?” asked Swann

    “No, no,” said Bergotte, “except in the scene where she confesses her passion to Oenone, where she moves her hand exactly like Hegeso on the stele in the Ceramic, it is a far more primitive art that she revives. I was referring to the Korai of the old Erechtheum, and I admit that there is perhaps nothing quite so remote from the art of Racine, but there are so many things already in Phèdre, . . . that one more . . . Oh, and then, yes, she is really charming, that little sixth century Phaedra, the rigidity of the arm, the lock of hair ‘frozen into marble,’ yes, you know, it is wonderful of her to have discovered all that. There is a great deal more antiquity in it than in most of the books they are labelling ‘antique’ this year.”

    As Bergotte had in one of his volumes addressed a famous invocation to these archaic statues, the words that he was now uttering were quite intelligible to me and gave me a fresh reason for taking an interest in Berma’s acting. I tried to picture her again in my mind, as she had looked in that scene in which I remembered that she had raised her arm to the level of her shoulder. And I said to myself, “There we have the Hesperid of Olympia; there we have the sister of those adorable suppliants on the Acropolis; there is indeed nobility in art!” But if these considerations were to enhance for me the beauty of Berma’s gesture, Bergotte should have put them into my head before the performance. Then, while that attitude of the actress was actually existing in flesh and blood before my eyes, at that moment in which the thing that was happening had still the substance of reality, I might have tried to extract from it the idea of archaic sculpture. But of Berma in that scene all that I retained was a memory which was no longer liable to modification, slender as a picture which lacks that abundant perspective of the present tense where one is free to delve and can always discover something new, a picture to which one cannot retrospectively give a meaning that is not subject to verification and correction from without. At this point Mme. Swann joined in the conversation, asking me whether Gilberte had remembered to give me what Bergotte had written aboutPhèdre, and adding, “My daughter is such a scatter-brain!” Bergotte smiled modestly and protested that they were only a few pages, of no importance. “But it is perfectly charming, that little pamphlet, that little ‘tract’ of yours!” Mme. Swann assured him, to shew that she was a good hostess, to make the rest of us think that she had read Bergotte’s essay, and also because she liked not merely to flatter Bergotte, but to make a selection for herself out of what he wrote, to control his writing. And it must be admitted that she did inspire him, though not in the way that she supposed. But when all is said there is, between what constituted the smartness of Mme. Swann’s drawing-room and a whole side of Bergotte’s work, so close a correspondence that either of them might serve among elderly men to-day, as a commentary upon the other

    I let myself go in telling him what my impressions had been. Often Bergotte disagreed, but he allowed me to go on talking. I told him that I had liked the green light which was turned on when Phaedra raised her arm. “Ah! The designer will be glad to hear that; he is a real artist. I shall tell him you liked it, because he is very proud of that effect. I must say, myself, that I do not care for it very much, it drowns everything in a sort of aqueous vapour, little Phaedra standing there looks too like a branch of coral on the floor of an aquarium. You will tell me, of course, that it brings out the cosmic aspect of the play. That is quite true. All the same, it would be more appropriate if the scene were laid in the Court of Neptune. Oh yes, of course, I know the Vengeance of Neptune does come into the play. I don’t suggest for a moment that we should think only of Port-Royal, but after all the story that Racine tells us is not the ‘Loves of the Sea-Urchins.’ Still, it is what my friend wished to have, and it is very well done, right or wrong, and it’s really quite pretty when you come to look at it. Yes, so you liked that, did you; you understood what it meant, of course; we feel the same about it, don’t we, really; it is a trifle unbalanced, what he’s done, you agree with me, but on the whole it is very clever of him.” And so, when Bergotte had to express an opinion which was the opposite of my own, he in no way reduced me to silence, to the impossibility of framing any reply, as M. de Norpois would have done. This does not prove that Bergotte’s opinions were of less value than the Ambassador’s; far from it. A powerful idea communicates some of its strength to him who challenges it. Being itself a part of the riches of the universal Mind, it makes its way into, grafts itself upon the mind of him whom it is employed to refute, slips in among the ideas already there, with the help of which, gaining a little ground, he completes and corrects it; so that the final utterance is always to some extent the work of both parties to a discussion. It is to ideas which are not, properly speaking, ideas at all, to ideas which, founded upon nothing, can find no support, no kindred spirit among the ideas of the adversary, that he, grappling with something which is not there, can find no word to say in answer. The arguments of M. de Norpois (in the matter of art) were unanswerable simply because they were without reality

    Since Bergotte did not sweep aside my objections, I confessed to him that they had won the scorn of M. de Norpois. “But he’s an old parrot!” was the answer. “He keeps on pecking you because he imagines all the time that you’re a piece of cake, or a slice of cuttle-fish.” “What’s that?” asked Swann. “Are you a friend of Norpois?” “He’s as dull as a wet Sunday,” interrupted his wife, who had great faith in Bergotte’s judgment, and was no doubt afraid that M. de Norpois might have spoken ill of her to us. “I tried to make him talk after dinner; I don’t know if it’s his age or his indigestion, but I found him too sticky for words. I really thought I should have to ‘dope’ him.” “Yes, isn’t he?” Bergotte chimed in. “You see, he has to keep his mouth shut half the time so as not to use up all the stock of inanities that hold his shirt-front down and his white waistcoat up.” “I think that Bergotte and my wife are both very hard on him,” came from Swann, who took the ‘line,’ in his own house, of a plain, sensible man. “I quite see that Norpois cannot interest you very much, but from another point of view,” (for Swann made a hobby of collecting scraps of ‘real life’) “he is quite remarkable, quite a remarkable instance of a lover. When he was Secretary at Rome,” he went on, after making sure that Gilberte could not hear him, “he had, here in Paris, a mistress with whom he was madly in love, and he found time to make the double journey every week, so as to see her for a couple of hours. She was, as it happens, a most intelligent woman, and is quite attractive to this day; she is a dowager now. And he has had any number of others since then. I’m sure I should have gone stark mad if the woman I was in love with lived in Paris and I was kept shut up in Rome. Nervous men ought always to love, as the lower orders say, ‘beneath’ them, so that their women have a material inducement to do what they tell them.” As he spoke, Swann realised that I might be applying this maxim to himself and Odette, and as, even among superior beings, at the moment when you and they seem to be soaring together above the plane of life, their personal pride is still basely human, he was seized by a violent ill-will towards me. But this was made manifest only in the uneasiness of his glance. He said nothing more to me at the time. Not that this need surprise us. When Racine (according to a story the truth of which has been exploded, though the theme of it may be found recurring every day in Parisian life) made an illusion to Scarron in front of Louis XIV, the most powerful monarch on earth said nothing to the poet that evening. It was on the following day, only, that he fell

    But as a theory requires to be stated as a whole, Swann, after this momentary irritation, and after wiping his eyeglass, finished saying what was in his mind in these words, words which were to assume later on in my memory the importance of a prophetic warning, which I had not had the sense to take: “The danger of that kind of love, however, is that the woman’s subjection calms the man’s jealousy for a time but also makes it more exacting. After a little he will force his mistress to live like one of those prisoners whose cells they keep lighted day and night, to prevent their escaping. And that generally ends in trouble.”

    I reverted to M. de Norpois. “You must never trust him; he has the most wicked tongue!” said Mme. Swann in an accent which seemed to me to indicate that M. de Norpois had been ‘saying things’ about her, especially as Swann looked across at his wife with an air of rebuke, as though to stop her before she went too far

    Meanwhile Gilberte, who had been told to go and get ready for our drive, stayed to listen to the conversation, and hovered between her mother and her father, leaning affectionately against his shoulder. Nothing, at first sight, could be in greater contrast to Mme. Swann, who was dark, than this child with her red hair and golden skin. But after looking at them both for a moment one saw in Gilberte many of the features — for instance, the nose cut short with a sharp, unfaltering decision by the unseen sculptor whose chisel repeats its work upon successive generations — the expression, the movements of her mother; to take an illustration from another form of art, she made one think of a portrait that was not a good likeness of Mme. Swann, whom the painter, to carry out some whim of colouring, had posed in a partial disguise, dressed to go out to a party in Venetian ‘character.’ And as not merely was she wearing a fair wig, but every atom of a swarthier complexion had been discharged from her flesh which, stripped of its veil of brownness, seemed more naked, covered simply in rays of light shed by an internal sun, this ‘make-up’ was not just superficial but was incarnate in her; Gilberte had the appearance of embodying some fabulous animal or of having assumed a mythological disguise. This reddish skin was so exactly that of her father that nature seemed to have had, when Gilberte was being created, to solve the problem of how to reconstruct Mme. Swann piecemeal, without any material at her disposal save the skin of M. Swann. And nature had utilised this to perfection, like a master carver who makes a point of leaving the grain, the knots of his wood in evidence. On Gilberte’s face, at the corner of a perfect reproduction of Odette’s nose, the skin was raised so as to preserve intact the two beauty spots of M. Swann. It was a new variety ot Mme. Swann that was thus obtained, growing there by her side like a white lilac-tree beside a purple. At the same time it did not do to imagine the boundary line between these two likenesses as definitely fixed. Now and then, when Gilberte smiled, one could distinguish the oval of her father’s cheek upon her mother’s face, as though some one had mixed them together to see what would result from the blend; this oval grew distinct, as an embryo grows into a living shape, it lengthened obliquely, expanded, and a moment later had disappeared. In Gilberte’s eyes there was the frank and honest gaze of her father; this was how she had looked at me when she gave me the agate marble and said, “Keep it, to remind yourself of our friendship.” But were one to put a question to Gilberte, to ask her what she had been doing, then one saw in those same eyes the embarrassment, the uncertainty, the prevarication, the misery that Odette used in the old days to shew, when Swann asked her where she had been and she gave him one of those lying answers which, in those days, drove the lover to despair and now made him abruptly change the conversation, as an incurious and prudent husband. Often in the Champs-Elysées I was disturbed by seeing this look on Gilberte’s face. But as a rule my fears were unfounded. For in her, a purely physical survival of her mother, this look (if nothing else) had ceased to have any meaning. It was when she had been to her classes, when she must go home for some lesson, that Gilberte’s pupils executed that movement which, in time past, in the eyes of Odette, had been caused by the fear of disclosing that she had, during the day, opened the door to one of her lovers, or was — at that moment in a hurry to be at some trysting-place. So one could see the two natures of M. and Mme. Swann ebb and flow, encroaching alternately one upon the other in the body of this Mélusine

    It is, of course, common knowledge that a child takes after both its-father and its mother. And yet the distribution of the merits and defects which it inherits is so oddly planned that, of two good qualities which seemed inseparable in one of the parents you will find but one in the child, and allied to that very fault in the other parent which seemed most irreconcilable with it. Indeed, the incarnation of a good moral quality in an incompatible physical blemish is often one of the laws of filial resemblance. Of two sisters, one will combine with the proud bearing of her father the mean little soul of her mother; the other, abundantly endowed with the paternal intelligence, will present it to the world in the aspect which her mother has made familiar; her mother’s shapeless nose and scraggy bosom are become the bodily covering of talents which you had learned to distinguish beneath a superb presence. With the result that of each of the sisters one can say with equal justification that it is she who takes more after one or other of her parents. It is true that Gilberte was an only child, but there were, at the least, two Gilbertes. The two natures, her father’s and her mother’s, did more than just blend themselves in her; they disputed the possession of her — and yet one cannot exactly say that, which would let it be thought that a third Gilberte was in the meantime suffering by being the prey of the two others. Whereas Gilberte was alternately one and the other, and at any given moment no more than one of the two, that is to say incapable, when she was not being good, of suffering accordingly, the better Gilberte not being able at the time, on account of her momentary absence, to detect the other’s lapse from virtue. And so the less good of the two was free to enjoy pleasures of an ignoble kind. When the other spoke to you from the heart of her father, she held broad views, you would have liked to engage with her upon a fine and beneficent enterprise; you told her so, but, just as your arrangements were being completed, her mother’s heart would already have resumed its control; hers was the voice that answered; and you were disappointed and vexed — almost baffled, as in the face of a substitution of one person for another — by an unworthy thought, an insincere laugh, in which Gilberte saw no harm, for they sprang from what she herself at that moment was. Indeed, the disparity was at times so great between these two Gilbertes that you asked yourself, though without finding an answer, what on earth you could have said or done to her, last time, to find her now so different. When she herself had arranged to meet you somewhere, not only did she fail to appear, and offer no excuse afterwards, but, whatever the influence might have been that had made her change her mind, she shewed herself in so different a character when you did meet her that you might well have supposed that, taken in by a likeness such as forms the plot of theMenaechmi, you were now talking to some one not the person who had so politely expressed her desire to see you, had she not shewn signs of an ill-humour which revealed that she felt herself to be in the wrong, and wished to avoid the necessity of an explanation

    “Now then, run along and get ready; you’re keeping us waiting,” her mother reminded her

    “I’m so happy here with my little Papa; I want to stay just for a minute,” replied Gilberte, burying her head beneath the arm of her father, who passed his fingers lovingly through her bright hair

    Swann was one of those men who, having lived for a long time amid the illusions of love, have seen the prosperity that they themselves brought to numberless women increase the happiness of those women without exciting in them any gratitude, any tenderness towards their benefactors; but in their child they believe that they can feel an affection which, being incarnate in their own name, will enable them to remain in the world after their death. When there should no longer be any Charles Swann, there would still be a Mlle. Swann, or a Mme. something-else, néeSwann, who would continue to love the vanished father. Indeed, to love him too well, perhaps, Swann may have been thinking, for he acknowledged Gilberte’s caress with a “Good girl!” in that tone, made tender by our apprehension, to which, when we think of the future, we are prompted by the too passionate affection of a creature who is destined to survive us. To conceal his emotion, he joined in our talk about Berma. He pointed out to me, but in a detached, a listless tone, as though he wished to remain to some extent unconcerned in what he was saying, with what intelligence, with what an astonishing fitness the actress said to Oenone, “You knew it!” He was right. That intonation at least had a value that was really intelligible, and might therefore have satisfied my desire to find incontestable reasons for admiring Berma. But it was by the very fact of its clarity that it did not at all content me. Her intonation was so ingenious, so definite in intention and in its meaning, that it seemed to exist by itself, so that any intelligent actress might have learned to use it. It was a fine idea; but whoever else should conceive it as fully must possess it equally. It remained to Berma’s credit that she had discovered it, but is one entitled to use the word ‘discover’ when the object in question is something that would not be different if one had been given it, something that does not belong essentially to one’s own nature seeing that some one else may afterwards reproduce it?

    “Upon my soul, your presence among us does raise the tone of the conversation!” Swann observed to me, as though to excuse himself to Bergotte; for he had formed the habit, in the Guermantes set, of entertaining great artists as if they were just ordinary friends whom one seeks only to make eat the dishes that they like, play the games, or, in the country, indulge in whatever form of sport they please. “It seems to me that we’re talking a great deal of art,” he went on. “But it’s so nice, I do love it!” said Mme. Swann, throwing me a look of gratitude, as well from good nature as because she had not abandoned her old aspirations towards a more intellectual form of conversation. After this it was to others of the party, and principally to Gilberte, that Bergotte addressed himself. I had told him everything that I felt with a freedom which had astonished me, and was due to the fact that, having acquired with him, years before (in the course of all those hours of solitary reading, in which he was to me merely the better part of myself), the habit of sincerity, of frankness, of confidence, I was less frightened by him than by a person with whom I should have been talking for the first time. And yet, for the same reason, I was greatly disturbed by the thought of the impression that I must have been making on him, the contempt that I had supposed he would feel for my ideas dating not from that afternoon but from the already distant time in which I had begun to read his books in our garden at Combray. And yet I ought perhaps to have reminded myself that, since it was in all sincerity, abandoning myself to the train of my thoughts, that I had felt, on the one hand, so intensely in sympathy with the work of Bergotte and on the other hand, in the theatre, a disappointment the reason of which I did not know, those two instinctive movements which had both carried me away could not be so very different from one another, but must be obedient to the same laws; and that that mind of Bergotte which I had loved in his books could not be anything entirely foreign and hostile to my disappointment and to my inability to express it. For my intelligence must be a uniform thing, perhaps indeed there exists but a single intelligence, in which everyone in the world participates, towards which each of us from the position of his own separate body turns his eyes, as in a theatre where, if everyone has his own separate seat, there is on the other hand but a single stage. Of course, the ideas which I was tempted to seek to disentangle were probably not those whose depths Bergotte usually sounded in his books. But if it were one and the same intelligence which we had, he and I, at our disposal, he must, when he heard me express those ideas, be reminded of them, cherish them, smile upon them, keeping probably, in spite of what I supposed, before his mind’s eye a whole world of intelligence other than that an excerpt of which had passed into his books, an excerpt upon which I had based my imagination of his whole mental universe. Just as priests, having the widest experience of the human heart, are best able to pardon the sins which they do not themselves commit, so genius, having the widest experience of the human intelligence, can best understand the ideas most directly in opposition to those which form the foundation of its own writings. I ought to have told myself all this (though, for that matter, it was none too consoling a thought, for the benevolent condescension of great minds has as a corollary the incomprehension and hostility of small; and one derives far less happiness from the friendliness of a great writer, which one finds expressed, failing a more intimate association, in his books, than suffering from the hostility of a woman whom one did not choose for her intelligence but cannot help loving). I ought to have told myself all this, but I did not; I was convinced that I had appeared a fool to Bergotte, when Gilberte whispered in my ear:

    “You can’t think how delighted I am, because you have made a conquest of my great friend Bergotte. He’s been telling Mamma that he found you extremely intelligent.”

    “Where are we going?” I asked her. “Oh, wherever you like; you know, it’s all the same to me.” But since the incident that had occurred on the anniversary of her grandfather’s death I had begun to ask myself whether Gilberte’s character was not other than I had supposed, whether that indifference to what was to be done, that wisdom, that calm, that gentle and constant submission did not indeed conceal passionate longings which her self-esteem would not allow to be visible and which she disclosed only by her sudden resistance whenever by any chance they were frustrated. As Bergotte lived in the same neighbourhood as my parents, we left the house together; in the carriage he spoke to me of my health. “Our friends were telling me that you had been ill. I am very sorry. And yet, after all, I am not too sorry, because I can see quite well that you are able to enjoy the pleasures of the mind, and they are probably what mean most to you, as to everyone who has known them.”

    Alas, what he was saying, how little, I felt, did it apply to myself, whom all reasoning, however exalted it might be, left cold, who was happy only in moments of pure idleness, when I was comfortable and well; I felt how purely material was everything that I desired in life, and how easily I could dispense with the intellect. As I made no distinction among my pleasures between those that came to me from different sources, of varying depth and permanence, I was thinking, when the moment came to answer him, that I should have liked an existence in which I was on intimate terms with the Duchesse de Guermantes, and often came across, as in the old toll-house in the Champs-Elysées, a chilly smell that would remind me of Combray. But in this ideal existence which I dared not confide to him the pleasures of the mind found no place

    “No, sir, the pleasures of the mind count for very little with me; it is not them that I seek after; indeed I don’t even know that I have ever tasted them.”

    “You really think not?” he replied. “Well, it may be, no, wait a minute now, yes, after all that must be what you like best, I can see it now clearly, I am certain of it.”

    As certainly, he did not succeed in convincing me; and yet I was already feeling happier, less restricted. After what M. de Norpois had said to me, I had regarded my moments of dreaming, of enthusiasm, of self-confidence as purely subjective and barren of truth. But according to Bergotte, who appeared to understand my case, it seemed that it was quite the contrary, that the symptom I ought to disregard was, in fact, my doubts, my disgust with myself. Moreover, what he had said about M. de Norpois took most of the sting out of a sentence from which I had supposed that no appeal was possible

    “Are you being properly looked after?” Bergotte asked me. “Who is treating you?” I told him that I had seen, and should probably go on seeing, Cottard. “But that’s not at all the sort of man you want!” he told me. “I know nothing about him as a doctor. But I’ve met him at Mme. Swann’s. The man’s an imbecile. Even supposing that that doesn’t prevent his being a good doctor, which I hesitate to believe, it does prevent his being a good doctor for artists, for men of intelligence. People like you must have suitable doctors, I would almost go so far as to say treatment and medicines specially adapted to themselves. Cottard will bore you, and that alone will prevent his treatment from having any effect. Besides, the proper course of treatment cannot possibly be the same for you as for any Tom, Dick or Harry. Nine tenths of the ills from which intelligent people suffer spring from their intellect. They need at least a doctor who understands their disease. How do you expect that Cottard should be able to treat you, he has made allowances for the difficulty of digesting sauces, for gastric trouble, but he has made no allowance for the effect of reading Shakespeare. So that his calculations are inaccurate in your case, the balance is upset; you see, always the little bottle-imp bobbing up again. He will find that you have a dilated stomach; he has no need to examine you for it, since he has it already in his eye. You can see it there, reflected in his glasses.” This manner of speaking tired me greatly; I said to myself, with the stupidity of common sense: “There is no more any dilated stomach reflected in Professor Cottard’s glasses than there are inanities stored behind the white waistcoat of M. de Norpois.” “I should recommend you, instead,” went on Bergotte, “to consult Dr. du Boulbon, who is quite an intelligent man.” “He is a great admirer of your books,” I replied. I saw that Bergotte knew this, and I decided that kindred spirits soon come together, that one has few really ‘unknown friends.’ What Bergotte had said to me with respect to Cottard impressed me, while running contrary to everything that I myself believed. I was in no way disturbed by finding my doctor a bore; I expected of him that, thanks to an art the laws of which were beyond me, he should pronounce on the subject of my health an infallible oracle, after consultation of my entrails. And I did not at all require that, with the aid of an intellect, in which I easily outstripped him, he should seek to understand my intellect, which I pictured to myself merely as a means, of no importance in itself, of trying to attain to certain external verities. I doubted greatly whether intellectual people required a different form of hygiene from imbeciles, and I was quite prepared to submit myself to the latter kind. “I’ll tell you who does need a good doctor, and that is our friend Swann,” said Bergotte. And on my asking whether he was ill, “Well, don’t you see, he’s typical of the man who has married a whore, and has to swallow a hundred serpents every day, from women who refuse to meet his wife, or men who were there before him. You can see them in his mouth, writhing. Just look, any day you’re there, at the way he lifts his eyebrows when he comes in, to see who’s in the room.” The malice with which Bergotte spoke thus to a stranger of the friends in whose house he had so long been received as a welcome guest was as new to me as the almost amorous tone which, in that house, he had constantly been adopting to speak to them. Certainly a person like my great-aunt, for instance, would have been incapable of treating any of us with that politeness which I had heard Bergotte lavishing upon Swann. Even to the people whom she liked, she enjoyed saying disagreeable things. But behind their backs she would never have uttered a word to which they might not have listened. There was nothing less like the social ‘world’ than our society at Combray. The Swanns’ house marked a stage on the way towards it, towards its inconstant tide. If they had not yet reached the open sea, they were certainly in the lagoon. “This is all between ourselves,” said Bergotte as he left me outside my own door. A few years later I should have answered: “I never repeat things.” That is the ritual phrase of society, from which the slanderer always derives a false reassurance. It is what I should have said then and there to Bergotte, for one does not invent all one’s speeches, especially when one is acting merely as a card in the social pack. But I did not yet know the formula. What my great-aunt, on the other hand, would have said on a similar occasion was: “If you don’t wish it to be repeated, why do you say it?” That is the answer of the unsociable, of the quarrelsome. I was nothing of that sort: I bowed my head in silence

    Men of letters who were in my eyes persons of considerable importance had had to plot for years before they succeeded in forming with Bergotte relations which continued to the end to be but dimly literary, and never emerged beyond the four walls of his study, whereas I, I had now been installed among the friends of the great writer, at the first attempt and without any effort, like a man who, instead of standing outside in a crowd for hours in order to secure a bad seat in a theatre, is shewn in at once to the best, having entered by a door that is closed to the public. If Swann had thus opened such a door to me, it was doubtless because, just as a king finds himself naturally inviting his children’s friends into the royal box, or on board the royal yacht, so Gilberte’s parents received their daughter’s friends among all the precious things that they had in their house, and the even more precious intimacies that were enshrined there. But at that time I thought, and perhaps was right in thinking, that this friendliness on Swann’s part was aimed indirectly at my parents. I seemed to remember having heard once at Combray that he had suggested to them that, in view of my admiration for Bergotte, he should take me to dine with him, and that my parents had declined, saying that I was too young, and too easily excited to ‘go out’ yet. My parents, no doubt, represented to certain other people (precisely those who seemed to me the most marvellous) something quite different from what they were to me, so that, just as when the lady in pink had paid my father a tribute of which he had shewn himself so unworthy, I should have wished them to understand what an inestimable present I had just received, and to testify their gratitude to that generous and courteous Swann who had offered it to me, or to them rather, without seeming any more to be conscious of its value than is, in Luini’s fresco, the charming Mage with the arched nose and fair hair, to whom, it appeared, Swann had at one time been thought to bear a striking resemblance

    Unfortunately, this favour that Swann had done me, which, as I entered the house, before I had even taken off my greatcoat, I reported to my parents, in the hope that it would awaken in their hearts an emotion equal to my own, and would determine them upon some immense and decisive act of politeness towards the Swanns, did not appear to be greatly appreciated by them. “Swann introduced you to Bergotte? An excellent friend for you, charming society!” cried my father, ironically. “It only wanted that!” Alas, when I had gone on to say that Bergotte was by no means inclined to admire M. de Norpois:

    “I dare say!” retorted my father. “That simply proves that he’s a foolish and evil-minded fellow. My poor boy, you never had much common sense, still, I’m sorry to see you fall among a set that will finish you off altogether.”

    Already the mere fact of my frequenting the Swanns had been far from delighting my parents. This introduction to Bergotte seemed to them a fatal but natural consequence of an original mistake, namely their own weakness in controlling me, which my grandfather would have called a ‘want of circumspection.’ I felt that I had only, in order to complete their ill humour, to tell them that this perverse fellow who did not appreciate M. de Norpois had found me extremely intelligent. For I had observed that whenever my father decided that anyone, one of my school friends for instance, was going astray — as I was at that moment — if that person had the approval of somebody whom my father did not rate high, he would see in this testimony the confirmation of his own stern judgment. The evil merely seemed to him more pronounced. I could hear him already exclaiming, “Of course, it all hangs together,” an expression that terrified me by the vagueness and vastness of the reforms the introduction of which into my quiet life it seemed to threaten. But since, were I not to tell them what Bergotte had said of me, even then nothing could efface the impression my parents had formed, that this should be made slightly worse mattered little. Besides, they seemed to me so unfair, so completely mistaken, that not only had I not any hope, I had scarcely any desire to bring them to a more equitable point of view. At the same time, feeling, as the words came from my lips, how alarmed they would be by the thought that I had found favour in the sight of a person who dismissed clever men as fools and had earned the contempt of all decent people, praise from whom, since it seemed to me a thing to be desired, would only encourage me in wrongdoing, it was in faltering tones and with a slightly shamefaced air that, coming to the end of my story, I flung them the bouquet of: “He told the Swanns that he had found me extremely intelligent.” Just as a poisoned dog, in a field, rushes, without knowing why, straight to the grass which is the precise antidote to the toxin that he has swallowed, so I, without in the least suspecting it, had said the one thing in the world that was capable of overcoming in my parents this prejudice with respect to Bergotte, a prejudice which all the best reasons that I could have urged, all the tributes that I could have paid him, must have proved powerless to defeat. Instantly the situation changed

    “Oh! He said that he found you intelligent,” repeated my mother. “I am glad to hear that, because he is a man of talent.”

    “What! He said that, did he?” my father joined in. “I don’t for a moment deny his literary distinction, before which the whole world bows; only it is a pity that he should lead that scarcely reputable existence to which old Norpois made a guarded allusion, when he was here,” he went on, not seeing that against the sovran virtue of the magic words which I had just repeated the depravity of Bergotte’s morals was little more able to contend than the falsity of his judgment

    But, my dear,” Mamma interrupted, “we’ve no proof that it’s true. People say all sorts of things. Besides M. de Norpois may have the most perfect manners in the world, but he’s not always very good-natured, especially about people who are not exactly his sort.”

    “That’s quite true; I’ve noticed it myself,” my father admitted

    “And then, too, a great deal ought to be forgiven Bergotte, since he thinks well of my little son,” Mamma went on, stroking my hair with her fingers and fastening upon me a long and pensive gaze

    My mother had not, indeed, awaited this verdict from Bergotte before telling me that I might ask Gilberte to tea whenever I had friends coming. But I dared not do so for two reasons. The first was that at Gilberte’s there was never anything else to drink but tea. Whereas at home Mamma insisted on there being a pot of chocolate as well. I was afraid that Gilberte might regard this as ‘common’; and so conceive a great contempt for us. The other reason was a formal difficulty, a question of procedure which I could never succeed in settling. When I arrived at Mme. Swann’s she used to ask me: “And how is your mother?” I had made several overtures to Mamma to find out whether she would do the same when Gilberte came to us, a point which seemed to me more serious than, at the Court of Louis XIV, the use of ‘Monseigneur.’ But Mamma would not hear of it for a moment

    “Certainly not. I do not know Mme. Swann.”

    “But neither does she know you.”

    “I never said she did, but we are not obliged to behave in exactly the same way about everything. I shall find other ways of being civil to Gilberte than Mme. Swann has with you.”

    But I was unconvinced, and preferred not to invite Gilberte

    Leaving my parents, I went upstairs to change my clothes and on emptying my pockets came suddenly upon the envelope which the Swanns’ butler had handed me before shewing me into the drawing-room. I was now alone. I opened it; inside was a card on which I was told the name of the lady whom I ought to have ‘taken in’ to luncheon

    It was about this period that Bloch overthrew my conception of the world and opened for me fresh possibilities of happiness (which, for that matter, were to change later on into possibilities of suffering), by assuring me that, in contradiction of all that I had believed at the time of my walks along the Méséglise way, women never asked for anything better than to make love. He added to this service a second, the value of which I was not to appreciate until much later; it was he who took me for the first time into a disorderly house. He had indeed told me that there were any number of pretty women whom one might enjoy. But I could see them only in a vague outline for which those houses were to enable me to substitute actual human features. So that if I owed to Bloch — for his ‘good tidings’ that beauty and the enjoyment of beauty were not inaccessible things, and that we have acted foolishly in renouncing them for all time — a debt of gratitude of the same kind that we owe to an optimistic physician or philosopher who has given us reason to hope for length of days in this world and not to be entirely cut off from it when we shall have passed beyond the veil, the houses of assignation which I began to frequent some years later — by furnishing me with specimens of beauty, by allowing me to add to the beauty of women that element which we are powerless to invent, which is something more than a mere summary of former beauties, that present indeed divine, the one present that we cannot bestow upon ourselves, before which faint and fail all the logical creations of our intellect, and which we can seek from reality alone: an individual charm — deserved to be ranked by me with those other benefactors more recent in origin but of comparable utility (before finding which we used to imagine without any warmth the seductive charms of Mantegna, of Wagner, of Siena, by studying other painters, hearing other composers, visiting other cities): namely illustrated editions of the history of painting, symphonic concerts and handbooks to ‘Mediaeval Towns.’ But the house to which Bloch led me (and which he himself, for that matter, had long ceased to visit), was of too humble a grade, its denizens were too inconspicuous and too little varied to be able to satisfy my old or to stimulate new curiosities. The mistress of this house knew none of the women with whom one asked her to negotiate, and was always suggesting others whom one did not want. She boasted to me of one in particular, one of whom, with a smile full of promise (as though this had been a great rarity and a special treat) she would whisper: “She is a Jewess! Doesn’t that make you want to?” (That, by the way, was probably why the girl’s name was Rachel.) And with a silly and affected excitement which, she hoped, would prove contagious, and which ended in a hoarse gurgle, almost of sensual satisfaction: “Think of that, my boy, a Jewess! Wouldn’t that be lovely? Rrrr!” This Rachel, of whom I caught a glimpse without her seeing me, was dark and not good looking, but had an air of intelligence, and would pass the tip of her tongue over her lips as she smiled, with a look of boundless impertinence, at the ‘boys’ who were introduced to her and whom I could hear making conversation. Her small and narrow face was framed in short curls of black hair, irregular as though they were outlined in pen-strokes upon a wash-drawing in Indian ink. Every evening I promised the old woman who offered her to me with a special insistence, boasting of her superior intelligence and her education, that I would not fail to come some day on purpose to make the acquaintance of Rachel, whom I had nicknamed “Rachel when from the Lord.” But the first evening I had heard her, as she was leaving the house, say to the mistress: “That’s settled then; I shall be free to-morrow, if you have anyone you won’t forget to send for me.”

    And these words had prevented me from recognising her as a person because they had made me classify her at once in a general category of women whose habit, common to all of them, was to come there in the evening to see whether there might not be a louis or two to be earned. She would simply vary her formula, saying indifferently: “If you want me” or “If you want anybody.”

    The mistress, who was not familiar with Halévy’s opera, did not know why I always called the girl “Rachel when from the Lord.” But failure to understand a joke has never yet made anyone find it less amusing, and it was always with a whole-hearted laugh that she would say to me:

    “Then there’s nothing doing to-night? When am I going to fix you up with ‘Rachel when from the Lord’? Why do you always say that, ‘Rachel when from the Lord’? Oh, that’s very smart, that is. I’m going to make a match of you two. You won’t be sorry for it, you’ll see.”

    Once I was just making up my mind, but she was ‘in the press,’ another time in the hands of the hairdresser, an elderly gentleman who never did anything for the women except pour oil on their loosened hair and then comb it. And I grew tired of waiting, even though several of the humbler frequenters of the place (working girls, they called themselves, but they always seemed to be out of work), had come to mix drinks for me and to hold long conversations to which, despite the gravity of the subjects discussed, the partial or total nudity of the speakers gave an attractive simplicity. I ceased moreover to go to this house because, anxious to present a token of my good-will to the woman who kept it and was in need of furniture, I had given her several pieces, notably a big sofa, which I had inherited from my aunt Léonie. I used never to see them, for want of space had prevented my parents from taking them in at home, and they were stored in a warehouse. But as soon as I discovered them again in the house where these women were putting them to their own uses, all the virtues that one had imbibed in the air of my aunt’s room at Combray became apparent to me, tortured by the cruel contact to which I had abandoned them in their helplessness! Had I outraged the dead, I should not have suffered such remorse. I returned no more to visit their new mistress, for they seemed to me to be alive, and to be appealing to me, like those objects, apparently inanimate, in a Persian fairy-tale, in which are embodied human souls that are undergoing martyrdom and plead for deliverance. Besides, as our memory presents things to us, as a rule, not in their chronological sequence but as it were by a reflexion in which the order of the parts is reversed, I remembered only long afterwards that it was upon that same sofa that, many years before, I had tasted for the first time the sweets of love with one of my girl cousins, with whom I had not known where to go until she somewhat rashly suggested our taking advantage of a moment in which aunt Léonie had left her room

    A whole lot more of my aunt Léonie’s things, and notably a magnificent set of old silver plate, I sold, in spite of my parents’ warnings, so as to have more money to spend, and to be able to send more flowers to Mme. Swann who would greet me, after receiving an immense basket of orchids, with: “If I were your father, I should have you up before the magistrate for this.” How was I to suppose that one day I might regret more than anything the loss of my silver plate, and rank certain other pleasures more highly than that (which would have shrunk perhaps into none at all) of bestowing favours upon Gilberte’s parents. Similarly, it was with Gilberte in my mind, and so as not to be separated from her, that I had decided not to enter a career of diplomacy abroad. It is always thus, impelled by a state of mind which is destined not to last, that we make our irrevocable decisions. I could scarcely imagine that that strange substance which was housed in Gilberte, and from her permeated her parents and her home, leaving me indifferent to all things else, could be liberated from her, could migrate into another person. The same substance, unquestionable, and yet one that would have a wholly different effect on me. For a single malady goes through various evolutions, and a delicious poison can no longer be taken with the same impunity when, with the passing of the years, the heart’s power of resistance has diminished

    My parents meanwhile would have liked to see the intelligence that Bergotte had discerned in me made manifest in some remarkable achievement. When I still did not know the Swanns I thought that I was prevented from working by the state of agitation into which I was thrown by the impossibility of seeing Gilberte when I chose. But, now that their door stood open to me, scarcely had I sat down at my desk than I would rise and run to them. And after I had left them and was at home again, my isolation was only apparent, my mind was powerless to swim against the stream of words on which I had allowed myself mechanically to be borne for hours on end. Sitting alone, I continued to fashion remarks such as might have pleased or amused the Swanns, and to make this pastime more entertaining I myself took the parts of those absent players, I put to myself imagined questions, so chosen that my brilliant epigrams served merely as happy answers to them. Though conducted in silence, this exercise was none the less a conversation and not a meditation, my solitude a mental society in which it was not I myself but other imaginary speakers who controlled my choice of words, and in which I felt as I formulated, in place of the thoughts that I believed to be true, those that came easily to my mind, and involved no introspection from without, that kind of pleasure, entirely passive, which sitting still affords to anyone who is burdened with a sluggish digestion

    Had I been less firmly resolved upon setting myself definitely to work, I should perhaps have made an effort to begin at once. But since my resolution was explicit, since within twenty-four hours, in the empty frame of that long morrow in which everything was so well arranged because I myself had not yet entered it, my good intentions would be realised without difficulty, it was better not to select an evening on which I was ill-disposed for a beginning for which the following days were not, alas, to shew themselves any more propitious. But I was reasonable. It would have been puerile, on the part of one who had waited now for years, not to put up with a postponement of two or three days. Confident that by the day after next I should have written several pages, I said not a word more to my parents of my decision; I preferred to remain patient for a few hours and then to bring to a convinced and comforted grandmother a sample of work that was already under way. Unfortunately the morrow was not that vast, external day to which I in my fever had looked forward. When it drew to a close, my laziness and my painful struggle to overcome certain internal obstacles had simply lasted twenty-four hours longer. And at the end of several days, my plans not having matured, I had no longer the same hope that they would be realised at once, no longer the courage, therefore, to subordinate everything else to their realisation: I began again to keep late hours, having no longer, to oblige me to go to bed early on any evening, the certain hope of seeing my work begun next morning. I needed, before I could recover my creative energy, several days of relaxation, and the only time that my grandmother ventured, in a gentle and disillusioned tone, to frame the reproach: “Well, and that work of yours; aren’t we even to speak of it now?” I resented her intrusion, convinced that in her inability to see that my mind was irrevocably made up, she had further and perhaps for a long time postponed the execution of my task, by the shock which her denial of justice to me had given my nerves, since until I had recovered from that shock I should not feel inclined to begin my work. She felt that her scepticism had charged blindly into my intention. She apologised, kissing me: “I am sorry; I shall not say anything again,” and, so that I should not be discouraged, assured me that, from the day on which I should be quite well again, the work would come of its own accord from my superfluity of strength

    Besides, I said to myself, in spending all my time with the Swanns, am I not doing exactly what Bergotte does? To my parents it seemed almost as though, idle as I was, I was leading, since it was spent in the same drawing-room with a great writer, the life most favourable to the growth of talent. And yet the assumption that anyone can be dispensed from having to create that talent for himself, from within himself, and can acquire it from some one else, is as impossible as it would be to suppose that a man can keep himself in good health, in spite of neglecting all the rules of hygiene and of indulging in the worst excesses, merely by dining out often in the company of a physician. The person, by the way, who was most completely taken in by this illusion, which misled me as well as my parents, was Mme. Swann. When I explained to her that I was unable to come, that I must stay at home and work, she looked as though she were thinking that I made a great fuss about nothing, that there was something foolish as well as ostentatious in what I had said

    “But Bergotte is coming, isn’t he? Do you mean that you don’t think it good, what he writes? It will be better still, very soon,” she went on, “for he is more pointed, he concentrates more in newspaper articles than in his books, where he is apt to spread out too much. I’ve arranged that in future he’s to do the leading articles in the Figaro. He’ll be distinctly the ‘right man in the right place’ there.” And, finally, “Come! He will tell you, better than anyone, what you ought to do.”

    And so, just as one invites a gentleman ranker to meet his colonel, it was in the interests of my career, and as though masterpieces of literature arose out of ‘getting to know” people, that she told me not to fail to come to dinner with her next day, to meet Bergotte

    And so there was not from the Swanns any more than from my parents, that is to say from those who, at different times, had seemed bound to place obstacles in my way, any further opposition to that pleasant existence in which I might see Gilberte as often as I chose, with enjoyment if not with peace of mind. There can be no peace of mind in love, since the advantage one has secured is never anything but a fresh starting-point for further desires. So long as I had not been free to go to her, having my eyes fixed upon that inaccessible goal of happiness, I could not so much as imagine the fresh grounds for anxiety that lay in wait for me there. Once the resistance of her parents was broken, and the problem solved at last, it began to set itself anew, and always in different terms. Each evening, on arriving home, I reminded myself that I had things to say to Gilberte of prime importance, things upon which our whole friendship hung, and these things were never the same. But at least I was happy, and no further menace arose to threaten my happiness. One was to appear, alas, from a quarter in which I had never detected any peril, namely from Gilberte and myself. And yet I ought to have been tormented by what, on the contrary, reassured me, by what I mistook for happiness. We are, when we love, in an abnormal state, capable of giving at once to an accident, the most simple to all appearance and one that may at any moment occur, a serious-aspect which that accident by itself would not bear. What makes us so happy is the presence in our heart of an unstable element which we are perpetually arranging to keep in position, and of which we cease almost to be aware so long as it is not displaced. Actually, there is in love a permanent strain of suffering which happiness neutralises, makes conditional only, procrastinates, but which may at any moment become what it would long since have been had we not obtained what we were seeking, sheer agony

    On several occasions I felt that Gilberte was anxious to put off my visits. It is true that when I was at all anxious to see her I had only to get myself invited by her parents who were increasingly persuaded of my excellent influence over her. “Thanks to them,” I used to think, “my love is running no risk; the moment I have them on my side, I can set my mind at rest; they have full authority over Gilberte.” Until, alas, I detected certain signs of impatience which she allowed to escape her when her father made me come to the house, almost against her will, and asked myself whether what I had regarded as a protection for my happiness was not in fact the secret reason why that happiness could not endure

    The last time that I called to see Gilberte, it was raining; she had been asked to a dancing lesson in the house of some people whom she knew too slightly to be able to take me there with her. In view of the dampness of the air I had taken rather more caffeine than usual. Perhaps on account of the weather, or because she had some objection to the house in which this party was being given, Mme. Swann, as her daughter was leaving the room, called her back in the sharpest of tones: “Gilberte!” and pointed to me, to indicate that I had come there to see her and that she ought to stay with me. This ‘Gilberte!’ had been uttered, or shouted rather, with the best of intentions towards myself, but from the way in which Gilberte shrugged her shoulders as she took off her outdoor clothes I divined that her mother had unwittingly hastened the gradual evolution, which until then it had perhaps been possible to arrest, which was gradually drawing away from me my friend. “You don’t need to go out dancing every day,” Odette told her daughter, with a sagacity acquired, no doubt, in earlier days, from Swann. Then, becoming once more Odette, she began speaking to her daughter in English. At once it was as though a wall had sprung up to hide from me a part of the life of Gilberte, as though an evil genius had spirited my friend far away. In a language that we know, we have substituted for the opacity of sounds, the perspicuity of ideas. But a language which we do not know is a fortress sealed, within whose walls she whom we love is free to play us false, while we, standing without, desperately alert in our impotence, can see, can prevent nothing. So this conversation in English, at which, a month earlier, I should merely have smiled, interspersed with a few proper names in French which did not fail to accentuate, to give a point to my uneasiness, had, when conducted within a few feet of me by two motionless persons, the same degree of cruelty, left me as much abandoned and alone as the forcible abduction of my companion. At length Mme. Swann left us. That day, perhaps from resentment against myself, the unwilling cause of her not going out to enjoy herself, perhaps also because, guessing her to be angry with me, I was precautionally colder than usual with her, the face of Gilberte, divested of every sign of joy, bleak, bare, pillaged, seemed all afternoon to be devoting a melancholy regret to the pas-de-quatre in which my arrival had prevented her from going to take part, and to be defying every living creature, beginning with myself, to understand the subtle reasons that had determined in her a sentimental attachment to the boston. She confined herself to exchanging with me, now and again, on the weather, the increasing violence of the rain, the fastness of the clock, a conversation punctuated with silences and monosyllables, in which I lashed myself on, with a sort of desperate rage, to the destruction of those moments which we might have devoted to friendship and happiness. And on each of our remarks was stamped, as it were, a supreme harshness, by the paroxysm of their stupefying unimportance, which at the same time consoled me, for it prevented Gilberte from being taken in by the banality of my observations and the indifference of my tone. In vain was my polite: “I thought, the other day, that the clock was slow, if anything”; she evidently understood me to mean: “How tiresome you are being!” Obstinately as I might protract, over the whole length of that rain-sodden afternoon, the dull cloud of words through which no fitful ray shone, I knew that my coldness was not so unalterably fixed as I pretended, and that Gilberte must be fully aware that if, after already saying it to her three times, I had hazarded a fourth repetition of the statement that the evenings were drawing in, I should have had difficulty in restraining myself from bursting into tears. When she was like that, when no smile filled her eyes or unveiled her face, I cannot describe the devastating monotony that stamped her melancholy eyes and sullen features. Her face, grown almost livid, reminded me then of those dreary beaches where the sea, ebbing far out, wearies one with its faint shimmering, everywhere the same, fixed in an immutable and low horizon. At length, as I saw no sign in Gilberte of the happy change for which I had been waiting now for some hours, I told her that she was not being nice. “It is you that are not being nice,” was her answer. “Oh, but surely ——!” I asked myself what I could have done, and, finding no answer, put the question to her. “Naturally, you think yourself nice!” she said to me with a laugh, and went on laughing. Whereupon I felt all the anguish that there was for me in not being able to attain to that other, less perceptible, plane of her mind which her laughter indicated. It seemed, that laughter, to mean: “No, no, I’m not going to let myself be moved by anything that you say, I know you’re madly in love with me, but that leaves me neither hot nor cold, for I don’t care a rap for you.” But I told myself that, after all, laughter was not a language so well defined that I could be certain of understanding what this laugh really meant. And Gilberte’s words were affectionate. “But how am I not being nice?” I asked her. “Tell me; I will do anything you want.” “No; that wouldn’t be any good. I can’t explain.” For a moment I was afraid that she thought that I did not love her, and this was for me a fresh agony, no less keen, but one that required treatment by a different conversational method. “If you knew how much you were hurting me you would tell me.” But this pain which, had she doubted my love for her, must have rejoiced her, seemed instead to make her more angry. Then, realising my mistake, making up my mind to pay no more attention to what she said, letting her (without bothering to believe her) assure me: “I do love you, indeed I do; you will see one day,” (that day on which the guilty are convinced that their innocence will be made clear, and which, for some mysterious reason, never happens to be the day on which their evidence is taken), I had the courage to make a sudden resolution not to see her again, and without telling her of it yet since she would not have believed me

    Grief that is caused one by a person with whom one is in love can be bitter, even when it is interpolated among preoccupations, occupations, pleasures in which that person is not directly involved and from which our attention is diverted only now and again to return to it. But when such a grief has its birth — as was now happening — at a moment when the happiness of seeing that person fills us to the exclusion of all else, the sharp depression that then affects our spirits, sunny hitherto, sustained and calm, lets loose in us a raging tempest against which we know not whether we are capable of struggling to the end. The tempest that was blowing in my heart was so violent that I made my way home baffled, battered, feeling that I could recover my breath only by retracing my steps, by returning, upon whatever pretext, into Gilberte’s presence. But she would have said to herself: “Back again! Evidently I can go to any length with him; he will come back every time, and the more wretched he is when he leaves me the more docile he’ll be.” Besides, I was irresistibly drawn towards her in thought, and those alternative orientations, that mad careering between them of the compass-needle within me, persisted after I had reached home, and expressed themselves in the mutually contradictory letters to Gilberte which I began to draft

    I was about to pass through one of those difficult crises which we generally find that we have to face at various stages in life, and which, for all that there has been no change in our character, in our nature (that nature which itself creates our loves, and almost creates the women whom we love, even to their faults), we do not face in the same way on each occasion, that is to say at every age. At such moments our life is divided, and so to speak distributed over a pair of scales, in two counterpoised pans which between them contain it all. In one there is our desire not to displease, not to appear too humble to the creature whom we love without managing to understand her, but whom we find it more convenient at times to appear almost to disregard, so that she shall not have that sense of her own indis-pensability which may turn her from us; in the other scale there is a feeling of pain — and one that is not localised and partial only — which cannot be set at rest unless, abandoning every thought of pleasing the woman and of making her believe that we can dispense with her, we go at once to find her. When we withdraw from the pan in which our pride lies a small quantity of the will-power which we have weakly allowed to exhaust itself with increasing age, when we add to the pan that holds our suffering a physical pain which we have acquired and have let grow, then, instead of the courageous solution that would have carried the day at one-and-twenty, it is the other, grown too heavy and insufficiently balanced, that crushes us down at fifty. All the more because situations, while repeating them-.selves, tend to alter, and there is every likelihood that, in middle life or in old age, we shall have had the grim satisfaction of complicating our love by an intrusion of habit which adolescence, repressed by other demands upon it, less master of itself, has never known

    I had just written Gilberte a letter in which I allowed the tempest of my wrath to thunder, not however without throwing her the lifebuoy of a few words disposed as though by accident on the page, by clinging to which my friend might be brought to a reconciliation; a moment later, the wind having changed, they were phrases full of love that I addressed to her, chosen for the sweetness of certain forlorn expressions, those ‘nevermores’ so touching to those who pen them, so wearisome to her who will have to read them, whether she believe them to be false and translate ‘nevermore’ by ‘this very evening, if you want me,’ or believe them to be true and so to be breaking the news to her of one of those final separations which make so little difference to our lives when the other person is one with whom we are not in love. But since we are incapable, while we are in love, of acting as fit predecessors of the next persons whom we shall presently have become, and who will then be in love no longer, how are we to imagine the actual state of mind of a woman whom, even when we are conscious that we are of no account to her, we have perpetually represented in our musings as uttering, so as to lull us into a happy dream or to console us for a great sorrow, the same speeches that she would make if she loved us. When we come to examine the thoughts, the actions of a woman whom we love, we are as completely at a loss as must have been, face to face with the phenomena of nature, the world’s first natural philosophers, before their science had been elaborated and had cast a ray of light over the unknown. Or, worse still, we are like a person in whose mind the law of causality barely exists, a person who would be incapable, therefore, of establishing any connexion between one phenomenon and another, to whose eyes the spectacle of the world would appear unstable as a dream. Of course I made efforts to emerge from this incoherence, to find reasons for things. I tried even to be ‘objective’ and, to that end, to bear well in mind the disproportion that existed between the importance which Gilberte had in my eyes and that, not only which I had in hers, but which she herself had in the eyes of other people, a disproportion which, had I failed to remark it, would have involved my mistaking mere friendliness on my friend’s part for a passionate avowal, and a grotesque and debasing display on my own for the simple and graceful movement with which we are attracted towards a pretty face. But I was afraid also of falling into the contrary error, in which I should have seen in Gilberte’s unpunctuality in keeping an appointment an irremediable hostility. I tried to discover between these two perspectives, equally distorting, a third which would enable me to see things as they really were; the calculations I was obliged to make with that object helped to take my mind off my sufferings; and whether in obedience to the laws of arithmetic or because I had made them give me the answer that I desired, I made up my mind that next day I would go to the Swanns’, happy, but happy in the same way as people who, having long been tormented by the thought of a journey which they have not wished to make, go no farther than to the station and return home to unpack their boxes. And since, while one is hesitating, the bare idea of a possible resolution (unless one has rendered that idea sterile by deciding that one will make no resolution) develops, like a seed in the ground, the lineaments, every detail of the emotions that will be born from the performance of the action, I told myself that it had been quite absurd of me to be as much hurt by the suggestion that I should not see Gilberte again as if I had really been about to put that suggestion into practice, and that since, on the contrary, I was to end by returning to her side, I might have saved myself the expense of all those vain longings and painful acceptances. But this resumption of friendly relations lasted only so long as it took me to reach the Swanns’; not because their butler, who was really fond of me, told me that Gilberte had gone out (a statement the truth of which was confirmed, as it happened, the same evening, by people who had seen her somewhere), but because of the manner in which he said it. “Sir, the young lady is not at home; I can assure you, sir, that I am speaking the truth. If you wish to make any inquiries I can fetch the young lady’s maid. You know very well, sir, that I would do everything in my power to oblige you, and that if the young lady was at home I would take you to her at once.” These words being of the only kind that is really important, that is to say spontaneous, the kind that gives us a radiograph shewing the main points, at any rate, of the unimaginable reality which would be wholly concealed beneath a prepared speech, proved that in Gilberte’s household there was an impression that I bothered her with my visits; and so, scarcely had the man uttered them before they had aroused in me a hatred of which I preferred to make him rather than Gilberte the victim; he drew upon his own head all the angry feelings that I might have had for my friend; freed from these complications, thanks to his words, my love subsisted alone; but his words had, at the same time, shewn me that I must cease for the present to attempt to see Gilberte. She would be certain to write to me, to apologise. In spite of which, I should not return at once to see her, so as to prove to her that I was capable of living without her. Besides, once I had received her letter, Gilberte’s society was a thing with which I should be more easily able to dispense for a time, since I should be certain of finding her ready to receive me whenever I chose. All that I needed in order to support with less pain the burden of a voluntary separation was to feel that my heart was rid of the terrible uncertainty whether we were not irreconcilably sundered, whether she had not promised herself to another, left Paris, been taken away by force. The days that followed resembled the first week of that old New Year which I had had to spend alone, without Gilberte. But when that week had dragged to its end, then for one thing my friend would be coming again to the Champs-Elysées, I should be seeing her as before; I had been sure of that; for another thing, I had known with no less certainty that so long as the New Year holidays lasted it would not be worth my while to go to the Champs-Elysées, which meant that during that miserable week, which was already ancient history, I had endured my wretchedness with a quiet mind because there was blended in it neither fear nor hope. Now, on the other hand, it was the latter of these which, almost as much as my fear of what might happen, rendered intolerable the burden of my grief. Not having had any letter from Gilberte that evening, I had attributed this to her carelessness, to her other occupations, I did not doubt that I should find something from her in the morning’s post. This I awaited, every day, with a beating heart which subsided, leaving me utterly prostrate, when I had found in it only letters from people who were not Gilberte, or else nothing at all, which was no worse, the proofs of another’s friendship making all the more cruel those of her indifference. I transferred my hopes to the afternoon post. Even between the times at which letters were delivered I dared not leave the house, for she might be sending hers by a messenger. Then, the time coming at last when neither the postman nor a footman from the Swanns’ could possibly appear that night, I must procrastinate my hope of being set at rest, and thus, because I believed that my sufferings were not destined to last, I was obliged, so to speak, incessantly to renew them. My disappointment was perhaps the same, but instead of just uniformly prolonging, as in the old days, an initial emotion, it began again several times daily, starting each time with an emotion so frequently renewed that it ended — it, so purely physical, so instantaneous a state — by becoming stabilised, so consistently that the strain of waiting having hardly time to relax before a fresh reason for waiting supervened, there was no longer a single minute in the day in which I was not in that state of anxiety which it is so difficult to bear even for an hour. So my punishment was infinitely more cruel than in those New Year holidays long ago, because this time there was in me, instead of the acceptance, pure and simple, of that punishment, the hope, at every moment, of seeing it come to an end. And yet at this state of acceptance I ultimately arrived; then I understood that it must be final, and I renounced Gilberte for ever, in the interests of my love itself and because I hoped above all that she would not retain any contemptuous memory of me. Indeed, from that moment, so that she should not be led to suppose any sort of lover’s spite on my part, when she made appointments for me to see her I used often to accept them and then, at the last moment, write to her that I was prevented from coming, but with the same protestations of my disappointment that I should have made to anyone whom I had not wished to see. These expressions of regret, which we keep as a rule for people who do not matter, would do more, I imagined, to persuade Gilberte of my indifference than would the tone of indifference which we affect only to those whom we love. When, better than by mere words, by a course of action indefinitely repeated, I should have proved to her that I had no appetite for seeing her, perhaps she would discover once again an appetite for seeing me. Alas! I was doomed to failure; to attempt, by ceasing to see her, to reawaken in her that inclination to see me was to lose her for ever; first of all, because, when it began to revive, if I wished it to last I must not give way to it at once; besides, the most agonising hours would then have passed; it was at this very moment that she was indispensable to me, and I should have liked to be able to warn her that what presently she would have to assuage, by the act of seeing me again, would be a grief so far diminished as to be no longer (what a moment ago it would still have been), nor the thought of putting an end to it, a motive towards surrender, reconciliation, further meetings. And then again, later on, when I should at last be able safely to confess to Gilberte (so far would her liking for me have regained its strength) my liking for her, the latter, not having been able to resist the strain of so long a separation, would have ceased to exist; Gilberte would have become immaterial to me. I knew this, but I could not explain it to her; she would have assumed that if I was pretending that I should cease to love her if I remained for too long without seeing her, that was solely in order that she might summon me back to her at once. In the meantime, what made it easier for me to sentence myself to this separation was the fact that (in order to make it quite clear to her that despite my protestations to the contrary it was my own free will and not any conflicting engagement, not the state of my health that prevented me from seeing her), whenever I knew beforehand that Gilberte would not be in the house, was going out somewhere with a friend and would not be home for dinner, I went to see Mme. Swann who had once more become to me what she had been at the time when I had such difficulty in seeing her daughter and (on days when the latter was not coming to the Champs-Elysées) used to repair to the Allée des Acacias. In this way I should be hearing about Gilberte, and could be certain that she would in due course hear about me, and in terms which would shew her that I was not interested in her. And I found, as all those who suffer find, that my melancholy condition might have been worse. For being free at any time to enter the habitation in which Gilberte dwelt, I constantly reminded myself, for all that I was firmly resolved to make no use of that privilege, that if ever my pain grew too sharp there was a way of making it cease. I was not unhappy, save only from day to day. And even that is an exaggeration. How many times in an hour (but now without that anxious expectancy which had strained every nerve of me in the first weeks after our quarrel, before I had gone again to the Swanns’) did I not repeat to myself the words of the letter which, one day soon, Gilberte would surely send, would perhaps even bring to me herself. The perpetual vision of that imagined happiness helped me to endure the desolation of my real happiness. With women who do not love Us, as with the ‘missing,’ the knowledge that there is no hope left does not prevent our continuing to wait for news. We live on tenterhooks, starting at the slightest sound; the mother whose son has gone to sea on some perilous voyage of discovery sees him in imagination every moment, long after the fact of his having perished has been established, striding into the room, saved by a miracle and in the best of health. And this strain of waiting, according to the strength of her memory and the resistance of her bodily organs, either helps her on her journey through the years, at the end of which she will be able to endure the knowledge that her son is no more, to forget gradually and to survive his loss, or else it kills her

    On the other hand, my grief found consolation in the idea that my love must profit by it. Each visit that I paid to Mme. Swann without seeing Gilberte was a cruel punishment, but I felt that it correspondingly enhanced the idea that Gilberte had of me

    Besides, if I always took care, before going to see Mme. Swann, that there should be no risk of her daughter’s appearing, that arose, it is true, from my determination to break with her, but no less perhaps from that hope of reconciliation which overlay my intention to renounce her (very few of such intentions are absolute, at least in a continuous form, in this human soul of ours, one of whose laws, confirmed by the unlooked-for wealth of illustration that memory supplies, is intermittence), and hid from me all that in it was unbearably cruel. As for that hope, I saw clearly how far it was chimerical. I was like a pauper who moistens his dry crust with fewer tears if he assures himself that, at any moment, a total stranger is perhaps going to leave him the whole of his fortune. We are all of us obliged, if we are to make reality endurable, to nurse a few little follies in ourselves. Now my hope remained more intact — while at the same time our separation became more effectual — if I refrained from meeting Gilberte. If I had found myself face to face with her in her mother’s drawing-room, we might perhaps have uttered irrevocable words which would have rendered our breach final, killed my hope and, on the other hand, by creating a fresh anxiety, reawakened my love and made resignation harder

    Ever so long ago, before I had even thought of breaking with her daughter, Mme. Swann had said to me: “It is all very well your coming to see Gilberte; I should like you to come sometimes for my sake, not to my ‘kettledrums,’ which would bore you because there is such a crowd, but on the other days, when you will always find me at home if you come fairly late.” So that I might be thought, when I came to see her, to be yielding only after a long resistance to a desire which she had expressed in the past. And very late in the afternoon, when it was quite dark, almost at the hour at which my parents would be sitting down to dinner, I would set out to pay Mme. Swann a visit, in the course of which I knew that I should not see Gilberte, and yet should be thinking only of her. In that quarter, then looked upon as remote, of a Paris darker than Paris is to-day, where even in the centre there was no electric light in the public thoroughfares and very little in private houses, the lamps of a drawing-room situated on the ground level, or but slightly raised above it, as were the rooms in which Mme. Swann generally received her visitors, were enough to lighten the street, and to make the passer-by raise his eyes, connecting with their glow, as with its apparent though hidden cause, the presence outside the door of a string of smart broughams. This passer-by was led to believe, not without a certain emotion, that a modification had been effected in this mysterious cause, when he saw one of the carriages begin to move; but it was merely a coachman who, afraid of his horses’ catching cold, started them now and again on a brisk walk, all the more impressive because the rubber-tired wheels gave the sound of their hooves a background of silence from which it stood out more distinct and more explicit

    The ‘winter-garden,’ of which in those days the passer-by generally caught a glimpse, in whatever street he might be walking, if the drawing-room did not stand too high above the pavement, is to be seen to-day only in photogravures in the gift-books of P. J. Stahl, where, in contrast to the infrequent floral decorations of the Louis XVI drawing-rooms now in fashion — a single rose or a Japanese iris in a long-necked vase of crystal into which it would be impossible to squeeze a second — it seems, because of the profusion of indoor plants which people had then, and of the absolute want of style in their arrangement, as though it must have responded in the ladies whose houses it adorned to some living and delicious passion for botany rather than to any cold concern for lifeless decoration. It suggested to one, only on a larger scale, in the houses of those days, those tiny, portable hothouses laid out on New Year’s morning beneath the lighted lamp — for the children were always too impatient to wait for daylight — among all the other New Year’s presents but the loveliest of them all, consoling them with its real plants which they could tend as they grew for the bareness of the winter soil; and even more than those little houses themselves, those winter-gardens were like the hothouse that the children could see there at the same time, portrayed in a delightful book, another of their presents, and one which, for all that it was given not to them but to Mlle. Lili, the heroine of the story, enchanted them to such a pitch that even now, when they are almost old men and women, they ask themselves whether, in those fortunate years, winter was not the loveliest of the seasons. And inside there, beyond the winter-garden, through the various kinds of arborescence which from the street made the lighted window appear like the glass front of one of those children’s playthings, pictured or real, the passer-by, drawing himself up on tiptoe, would generally observe a man in a frock coat, a gardenia or a carnation in his buttonhole, standing before a seated lady, both vaguely outlined, like two intaglios cut in a topaz, in the depths of the drawing-room atmosphere clouted by the samovar — then a recent importation — with steam which may very possibly be escaping from it still to-day, but to which, if it does, we are grown so accustomed now that no one notices it. Mme. Swann attached great importance to her ‘tea’; she thought that she shewed her originality and expressed her charm when she said to a man, “You will find me at home any day, fairly late; come to tea!” so that she allowed a sweet and delicate smile to accompany the words which she pronounced with a fleeting trace of English accent, and which her listener duly noted, bowing solemnly in acceptance, as though the invitation had been something important and uncommon which commanded deference and required attention. There was another reason, apart from those given already, for the flowers’ having more than a merely ornamental part in Mme. Swann’s drawing-room, and this reason pertained not to the period, but, in some degree, to the former life of Odette. A great courtesan, such as she had been, lives largely for her lovers, that is to say at home, which means that she comes in time to live for her home. The things that one sees in the house of a ‘respectable’ woman, things which may of course appear to her also to be of importance, are those which are in any event of the utmost importance to the courtesan. The culminating point of her day is not the moment in which she dresses herself for all the world to see, but that in which she undresses herself for a man. She must be as smart in her wrapper, in her nightgown, as in her outdoor attire. Other women display their jewels, but as for her, she lives in the intimacy of her pearls. This kind of existence imposes on her as an obligation and ends by giving her a fondness for luxury which is secret, that is to say which comes near to being disinterested. Mme. Swann extended this to include her flowers. There was always beside her chair an immense bowl of crystal filled to the brim with Parma violets or with long white daisy-petals scattered upon the water, which seemed to be testifying, in the eyes of the arriving guest, to some favourite and interrupted occupation, such as the cup of tea which Mme. Swann would, for her own amusement, have been drinking there by herself; an occupation more intimate still and more mysterious, so much so that one felt oneself impelled to apologise on seeing the flowers exposed there by her side, as one would have apologised for looking at the title of the still open book which would have revealed to one what had just been read by — and so, perhaps, what was still in the mind of Odette. And unlike the book the flowers were living things; it was annoying, when one entered the room to pay Mme. Swann a visit, to discover that she was not alone, or if one came home with her not to find the room empty, so prominent a place in it, enigmatic and intimately associated with hours in the life of their mistress of which one knew nothing, did those flowers assume which had not been made ready for Odette’s visitors but, as it were, forgotten there by her, had held and would hold with her again private conversations which one was afraid of disturbing, the secret of which one tried in vain to read, fastening one’s eyes on the moist purple, the still liquid water-colour of the Parma violets. By the end of October Odette would begin to come home with the utmost punctuality for tea, which was still known, at that time, as ‘five-o’clock tea,’ having once heard it said, and being fond of repeating that if Mme. Verdurin had been able to form a salon it was because people were always certain of finding her at home at the same hour. She imagined that she herself had one also, of the same kind, but freer, senza rigore as she used to say. She saw herself figuring thus as a sort of Lespinasse, and believed that she had founded a rival salon by taking from the du Defiant of the little group several of her most attractive men, notably Swann himself, who had followed her in her secession and into her retirement, according-to a version for which one can understand that she had succeeded in gaining credit among her more recent friends, ignorant of what had passed, though without convincing herself. But certain favourite parts are played by us so often before the public and rehearsed so carefully when we are alone that we find it easier to refer to their fictitious testimony than to that of a reality which we have almost entirely forgotten. On days on which Mme. Swann had not left the house, one found her in a wrapper of crêpe-de-Chine, white as the first snows of winter, or, it might be, in one of those long pleated garments of moussettne-de-soie, which seemed nothing more than a shower of white or rosy petals, and would be regarded to-day as hardly suitable for winter, though quite wrongly. For these light fabrics and soft colours gave to a woman — in the stifling warmth of the drawing-rooms of those days, with their heavily curtained doors, rooms of which the most effective thing that the society novelists of the time could find to say was that they were ‘exquisitely cushioned’— the same air of coolness that they gave to the roses which were able to stay in the room there by her side, despite the winter, in the glowing flesh tints of their nudity, as though it were already spring. By reason of the muffling of all sound in the carpets, and of the remoteness of her cosy retreat, the lady of the house, not being apprised of your entry as she is to-day, would continue to read almost until you were standing before her chair, which enhanced still further that sense of the romantic, that charm of a sort of secret discovery, which we find to-day in the memory of those gowns, already out of fashion even then, which Mme. Swann was perhaps alone in not having discarded, and which give us the feeling that the woman who wore them must have been the heroine of a novel because most of us have scarcely set eyes on them outside the pages of certain of Henry Gréville’s tales. Odette had, at this time, in her drawing-room, when winter began, chrysanthemums of enormous size and a variety of colours such as Swann, in the old days, certainly never saw in her drawing-room in the Rue La Pérouse. My admiration for them — when I went to pay Mme. Swann one of those melancholy visits during which, prompted by my sorrow, I discovered in her all the mystical poetry of her character as the mother of that Gilberte to whom she would say on the morrow: “Your friend came to see me yesterday,”— sprang, no doubt, from my sense that, rose-pale like the Louis XIV silk that covered her chairs, snow-white like her crêpe-de-Chine wrapper, or of a metallic red like her samovar, they superimposed upon the decoration of the room another, a supplementary scheme of decoration, as rich, as delicate in its colouring, but one which was alive and would last for a few days only. But I was touched to find that these chrysanthemums appeared less ephemeral than, one might almost say, lasting, when I compared them with the tones, as pink, as coppery, which the setting sun so gorgeously displays amid the mists of a November afternoon, and which, after seeing them, before I had entered the house, fade from the sky, I found again inside, prolonged, transposed on to the flaming palette of the flowers. Like the fires caught and fixed by a great colourist from the impermanence of the atmosphere and the sun, so that they should enter and adorn a human dwelling, they invited me, those chrysanthemums, to put away all my sorrows and to taste with a greedy rapture during that ‘tea-time’ the too fleeting joys of November, of which they set ablaze all around me the intimate and mystical glory. Alas, it was not in the conversations to which I must listen that I could hope to attain to that glory; they had but little in common with it. Even with Mme. Cottard, and although it was growing late, Mme. Swann would assume her most caressing manner to say: “Oh, no, it’s not late, really; you mustn’t look at the clock; that’s not the right time; it’s stopped; you can’t possibly have anything else to do now, why be in such a hurry?” as she pressed a final tartlet upon the Professor’s wife, who was gripping her card-case in readiness for flight

    “One simply can’t tear oneself away from this house!” observed Mme. Bontemps to Mme. Swann, while Mme. Cottard, in her astonishment at hearing her own thought put into words, exclaimed: “Why, that’s just what I always say myself, what I tell my own little judge, in the court of conscience!” winning the applause of the gentlemen from the Jockey Club, who had been profuse in their salutations, as though confounded at such an honour’s being done them, when Mme. Swann had introduced them to this common and by no means attractive little woman, who kept herself, when confronted with Odette’s brilliant friends, in reserve, if not on what she herself called ‘the defensive,’ for she always used stately language to describe the simplest happenings. “I should never have suspected it,” was Mme. Swann’s comment, “three Wednesdays running you’ve played me false.” “That’s quite true, Odette; it’s simply ages, it’s an eternity since I saw you last. You see, I plead guilty; but I must tell you,” she went on with a vague suggestion of outraged modesty, for although a doctor’s wife she would never have dared to speak without periphrasis of rheumatism or of a chill on the kidneys,” that I have had a lot of little troubles. As we all have, I dare say. And besides that I’ve had a crisis among my masculine domestics. I’m sure, I’m no more imbued with a sense of my own authority than most ladies; still I’ve been obliged, just to make an example you know, to give my Vatel notice; I believe he was looking out anyhow for a more remunerative place. But his departure nearly brought about the resignation of my entire ministry. My own maid refused to stay in the house a moment longer; oh, we have had some Homeric scenes. However I held fast to the reins through thick and thin; the whole affair’s been a perfect lesson, which won’t be lost on me, I can tell you. I’m afraid I’m boring you with all these stories about servants, but you know as well as I do what a business it is when one is obliged to set about rearranging one’s household

    “Aren’t we to see anything of your delicious child?” she wound up. “No, my delicious child is dining with a friend,” replied Mme. Swann, and then, turning to me: “I believe she’s written to you, asking you to come and see her to-morrow. And your babies?” she went on to Mme. Cottard. I breathed a sigh of relief. These words by which Mme. Swann proved to me that I oould see Gilberte whenever I chose gave me precisely the comfort which I had come to seek, and which at that time made my visits to Mme. Swann so necessary. “No, I’m afraid not; I shall write to her, anyhow, this evening. Gilberte and I never seem to see one another now,” I added, pretending to attribute our separation to some mysterious agency, which gave me a further illusion of being in love, supported as well by the affectionate way in which I spoke of Gilberte and she of me. “You know, she’s simply devoted to you,” said Mme. Swann. “Really, you won’t come to-morrow?” Suddenly my heart rose on wings; the thought had just struck me —“After all, why shouldn’t I, since it’s her own mother who suggests it?” But with the thought I fell back into my old depression. I was afraid now lest, when she saw me again, Gilberte might think that my indifference of late had been feigned, and it seemed wiser to prolong our separation. During these asides Mme. Bontemps had been complaining of the insufferable dulness of politicians’ wives, for she pretended to find everyone too deadly or too stupid for words, and to deplore her husband’s official position. “Do you mean to say you can shake hands with fifty doctors’ wives, like that, one after the other?” she exclaimed to Mme. Cottard, who, unlike her, was full of the kindest feelings for everybody and of determination to do her duty in every respect. “Ah! you’re a law-abiding woman! You see, in my case’, at the Ministry, don’t you know, I simply have to keep it up, of course. It’s too much for me, I can tell you; you know what those officials’ wives are like, it’s all I can do not to put my tongue out at them. And my niece Albertine is just like me. You really wouldn’t believe the impudence that girl has. Last week, on my ‘day,’ I had the wife of the Under Secretary of State for Finance, who told us that she knew nothing at all about cooking. ‘But surely, ma’am,’ my niece chipped in with her most winning smile, ‘you ought to know everything about it, after all the dishes your father had to wash.’” “Oh, I do love that story; I think it’s simply exquisite!” cried Mme. Swann. “But certainly on the Doctor’s consultation days you should make a point of being ‘at home,’ among your flowers and books and all your pretty things,” she urged Mme. Cottard. “Straight out like that! Bang! Right in the face; bang! She made no bones about it, I can tell you! And she’d never said a word to me about it, the little wretch; she’s as cunning as a monkey. You are lucky to be able to control yourself; I do envy people who can hide what is in their minds.” “But I’ve no need to do that, Mme. Bontemps, I’m not so hard to please,” Mme. Cottard gently expostulated. “For one thing, I’m not in such a privileged position,” she went on, slightly raising her voice as was her custom, as though she were underlining the point of her remark, whenever she slipped into the conversation any of those delicate courtesies, those skilful flatteries which won her the admiration and assisted the career of her husband. “And besides I’m only too glad to do anything that can be of use to the Professor.”

    “But, my dear, it isn’t what one’s glad to do; it’s what one is able to do! I expect you’re not nervous. Do you know, whenever I see the War Minister’s wife making faces, I start copying her at once. It’s a dreadful thing to have a temperament like mine.”

    “To be sure, yes,” said Mme. Cottard, “I’ve heard people say that she had a twitch; my husband knows someone else who occupies a very high position, and it’s only natural, when gentlemen get talking together . . . ”

    “And then, don’t you know, it’s just the same with the Chief of the Registry; he’s a hunchback. Whenever he comes to see me, before he’s been in the room five minutes my fingers are itching to stroke his hump. My husband says I’ll cost him his place. What if I do! A fig for the Ministry! Yes, a fig for the Ministry! I should like to have that printed as a motto on my notepaper. I can see I am shocking you; you’re so frightfully proper, but I must say there’s nothing amuses me like a little devilry now and then. Life would be dreadfully monotonous without it.” And she went on talking about the Ministry all the time, as though it had been Mount Olympus. To change the conversation, Mme. Swann turned to Mme. Cottard: “But you’re looking very smart to-day. Redfern fecit?”

    “No, you know, I always swear by Rauthnitz. Besides, it’s only an old thing I’ve had done up.” “Not really! It’s charming!”

    “Guess how much. . . . No, change the first figure!”

    “You don’t say so! Why, that’s nothing; it’s given away! Three times that at least, I should have said.” “You see how history comes to be written,” apostrophised the doctor’s wife. And pointing to a neck-ribbon which had been a present from Mme. Swann: “Look, Odette! Do you recognise this?”

    Through the gap between a pair of curtains a head peeped with ceremonious deference, making a playful pretence of being afraid of disturbing the party; it was Swann. “Odette, the Prince d’Agrigente is with me in the study. He wants to know if he may pay his respects to you. What am I to tell him?” “Why, that I shall be delighted,” Odette would reply, secretly flattered, but without losing anything of the composure which came to her all the more easily since she had always, even in her ‘fast’ days, been accustomed to entertain men of fashion. Swann disappeared to deliver the message, and would presently return with the Prince, unless in the meantime Mme. Verdurin had arrived. When he married Odette Swann had insisted on her ceasing to frequent the little clan. (He had several good reasons for this stipulation, though, had he had none, he would have made it just the same in obedience to a law of ingratitude which admits no exception, and proves that every ‘go-between’ is either lacking in foresight or else singularly disinterested.) He had conceded only that Odette and Mme. Verdurin might exchange visits once a year, and even this seemed excessive to some of the ‘faithful,’ indignant at the insult offered to the ‘Mistress’ who for so many years had treated Odette and even Swann himself as the spoiled children of her house. For if it contained false brethren who ‘failed’ upon certain evenings in order that they might secretly accept an invitation from Odette, ready, in the event of discovery, with the excuse that they were anxious to meet Bergotte (although the Mistress assured them that he never went to the Swanns’, and even if he did, had no vestige of talent, really — in spite of which she was making the most strenuous efforts, to quote one of her favourite expressions, to ‘attract’ him), the little group had its ‘die-hards’ also. And these, though ignorant of those conventional refinements which often dissuade people from the extreme attitude one would have liked to see them adopt in order to annoy some one else, would have wished Mme. Verdurin, but had never managed to prevail upon her, to sever all connection with Odette, and thus deprive Odette of the satisfaction of saying, with a mocking laugh: “We go to the Mistress’s very seldom now, since the Schism. It was all very well while my husband was still a bachelor, but when one is married, you know, it isn’t always so easy. . . . If you must know, M. Swann can’t abide old Ma Verdurin, and he wouldn’t much like the idea of my going there regularly, as I used to. And I, as a dutiful spouse, don’t you see . . .?” Swann would accompany his wife to their annual evening there but would take care not to be in the room when Mme. Verdurin came to call. And so, if the ‘Mistress’ was in the drawing-room, the Prince d’Agrigente would enter it alone. Alone, too, he was presented to her by Odette, who preferred that Mme. Verdurin should be left in ignorance of the names of her humbler guests, and so might, seeing more than one strange face in the room, be led to believe that she was mixing with the cream of the aristocracy, a device which proved so far successful that Mme. Verdurin said to her husband, that evening, with profound contempt: “Charming people, her friends! I met all the fine flower of the Reaction!” Odette was living, with respect to Mme. Verdurin, under a converse illusion. Not that the latter’s salon had ever begun, at that time, to develop into what we shail one day see it to have become. Mme. Verdurin had not yet reached the period of incubation in which one dispenses with one’s big parties, where the few brilliant specimens recently acquired would be lost in too numerous a crowd, and prefers to wait until the generative force of the ten righteous whom one has succeeded in attracting shall have multiplied those ten seventyfold. As Odette was not to be long now in doing, Mme. Verdurin did indeed entertain the idea of ‘Society’ as her final objective, but her zone of attack was as yet so restricted, and moreover so remote from that in which Odette had some chance of arriving at an identical goal, of breaking the line of defence, that the latter remained absolutely ignorant of the strategic plans which the ‘Mistress’ was elaborating. And it was with the most perfect sincerity that Odette, when anyone spoke to her of Mme. Verdurin as a snob, would answer, laughing, “Oh, no, quite the opposite! For one thing, she never gets a chance of being a snob; she doesn’t know anyone. And then, to do her justice, I must say that she seems quite pleased not to know anyone. No, what she likes are her Wednesdays, and people who talk well.” And in her heart of hearts she envied Mme. Verdurin (for all that she did not despair of having herself, in so eminent a school, succeeded in acquiring them) those arts to which the ‘Mistress’ attached such paramount importance, albeit they did but discriminate, between shades of the Non-existent, sculpture the void, and were, properly speaking, the Arts of Nonentity: to wit those, in the lady of a house, of knowing how to ‘bring people together,’ how to ‘group,’ to ‘draw out,’ to ‘keep in the background,’ to act as a ‘connecting link.’

    In any case, Mme. Swann’s friends were impressed when they saw in her house a lady of whom they were accustomed to think only as in her own, in an inseparable setting of her guests, amid the whole of her little group which they were astonished to behold thus suggested, summarised, assembled, packed into a single armchair in the bodily form of the ‘Mistress,’ the hostess turned visitor, muffled in her cloak with its grebe trimming, as shaggy as the white skins that carpeted that drawing-room embowered in which Mme. Verdurin was a drawing-room in herself. The more timid among the women thought it prudent to retire, and using the plural, as people do when they mean to hint to the rest of the room that it is wiser not to tire a convalescent who is out of bed for the first time: “Odette,” they murmured, “we are going to leave you.” They envied Mme. Cottard, whom the ‘Mistress’ called by her Christian name. “Can I drop you anywhere?” Mme. Verdurin asked her, unable to bear the thought that one of the faithful was going to remain behind instead of following her from the room. “Oh, but this lady has been so very kind as to say, she’ll take me,” replied Mme. Cottard, not wishing to appear to be forgetting, when approached by a more illustrious personage, that she had accepted the offer which Mme. Bontémps had made of driving her home behind her cockaded coachman. “I must say that I am always specially grateful to the friends who are so kind as to take me with them in their vehicles. It is a regular godsend to me, who have no Automedon.” “Especially,” broke in the ‘Mistress,’ who felt that she must say something, since she knew Mme. Bontémps slightly and had just invited her to her Wednesdays, “as at Mme. de Crécy’s house you’re not very near home. Oh, good gracious, I shall never get into the way of saying Mme. Swann!” It was a recognised pleasantry in the little clan, among those who were not overendowed with wit, to pretend that they could never grow used to saying ‘Mme. Swann.’ “I have been so accustomed to saying Mme. de Crécy that I nearly went wrong again!” Only Mme. Verdurin, when she spoke to Odette, was not content with the nearly, but went wrong on purpose. “Don’t you feel afraid, Odette, living out in the wilds like this? I’m sure I shouldn’t feel at all comfortable, coming home after dark. Besides, it’s so damp. It can’t be at all good for your husband’s eczema. You haven’t rats in the house, I hope!” “Oh, dear no. What a horrid idea!” “That’s a good thing; I was told you had. I’m glad to know it’s not true, because I have a perfect horror of the creatures, and I should never have come to see you again. Goodbye, my dear child, we shall meet again soon; you know what a pleasure it is to me to see you. You don’t know how to put your chrysanthemums in water,” she went on, as she prepared to leave the room, Mme. Swann having risen to escort her. “They are Japanese flowers; you must arrange them the same way as the Japanese.” “I do not agree with Mme. Verdurin, although she is the Law and the Prophets to me in all things! There’s no one like you, Odette, for finding such lovely chrysanthemums, or chrysanthema rather, for it seems that’s what we ought to call them now,” declared Mme. Cottard as soon as the ‘Mistress’ had shut the door behind her. “Dear Mme. Verdurin is not always very kind about other people’s flowers,” said Odette sweetly. “Whom do you go to, Odette,” asked Mme. Cottard, to forestall any further criticism of the ‘Mistress.’ “Lemaître? I must confess, the other day in Lemaître’s window I saw a huge, great pink bush which made me do something quite mad.” But modesty forbade her to give any more precise details as to the price of the bush, and she said merely that the Professor, “and you know, he’s not at all a quicktempered man,” had ‘waved his sword in the air’ and told her that she “didn’t know what money meant.” “No, no, I’ve no regular florist except Debac.” “Nor have I,” said Mme. Cottard, “but I confess that I am unfaithful to him now and then with Lachaume.” “Oh, you forsake him for Lachaume, do you; I must tell Debac that,” retorted Odette, always anxious to shew her wit, and to lead the conversation in her own house, where she felt more at her ease than in the little clan. “Besides, Lachaume is really becoming too dear; his prices are quite excessive, don’t you know; I find his prices impossible!” she added, laughing

    Meanwhile Mme. Bontemps, who had been heard a hundred times to declare that nothing would induce her to go to the Verdurins’, delighted at being asked to the famous Wednesdays, was planning in her own mind how she could manage to attend as many of them as possible. She was not’ aware that Mme. Verdurin liked people not to miss a single one; also she was one of those people whose company is but little sought, who, when a hostess invites them to a series of parties, do not accept and go to them without more ado, like those who know that it is always a pleasure to see them, whenever they have a moment to spare and feel inclined to go out; people of her type deny themselves it may be the first evening and the third, imagining that their absence will be noticed, and save themselves up for the second and fourth, unless it should happen that, having heard from a trustworthy source that the third is to be a particularly brilliant party, they reverse the original order, assuring their hostess that “most unfortunately, we had another engagement last week.” So Mme. Bontemps was calculating how many Wednesdays there could still be left before Easter, and by what means she might manage to secure one extra, and yet not appear to be thrusting herself upon her hostess. She relied upon Mme. Cottard, whom she would have with her in the carriage going home, to give her a few hints. “Oh, Mme. Bontemps, I see you getting up to go; it is very bad of you to give the signal for flight like that! You owe me some compensation for not turning up last Thursday. . . . Come, sit down again, just for a minute. You can’t possibly be going anywhere else before dinner. Really, you won’t let yourself be tempted?” went on Mme. Swann, and, as she held out a plate of cakes, “You know, they’re not at all bad, these little horrors. They don’t look nice, but just taste one, I know you’ll like it.” “On the contrary, they look quite delicious,” broke in Mme. Cottard. “In your house, Odette, one is never short of victuals. I have no need to ask to see the trade-mark; I know you get everything from Rebattet. I must say that I am more eclectic. For sweet biscuits and everything of that sort I repair, as often as not, to Bourbonneux. But I agree that they simply don’t know what an ice means. Rebattet for everything iced, and syrups and sorbets; they’re past masters. As my husband would say, they’re the ne plus ultra.” “Oh, but we just make these in the house. You won’t, really?” “I shan’t be able to eat a scrap of dinner,” pleaded Mme. Bontemps, “but I will just sit down again for a moment; you know, I adore talking to a clever woman like you.” “You will think me highly indiscreet, Odette, but I should so like to know what you thought of the hat Mme. Trombert had on. I know, of course, that big hats are the fashion just now. All the same, wasn’t it just the least little bit exaggerated? And compared to the hat she came to see me in the other day, the one she had on just now was microscopic!” “Oh no, I am not at all clever,” said Odette, thinking that this sounded well. “I am a perfect simpleton, I believe everything people say, and worry myself to death over the least thing.” And she insinuated that she had, just at first, suffered terribly from the thought of having married a man like Swann, who had a separate life of his own and was unfaithful to her. Meanwhile the Prince d’Agrigente, having caught the words “I am not at all clever,” thought it incumbent on him to protest; unfortunately he had not the knack of repartee. “Tut, tut, tut, tut!” cried Mme. Bontemps, “Not clever; you!” “That’s just what I was saying to myself —‘What do I hear?’,” the Prince clutched at this straw, “My ears must have played me false!” “No, I assure you,” went on Odette, “I am really just an ordinary woman, very easily shocked, full of prejudices, living in my own little groove and dreadfully ignorant.” And then, in case he had any news of the Baron de Charlus, “Have you seen our dear Baronet?” she asked him. “You, ignorant!” cried Mme. Bontemps. “Then I wonder what you’d say of the official world, all those wives of Excellencies who can talk of nothing but their frocks. . . . Listen to this, my friend; not more than a week ago I happened to mention Lohengrin to the Education Minister’s wife. She stared at me, and said ‘Lohengrin? Oh, yes, the new review at the Folies-Bergères. I hear it’s a perfect scream!’ What do you say to that, eh? You can’t help yourself; when people say things like that it makes your blood boil. I could have struck her. Because I have a bit of a temper of my own. What do you say, sir;” she turned to me, “was I not right?” “Listen,” said Mme. Cottard, “people can’t help answering a little off the mark when they’re asked a thing like that point blank, without any warning. I know something about it, because Mme. Verdurin also has a habit of putting a pistol to your head.” “Speaking of Mme. Verdurin,” Mme. Bontemps asked Mme. Cottard, “do you know who will be there on Wednesday? Oh, I’ve just remembered that we’ve accepted an invitation for next Wednesday. You wouldn’t care to dine with us on Wednesday week? We could go on together to Mme. Verdurin’s. I should never dare to go there by myself; I don’t know why it is, that great lady always terrifies me.” “I’ll tell you what it is,” replied Mme. Cottard, “what frightens you about Mme. Verdurin is her organ. But you see everyone can’t have such a charming organ as Mme. Swann. Once you’ve found your tongue, as the ‘Mistress’ says, the ice will soon be broken. For she’s a very easy person, really, to get on with. But I can quite understand what you feel; it’s never pleasant to find oneself for the first time in a strange country.” “Won’t you dine with us, too?” said Mme. Bontemps to Mme. Swann. “After dinner we could all go to the Verdurins’ together, ‘do a Verdurin’; and even if it means that the ‘Mistress’ will stare me out of countenance and never ask me to the house again, once we are there we’ll just sit by ourselves and have a quiet talk, I’m sure that’s what I should like best.” But this assertion can hardly have been quite truthful, for Mme. Bontemps went on to ask: “Who do you think will be there on Wednesday week? What will they be doing? There won’t be too big a crowd, I hope!” “I certainly shan’t be there,” said Odette. “We shall just look in for a minute on the last Wednesday of all. If you don’t mind waiting till then ——” But Mme. Bontemps did not appear to be tempted by the proposal

    Granted that the intellectual distinction of a house and its smartness are generally in inverse rather than direct ratio, one must suppose, since Swann found Mme. Bontemps attractive, that any forfeiture of position once accepted has the consequence of making us less particular with regard to the people among whom we have resigned ourselves to finding entertainment, less particular with regard to their intelligence as to everything else about them. And if this be true, men, like nations, must see their culture and even their language disappear with their independence. One of the effects of this indulgence is to aggravate the tendency which after a certain age we have towards finding pleasure in speeches that are a homage to our own turn of mind, to our weaknesses, an encouragement to us to yield to them; that is the age at which a great artist prefers to the company of original minds that of pupils who have nothing in common with him save the letter of his doctrine, who listen to him and offer incense; at which a man or woman of mark, who is living entirely for love, will find that the most intelligent person in a gathering is one perhaps of no distinction, but one who has shewn by some utterance that he can understand and approve what is meant by an existence devoted to gallantry, and has thus pleasantly excited the voluptuous instincts of the lover or mistress; it was the age, too, at which Swann, in so far as he had become the husband of Odette, enjoyed hearing Mme. Bontemps say how silly it was to have nobody in one’s house but duchesses (concluding from that, quite the contrary of what he would have decided in the old days at the Verdurins’, that she was a good creature, extremely sensible and not at all a snob) and telling her stories which made her ‘die laughing’ because she had not heard them before, although she always ‘saw the point’ at once, liked flattering her for his own amusement. “Then the Doctor is not mad about flowers, like you?” Mme. Swann asked Mme. Cottard. “Oh, well, you know, my husband is a sage; be practises moderation in all things. Yet, I must admit, he has a passion.” Her eye aflame with malice, joy, curiosity, “And what is that, pray?” inquired Mme. Bontemps. Quite simply Mme. Cottard answered her, “Reading.” “Oh, that’s a very restful passion in a husband!” cried Mme. Bontemps suppressing an impish laugh. “When the Doctor gets a book in his hands, you know!” “Well, that needn’t alarm you much . . . ” “But it does, for his eyesight. I must go now and look after him, Odette, and I shall come back on the very first opportunity and knock at your door. Talking of eyesight, have you heard that the new house Mme. Verdurin has just bought is to be lighted by electricity? I didn’t get that from my own little secret service, you know, but from quite a different source; it was the electrician himself, Mildé, who told me. You see, I quote my authorities! Even the bedrooms, he says, are to have electric lamps with shades which will filter the light. It is evidently a charming luxury, for those who can afford it. But it seems that our contemporaries must absolutely have the newest thing if it’s the only one of its kind in the world. Just fancy, the sister-in-law of a friend of mine has had the telephone installed in her house! She can order things from her tradesmen without having to go out of doors! I confess that I’ve made the most bare-faced stratagems to get permission to go there one day, just to speak into the instrument. It’s very tempting, but more in a friend’s house than at home. I don’t think I should like to have the telephone in my establishment. Once the first excitement is over, it must be a perfect racket going on all the time. Now, Odette, I must be off; you’re not to keep Mme. Bontemps any longer, she’s looking after me. I must absolutely tear myself away; you’re making me behave in a nice way, I shall be getting home after my husband!”

    And for myself also it was time to return home, before I had tasted those wintry delights of which the chrysanthemums had seemed to me to be the brilliant envelope. These pleasures had not appeared, and yet Mme. Swann did not look as though she expected anything more. She allowed the servants to carry away the tea-things, as who should say “Time, please, gentlemen!” And at last she did say to me: “Really, must you go? Very well; good-bye!” I felt that I might have stayed there without encountering those unknown pleasures, and that my unhappiness was not the cause of my having to forego them. Were they to be found, then, situated not upon that beaten track of hours which leads one always to the moment of departure, but rather upon some cross-road unknown to me along which I ought to have digressed? At least, the object of my visit had been attained; Gilberte would know that I had come to see her parents when she was not at home, and that I had, as Mme. Cottard had incessantly assured me, “made a complete conquest, first shot, of Mme. Verdurin,” whom, she added, she had never seen ‘make so much’ of anyone. (“You and she must have hooked atoms.”) She would know that I had spoken of her as was fitting, with affection, but that I had not that incapacity for living without our seeing one another which I believed to be at the root of the boredom that she had shewn at our last meetings. I had told Mme. Swann that I should not be able to see Gilberte again. I had said this as though I had finally decided not to see her any more. And the letter which I was going to send Gilberte would be framed on those lines. Only to myself, to fortify my courage, I proposed no more than a supreme and concentrated effort, lasting a few days only. I said to myself: “This is the last time that I shall refuse to meet her; I shall accept the next invitation.” To make our separation less difficult to realise, I did not picture it to myself as final. But I knew very well that it would be

    The first of January was exceptionally painful to me that winter. So, no doubt, is everything that marks a date and an anniversary when we are unhappy. But if our unhappiness is due to the loss of some dear friend, our suffering consists merely in an unusually vivid comparison of the present with the past. There was added to this, in my case, the unexpressed hope that Gilberte, having intended to leave me to take the first steps towards a reconciliation, and discovering that I had not taken them, had been waiting only for the excuse of New Year’s Day to write to me, saying: “What is the matter? I am madly in love with you; come, and let us explain things properly; I cannot live without seeing you.” As the last days of the old year went by, such a letter began to seem probable. It was, perhaps, nothing of the sort, but to make us believe that such a thing is probable the desire, the need that we have for it suffices. The soldier is convinced that a certain interval of time, capable of being indefinitely prolonged, will be allowed him before the bullet finds him, the thief before he is taken, men in general before they have to die. That is the amulet which preserves people — and sometimes peoples — not from danger but from the fear of danger, in reality from the belief in danger, which in certain cases allows them to brave it without their actually needing to be brave. It is confidence of this sort, and with as little foundation, that sustains the lover who is counting upon a reconciliation, upon a letter. For me to cease to expect a letter it would have sufficed that I should have ceased to wish for one. However unimportant one may know that one is in the eyes of her whom one still loves, one attributes to her a series of thoughts (though their sum-total be indifference) the intention to express those thoughts, a complication of her inner life in which one is the constant object possibly of her antipathy but certainly of her attention. But to imagine what was going on in Gilberte’s mind I should have required simply the power to anticipate on that New Year’s Day what I should feel on the first day of any of the years to come, when the attention or the silence or the affection or the coldness of Gilberte would pass almost unnoticed by me and I should not dream, should not even be able to dream of seeking a solution of problems which would have ceased to perplex me. When we are in love, our love is too big a thing for us to be able altogether to contain it within us. It radiates towards the beloved object, finds in her a surface which arrests it, forcing it to return to its starting-point, and it is this shock of the repercussion of our own affection which we call the other’s regard for ourselves, and which pleases us more then than on its outward journey because we do not recognise it as having originated in ourselves. New Year’s Day rang out all its hours without there coming to me that letter from Gilberte. And as I received a few others containing greetings tardy or retarded by the overburdening of the mails at that season, on the third and fourth of January I hoped still, but my hope grew hourly more faint. Upon the days that followed I gazed through a mist of tears. This undoubtedly meant that, having been less sincere than I thought in my renunciation of Gilberte, I had kept the hope of a letter from her for the New Year. And seeing that hope exhausted before I had had time to shelter myself behind another, I suffered as would an invalid who had emptied his phial of morphia without having another within his reach. But perhaps also in my case — and these two explanations are not mutually exclusive, for a single feeling is often made up of contrary elements — the hope that I entertained of ultimately receiving a letter had brought to my mind’s eye once again the image of Gilberte, had reawakened the emotions which the expectation of finding myself in her presence, the sight of her, her way of treating me had aroused in me before. The immediate possibility of a reconciliation had suppressed in me that faculty the immense importance of which we are apt to overlook: the faculty of resignation. Neurasthenics find it impossible to believe the friends who assure them that they will gradually recover their peace of mind if they will stay in bed and receive no letters, read no newspapers. They imagine that such a course will only exasperate their twitching nerves. And similarly lovers, who look upon it from their enclosure in a contrary state of mind, who have not begun yet to make trial of it, are unable to believe in the healing power of renunciation

    In consequence of the violence of my palpitations, my doses of caffeine were reduced; the palpitations ceased. Whereupon I asked myself whether it was not to some extent the drug that had been responsible for the anguish that I had felt when I came near to quarrelling with Gilberte, an anguish which I had attributed, on every recurrence of it, to the distressing prospect of never seeing my friend again or of running the risk of seeing her only when she was a prey to the same ill-humour. But if this medicine had been at the root of the sufferings which my imagination must in that case have interpreted wrongly (not that there would be anything extraordinary in that, seeing that, among lovers, the most acute mental suffering assumes often the physical identity of the woman with whom they are living), it had been, in that sense, like the philtre which, long after they have drunk of it, continues to bind Tristan to Isolde. For the physical improvement which the reduction of my caffeine effected almost at once did not arrest the evolution of that grief which my absorption of the toxin had perhaps — if it had not created it — at any rate contrived to render more acute

    Only, as the middle of the month of January approached, once my hopes of a letter on New Year’s Day had been disappointed, once the additional disturbance that had come with their disappointment had grown calm, it was my old sorrow, that of ‘before the holidays,’ which began again. What was perhaps the most cruel thing about it was that I myself was its architect, unconscious, wilful, merciless and patient. The one thing that mattered, my relations with Gilberte, it was I who was labouring to make them impossible by gradually creating out of this prolonged separation from my friend, not indeed her indifference, but what would come to the same thing in the end, my own. It was to a slow and painful suicide of that part of me which was Gilberte’s lover that I was goading myself with untiring energy, with a clear sense not only of what I was presently doing but of what must result from it in the future; I knew not only that after a certain time I should cease to love Gilberte, but also that she herself would regret it and that the attempts which she would then make to see me would be as vain as those that she was making now, no longer because I loved her too well but because I should certainly be in love with some other woman whom I should continue to desire, to wait for, through hours of which I should not dare to divert any particle of a second to Gilberte who would be nothing to me then. And no doubt at that very moment in which (since I was determined not to see her again, unless after a formal request for an explanation or a full confession of love on her part, neither of which was in the least degree likely to come to me now) I had already lost Gilberte, and loved her more than ever, and could feel all that she was to me better than in the previous year when, spending all my afternoons in her company, or as many as I chose, I believed that no peril threatened our friendship — no doubt at that moment the idea that I should one day entertain identical feelings for another was odious to me, for that idea carried me away beyond the range of Gilberte, my love and my sufferings. My love, my sufferings in which through my tears I attempted to discern precisely what Gilberte was, and was obliged to recognise that they did not pertain exclusively to her but would, sooner or later, be some other woman’s portion. So that — or such, at least, was my way of thinking then — we are always detached from our fellow-creatures; when a man loves one of them he feels that his love is not labelled with their two names, but may be born again in the future, may have been born already in the past for another and not for her. And in the time when he is not in love, if he makes up his mind philosophically as to what it is that is inconsistent in love, he will find that the love of which he can speak unmoved he did not, at the moment of speaking, feel, and therefore did not know, knowledge in these matters being intermittent and not outlasting the actual presence of the sentiment. That future in which I should not love Gilberte, which my sufferings helped me to divine although my imagination was not yet able to form a clear picture of it, certainly there would still have been time to warn Gilberte that it was gradually taking shape, that its coming was, if not imminent, at least inevitable, if she herself, Gilberte, did not come to my rescue and destroy in the germ my nascent indifference. How often was I not on the point of writing, or of going to Gilberte to tell her: “Take care. My mind is made up. What I am doing now is my supreme effort. I am seeing you now for the last time. Very soon I shall have ceased to love you.” But to what end? By what authority should I have reproached Gilberte for an indifference which, not that I considered myself guilty on that count, I too manifested towards everything that was not herself? The last time! To me, that appeared as something of immense significance, because I was in love with Gilberte. On her it would doubtless have made just as much impression as those letters in which our friends ask whether they may pay us a visit before they finally leave the country, an offer which, like those made by tiresome women who are in love with us, we decline because we have pleasures of our own in prospect. The time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic; the passions that we feel expand it, those that we inspire contract it; and habit fills up what remains

    Besides, what good would it have done if I had spoken to Gilberte; she would not have understood me. We imagine always when we speak that it is our own ears, our own mind that are listening. My words would have come to her only in a distorted form, as though they had had to pass through the moving curtain of a waterfall before they reached my friend, unrecognisable, giving a foolish sound, having no longer any kind of meaning. The truth which one puts into one’s words does not make a direct path for itself, is not supported by irresistible evidence. A considerable time must elapse before a truth of the same order can take shape in the words themselves. Then the political opponent who, despite all argument, every proof that he has advanced to damn the votary of the rival doctrine as a traitor, will himself have come to share the hated conviction by which he who once sought in vain to disseminate it is no longer bound. Then the masterpiece of literature whidi for the admirers who read it aloud seemed to make self-evident the proofs of its excellence, while to those who listened it presented only a senseless or commonplace image, will by these too be proclaimed a masterpiece, but too late for the author to learn of their discovery. Similarly in love the barriers, do what one may, cannot be broken down from without by him whom they maddeningly exclude; it is when he is no longer concerned with them that suddenly, as the result of aft effort directed from elsewhere, accomplished within the heart of her who did not love him, those barriers which he has charged without success will fall to no advantage. If I had come to Gilberte to tell her of my future indifference and the means of preventing it, she would have assumed from my action that my love for her, the need that I had of her, were even greater than I had supposed, and her distaste for the sight of me would thereby have been increased. And incidentally it is quite true that it was that love for her which helped me, by means of the incongruous states of mind which it successively produced in me, to foresee, more clearly than she herself could, the end of that love. And yet some such warning I might perhaps have addressed, by letter or with my own lips, to Gilberte, after a long enough interval, which would render her, it is true, less indispensable to me, but would also have proved to her that she was not so indispensable. Unfortunately certain persons — of good or evil intent — spoke of me to her in a fashion which must have led her to think that they were doing so at my request. Whenever I thus learned that Cottard, my own mother, even M. de Norpois had by a few ill-chosen words rendered useless all the sacrifice that I had just been making, wasted all the advantage of my reserve by giving me, wrongly, the appearance of having emerged from it, I was doubly angry. In the first place I could no longer reckon from any date but the present my laborious and fruitful abstention which these tiresome people had, unknown to me, interrupted and so brought to nothing. And not only that; I should have less pleasure in seeing Gilberte, who would think of me now no longer as containing myself in dignified resignation, but as plotting in the dark for an interview which she had scorned to grant me. I cursed all the idle chatter of people who so often, without any intention of hurting us or of doing us a service, for no reason, for talking’s sake, often because we ourselves have not been able to refrain from talking in their presence, and because they are indiscreet (as we ourselves are), do us, at a crucial moment, so much harm. It is true that in the grim operation performed for the eradication of our love they are far from playing a part equal to that played by two persons who are in the habit, from excess of good nature in one and of malice in the Other, of undoing everything at the moment when everything is on the point of being settled. But against these two persons we bear no such grudge as against the inopportune Cottards of this world, for the latter of them is the person whom we love and the former is ourself

    Meanwhile, since on almost every occasion of my going to see her Mme. Swann would invite me to come to tea another day, with her daughter, and tell me to reply directly to her, I was constantly writing to Gilberte, and in this correspondence I did not choose the expressions which might, I felt, have won her over, sought only to carve out the easiest channel for the torrent of my tears. For, like desire, regret seeks not to be analysed but to be satisfied. When one begins to love, one spends one’s time, not in getting to know what one’s love really is, but in making it possible to meet next day. When one abandons love one seeks not to know one’s grief but to offer to her who is causing it that expression of it which seems to one the most moving. One says the things which one feels the need of saying, and which the other will not understand, one speaks for oneself alone. I wrote: “I had thought that it would not be possible. Alas, I see now that it is not so difficult.” I said also: “I shall probably not see you again;” I said it while I continued to avoid shewing a coldness which she might think affected, and the words, as I wrote them, made me weep because I felt that they expressed not what I should have liked to believe but what was probably going to happen. For at the next request for a meeting which she would convey to me I should have again, as I had now, the courage not to yield, and, what with one refusal and another, I should gradually come to the moment when, by virtue of not having seen her again, I should not wish to see her. I wept, but I found courage enough to sacrifice, I tasted the sweets of sacrificing the happiness of being with her to the probability of seeming attractive to her one day, a day when, alas, my seeming attractive to her would be immaterial to me. Even the supposition, albeit so far from likely, that at this moment, as she had pretended during the last visit that I had paid her, she loved me, that what I took for the boredom which one feels in the company of a person of whom one has grown tired had been due only to a jealous susceptibility, to a feint of indifference analogous to my own, only rendered my decision less painful. It seemed to me that in years to come, when we had forgotten one another, when I should be able to look back and tell her that this letter which I was now in course of writing had not been for one moment sincere, she would answer, “What, you really did love me, did you? If you had only known how I waited for that letter, how I hoped that you were coming to see me, how I cried when I read it.” The thought, while I was writing it, immediately on my return from her mother’s house, that I was perhaps helping to bring about that very misunderstanding, that thought, by the sadness in which it plunged me, by the pleasure of imagining that I was loved by Gilberte, gave me the impulse to continue my letter

    If, at the moment of leaving Mme. Swann, when her tea-party ended, I was thinking of what I was going to write to her daughter, Mme. Cottard, as she departed, had been filled with thoughts of a wholly different order. On her little ‘tour of inspection’ she had not failed to congratulate Mme. Swann on the new ‘pieces,’ the recent ‘acquisitions’ which caught the eye in her drawing-room. She could see among them some, though only a very few, of the things that Odette had had in the old days in the Rue La Pérouse, for instance her animals carved in precious stones, her fetishes

    For since Mme. Swann had picked up from a friend whose opinion she valued the word ‘dowdy’— which had opened to her a new horizon because it denoted precisely those things which a few years earlier she had considered ‘smart’— all those things had, one after another, followed into retirement the gilded trellis that had served as background to her chrysanthemums, innumerable boxes of sweets from Giroux’s, and the coroneted note-paper (not to mention the coins of gilt pasteboard littered about on the mantelpieces, which, even before she had come to know Swann, a man of taste had advised her to sacrifice). Moreover in the artistic disorder, the studio-like confusion of the rooms, whose walls were still painted in sombre colours which made them as different as possible from the white-enamelled drawing-rooms in which, a little later, you were to find Mme. Swann installed, the Far East recoiled more and more before the invading forces of the eighteenth century; and the cushions which, to make me ‘comfortable,’ Mme. Swann heaped up and buffeted into position behind my back were sprinkled with Louis XV garlands and not, as of old, with Chinese dragons. In the room in which she was usually to be found, and of which she would say, “Yes, I like this room; I use it a great deal. I couldn’t live with a lot of horrid vulgar things swearing at me all the time; this is where I do my work ——” though she never stated precisely at what she was working. Was it a picture? A book, perhaps, for the hobby of writing was beginning to become common among women who liked to ‘do something,’ not to be quite useless. She was surrounded by Dresden pieces (having a fancy for that sort of porcelain, which she would name with an English accent, saying in any connexion: “How pretty that is; it reminds me of Dresden flowers,”), and dreaded for them even more than in the old days for her grotesque figures and her flower-pots the ignorant handling of her servants who must expiate, every now and then, the anxiety that they had caused her by submitting to outbursts of rage at which Swann, the most courteous and considerate of masters, looked on without being shocked. Not that the clear perception of certain weaknesses in those whom we love in any way diminishes our affection for them; rather that affection makes us find those weaknesses charming. Rarely nowadays was it in one of those Japanese wrappers that Odette received her familiars, but rather in the bright and billowing silk of a Watteau gown whose flowering foam she made as though to caress where it covered her bosom, and in which she immersed herself, looked solemn, splashed and sported, with such an air of comfort, of a cool skin and long-drawn breath, that she seemed to look on these garments not as something decorative, a mere setting for herself, but as necessary, in the same way as her ‘tub’ or her daily ‘outing,’ to satisfy the requirements of her style of beauty and the niceties of hygiene. She used often to say that she would go without bread rather than give up ‘art’ and ‘having nice things about her,’ and that the burning of the ‘Gioconda’ would distress her infinitely more than the destruction, by the same element, of ‘millions’ of the people she knew. Theories which seemed paradoxical to her friends, but made her pass among them as a superior woman, and qualified her to receive a visit once a week from the Belgian Minister, so that in the little world whose sun she was everyone would have been greatly astonished to learn that elsewhere — at the Verdurins’, for instance — she was reckoned a fool. It was this vivacity of expression that made Mme. Swann prefer men’s society to women’s. But when she criticised the latter it was always from the courtesan’s standpoint, singling out the blemishes that might lower them in the esteem of men, a lumpy figure, a bad complexion, inability to spell, hairy legs, foul breath, pencilled eyebrows. But towards a woman who had shewn her kindness or indulgence in the past she was more lenient, especially if this woman were now in trouble. She would defend her warmly, saying: “People are not fair to her. I assure you, she’s quite a nice woman really.”

    It was not only the furniture of Odette’s drawing-room, it was Odette herself that Mme. Cottard and all those who had frequented the society of Mme. de Crécy would have found it difficult, if they had not seen her for some little time, to recognise. She seemed to be so much younger. No doubt this was partly because she had grown stouter, was in better condition, seemed at once calmer, more cool, more restful, and also because the new way in which she braided her hair gave more breadth to a face which was animated by an application of pink powder, and into which her eyes and profile, formerly too prominent, seemed now to have been reabsorbed. But another reason for this change lay in the fact that, having reached the turning-point of life, Odette had at length discovered, or invented, a physiognomy of her own, an unalterable ‘character,’ a ‘style of beauty’ and on her incoherent features — which for so long, exposed to every hazard, every weakness of the flesh, borrowing for a moment, at the slightest fatigue, from the years to come, a sort of flickering shadow of anility, had furnished her, well or ill, according to how she was feeling, how she was looking, with a countenance dishevelled, inconstant, formless and attractive — had now set this fixed type, as it were an immortal youthfulness

    Swann had in his room, instead of the handsome photographs that were now taken of his wife, in all of which the same cryptic, victorious expression enabled one to recognise, in whatever dress and hat, her triumphant face and figure, a little old daguerreotype of her, quite plain, taken long before the appearance of this new type, so that the youth and beauty of Odette, which she had not yet discovered when it was taken, appeared to be missing from it. But it is probable that Swann, having remained constant, or having reverted to a different conception of her, enjoyed in the slender young woman with pensive eyes and tired features, caught in a pose between rest and motion, a more Botticellian charm. For he still liked to recognise in his wife one of Botticelli’s figures. Odette, who on the other hand sought not to bring out but to make up for, to cover and conceal the points in herself that did not please her, what might perhaps to an artist express her ‘character’ but in her woman’s eyes were merely blemishes, would not have that painter mentioned in her presence. Swann had a wonderful scarf of oriental silk, blue and pink, which he had bought because it was exactly that worn by Our Lady in the Magnificat. But Mme. Swann refused to wear it. Once only she allowed her husband to order her a dress covered all over with daisies, cornflowers, forget-me-nots and campanulas, like that of the Primavera. And sometimes in the evening, when she was tired, he would quietly draw my attention to the way in which she was giving, quite unconsciously, to her pensive hands the uncontrolled, almost distraught movement of the Virgin who dips her pen into the inkpot that the angel holds out to her, before writing upon the sacred page on which is already traced the word ‘Magnificat.’ But he added, “Whatever you do, don’t say anything about it to her; if she knew she was doing it, she would change her pose at once.”

    Save at these moments of involuntary relaxation, in which Swann essayed to recapture the melancholy cadence of Botticelli, Odette seemed now to be cut out in a single figure, wholly confined within a line which, following the contours of the woman, had abandoned the winding paths, the capricious re-entrants and salients, the radial points, the elaborate dispersions of the fashions of former days, but also, where it was her anatomy that went wrong by making unnecessary digressions within or without the ideal circumference traced for it, was able to rectify, by a bold stroke, the errors of nature, to make up, along a whole section of its course, for the failure as well of the human as of the textile element. The pads, the preposterous ‘bustle’ had disappeared, as well as those tailed corsets which, projecting under the skirt and stiffened by rods of whalebone, had so long amplified Odette with an artificial stomach and had given her the appearance of being composed of several incongruous pieces which there was no individuality to bind together. The vertical fall of fringes, the curve of trimmings had made way for the inflexion of a body which made silk palpitate as a siren stirs the waves, gave to cambric a human expression now that it had been liberated, like a creature that had taken shape and drawn breath, from the long chaos and nebulous envelopment of fashions at length dethroned. But Mme. Swann had chosen, had contrived to preserve some vestiges of certain of these, in the very thick of the more recent fashions that had supplanted them. When in the evening, finding myself unable to work and feeling certain that Gilberte had gone to the theatre with friends, I paid a surprise visit to her parents, I used often to find Mme. Swann in an elegant dishabille the skirt of which, of one of those rich dark colours, blood-red or orange, which seemed always as though they meant something very special, because they were no longer the fashion, was crossed diagonally, though not concealed, by a broad band of black lace which recalled the flounces of an earlier day. When on a still chilly afternoon in Spring she had taken me (before my rupture with her daughter) to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, under her coat, which she opened or buttoned up according as the exercise made her feel warm, the dog-toothed border of her blouse suggested a glimpse of the lapel of some non-existent waistcoat such as she had been accustomed to wear, some years earlier, when she had liked their edges to have the same slight indentations; and her scarf — of that same ‘Scotch tartan’ to which she had remained faithful, but whose tones she had so far softened, red becoming pink and blue lilac, that one might almost have taken it for one of those pigeon’s-breast taffetas which were the latest novelty — was knotted in such a way under her chin, without one’s being able to make out where it was fastened, that one could not help being reminded of those bonnet-strings which were — now no longer worn. She need only ‘hold out’ like this for a little longer and young men attempting to understand her theory of dress would say: “Mme. Swann is quite a period in herself, isn’t she?” As in a fine literary style which overlays with its different forms and so strengthens a tradition which lies concealed among them, so in Mme. Swann’s attire those half-hinted memories of waistcoats or of ringlets, sometimes a tendency, at once repressed, towards the ‘all aboard,’ or even a distant and vague allusion to the ‘chase me’ kept alive beneath the concrete form the unfinished likeness of other, older forms which you would not have succeeded, now, in making a tailor or a dressmaker reproduce, but about which your thoughts incessantly hovered, and enwrapped Mme. Swann in a cloak of nobility — perhaps because the sheer uselessness of these fripperies made them seem meant to serve some more than utilitarian purpose, perhaps because of the traces they preserved of vanished years, or else because there was a sort of personality permeating this lady’s wardrobe, which gave to the most dissimilar of her costumes a distinct family likeness. One felt that she did not dress simply for the comfort or the adornment of her body; she was surrounded by her garments as by the delicate and spiritualised machinery of a whole form of civilisation

    When Gilberte, who, as a rule, gave her tea-parties on the days when her mother was ‘at home,’ had for some reason to go out, and I was therefore free to attend Mme. Swann’s ‘kettledrum,’ I would find her dressed in one of her lovely gowns, some of which were of taffeta, others of gros-grain, or of velvet, or of crêpe-de-Chine, or satin or silk, gowns which, not being loose like those that she generally wore in the house but buttoned up tight as though she were just going out in them, gave to her stay-at-home laziness on those afternoons something alert and energetic. And no doubt the daring simplicity of their cut was singularly appropriate to her figure and to her movements, which her sleeves appeared to be symbolising in colours that varied from day to day: one would have said that there was a sudden determination in the blue velvet, an easy-going good humour in the white taffeta, and that a sort of supreme discretion full of dignity in her way of holding out her arm had, in order to become visible, put on the appearance, dazzling with the smile of one who had made great sacrifices, of the black crêpe-de-Chine. But at the same time these animated gowns took from the complication of their trimmings, none of which had any practical value or served any conceivable purpose, something detached, pensive, secret, in harmony with the melancholy which Mme. Swann never failed to shew, at least in the shadows under her eyes and the drooping arches of her hands. Beneath the profusion of sapphire charms, enamelled four-leaf clovers, silver medals, gold medallions, turquoise amulets, ruby chains and topaz chestnuts there would be, on the dress itself, some design carried out in colour which pursued across the surface of an inserted panel a preconceived existence of its own, some row of little satin buttons, which buttoned nothing and could not be unbuttoned, a strip of braid that sought to please the eye with the minuteness, the discretion of a delicate reminder; and these, as well as the trinkets, had the effect — for otherwise there would have been no possible justification of their presence — of disclosing a secret intention, being a pledge of affection, keeping a secret, ministering to a superstition, commemorating a recovery from sickness, a granted wish, a love affair or a ‘philippine.’ And now and then in the blue velvet of the bodice a hint of ‘slashes,’ in the Henri II style, in the gown of black satin a slight swelling which, if it was in the sleeves, just below the shoulders, made one think of the ‘leg of mutton’ sleeves of 1830, or if, on the other hand, it was beneath the skirt, with its Louis XV paniers, gave the dress a just perceptible air of being ‘fancy dress’ and at all events, by insinuating beneath the life of the present day a vague reminiscence of the past, blended with the person of Mme. Swann the charm of certain heroines of history or romance. And if I were to draw her attention to this: “I don’t play golf,” she would answer, “like so many of my friends. So I should have no excuse for going about, as they do, in sweaters.”

    In the confusion of her drawing-room, on her way from shewing out one visitor, or with a plateful of cakes to ‘tempt’ another, Mme. Swann as she passed by me would take me aside for a moment: “I have special instructions from Gilberte that you are to come to luncheon the day after to-morrow. As I wasn’t sure of seeing you here, I was going to write to you if you hadn’t come.” I continued to resist. And this resistance was costing me steadily less and less, because, however much one may love the poison that is destroying one, when one has compulsorily to do without it, and has had to do without it for some time past, one cannot help attaching a certain value to the peace of mind which one had ceased to know, to the absence of emotion and suffering. If one is not altogether sincere in assuring oneself that one does not wish ever to see again her whom one loves, one would not be a whit more sincere in saying that one would like to see her. For no doubt one can endure her absence only when one promises oneself that it shall not be for long, and thinks of the day on which one shall see her again, but at the same time one feels how much less painful are those daily recurring dreams of a meeting immediate and incessantly postponed than would be an interview which might be followed by a spasm of jealousy, with the result that the news that one is shortly to see her whom one loves would cause a disturbance which would be none too pleasant. What one procrastinates now from day to day is no longer the end of the intolerable anxiety caused by separation, it is the dreaded renewal of emotions which can lead to nothing. How infinitely one prefers to any such interview the docile memory which one can supplement at one’s pleasure with dreams, in which she who in reality does not love one seems, far from that, to be making protestations of her love for one, when one is by oneself; that memory which one can contrive, by blending gradually with it a portion of what one desires, to render as pleasing as one may choose, how infinitely one prefers it to the avoided interview in which one would have to deal with a creature to whom one could no longer dictate at one’s pleasure the words that one would like to hear on her lips, but from whom one would meet with fresh coldness, unlooked-for violence. We know, all of us, when we no longer love, that forgetfulness, that even a vague memory do not cause us so much suffering as an ill-starred love. It was of such forgetfulness that in anticipation I preferred, without acknowledging it to myself, the reposeful tranquillity

    Moreover, whatever discomfort there may be in such a course of psychical detachment and isolation grows steadily less for another reason, namely that it weakens while it is in process of healing that fixed obsession which is a state of love. Mine was still strong enough for me to be able to count upon recapturing my old position in Gilberte’s estimation, which in view of my deliberate abstention must, it seemed to me, be steadily increasing; in other words each of those calm and melancholy days on which I did not see her, coming one after the other without interruption, continuing too without prescription (unless some busy-body were to meddle in my affairs), was a day not lost but gained. Gained to no purpose, it might be, for presently they would be able to pronounce that I was healed. Resignation, modulating our habits, allows certain elements of our strength to be indefinitely increased. Those — so wretchedly inadequate — that I had had to support my grief, on the first evening of my rupture with Gilberte, had since multiplied to an incalculable power. Only, the tendency which everything that exists has to prolong its own existence is sometimes interrupted by sudden impulses to which we give way with all the fewer scruples over letting ourselves go since we know for how many days, for how many months even we have been able, and might still be able to abstain. And often it is when the purse in which we hoard our savings is nearly full that we undo and empty it, it is without waiting for the result of our medical treatment and when we have succeeded in growing accustomed to it that we abandon it. So, one day, when Mme. Swann was repeating her familiar statement of what a pleasure it would be to Gilberte to see me, thus putting the happiness of which I had now for so long been depriving myself, as it were within arm’s length, I was stupefied by the realisation that it was still possible for me to enjoy that pleasure, and I could hardly wait until next day, when I had made up my mind to take Gilberte by surprise, in the evening, before dinner

    What helped me to remain patient throughout the long day that followed was another plan that I had made. From the moment in which everything was forgotten, in which I was reconciled to Gilberte, I no longer wished to visit her save as a lover. Every day she should receive from me the finest flowers that grew. And if Mme. Swann, albeit she had no right to be too severe a mother, should forbid my making a daily offering of flowers, I should find other gifts, more precious and less frequent. My parents did not give me enough money for me to be able to buy expensive things. I thought of a big bowl of old Chinese porcelain which had been left to me by aunt Léonie, and of which Mamma prophesied daily that Françoise would come running to her with an “Oh, it’s all come to pieces!” and that that would be the end of it. Would it not be wiser, in that case, to part with it, to sell it so as to be able to give Gilberte all the pleasure I could. I felt sure that I could easily get a thousand francs for it. I had it tied up in paper; I had grown so used to it that I had ceased altogether to notice it; parting with it had at least the advantage of making me realise what it was like. I took it with me as I started for the Swanns’, and, giving the driver their address, told him to go by the Champs-Elysées, at one end of which was the shop of a big dealer in oriental things, who knew my father. Greatly to my surprise he offered me there and then not one thousand but ten thousand francs for the bowl. I took the notes with rapture. Every day, for a whole year, I could smother Gilberte in roses and lilac. When I left the shop and got into my cab again the driver (naturally enough, since the Swanns lived out by the Bois) instead of taking the ordinary way began to drive me along the Avenue des Champs-Elysées. He had just passed the end of the Rue de Berri when, in the failing light, I thought I saw, close to the Swanns’ house but going in the other direction, going away from it, Gilberte, who was walking slowly, though with a firm step, by the side of a young man with whom she was conversing, but whose face I could not distinguish. I stood up in the cab, meaning to tell the driver to stop; then hesitated. The strolling couple were already some way away, and the parallel lines which their leisurely progress was quietly drawing were on the verge of disappearing in the Elysian gloom. A moment later, I had reached Gilberte’s door. I was received by Mme. Swann. “Oh! she will be sorry!” was my greeting, “I can’t think why she isn’t in. She came home just now from a lesson, complaining of the heat, and said she was going out for a little fresh air with another girl.” “I fancy I passed her in the Avenue des Champs-Elysées.” “Oh, I don’t think it can have been. Anyhow, don’t mention it to her father; he doesn’t approve of her going out at this time of night. Must you go? Good-bye.” I left her, told my driver to go home the same way, but found no trace of the two walking figures. Where had they been? What were they saying to one another in the darkness so confidentially?

    I returned home, desperately clutching my windfall of ten thousand francs, which would have enabled me to arrange so many pleasant surprises for that Gilberte whom now I had made up my mind never to see again. No doubt my call at the dealer’s had brought me happiness by allowing me to expect that in future, whenever I saw my friend, she would be pleased with me and grateful. But if I had not called there, if my cabman had not taken the Avenue des Champs-Elysées, I should not have seen Gilberte with that young man. Thus a single action may have two contradictory effects, and the misfortune that it engenders cancel the good fortune that it has already brought one. There had befallen me the opposite of what so frequently happens. We desire some pleasure, and the material means of obtaining it are lacking. “It is a mistake,” Labruyère tells us, “to be in love without an ample fortune.” There is nothing for it but to attempt a gradual elimination of our desire for that pleasure. In my case, however, the material means had been forthcoming, but at the same moment, if not by a logical effect, at any rate as a fortuitous consequence of that initial success, my pleasure had been snatched from me

    As, for that matter, it seems as though it must always be. As a rule, however, not on the same evening on which we have acquired what makes it possible. Usually, we continue to struggle and to hope for a little longer. But the pleasure can never be realised. If we succeed in overcoming the force of circumstances, nature at once shifts the battle-ground, placing it within ourselves, and effects a gradual change in our heart until it desires something other than what it is going to obtain. And if this transposition has been so rapid that our heart has not had time to change, nature does not, on that account, despair of conquering us, in a manner more gradual, it is true, more subtle, but no less efficacious. It is then, at the last moment, that the possession of our happiness is wrested from us, or rather it is that very possession which nature, with diabolical cleverness, uses to destroy our happiness. After failure in every quarter of the domain of life and action, it is a final incapacity, the mental incapacity for happiness, that nature creates in us. The phenomenon, of happiness either fails to appear, or at once gives way to the bitterest of reactions

    I put my ten thousand francs in a drawer. But they were no longer of any use to me. I ran through them, as it happened, even sooner than if I had sent flowers every day to Gilberte, for when evening came I was always too wretched to stay in the house and used to go and pour out my sorrows upon the bosoms of women whom I did not love. As for seeking to give any sort of pleasure to Gilberte, I no longer thought of that; to visit her house again now could only have added to my sufferings. Even the sight of Gilberte, which would have been so exquisite a pleasure only yesterday, would no longer have sufficed me. For I should have been miserable all the time that I was not actually with her. That is how a woman, by every fresh torture that she inflicts on us, increases, often quite unconsciously, her power over us and at the same time our demands upon her. With each injury that she does us, she encircles us more and more completely, doubles our chains — but halves the strength of those which hitherto we had thought adequate to bind her in order that we might retain our own peace of mind. Only yesterday, had I not been afraid of annoying Gilberte, I should have been content to ask for no more than occasional meetings, which now would no longer have contented me and for which I should now have substituted quite different terms. For in this respect love is not like war; after the battle is ended we renew the fight with keener ardour, which we never cease to intensify the more thoroughly we are defeated, provided always that we are still in a position to give battle. This was not my position with regard to Gilberte. Also I preferred, at first, not to see her mother again. I continued, it is true, to assure myself that Gilberte did not love me, that I had known this for ever so long, that I could see her again if I chose, and, if I did not choose, forget her in course of time. But these ideas, like a remedy which has no effect upon certain complaints, had no power whatsoever to obliterate those two parallel lines which I kept on seeing, traced by Gilberte and the young man as they slowly disappeared along the Avenue des Champs-Elysées. This was a fresh misfortune, which like the rest would gradually lose its force, a fresh image which would one day present itself to my mind’s eye completely purged of every noxious element that it now contained, like those deadly poisons which one can handle without danger, or like a crumb of dynamite which one can use to light one’s cigarette without fear of an explosion. Meanwhile there was in me another force which was striving with all its might to overpower that unwholesome force which still shewed me, without alteration, the figure of Gilberte walking in the dusk: to meet and to break the shock of the renewed assaults of memory, I had, toiling effectively on the other side, imagination. The former force did indeed continue to shew me that couple walking in the Champs-Elysées, and offered me other disagreeable pictures drawn from the past, as for instance Gilberte shrugging her shoulders when her mother asked her to stay and entertain me. But the other force, working upon the canvas of my hopes, outlined a future far more attractively developed than this poor past which, after all, was so restricted. For one minute in which I saw Gilberte’s sullen face, how many were there in which I planned to my own satisfaction all the steps that she was to take towards our reconciliation, perhaps even towards our betrothal. It is true that this force, which my imagination was concentrating upon the future, it was drawing, for all that, from the past. I was still in love with her whom, it is true, I believed that I detested. But whenever anyone told me that I was looking well, or was nicely dressed, I wished that she could have been there to see me. I was irritated by the desire that many people shewed about this time to ask me to their houses, and refused all their invitations. There was a scene at home because I did not accompany my father to an official dinner at which the Bontemps were to be present with their niece Albertine, a young girl still hardly more than a child. So it is that the different periods of our life overlap one another. We scornfully decline, because of one whom we love and who will some day be of so little account, to see another who is of no account to-day, with whom we shall be in love to-morrow, with whom we might, perhaps, had we consented to see her now, have fallen in love a little earlier and who would thus have put a term to our present sufferings, bringing others, it is true, in their place. Mine were steadily growing less. I had the surprise of discovering in my own heart one sentiment one day, another the next, generally inspired by some hope or some fear relative to Gilberte. To the Gilberte whom I kept within me. I ought to have reminded myself that the other, the real Gilberte, was perhaps entirely different from mine, knew nothing of the regrets that I ascribed to her, was thinking probably less about me, not merely than I was thinking about her but that I made her be thinking about me when I was closeted alone with my fictitious Gilberte, wondering what really were her feelings with regard to me and so imagining her attention as constantly directed towards myself

    During those periods in which our bitterness of spirit, though steadily diminishing, still persists, a distinction must be drawn between the bitterness which comes to us from our constantly thinking of the person herself and that which is revived by certain memories, some cutting speech, some word in a letter that we have had from her. The various forms which that bitterness can assume we shall examine when we come to deal with another and later love affair; for the present it must suffice to say that, of these two kinds, the former is infinitely the less cruel. That is because our conception of the person, since it dwells always within ourselves, is there adorned with the halo with which we are bound before long to invest her, and bears the marks if not of the frequent solace of hope, at any rate of the tranquillity of a permanent sorrow. (It must also be observed that the image of a person who makes us suffer counts for little if anything in those complications which aggravate the unhappiness of love, prolong it and prevent our recovery, just as in certain maladies the cause is insignificant beyond comparison with the fever which follows it and the time that must elapse before our convalescence.) But if the idea of the person whom we love catches and reflects a ray of light from a mind which is on the whole optimistic, it is not so with those special memories, those cutting words, that inimical letter (I received only one that could be so described from Gilberte); you would say that the person herself dwelt in those fragments, few and scattered as they were, and dwelt there multiplied to a power of which she falls ever so far short in the idea which we are accustomed to form of her as a whole. Because the letter has not — as the image of the beloved creature has — been contemplated by us in the melancholy calm of regret; we have read it, devoured it in the fearful anguish with which we were wrung by an unforeseen misfortune. Sorrows of this sort come to us in another way; from without; and it is along the road of the most cruel suffering that they have penetrated to our heart. The picture of our friend in our mind, which we believe to be old, original, authentic, has in reality been refashioned by her many times over. The cruel memory is not itself contemporary with the restored picture, it is of another age, it is one of the rare witnesses to a monstrous past. But inasmuch as this past continues to exist, save in ourselves, who have been pleased to substitute for it a miraculous age of gold, a paradise in which all mankind shall be reconciled, those memories, those letters carry us back to reality, and cannot but make us feel, by the sudden pang they give us, what a long way we have been borne from that reality by the baseless hopes engendered daily while we waited for something to happen. Not that the said reality is bound always to remain the same, though that does indeed happen at times. There are in our life any number of women whom we have never wished to see again, and who have quite naturally responded to our in no way calculated silence with a silence as profound. Only in their case as we never loved them, we have never counted the years spent apart from them, and this instance, which would invalidate our whole argument, we are inclined to forget when we are considering the healing effect of isolation, just as people who believe in presentiments forget all the occasions on which their own have not ‘come true.’

    But, after a time, absence may prove efficacious. The desire, the appetite for seeing us again may after all be reborn in the heart which at present contemns us. Only, we must allow time. Now the demands which we ourselves make upon time are no less exorbitant than those of a heart in process of changing. For one thing, time is the very thing that we are least willing to allow, for our own suffering is keen and we are anxious to see it brought to an end. And then, too, the interval of time which the other heart needs to effect its change our own heart will have spent in changing itself also, so that when the goal which we had set ourselves becomes attainable it will have ceased to count as a goal, or to seem worth attaining. This idea, however, that it will be attainable, that what, when it no longer spells any good fortune to us, we shall ultimately secure is not good fortune, this idea embodies a part, but a part only of the truth. Our good fortune accrues to us when we have grown indifferent to it. But the very fact of our indifference will have made us less exacting, and allow us in retrospect to feel convinced that we should have been in raptures over our good fortune had it come at a time when, very probably, it would have seemed to us miserably inadequate. People are not very hard to satisfy nor are they very good judges of matters in which they take no interest. The friendly overtures of a person whom we no longer love, overtures which strike us, in our indifference to her, as excessive, would perhaps have fallen a long way short of satisfying our love. Those tender speeches, that invitation or acceptance, we think only of the pleasure which they would have given us, and not of all those other speeches and meetings by which we should have wished to see them immediately followed, which we should, as likely as not, simply by our avidity for them, have precluded from ever happening. So that we can never be certain that the good fortune which comes to us too late, when we are no longer in love, is altogether the same as that good fortune the want of which made us, at one time, so unhappy. There is only one person who could decide that; our ego of those days; he is no longer with us, and were he to reappear, no doubt that would be quite enough to make our good fortune — whether identical or not — vanish

    Pending these posthumous fulfilments of a dream in which I should not, when the time came, be greatly interested, by dint of my having to invent, as in the days when I still hardly knew Gilberte, speeches, letters in which she implored my forgiveness, swore that she had never loved anyone but myself and besought me to marry her, a series of pleasant images incessantly renewed came by degrees to hold a larger place in my mind than the vision of Gilberte and the young man, which had nothing now to feed upon. At this point I should perhaps have resumed my visits to Mme. Swann but for a dream that came to me, in which one of my friends, who was not, however, one that I could identify, behaved with the utmost treachery towards me and appeared to believe that I had been treacherous to him. Abruptly awakened by the nain which this dream had given me, and finding that it persisted after I was awake, I turned my thoughts back to the dream, racked my brains to discover who could have been the friend whom I had seen in my sleep, the sound of whose name — a Spanish name — was no longer distinct in my ears. Combining Joseph’s part with Pharaoh’s, I set to work to interpret my dream. I knew that, when one is interpreting a dream, it is often a mistake to pay too much attention to the appearance of the people one saw in it, who may perhaps have been disguised or have exchanged faces, like those mutilated saints on the walls of cathedrals which ignorant archaeologists have restored, fitting the body of one to the head of another and confusing all their attributes and names. Those that people bear in a dream are apt to mislead us. The person with whom we are in love is to be recognised only by the intensity of the pain that we suffer. From mine I learned that, though transformed while I was asleep into a young man, the person whose recent betrayal still hurt me was Gilberte. I remembered then that, the last time I had seen her, on the day when her mother had forbidden her to go out to a dancing-lesson, she had, whether in sincerity or in make-believe, declined, laughing in a strange manner, to believe in the genuineness of my feeling for her. And by association this memory brought back to me another. Long before that, it had been Swann who would not believe in my sincerity, nor that I was a suitable friend for Gilberte. In vain had I written to him, Gilberte had brought back my letter and had returned it to me with the same incomprehensible laugh. She had not returned it to me at once: I remembered now the whole of that scene behind the clump of laurels. As soon as one is unhappy one becomes moral. Gilberte’s recent antipathy for me seemed to me a judgment delivered on me by life for my conduct that afternoon. Such judgments one imagines one can escape because one looks out for carriages when one is crossing the street, and avoids obvious dangers. But there are others that take effect within us. The accident comes from the side to which one has not been looking, from inside, from the heart. Gilberte’s words: “If you like, we might go on wrestling,” made me shudder. I imagined her behaving like that, at home perhaps, in the linen-room, with the young man whom I had seen escorting her along the Avenue des Champs-Elysées. And so, just as when, a little time back, I had believed myself to be calmly established in a state of happiness, it had been fatuous in me, now that I had abandoned all thought of happiness, to take for granted that at least I had grown and was going to remain calm. For, so long as our heart keeps enshrined with any permanence the image of another person, it is not only our happiness that may at any moment be destroyed; when that happiness has vanished, when we have suffered, and, later, when we have succeeded in lulling our sufferings to sleep, the thing then that is as elusive, as precarious as ever our happiness was, is our calm. Mine returned to me in the end, for the cloud which, lowering our resistance, tempering our desires, has penetrated, in the train of a dream, the enclosure of our mind, is bound, in course of time, to dissolve, permanence and stability being assured to nothing in this world, not even to grief. Besides, those whose suffering is due to love are, as we say of certain invalids, their own physicians. As consolation can come to them only from the person who is the cause of their grief, and as their grief is an emanation from that person, it is there, in their grief itself, that they must in the end find a remedy: which it will disclose to them at a given moment, for as long as they turn it over in their minds this grief will continue to shew them fresh aspects of the loved, the regretted creature, at one moment so intensely hateful that one has no longer the slightest desire to see her, since before finding enjoyment in her company one would have first to make her suffer, at another so pleasant that the pleasantness in which one has invested her one adds to her own stock of good qualities and finds in it a fresh reason for hope. But even although the anguish that had reawakened in me did at length grow calm, I no longer wished — except just occasionally — to visit Mme. Swann. In the first place because, among those who love and have been forsaken, the state of incessant — even if unconfessed — expectancy in which they live undergoes a spontaneous transformation, and, while to all appearance unchanged, substitutes for its original elements others that are precisely the opposite. The first were the consequences of — a reaction from — the painful incidents which had upset us. The tension of waiting for what is yet to come is mingled with fear, all the more since we desire at such moments, should no message come to us from her whom we love, to act for ourselves, and are none too confident of the success of a step which, once we have taken it, we may find it impossible to follow up. But presently, without our having noticed any change, this tension, which still endures, is sustained, we discover, no longer by our recollection of the past but by anticipation of an imaginary future. From that moment it is almost pleasant. Besides, the first state, by continuing for some time, has accustomed us to living in expectation. The suffering that we felt during those last meetings survives in us still, but is already lulled to sleep. We are in no haste to arouse it, especially as we do not see very clearly what to ask for now. The possession of a little more of the woman whom we love would only make more essential to us the part that we did not yet possess, which is bound to remain, whatever happens, since our requirements are begotten of our satisfactions, an irreducible quantity

    Another, final reason came later on to reinforce this, and to make me discontinue altogether my visits to Mme. Swann. This reason, slow in revealing itself, was not that I had now forgotten Gilberte but that I must make every effort to forget her as speedily as possible. No doubt, now that the keen edge of my suffering was dulled, my visits to Mme. Swann had become once again, for what sorrow remained in me, the sedative and distraction which had been so precious to me at first. But what made the sedative efficacious made the distraction impossible, namely that with these visits the memory of Gilberte was intimately blended. The distraction would be of no avail to me unless it was employed to combat a sentiment which the presence of Gilberte no longer nourished, thoughts, interests, passions in which Gilberte should have no part. These states of consciousness, to which the person whom we love remains a stranger, then occupy a place which, however small it may be at first, is always so much reconquered from the love that has been in unchallenged possession of our whole soul. We must seek to encourage these thoughts, to make them grow, while the sentiment which is no more now than a memory dwindles, so that the new elements introduced into our mind contest with that sentiment, wrest from it an ever increasing part of our soul, until at last the victory is complete. I decided that this was the only way in which my love could be killed, and I was still young enough, still courageous enough to undertake the attempt, to subject myself to that most cruel grief which springs from the certainty that, whatever time one may devote to the effort, it will prove successful in the end. The reason I now gave in my letters to Gilberte for refusing to see her was an allusion to some mysterious misunderstanding, wholly fictitious, which was supposed to have arisen between her and myself, and as to which I had hoped at first that Gilberte would insist upon my furnishing her with an explanation. But, as a matter of fact, never, even in the most insignificant relations in life, does a request for enlightenment come from a correspondent who knows that an obscure, untruthful, incriminating sentence has been written on purpose, so that he shall protest against it, and is only too glad to feel, when he reads it, that he possesses — and to keep in his own hands — the initiative in the coming operations. For all the more reason is this so in our more tender relations, in which love is endowed with so much eloquence, indifference with so little curiosity. Gilberte having never appeared to doubt nor sought to learn more about this misunderstanding, it became for me a real entity, to which I referred anew in every letter. And there is in these baseless situations, in the affectation of coldness, a sort of fascination which tempts one to persevere in them. By dint of writing: “Now that our hearts are sundered,” so that Gilberte might answer: “But they are not. Do explain what you mean,” I had gradually come to believe that they were. By constantly repeating, “Life may have changed for us, it will never destroy the feeling that we had for one another,” in the hope of hearing myself, one day, say: “But there has been no change, the feeling is stronger now than ever it was,” I was living with the idea that life had indeed changed, that we should keep only the memory of a feeling which no longer existed, as certain neurotics, from having at first pretended to be ill, end by becoming chronic invalids. Now, whenever I had to write to Gilberte, I brought my mind back to this imagined change, which, being now tacitly admitted by the silence which she preserved with regard to it in her replies, would in future subsist between us. Then Gilberte ceased to make a point of ignoring it. She too adopted my point of view; and, as in the speeches at official banquets, when the foreign Sovereign who is being entertained adopts practically the same expressions as have just been used by the Sovereign who is entertaining him, whenever I wrote to Gilberte: “Life may have parted us; the memory of the days when we knew one another will endure,” she never failed to respond: “Life may have parted us; it cannot make us forget those happy hours which will always be dear to us both,” (though we should have found it hard to say why or how ‘Life’-had parted us, or what change had occurred). My sufferings were no longer excessive. And yet, one day when I was telling her in a letter that I had heard of the death of our old barley-sugar woman in the Champs-Elysées, as I wrote the words: “I felt at once that this would distress you, in me it awakened a host of memories,” I could not restrain myself from bursting into tears when I saw that I was speaking in the past tense, as though it were of some dead friend, now almost forgotten, of this love of which in spite of myself I had never ceased to think as of a thing still alive, or one that at least might be born again. Nothing can be more affectionate than this sort of correspondence between friends who do not wish to see one another any more. Gilberte’s letters to me had all the delicate refinement of those which I used to write to people who did not matter, and shewed me the same apparent marks of affection, which it was so pleasant for me to receive from her

    But, as time went on, every refusal to see her disturbed me less. And as she became less dear to me, my painful memories were no longer strong enough to destroy by their incessant return the growing pleasure which I found in thinking of Florence, or of Venice. I regretted, at such moments, that I had abandoned the idea of diplomacy, and had condemned myself to a sedentary existence, in order not to be separated from a girl whom I should not see again and had already almost forgotten. We construct our house of life to suit another person, and when at length it is ready to receive her that person does not come; presently she is dead to us, and we live on, a prisoner within the walls which were intended only for her. If Venice seemed to my parents to be a long way off, and its climate treacherous, it was at least quite easy for me to gov without tiring myself, and settle down at Balbec. But to do that I should have had to leave Paris, to forego those visits thanks to which, infrequent as they were, I might sometimes hear Mme. Swann telling me about her daughter. Besides, I was beginning to find in them various pleasures in which Gilberte had no part

    When spring drew round, and with it the cold weather, during an icy Lent and the hailstorms of Holy Week, as Mme. Swann began to find it cold in the house, I used often to see her entertaining her guests in her furs, her shivering hands and shoulders hidden beneath the gleaming white carpet of an immense rectangular muff and a cape, both of ermine, which she had not taken off on coming in from her drive, and which suggested the last patches of the snows of winter, more persistent than the rest, which neither the heat of the fire nor the advancing season had succeeded in melting. And the whole truth about these glacial but already flowering weeks was suggested to me in this drawing-room, which soon I should be entering no more, by other more intoxicating forms of whiteness, that for example of the guelder-roses clustering, at the summits of their tall bare stalks, like the rectilinear trees in pre-Raphaelite paintings, their balls of blossom, divided yet composite, white as annunciating angels and breathing a fragrance as of lemons. For the mistress of Tansonville knew that April, even an ice-bound April, was not barren of flowers, that winter, spring, summer are not held apart by barriers as hermetic as might be supposed by the town-dweller who, until the first hot day, imagines the world as containing nothing but houses that stand naked in the rain. That Mme. Swann was content with the consignments furnished by her Combray gardener, that she did not, by the intervention of her own ‘special’ florist, fill up the gaps left by an insufficiently powerful magic with subsidies borrowed from a precocious Mediterranean shore, I do not for a moment suggest, nor did it worry me at the time. It was enough to fill me with longing for country scenes that, overhanging the loose snowdrifts of the muff in which Mme. Swann kept her hands, the guelder-rose snow-balls (which served very possibly in the mind of my hostess no other purpose than to compose, on the advice of Bergotte, a ‘Symphony in White’ with her furniture and her garments) reminded me that what the Good Friday music in Parsifal symbolised was a natural miracle which one could see performed every year, if one had the sense to look for it, and, assisted by the acid and heady perfume of the other kinds of blossom, which, although their names were unknown to me, had brought me so often to a standstill to gaze at them on my walks round Combray, made Mme. Swann’s drawing-room as virginal, as candidly ‘in bloom,’ without the least vestige of greenery, as overladen with genuine scents of flowers as was the little lane by Tansonville

    But it was still more than I could endure that these memories should be recalled to me. There was a risk of their reviving what little remained of my love for Gilberte. Besides, albeit I no longer felt the least distress during these visits to Mme. Swann, I extended the intervals between them and endeavoured to see as little of her as possible. At most, since I continued not to go out of Paris, I allowed myself an occasional walk with her. Fine weather had come at last, and the sun was hot. As I knew that before luncheon Mme. Swann used to go out every day for an hour, and would stroll for a little in the Avenue du Bois, near the Etoile — a spot which, at that time, because of the people who used to collect there to gaze at the ‘swells’ whom they knew only by name, was known as the ‘Shabby-Genteel Club’— I persuaded my parents, on Sundays (for on weekdays I was busy all morning), to let me postpone my luncheon until long after theirs, until a quarter past one, and go for a walk before it. During May, that year, I never missed a Sunday, for Gilberte had gone to stay with friends in the country. I used to reach the Arc de Triomphe about noon. I kept watch at the entrance to the Avenue, never taking my eyes off the corner of the side-street along which Mme. Swann, who had only a few yards to walk, would come from her house. As by this time many of the people who had been strolling there were going home to luncheon, those who remained were few in number and, for the most part, fashionably dressed. Suddenly, on the gravelled path, unhurrying, cool, luxuriant, Mme. Swann appeared, displaying around her a toilet which was never twice the same, but which I remember as being typically mauve; then she hoisted and unfurled at the end of its long stalk, just at the moment when her radiance was most complete, the silken banner of a wide parasol of a shade that matched the showering petals of her gown. A whole troop of people escorted her; Swann himself, four or five fellows from the Club, who had been to call upon her that morning or whom she had met in the street: and their black or grey agglomeration, obedient to her every gesture, performing the almost mechanical movements of a lifeless setting in which Odette was framed, gave to this woman, in whose eyes alone was there any intensity, the air of looking out in front of her, from among all those men, as from a window behind which she had taken her stand, and made her emerge there, frail but fearless, in the nudity of her delicate colours, like the apparition of a creature of a different species, of an unknown race, and of almost martial strength, by virtue of which she seemed by herself a match for all her multiple escort. Smiling, rejoicing in the fine weather, in the sunshine which had not yet become trying, with the air of calm assurance of a creator who has accomplished his task and takes no thought for anything besides; certain that her clothes — even though the vulgar herd should fail to appreciate them — were the smartest anywhere to be seen, she wore them for herself and for her friends, naturally, without exaggerated attention to them but also without absolute detachment; not preventing the little bows of ribbon upon her bodice and skirt from floating buoyantly upon the air before her, like separate creatures of whose presence there she was not unconscious, but was indulgent enough to let them play if they chose, keeping their own rhythm, provided that they accompanied her where she led the way; and even upon her mauve parasol, which, as often as not, she had not yet ‘put up’ when she appeared on the scene, she let fall now and then, as though upon a bunch of Parma violets, a gaze happy and so kindly that, when it was fastened no longer upon her friends but on some inanimate object, her eyes still seemed to smile. She thus kept open, she made her garments occupy that interval of smartness, of which the men with whom she was on the most familiar terms respected both the existence and its necessity, not without shewing a certain deference, as of profane visitors to a shrine, an admission of their own ignorance, an interval over which they recognised that their friend had (as we recognise that a sick man has over the special precautions that he has to take, or a mother over her children’s education) a competent jurisdiction. No less than by the court which encircled her and seemed not to observe’ the passers-by, Mme. Swann by the lateness of her appearance there at once suggested those rooms in which she had spent so long, so leisurely a morning and to which she must presently return for luncheon; she seemed to indicate their proximity by the unhurrying ease of her progress, like the turn that one takes up and down one’s own garden; of those rooms one would have said that she was carrying about her still the cool, the indoor shade. But for that very reason the sight of her gave me only a stronger sensation of open air and warmth. All the more because, being assured in my own mind that, in accordance with the liturgy, with the ritual in which Mme. Swann was so profoundly versed, her clothes were connected with the time of year and of day by a bond both inevitable and unique, I felt that the flowers upon the stiff straw brim of her hat, the baby-ribbons upon her dress, had been even more naturally born of the month of May than the flowers in gardens and in woods; and to learn what latest change there was in weather or season I had not to raise my eyes higher than to her parasol, open and outstretched like another, a nearer sky, round, clement, mobile, blue. For these rites, if they were of sovereign importance, subjugated their glory (and, consequently, Mme. Swann her own) in condescending obedience to the day, the spring, the sun, none of which struck me as being sufficiently flattered that so elegant a woman had been graciously pleased not to ignore their existence, and had chosen on their account a gown of a brighter, of a thinner fabric, suggesting to me, by the opening of its collar and sleeves, the moist warmness of the throat and wrists that they exposed — in a word, had taken for them all the pains that a great personage takes who, having gaily condescended to pay a visit to common folk in the country, whom everyone, even the most plebeian, knows, yet makes a point of donning, for the occasion, suitable attire. On her arrival I would greet Mme. Swann, she stop me and say (in English) ‘Good morning,’ and smile. We would walk a little way together. And I learned then that these canons according to which she dressed, it was for her own satisfaction that she obeyed them, as though yielding to a Superior Wisdom of which she herself was High Priestess: for if it should happen that, feeling too warm, she threw open or even took off altogether and gave me to carry the jacket which she had intended to keep buttoned up, I would discover in the blouse beneath it a thousand details of execution which had had every chance of remaining there unperceived, like those parts of an orchestral score to which the composer has devoted infinite labour albeit they may never reach the ears of the public: or in the sleeves of the jacket that lay folded across my arm I would see, I would drink in slowly, for my own pleasure or from affection for its wearer, some exquisite detail, a deliciously tinted strip, a lining of mauve satinette which, ordinarily concealed from every eye, was yet just as delicately fashioned as the outer parts, like those gothic carvings on a cathedral, hidden on the inside of a balustrade eighty feet from the ground, as perfect as are the bas-reliefs over the main porch, and yet never seen by any living man until, happening to pass that way upon his travels, an artist obtains leave to climb up there among them, to stroll in the open air, sweeping the whole town with a comprehensive gaze, between the soaring towers

    What enhanced this impression that Mme. Swann was walking in the Avenue as though along the paths of her own garden, was — for people ignorant of her habit of ‘taking exercise’— that she had come there on foot, without any carriage following, she whom, once May had begun, they were accustomed to see, behind the most brilliant ‘turn-out,’ the smartest liveries in Paris, gently and majestically seated, like a goddess, in the balmy air of an immense victoria on eight springs. On foot Mme. Swann had the appearance — especially as her pace began to slacken in the heat of the sun — of having yielded to curiosity, of committing an ‘exclusive’ breach of all the rules of her code, like those Crowned Heads who, without consulting anyone, accompanied by the slightly scandalised admiration of a suite which dares not venture any criticism, step out of their boxes during a gala performance and visit the lobby of the theatre, mingling for a moment or two with the rest of the audience. So between Mme. Swann and themselves the crowd felt that there existed those barriers of a certain kind of opulence which seem to them the most insurmountable that there are. The Faubourg Saint-Germain may have its barriers also, but these are less ‘telling’ to the eyes and imagination of the ‘shabby-genteel.’ These latter, when in the presence of a real personage, more simple, more easily mistaken for the wife of a small professional or business man, less remote from the people, will not feel the same sense of their own inequality, almost of their unworthiness, as dismays them when they encounter Mme. Swann. Of course women of that sort are not themselves dazzled, as the crowd are, by the brilliance of their apparel, they have ceased to pay any attention to it, but only because they have grown used to it, that is to say have come to look upon it more and more as natural and necessary, to judge their fellow creatures according as they are more or less initiated into these luxurious ways: so that (the grandeur which they allow themselves to display or discover in others being wholly material, easily verified, slowly acquired, the lack of it hard to compensate) if such women place a passer-by in the lowest rank of society, it is by the same instinctive process that has made them appear to him as in the highest, that is to say instinctively, at first sight, and without possibility of appeal. Perhaps that special class of society which included in those days women like Lady Israels, who mixed with the women of the aristocracy, and Mme. Swann, who was to get to know them later on, that intermediate class, inferior to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, since it ‘ran after’ the denizens of that quarter, but superior to everything that was not of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, possessing this peculiarity that, while already detached from the world of the merely rich, it was riches still that it represented, but riches that had been canalised, serving a purpose, swayed by an idea that was artistic, malleable gold, chased with a poetic design, taught to smile; perhaps that class — in the same form, at least, and with the same charm — exists no longer. In any event, the women who were its members would not satisfy to-day what was the primary condition on which they reigned, since with advancing age they have lost — almost all of them — their beauty. Whereas it was (just as much as from the pinnacle of her noble fortune) from the glorious zenith of her ripe and still so fragrant summer that Mme. Swann, majestic, smiling, kind, as she advanced along the Avenue du Bois, saw like Hypatia, beneath the slow tread of her feet, worlds revolving. Various young men as they passed looked at her anxiously, not knowing whether their vague acquaintance with her (especially since, having been introduced only once, at the most, to Swann, they were afraid that he might not remember them) was sufficient excuse for their venturing to take off their hats. And they trembled to think of the consequences as they made up their minds, asking themselves whether the gesture, so bold, so sacrilegious a tempting of providence, would not let loose the catastrophic forces of nature or bring down, upon them the vengeance of a jealous god. It provoked only, like the winding of a piece of clockwork, a series of gesticulations from little, responsive bowing figures, who were none other than Odette’s escort, beginning with Swann himself, who raised his tall hat lined in green leather with an exquisite courtesy, which he had acquired in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, but to which was no longer wedded the indifference that he would at one time have shewn. Its place was now taken (as though he had been to some extent permeated by Odette’s prejudices) at once by irritation at having to acknowledge the salute of a person who was none too well dressed and by satisfaction at his wife’s knowing so many people, a mixed sensation to which he gave expression by saying to the smart friends who walked by his side: “Whatl another! Upon my word, I can’t imagine where my wife picks all these fellows up!” Meanwhile, having greeted with a slight movement of her head the terrified youth, who had already passed out of sight though his heart was still beating furiously, Mme. Swann turned to me: “Then it’s all over?” she put it to me, “You aren’t ever coming to see Gilberte again? I’m glad you make an exception of me, and are not going to ‘drop’ me straight away. I like seeing you, but I used to like also the influence you had over my daughter. I’m sure she’s very sorry about it, too. However, I mustn’t bully you, or you’ll make up your mind at once that you never want to set eyes on me again.” “Odette, Sagan’s trying to speak to you!” Swann called his wife’s attention. And there, indeed, was the Prince, as in some transformation scene at the close of a play, or in a circus, or an old painting, wheeling his horse round so as to face her, in a magnificent heroic pose, and doffing his hat with a sweeping theatrical and, so to speak, allegorical flourish in which he displayed all the chivalrous courtesy of a great noble bowing in token of his respect for Woman, were she incarnate in a woman whom it was impossible for his mother or his sister to know. And at every moment, recognised in the depths of the liquid transparency and of the luminous glaze of the shadow which her parasol cast over her, Mme. Swann was receiving the salutations of the last belated horsemen, who passed as though in a cinematograph taken as they galloped in the blinding glare of the Avenue, men from the clubs, the names of whom, which meant only celebrities to the public, Antoine de Castellane, Adalbert de Montmorency and the rest — were for Mme. Swann the familiar names of friends. And as the average span of life, the relative longevity of our memories of poetical sensations is much greater than that of our memories of what the heart has suffered, long after the sorrows that I once felt on Gilberte’s account have faded and vanished, there has survived them the pleasure that I still derive — whenever I close my eyes and read, as it were upon the face of a sundial, the minutes that are recorded between a quarter past twelve and one o’clock in the month of May — from seeing myself once again strolling and talking thus with Mme. Swann beneath her parasol, as though in the coloured shade of a wistaria bower",Marcel Proust,Mista Grimm,1994,"[96, 97, 91, 80, 86, 86]",6

Phone check, collect call from the baller
Her mama said please don't call her

Seen one of my peers, ""What the fuck you doin in here?""
He said, ""One-eighty-seven on the enemy
And they treat me like I just shot a Kennedy!""
Deputy bitch thinks she's the Queen Bee
Ink on my thumb, index, and pinky
""Sir, what set you from?"" Play dumb
""General popu-la-tion""
Mama put your house up, and I can bounce up
Out this motherfucker, that's why I love ya
Out like a boss, with a half-pint of sauce
Got the shit sewed up like Betsy Ross

Cause we can play hookie in the Aqua Boogie
With concrete Nikes, ya gets no stripes
Livin unforgiven with the mic on
And punks runnin like roaches with the light on
And that's all the shit I'm startin
Bust a cap (ka-kow-POW) like Jerome on Martin
You lookin for a punk with benefits
Cause you got a baby, that take many shits
And you know I got a grip like a baby on a tit

369,Looking For Mr. Do Right,"[Intro:]
It's raining again
What time is it?
Man, I can't believe he done stood me up again
I don't deserve this
What kind of fool does he think I am?

Time after time
And today
But what for?
Huh, you know what?
I think it's time I've looked for Mr. Do Right

[Verse 1:]
Worked all day long
I need a man whose back is real strong
Someone to fulfill my intellect and sexual desires

Now, please
Don't get me wrong
I don't even come on strong
It's been awhile since I've been satisfied
And these feelings I can no longer hide

[Pre-Chorus:]
I used to be in love
But it was oh, so long ago
My mind and body's craving
For a real man to give me some love

But now that you're here with me
There's a smile upon my face
Cause loving you is so damn easy
And you sure 'nuff driving me crazy

[Chorus:]
Can't someone stop this rain from falling on my face?
I'm looking for Mister
Mr. Do Right
Someone who can do it all night

When will you learn playing with fire really burns
I'm searching for Mister
Mr. Do Right
Someone who can please me through the night

[Verse 2:]
I sit here waiting
You just won't call, no
My mind is so confused
But you don't seem to care at all

Now Lord knows I've tried
To keep our love alive
So I sing this song for you
Cause it seems like the right thing to do

[Repeat Pre-Chorus:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
You used to love me
(I need a real man)
I need a strong man
I need a Mr. Do Right

You don't hold me like you used to
My mind and body's craving
Oh yeah
For Mr. Do Right
Lord knows I've tried
Mr. Do Right

Don't keep me waiting, anticipating, oh
I worked all week long
I need a Mister
I need a man who's back is real strong
Fulfill me

370,The River Of Dreams,"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind

In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams

In the middle of the night

Hey, it's another Christmas Holiday
It's a joyous thing let the angels sing
Cause we're together
We got a thing here, can't let it slip away
Though outside is rain and sleet
When our bodies meet...
I don't care 'bout the weather

Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin'
So baby let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Verse 2]
Ohhhh, come over here and help me trim the tree
I wanna wrap you up baby
Then you'll see you're the only present I need
There's so much more
Waiting for you in store
From this precious day
I can gladly say
There's no place that I'd rather be
And ohhh, you are my everything, come a little closer
God must have sent you down from heaven

[Chorus]
Let it snow, let it snow
Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin'

Of this life, well, hang on

[Chorus]
Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts
Sometimes

[Verse 2]
Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (Hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (Hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well, hang on

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
And everybody hurts

[Bridge]
Don't throw your hand
Oh, no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone

[Verse 3]
If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much
Of this life to hang on

[Chorus]
Well, everybody hurts
Sometimes, everybody cries
And everybody hurts
Sometimes
And everybody hurts
Sometimes

[Outro]
So, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Everybody hurts
No, no, no, no, no, you're not alone",R.E.M.,R.E.M.,1994,"[92, 74, 68, 67]",4

Longtime mi watch ya mi wha chat to ya
And ya a gwaan like ya nuh wha chat to me
So whappn Dre tell em whe di fuck a gwaan nuh

[Verse 1]
Creeping down the back street on D's
I got my Glock cocked, cause niggas want these
No soon as I said it, seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a TEC-9, trying to take mine
You wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone call
My niggas coming like the Gotti boys
Bodies being found on Greenleaf
With their fucking heads cut off
Motherfucker, I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
Rolling in my '4 with 16 switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Clocking all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by
Cause I'm too hard to lift
And no, this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfucking D-R-E
From the C-P-T
On a rhyming spree, a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top, you trip
I let the hollow points commence to pop, pop, pop
Yeah, cause if it don't stop
I have to put my shit in reverse
Go back and take another spot

[Refrain: Snoop Dogg + Dr. Dre]
Cause I'm rolling in my 6-4
With all the niggas saying

[Hook: Jewell & Ruben Cruz + Dr. Dre]
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
With all the niggas saying
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

[Verse 2]
Just another motherfucking day for Dre, so I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks or black fists
It's just that gangsta glare
With gangsta raps
That gangsta shit
Makes a gangs of snaps
(Uh, word to the motherfucking streets)
And word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit you with
That I get you with
As I groove in my '4 on D's
Hitting the switches
Bitches relax, while I get my proper swerve on
Bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic
The Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smelling like indo-nesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick cause my '4 on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit
So when I crawl, I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip and make a trip to the south side
Yeah

[Refrain: Snoop Dogg + Dr. Dre]
Rolling in my 6-4
With all the bitches saying

[Hook: Jewell + Dr. Dre]
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
With all the motherfucking bitches saying
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Know what I'm saying?
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

[Verse 3]
Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slauson
On my way to the strip
Now I'm just flossin'
Checking my rearview
Cause niggas, they will do
Jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a 2-11
Fuck around and get caught up in a (1-8-7)
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynching
But I just watch 'em hang
So on and so on
Why don't you let me roll on?
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak
Now everybody peeping out they window
When they hear me beating up the street
Is it Dre? Is it Dre?
That's what they say
Every single motherfucking day
Yo, but I ain't tripping, I'm just kicking it
While my D's keep spinning and these hoes keep grinning I be

[Refrain: Snoop Dogg + Dr. Dre]
Rolling in my 6-4

383,The Song Remembers When,"I was standing at the counter
I was waiting for the change
When I heard that old familiar music start
It was like a lighted match
Had been tossed into my soul
It was like a dam had broken in my heart

After taking every detour
Getting lost and losing track
So that even if I wanted
I could not find my way back
After driving out the memory
Of the way things might have been
After I'd forgotten all about us
The song remembers when

We were rolling through the Rockies
We were up above the clouds
When a station out of Jackson played that song
And it seemed to fit the moment
And the moment seemed to freeze
When we turned the music up and sang along

And there was a God in Heaven
And the world made perfect sense
We were young and were in love
And we were easy to convince
We were headed straight for Eden
It was just around the bend
And though I have forgotten all about it
The song remembers when

I guess something must have happened
And we must have said goodbye
And my heart must have been broken
Though I can't recall just why
The song remembers when

Well, for all the miles between us
And for all the time that's passed
You would think I haven't gotten very far
And I hope my hasty heart
Will forgive me just this once
If I stop to wonder how on Earth you are

But that's just a lot of water
Underneath a bridge I burned
And there's no use in backtracking
Around corners I have turned
Still I guess some things we bury
Are just bound to rise again
For even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when
Yeah, and even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when",Trisha Yearwood,Trisha Yearwood,1994,"[98, 90, 82, 82]",4

[Mr. Funke] Huh?
[DoItAll] Turn your radio up!
[Mr. Funke] What?!
[DoItAll] It's us!
[Mr. Funke] It's US?!
[DoItAll] Yeah listen to the cut!
It's our style!
[Mr. Funke] Our style?
[DoItAll] Your style
[Mr. Funke] Stop brother
[DoItAll] Aiyyo nigga wake up, ""let me show you some-thin!""
Listen to the way they flip the metaphors and phrases
Listen, listen, it's drivin me CRA-ZY
Cause everytime I do a style and flip it kind of simple
Brothers say, ""That's fat,"" and do it on the demo
From a demo to a promo now a hit on the radio
Next thing you know, they'll be doing our video
[Mr. Funke] Same one?
[DoItAll] Same one! Concepts, whole nine
And crazy similarities to the whole rhyme
I'm not worried though (why?) I'm flippin hits from the grill
And in the underground only real stays real, so umm
Check the skills, the skills are kinda ill and yo
Here Come the Lords, cause we're here to make a kill!

(Here Come the Lords) 7X

[Mr. Funke] Aiyyo, Marley!
[Marley] Aiyyo whassup knocka?
[Mr. Funke] Do you hear these suckas tryin to clock the Lord Chief Rocka
[Marley] Yeah I hear em, they're just a bunch of clones on your bone
[Mr. Funke] Hold up, I'm tryin to figure out where could they get my style from
Aiyyo wait a minute, remember the tape you shopped around a while back?
[Marley] Yo what, wasn't that your boys?
[Mr. Funke] Now they got our stuff down pat!
[Marley] Yo man don't sweat it, just show em why they call you Mr. Funke
Yo Lord Jazz, pass me some of that Brass Brass Monkey

[Mr. Funke]
Here Come the Lords, Here Come the Lords, Mr. Funke don't you see me?
I told you we were comin, you suckas didn't believe me
The Skipper, my Lords style stick like Jack the Ripper
I'm hangin other rappers like your girl hangs on my zipper
Lord Jazz, hit me one time, make it funky
Stop being stingy knocka, pass that Brass Monkey
I step, off a stage, everyone knows, who I am
Grab the mic like Teddy Riley and I _Jam_ (chicka, aawww, Jam)
Give me the mic and watch me wax that ass *horn sample*
Keep the camera moving cause I'm kinda fast *horn sample*
You can trip, you can flip, you could even slip or dip
But you'll never ever rip, Funke style as good as this
Because you sound like you're drugged, you might as well be a singer
Your whimsy couldn't touch me if your name was Sticky Fingaz
So when I come around, don't try to be down, don't try to be down
Just dig the sound, cause here comes the Lords of the Underground

(Here Come the Lords) 7X

[DoItAll]
Well umm, open up the doors and yell, Here Come the Lords
Yell it loud yell it loud, let me hear it from a crowd
I packs em, _In the Closet_ like Michael Jackson
And love to hear the girls go OOH when I'm rockin
So catch it, no stutter in my flow but I wrecks it
And caught you on the dillz from my jam called _Check It_
Check it check it check it check it microphone check it
Yeah, you went wild, cause your moms digs my records
So come on, I'm takin you where the sun don't shine
The underground, but everything is fine
I rhyme, copacetic, unless it gets hectic
Your vocal chords'll get CRACKED, you gets no chloraseptic
So hit em, so chill, chill man chill
I know who used to be but now who's _Top Bill_
Well it's me, and yes, I am back by the Funke
Marley filled the House with Hits so you know The Lords are chunky
We stink, like pee-eww, funk from my shoe
But what about this funk, can two brothers like us do
But get down like James Brown and rock the whole town
Hah! And now The Lords have broke ground

(Let me) let me, come inside

If you want me, if you need me
(Let me) turn down all the lights
(I'll make you) I'll make you feel alright, tonight
Come inside, come inside

[Verse 1]
I'm thinking about you
The last time we made love
And I fantasize
So many things that I dream of
I wanna do with you baby
And tonight won't be the same
I wanna come inside I like to hear you call my name

[Bridge 1]
(Slowly) I'll give it to you baby
(Only) if you promise me you'll let your mind run free
Grab a hold and love me totally
I wanna slip and slide dip and dive
Do everything to make it alright tonight
Just let me come inside, oh baby

I can set your body on fire, or soothe your soul with ease
Just a kiss, I'll taste your sweet sweet lips
All of the passion I have inside of me
I know you won't forget

(Slowly) I'll give it to you baby

386,Hopelessly,"I walk the wire every night
I can't decide between wrong and right
I've lost control over the things i do
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

Now the one who never took a chance
Becomes a victim of circumstance
I've lost my way, now I'm so confused
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

All my dreams are far behind me
They don't matter anymore
I don't care about the things I could lose
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

Now the one who always played it safe
Becomes another who's lost his way
I can't believe it, though I know it's true
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

And all my dreams begin to blind me
And I was so confused
And I don't care about the things I could lose
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

I'm not gonna fight it, I'm gonna choose

387,Addams Family (Whoomp!),"[Round 1: Caustic]
I said what's up homie? Welcome to your own lobotomy
You may have sent Dirtbag Dan back to local comedy but ain't no one stopping me
We're at World Domination 6, right? The whole globe is watching me
Ain't that about a bitch? Like a Rone biography
I said my dude, I'm honestly happy for you
I thought you'd never be the champ son
Shit, we six bars into this title match and it's already better than the last one
I mean I'm way too advanced son, I can do shit that you've never did
That's why I gotta take his last breath before he get a second wind
I mean I heard you was gonna get personal with me, I must've got in his head
Y'all been begging for a king but instead you got a God in the flesh
You want your style...your style? Is as obvious as it gets
You rap like how bitches baby-talk to their pets
Like, ""Oh, you gon' rap like this you think you’ve got it handled
Oh. You gon' talk to Daniel like a cocker spaniel ARF!
Boy I catch you slipping on yo' campus while you flannel
Boy I gotta chopper knock you our your socks and sandals!""
Bitch so don't panic, your punches do no damage
I'll elbow turn your nose into nothing but bone fragments
Body blows, give him a bleeding heart like a hopeless romantic
I'm nomadic, I leave Earth with no hope of going home to my own planet
You my bro Adam, but that don't mean I won't go at him
Throw blows at him, bury him up to his throat and throw stones at him
You get cold feet? I toe tag you
You know that chrome Magnum
But that forehead cro magnon
My bullets hit you ricochet and hit Gully and Organik
I said they keep calling you a king but I think this king needs the boot
I mean honestly this whole chain needs a control+alt+delete and reboot
This guy called me a fucking ""weed"" man, but I think we can see the truth
I think he's just jealous of the weeds, at least weeds has some roots
I mean my dude, you dressed up like fucking Abraham Lincoln trying to gain some views
And then you rapped about freeing slaves while all the black people tried to escape the room
The craziest shit is
Out of all the angles this lame could use
It's funny you dress like Abe Lincoln but you're the one getting the chain removed
I'm way too smooth, you ain't never been great
Let's face facts Adam I'm already a legend today
But I swear to God the only thing black in your house is electrical tape
He probably calls the cops on his own shadow like, ""Stop him, he's getting away.""
You're a fucking faggot with no stripes
You wanna gamble but no dice
This fool Adam is so white he won't even reach in his bars
He's had everything handed to him his whole life
I said, he'll out write me and then out white me
You don't want to mess with dude
He's never struggled a day in his life, his parents put him on a pedestal
He's got a top five but no non-white rappers
He's got a tattoo right above his champ stamp that says #AllLivesMatter
He loves chai tea, tai chi
He hates Spike Lee, doing The Right Thing
He loves Skyping, typing, hiking, biking
Third Reiching, evidence hiding, stereotyping, racial profiling
Pretty much any white thing
Homie...you ain't anything like me
You ain't prepped for survival
Cause a year from now, nobody's gonna remember when you went viral
You may have cheated death before with Illmac' but now your destination is final
We can all judge this book by this cover cause the story ends with the title

[Round 1: Rone]
Roney Bae the King, formerly the prince
I call him ""cocker spaniel"" cause he's always been my bitch
Oh, so you're the super villain career ender
Well I dig that
I heard you even ended a marriage before, well that's a sick stat
But my rhymes change lives too, you doubt my impact?
Have you seen Big T lately? He's 170 with a six pack
World Domination
What? I gotta break him down geographically?
I mean Taiwan fucks with me
I guess I got that Taipei personality
I mean chicas want my Calvin's off
No strap to get my style across
Cause I rap like I got an Eagle that's the size of an albatross
I was whipping the drop Regal that's blacker than Don Cheadle
You're pall bearer, the jaw ring gon' say ""shells these are not Beatles""
Do you like your pops leave you
Horror script and the plots evil
And I already killed you once, my stories all got sequels
I'll run up on him like the Rocky steps
Slash him with a hockey stick
I killed him once, I gotta kill him again like he's a zombie flick
But there's no skeletons in my closet so this ain't another body
You're only as good as the dirt you have and you have nothing on me
I mean, I didn't cheat on my girl, not a whore in my house
But not because I have morals, let me just dispel that lie now
And not because of love, let me shoot that right down
I didn't cheat cause I was scared fucking Caustic would find out
Fucking Sherlock Holmes
He bides his time, thinking he's kinda sly
Stealing receipts, checking what I would buy like some kind of private eye
But I got hip to the game quicker, we're not painting the same picture
'kay wigger? There's a difference between a dirt digger and a grave digger
See, you're finished
Well...done, stick a fork him
The mortician, the 28.4 liter Ford engine
The unicorn, I'm Porziņģis in the form with it
I'm Ben Simmons on the floor spinning
A centaur while he's formed shifting but Caustic is just
Light and projection, it's pure physics
You had the same hair-beard combo as every pussy at Coachella
So you can not be hard, it's a simple little fact
Plus you have the same voice as the pig from Toy Story
So it's only right I dump that nickel in his back!
Yo, I'll hit your niece with the braces
Get her tea bagged 'til her teeth snag, I'm her new dentist
You fuck with Juventus I use your team flag as a skeet rag
I'll let the team shag
I could get half of your family tree bag
Your baby mom is 43, does speed and let's her jeans sag
Your baby mom looks like a drag queen, I'll get your queen dragged
Rip his beard off, do his Adam's apple like a speed bag
I don't care if Soul's punch was softer than a fucking bean bag
You got slapped and just stood there just like that shit was freeze tag
I mean, damn, Daniel!
I bet that pussy wet as dam Daniel
That pussy got man handled
He hit it then kick it out he told to go pan handle
Watch me grand stand you
{punching sounds} Van Damme you
{punching sounds} Damn Daniel you don't understand I'm snuffing your man's candle
Watch me back stab you, over and over again like the needle gone on a back tattoo
Check, check, Martin Havlat you
Fold him, zip him, knapsack you
Style on him, Rat Pack you
Whip my phone out, fucking battle and beat him then fucking Snapchat you
But wait, wait, wait, wait
Maybe, keeping it all rappity rap is keeping it too basic
So if I acted how you act, well, how would you take it?
Cause if I was you, I would probably name your girl and call her a hot mess
If I was you, I would take your statements out of context
If I was you, I'd go low and come at your pops next
If I was you, I'd probably blame you for Cadalack Ron's death
I mean, getting high, getting high - Listen to me Caustic! Listen to me Caustic!
Getting high in front of a recovery addict, why would he need that?
I can't believe that
So if I was you, I would probably blame you for his relapse
But I'm not you
I'm not you
I just know my friend would like to hear his name dropped
And I miss him
You miss him too?
Well I'ma put you in the same spot
Rest in peace, that's one

[Round 2: Caustic]
Ooh, he's gonna get personal with me
Oh gee golly wiz, I can't wait
Why don't you go drink some fucking bleach since you think being white's that great
You used to be my right hand man, now you don't deserve my handshake
Game Of Thrones shit, still the King Slayer even though my right hand fake
I said I wish a motherfucker would, I be chopping 'em down
Blocks will come out, I be making Mr. Booblaka Chilaka Boo sounds
When it comes to rapping bitch I've been snapping longer than locker room towels
I'll have you stretched on a table with the doctors around
Just to tell you you ass out like a hospital gown
Oh...so I was walking around thinking like, ""Dude
What would make Adam just madder than hell?
What would take all the wind outta his sails.""
Then he said, ""Well we should mention our girls names.""
Well, don't you date that bitch Allison Dale?
Yeah? Why don't you pass the message to that slut and tell her I can excel in every way that Adam has failed
If you look at her pictures, her eyes are sad you can tell
She's so used to having two hands grabbing her tail
And get her asshole impaled by more African males than a crack addict in jail
And that's hard...
You know, that's a hard thing to live up to
But he makes up for it with a strong back rub and a solid ""I love you""
He be kissing that bitch on the mouth like it's the love of his life
But deep down he knows he just ain't fucking her right
She's got the Black Snake Moan, she likes a little mud in her pipes
I don't even know why she fucks this guy
He's all types of bitch, he's got red lips and rosy cheeks
Who the fuck you supposed to be? Tyler Swift?
You fucking giant vagina lip
I don't get what part you're not understanding
I don't know any other man in the world that could've called to have a mirror match with a tranny
I mean this is the difference between us
Y'all looking at a glimpse of a genius
But with all these pussy ass feminine little physical features
We all agree, there's No Shame if you decide to get rid of your penis
Well hold on, I got a question
How come every time somebody mentions a time Rone got molested
His face immediately looks like he just got a Botox injection?
Now, it's my chance to get him so, I better get him
I mean, fans love to tell you what you can and can't talk about but you know me, I never listen
They said ""It's an automatic loss if you talk about Sandusky or any of his alleged victims.""
Well as far as I'm concerned if you getting defensive about getting molested then you probably got fucking molested with 'em
Now I know talking about Sandusky is played but y'all know I got a little something to say
To be honest Adam, I've studied your case
And I'm not saying that being molested makes somebody gay
But...you were on the track team
At any point did you consider just...running away?
Is that not something you would try?
I mean all those years of learning how to take a baton from behind
It's like you learned nothing from the guy
I mean maybe that's why your little album Committed was trash
You haven't dealt with all that shit from your past
Maybe all those Sandusky dicks in your ass changed your pitch when you rap
All those sexual assaults and you never did nothing back?
You got raped by your running coach, no wonder you sound like such a bitch on your tracks
See I like saying shit like that just to watch him get rattled
But if you wanna see some really weird shit, why don't you check out his Complement Battle?
Now, the second I turned it on I knew there was something fucking strange going down out here
But it did answer a long time question
Who's dick do you gotta suck to get a title shot around here?
And then you think and it's just you know, it's just Adam and Patrick
They're always coming up with the wackiest antics
You know, running around Canada, acting like faggots
But that's the part that makes me think somebody really raped you
Maybe you overplay the gay thing to cover up how uncomfortable it actually makes you
So while you were out there pretending to be a couple gay dudes
How about the fact that for all that gay shit you did, Pat never actually paid you?
Aw, this shit just got incredibly real
Aye, he done sucked a dude's dick and didn't even keep up his end of the deal
Adam calling every day and Pat's like, ""Don't worry Adam, you getting it still.""
And then you took him out to dinner in L.A. and you got fucking left with the bill
That's amazing, my dude Pat, screwed you for two stacks
And you didn't do shit bitch, what part of Philly did they do that?
I mean and I don't blame him, look at Pat, he'd fucking whoop his ass
He wasn't trying to scuffle but he played it like it was an accident but you actually kind of got hustled
I bet you was having Sandusky flashbacks yelling at Pat like, ""Why did I trust you?!""
It sucks Adam you just can't help but get fucked by the guys you look up to
I said you either real or you ain't dawg, there ain't no in-between
We ain't cut from the same cloth, I'm tailor made for the game or so it would seem
Cause when it comes to rhyming I'm on top if you know what I mean
You a cup of noodle, I'll peel your lid back just to blow off some steam
Infrared beams look like techno lasers
Dealership maintenance you just met your maker
So now's a good time to go ahead and accept your savior
Before I make the Devil your fucking next door neighbor
I said that's a sign you're a bitch, I ain't here to impress no haters
I said the deuce deuce is a good buy/bye, I protect my paper
In a fair one, you won't fare well, I don't respect yo' gangsta
Plus I got a piece so long it'll catch you later
Bitch

[Round 2: Rone]
Man, that fucking gangsta shit is the weirdest shit I've heard about you
I talked to the rest of the white battle rappers and to be honest
The fellas are getting worried about you
Bro, it's like you can't decide if you're Jamal or Geppetto
An Italian who acts black? Where you from, the Spaghetto?
Talking about this fake drug dealer shit
Selling, copping, never stopping
Bragging 'bout who he sold to, Benny, Robby, Jenny, Johnny
He even made a deal in a Denny's lobby with Hammurabi
Bro, you know who else sold weed before? Fucking everybody!
Bro, my little sister, sold packs of loud shit
You don't hear her bragging 'bout it
My grandma's stylist was packing ounces
Shit, so was my dad's accountant
If you do all this secret illegal shit then why would you tell us?
He's like, ""Gangsters move in silence
And did I mention I sell drugs?""
Well, I roof whatever drugs you got
I'm talking crack, pills, heroin
Even if it's legal drugs, I'm talking Advil, Claritin
I'll throw your bitch off the roof like I'm Dan Bilzerian
I'll throw your shoes on the phone line while your man's still wearing 'em
You wife her, I'll snipe her like click click boom, La Di Da Di
She on the patch then I'm Slick Rick smooth
I'll send a photo of the bands then send a dick pic through
That's the chicken and the beef like a McPick 2
But I got a top five reasons you should not rap
Number 1: you are a cable guy for Comcast
You know what? Fuck the list, we can stop flat
Reasons one through five, they are all that
Fucking cable guys deserve a special section of Hell
Where the Devil tortures them sometime between seven and twelve
Fucking Fairy the Cable Guy, our second battle isn't stressing me
But I feel like Matthew Broderick cause the Cable Guy is obsessed with me
So this for every time you said 'five' and showed up after six
This is for every stranger's toilet that you clogged with a massive shit
This is for every shitty operator y'all have ever had talk to me
Every one of them in India who claims they're down the block from me
Fucking cable companies are an inherently un-American symbol
Comcast runs a Monopoly and you just play the thimble
So I want remunerations for dealing with your faggot shit
So after I beat you, you're hooking me up with all of the sports packages
You know what? Fuck all the sports packages
I don't want sports packages let me be more accurate
I want the porn packages
Fucking Skinemax? Gimme that
Bunny Ranch? I fucks with that
He's already asked but here's something you should know about me now
If I can't have battle rap I will burn it to the ground
I mean, Dizaster's been ducking me like I'm not in that class
Dizaster's been ducking me like some kind of Math class
I heard Tay Roc run his mouth, how is he a threat?
Bro, I would take care of Roc like a Chia Pet
Bro, I would take care of Roc like a PG vet
Bro, I would take care of Roc like a vet PG
I whip Roc like Nash when he's MVP
I would get rid of Roc like it's NBD
I'll 30 Roc like the studios at NBC
And y'all might think I'm losing focus, but maybe you should know this
Before the battle I Instagram'd evidence that he doesn't write his own shit
So log onto @adamferrone to read every word now
Or just wait, cause we'll get into it in that third round

[Round 3: Caustic]
Yo, you mentioned my homie Ron...I swear to God I'm a writer
Bitch I could check this dick and feel nothing, I'm like Bonnie Godiva
They said, ""Caustic, did you see Day 1? 'Cane was snapping.""
I was like, ""Yeah, yes. But all his good lines were about me so I guess he still needs Caustic bars to get a major reaction.""
I said, oh you didn't buy nothing right, 'Cane?
What the fuck were you paying for when you made the transaction?
You know what? You can just walk around with this L but I guess Stranger Things have happened
I said my dude came
It was three years I was hoping that you'd change
But you're still the same bum begging for bars with loose change
I said you still got your mouth wrapped around another dude's name
You're like a shamed Olympian blaming the steroids for the poor decisions that you made
I said, Al can fucking blow me
At this point Al owes me some alimony
Acting like I snitched on somebody, no I just alerted my actual homie
About some fucking stranger who didn't pay me the fucking full amount that he owes me
But I'm no angle though
We've all gotten a couple bars along the way, you know?
But shit if we wanna talk about the ratio
I don't need a bunch of Facebook conversations posted to tell you what I gave to Rone
Oh...did you forgot?
When we were out there in England?
Don't Flop for the weekend
You couldn't finish your rounds cause you was too busy drinking
I gave you a whole round for Youthoracle right in front of you without even blinking
You're like, ""Hey, thanks Caustic I'm sorry I choked. But you don't write how I be normally speaking
But hey it'd be cool if we could keep this our little secret.""
Awww, you little fucking faggot dude
Aye, you mad at me?
What about a week before your battle with T
And didn't have much help to give you but I did give you a little something, didn't I, you manatee?

[Rone]
Never

[Caustic]
Never?
I mean imagine me
Bunch of people get credit for my writtens
But I can tell you like this, I've taken a lot less than I've given
So whoever's feeding you your information is telling you some fucking fiction
And besides, Erik Foreman helped you write this whole fucking battle so what's the fucking difference?!
No?
See, if you look at his name it'll prove that he's a hypocrite in the long run
Cause he likes to sit around and call people frauds even though you R-one
I said I know who I am, these battlers should have a natural fear
But this is your second title match
I've had bars in title matches for the last three and half years
And if you're confused, you think that shit is weird
And you don't think that shit is actually true
Then why aren't you taking a second and ask half of the fucking battlers in this room
But it's Rone!
It's Rone who they've given me
He composes it like a symphony
He's simply, says simple things a bunch of filler schemes and similes
But he hides it behind this whiny high pitched delivery
So you can't tell he's the least quotable rapper in King Of The Dot history
I mean every since you became a little mini-celebrity
You think you got all the answers like that guinea from Jeopardy
I'm sick of this fucking rich dickhead kid disrespecting me
The only privileged I ever had in my life was a fifth of Hennessy
And after I finish that I'm gonna find your little sister Stephanie
And dig her the fuck out like a hysterectomy
See him and Erik Foreman have been on the internet instant messaging
Desperately trying to discredit me
To make me lose I swear to God they'll do anything
But, I've got enemies
Got a lot of enemies but both you faggots 'bout to get the same vasectomy
But since you're a man of education let's look at it scientifically
You lost momentum while I gave it a simple transfer of energy
Cause if you break it down to the chemistry
Your volume to the masses doesn't have any density
Cause even in the most basic of matters
You just can't trust Adams cause they make up everything

[Rone]
You're a liar, bro, you're a liar

[Caustic]
I'm a liar? I'm a liar? That's your observation?
The best you got is a 2012 Photoshop conversation?
Suck a fucking dick, that shit is fucking finished
You're supposed to be a fucking champion, now you out here coming with gimmicks
Dude that shit is fucking actually true
If you were a real fucking champion you would've showed up to the event and interacted with fans like champions do
Your trend ended before you started, you're the Ed Hardy of battling dude
Dude, I was gonna retire after I won this shit
That's some shit I thought I never would say
I was just gonna take the chain and left y'all for dead
Then I thought about it, is that really how this legend will end?
Then I said, fuck it
I'd rather stay and break Pat's record instead!
Let's go!

[Round 3: Rone]
So this is not a regular battle round
You know, a verse on his weaknesses
So fuck a crowd, fuck a crown, these are personal grievances
So let's not mince words
You missed your first battle with Big T cause you were hungover from some bad coke
On Friday you're doing great, the next day you can't go
Once the fans had their money paid and that's why you're fucking fake
Cause you were in Chicago at the venue but couldn't go because a tummy ache?
Bro, what the eff is that?
How is he your expecting champ when he might miss any heavy scratch from a bout of the menstrual cramps?
Fuck losing any respect, mine for dude didn't exist
Cause I did the same drugs and was fine, your immune system's a bitch
But the very worst thing from the scene from that night
Worse than Mr. Free Drugs being a fiend for that white
Is your slogan, ""Free Drugs""
I was believing the hype
And then I watched you pay for those shitty drugs at a fucking premium price
I mean, what happened to the slogan, dawg? I really believed that
When I say ""Grandmom's favorite grandson,"" ask my grandmom, I really mean that
But yo, there's something bigger about your fame that has driven me insane
How you made your whole name off of ghostwriting for Arcane
But behind the scenes us battlers know you in a different way
You are the most notorious recipient of shared bars in the game
Oh y'all want names?
Y'all want names?
Fresco never gave you bars?
Fredo never gave you bars?
Frank Stacks never gave you bars?
D-Lor never gave you bars?
Fucking Reverse Live never gave you bars?
Fucking Real Deal never gave you bars?
Bro, fucking Marvwon never gave you bars?
Madness never gave you bars?
Bro, and that's the ones I know, imagine ones I don't
Imagine all his secrets if that's the stuff he shows
I mean the first time he called me for bars we weren't even bros then
It was against fucking Roosevelt and that was back in '010
It's really just incredible what he does behind the scenes

I watched five battlers give him bars for Mr. 13
Vers' Arsonal, Chedda Cheese, every battle it's obscene
Last year vers' Big T it was full four bar schemes
And you still skipped the battle after I directly gave you bars
So stop lying you are not genius that you claim you are
Battles on 24 hours notice really aren't that exciting for him
When you realize he probably has like 24 people writing for him
I mean, fucking getting bars, burning bridges, that just shows he's a selfish guy
His slogan ""Free Drugs"" that explains his health's decline
But after all his snitching it was on himself this time
Cause Mr. Free Drugs has always needed someone else's lines
And the way you vilified Arcane when you are ten times the cheater
That's like getting ethic lessons from fucking Carlos Mencia
Go and get your ghostwriters I guarantee they're not enough
Oh you write your own shit? Yeah so does Melania Trump
I said you really can't compare duke
I say shit they're scared to
You dig dirt, find someone that's written for me, I fucking dare you!
Bro, this is for all that bad karma you built up
All that cattiness displayed
Because all of that bad karma that comes back to you TODAY
So I hope you get STDs to what you said to Q-Shinobi
Based on what you said to K, I hope you lose one of your closest homies
For what you said to Caddy I wish you dope scared veins
And your mom deserves to die for what you said about Arcane
Based on Soul, I hope your girl moves away, far from you
From Jeff, I hope she cheats, just to make it hard from you
From Ex-I I hope you know the guy
And just to make it horrible
I hope it's one of your best friends from what you said to Arsonal
I hope they run a train on her from what you said to Cortez
I hope she gets a restraining order from what you said to Megadeath
Then I hope you get back together and the two of you have babies
And I hope that fucking kid's retarded from what you said to Matt Daley
Bro, you are a rat and a snake
That's just how I see him
This is bigger than rap beefing, both coasts or regions
So I'm not lobbying for a win and I don't care if you believe it
But any league where he's the champ isn't one I want to be in",King of the Dot,Tag Team,1994,"[96, 84, 84]",3

Yo, whassup? This is Tajai of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew
I'm chillin' with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
And my man Op', you know he's dope (Yo, yo, yeah)
But right now, y'know, we just maxin' in the studio
We hailin' from East Oakland, California
And, um, sometime,s it gets a little hectic out there
(Haha, we just chilling)
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill

[Verse 1: Opio]
Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a 40, swig it, you know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali
Gettin' weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration

[Verse 2: A-Plus]
I get inspired by the blunts too! (Too)
I'll front you (You), if you hang with a bunk crew (Chump)
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done
Take her home and quickly do this (Yep)
I need not explain this (Nah)
A-Plus is famous, so get the Amos

[Verse 3: Tajai]
Hey, Miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look great–let's grub now
A rubdown sounds flavor, later there's the theatre (That's nice shit)
We in the cut, the cinema was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

[Verse 4: Phesto]
Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip
Like handball, ‘cause the man's all that
All phat, I be the chill from 93 'til

Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill… from 93 'til

Huh, my black Timbs do me well (Yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (What?)
Another person's busy-ness, I cause dizziness
Until you stop acting like a silly bitch

[Verse 6: Phesto]
Yo, crews are jealous 'cause we get props
The cops wanna stop our fun, but the top
Is where we're dwellin', swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit, and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses, this bro's quick
They hit blunts and flip once
I'm chillin', ‘cause my crew's close, kid

[Verse 7: Tajai]
I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, ‘cause I'm an exception to the rule (Or not!)
I'm steppin' to the cool spots where crews flock
To snare a dip, or see where the shit that's flam-bee
Blam leakin' out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement
My ace been fattenin' up tracks
Time to get prolific with the whiz kid

[Verse 8: Opio]
Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks? We can max pumpin' fat tracks
Exchangin' facts about impacts, ‘cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers, brothers can't hack it
They lack wit, we got the mack shit
'93 to infinity–kill all that wack shit!

Ah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til (Uh-huh)
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 until
This is how we chill from 93 'til (Yeah)

I be coolin', school's in session, but I'm fresh in
Rappin', so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit
With my own clique, roll many backroads
With a fat stog' and blunts, foldin' runts
Holdin' stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin'

""Enjoy yourself -- every day above ground

1 A PROLOGUE 1
crawls up the screen -- with Narrator.

NARRATOR
In May 1900, Fidel Castro -- in an
effort to normalize relations with
the Carter Administration -- opened
the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the
apparent intention of letting some
of his people join their relatives
in the United States. Within seventy-
two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed
for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it
became evident that Castro was forcing
the boat owners to carry back with
them not only their relatives but the
dregs of his jail population. 3y the
time the port was closed 125,000
'Marielitos' had landed in Florida.
An estimated 25,000 had criminal
records. This is the story of that
minority -- those they call 'Los
Bandidos.'

The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a
stilleto and in the empty black void we:

We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and
then. We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally we
encompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --
muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and
on the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.
He is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken
cardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from
prison.

Tony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of
._ a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in,
trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.

Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As he
finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
handling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
not yet seen in Tony.
Someone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His
expression alters to uncertainty.
VOICE
Yes? ..Hello?..Who is this?
Tony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those
in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.
He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes
somebody in another phone booth and goes over.

Angel Frenandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
worn phone book in his hand.

Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the

68 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 68
The interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled
'with religious objects from macumba and waist-high black
Jesus statues in various corners. The floor is without
rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the
impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.

Stepping forward to the center of the living room like a
cautious cat is his ninteen-year-old sister Gina. Their
eyes lock.

TONY
(moved)
Hi Gina....

GINA
Tony?
She looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,
curly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and
large-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.
(She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in
Tony's possession.)

Tony, over her shoulder, opens the gift.

TONY
Hey pussycat, c'mon -- you think
they can keep a guy like me down?
Disengaging gently, he holds up the contents of the gift
box in font of her. It's a beautiful diamond locket to
wear around her neck. Her eyes open wide.

TONY
...yeah for you...and look -- here.
What I got written on it....
""To Gina From Tony. Always.""

GINA
It's beautiful Tony, it's just
beautiful....
The mother is amazed at the cost of the gift. Tony pulls
out another present, for her.

TONY
...for you too Mama, look....
Moving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an
exquisite peral necklace. She stares at it, doesn't take
it. Gina comes over, takes it for her.

GINA
it's beautiful...

INT. COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93
Subtitle appears:

COCHABAMBA, BOLIVA
Alejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy
hair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a
casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.

On his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with ""Alex'
written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex
with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His
eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the
continual excitement of his toys and his money.
Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in
proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte
position, his eyes swivelling to stare down the person who
might glance at him. He is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar
who is insecure to begin with.

Sosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing
lab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with mas,sive iron
kettles bubbling with coca paste...across to a row of ovens
where the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians
working there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey"" as he
passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his
vineyard.

SOSA
so this and my other factory 1 can
&&A guarantee production of 200
kilos refined every month of the
year. Problem is I have no steady
market. Some months I can't get rid
of fifty keys, other months I have to
do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh?
Nobody can run a business that way ---

OMAR
I know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got
the same problems up in Miami, the
demand varies for us too, month to
month....
Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his
skinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his
nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.

Tow, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to
look at a sample of the dried coke.
The Shadow stops, eyeballs him.

Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then
samples the coke off his thumb into his nose. Pause. His
expression says I like it. He moves on.
The Shadow moves with him.
SOSA
(meanwhile)
...Basically what I'm looking for is
somebody to share the risks with me,
somebody in the States who might
guarantee me something like-.-say
150 kilos a month.

The camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains
to a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings
from the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.
At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impas-
sively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar
and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the
glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.
He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements
of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, con-
stantly changing dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).

Omar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe
assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his
brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.

What do you suggest is a fair...?
Excuse me.
Interrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly
appears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves
him in.

Sosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda

Why?

The Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting to
Sinatra's ""Strangers In The Night'.
OWNER
All right, you coneheads, another
exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh? (X)
Now I want you to check out this next
hombre. I found him stoned in the
jungle and there's nothing you'll
ever see like him. I present with
great pride, 'from Caracas, Venezuela
-- 'Octavia' !

Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as
sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-
light drawing immediate laughter.
He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo
mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.
With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the
sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established,
the music suddenly shifts upbeat to ""Saturday Night Fever""
and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts
shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes
staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.
Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.
More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.
PJ%en the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome
face of a young clown in white paint with the large
blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
audience.
Tony is hooked by the image, looks on.
The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and
pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,
bouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing,
everybody is merry...

its close, a haunting figure of mockery....
Tony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time. His
antennae warn him. Out of the side of his eye, he sees....
The two hitters moving on him.
He sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,
smashing the mirrors....
Screams, crowd diving for cover....
Tony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Baretta out of
his ankle, firing....
Hits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers
across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and
ceilings....
Tony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing....
The second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more
mirrors, and more screaming.
Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the

He jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.
The second hitter, wounded, running out of the club,
towards him.
The third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.
Tony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram
machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.
Carhops scattering, the hitters seeking cover.
Hitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head
exploding like squashed watermelon.

smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks
coffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who

You stay out of it. Run things down

I don't like it.

You don't like it! It was you got

Elvira's untouched plate.

She does the other nostril. Tony looking at her. One beat.
Two beats. He passes a silent burp.

So what about the trial? I heard
Sheffield thinks he can get a new
postponement....
Tony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues to look at Elvira,
then away, encompassing the restaurant.

TONY
(ignoring the question)
Is this it? Is that what it's all about,
Manny? Eating, drinking, snorting, fucking?
Then what? You're fifty and you got a bag
for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and
your liver's got spots and you're looking

Is that what it's all about?

It's not so bad Tony, could be worse....

Elvira reacts -- wanting to kill. She gets up and dumps
her plate filled with food on him. Slop drips all over him.

ELVIRA
You sonufabitch! You fuck!
They got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping
around to clean up the mess. Tony slowly wiping the food
off himself.

ELVIRA
How dare you talk to me like that!
You call yourself a man! What makes
you so much better than me, what do
you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?
Oh that's just wonderful Tony -- a
real contribution to human history.
You want a kid. What kind of father
do you think you'd make, Tony? What
kind of stories are you going to
tell the kid before he goes to sleep
at night? You going to drive him to
school in the mornings, Tony? You
really think you're still going to
be alive by the time he goes to
school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony,
you're dreaming!
The audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over
the faces of Vie and his rich friends.

Tony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.

TONY
Sit down before I kill you.

ELVXRA
* . . You think of yourself as a husband,

home without having six of your goons

Ground level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes
the bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the
camera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,
taped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of
the Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass

the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an

A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the
hitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.
He doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.

Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the
room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.

Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant
swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.
The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and
Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls
him over the balustrade.

The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
at the base of the balcony.
Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and
empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the
pool below.

underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.

Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back
into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.
It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels,
looking questioningly in her face.
