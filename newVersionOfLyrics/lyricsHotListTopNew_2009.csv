0,Empire State Of Mind,"Yeah, yeah, I'ma up at Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere

I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the Kitchen like a Simmons whipping pastry

Cruising down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Driving so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm up at Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboards, and I brought my boys with me

Say what up to Ty Ty, still sipping mai tai
Sitting courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I can trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I most definitely from

In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made, oh
There's nothing you can't do, now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you, let's hear it for New York
New York, New York
(I made you hot, nigga)

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walking with my clique, though

Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we selling rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip hop
Yellow Cab, Gypsy Cab, Dollar Cab, holla back
For foreigners that ain't fifty, act like they forgot how to act

Eight million stories out there, and they're naked
Cities is a pity, half of y'all won't make it
Me, I gotta plug, Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy paying LeBron, I'm paying Dwyane Wade

Three dice, Cee-lo, three-card Monte
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yo, I'm from the Empire State that's

In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made, oh
There's nothing you can't do, now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you, let's hear it for New York
New York, New York

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick
The sidelines is blind with casualties
Who sipping life casually, then gradually become worse

Don't bite the apple, Eve, caught up in the in crowd
Now you're in style, end of the winter gets cold
En vogue with your skin out, the city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the cities filled with them

Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends

Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do, now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you, let's hear it for New York
New York, New York

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made, oh
There's nothing you can't do, now you're in New York

4,Fireflies,"[Verse 1]
You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep

And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

'Cause everything is never as it seems

From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread

Why do I tire of counting sheep?

When I'm far too tired to fall asleep (Haha)

[Verse 3]
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

Hello, everybody. I'm finally putting my YouTube videos up all in one place. People have been telling me I needed to do that for a long time so that's what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do a little intro on all of them. You see, I'd been kicking around the idea of doing reviews, I'd seen, The Nostalgia Critic and Angry Video Game Nerd, I'd seen them do it for a long time and a huge fan. And I'd never found a good reason or, the motivation to actually try it and then I had the idea to do the pop song reviews. And I'd been writing, reviews of songs in my blog – which is long gone by now, you can't find it – but I'd been doing reviews on my blog for a long time. And, I was scared of showing my face, then I had this great idea of this image of this silhouette guy sitting at his piano – he can play piano and I just loved the image of it so I couldn't stop myself from doing it. I was just so excited by it and this is the first episode, the humble, very humble beginning of Todd In The Shadows. This was so much harder than I thought it was gonna be and I'm not sure why I picked such an innocuous song to start off with – who's really bothered by ""Down"" by Jay Sean? And I started on it, I figured it would be easy, and I found out I couldn't figure out how to do anything: I didn't know how to act, I didn't know how to write, I didn't know how to edit, I didn't know how to film, I didn't know how to frame – I still [laughs] don't know how much I've really learned about this since I've started but, eh, you had to start somewhere. I started with this for some reason. It's rough but it was a start, so – ""Down"" by Jay Sean, enjoy.
[Review]
                                            ""Down"" by Jay Sean                                                   ft/Lil Wayne                                             A pop song review[Todd playing ""Down"" on the piano]

Hello, friends! If you'll just give me a moment, I'd like to indulge in one of my favorite past-times: over-analyzing cheap pop songs. So, there's one song I wanna look at in particular – you may have heard it – it's Jay Sean's ""Down.""

[Clip: ""Down"" by Jay Sean featuring Lil Wayne]

Now, maybe you don't pay attention to the pop charts but I do and this song is everywhere – I mean, it's on the pop stations, it's on the country stations, it's on the gospel stations, the Rush Limbaugh stations, and it's an impressive feat for a song that's only a word long.
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling downSee? He even rhymes ""down"" with ""down!"" Although I can't be too surprised it's a hit song right now – I mean, it sounds like everything else on the radio, I mean everything else.
You down, down, down, down?[Clip: ""Low"" by Flo Rida featuring T-Pain]
Low, low, low, low[Clip: ""Right Now (Na Na Na)"" by Akon]
Right now, na, na[Clip: ""With You"" by Chris Brown]
With you, with you, with you, with youI've never heard a song that sounds this much like everything. I mean, it even has the now-required cameo from Lil Wayne, who always sounds like he's going through puberty.
Down like she supposed to be
She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature
'Cause, to me, she's zero degreesUh... did Lil Wayne just lose control of his metaphor there? I always thought if you say a girl's zero degrees frozen, that means she wasn't into you. I don't know. Also, why is he dressed like the guy from The White Stripes?
Cold, over freeze
I got that girl from overseas
Now she's my Miss America
Now can I be her soldier please?
Did he just say ""She's my Miss America"" and then salute a British flag?

[Todd shrugs]
Honestly, I'm down like the economyHa! That's clever... ""down like the economy."" I don't have a job. Thanks for the reminder, Lil Wayne.

Here's an interesting fact: Jay Sean is the first major pop singer of Sikh descent.
Yeah, that's right. Just goes to show you that the pop charts are an all-inclusive place, open to all creeds and all colors and all cultures as long as they sound like everything else.

I'm kinda amused that the guy's named Jay Sean. He just had to have a name as generic as his song. I mean, it's Jay Sean! You know Jay Sean, I know Jay Sean, everyone knows Jay Sean! Jay Sean's a star, we live in a Jay Sean era of music. Jay Sean, Jay... we've already got a bunch of Jays.





And we've already got a bunch of Seans.





We certainly don't need a Jay Sean. Hey, wait a minute, is this the same guy that did ""Tipsy"" a few years back?

[Clip: ""Tipsy"" by J-Kwon]

You know, ""Tipsy"" in ""Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy!""
(Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy)
Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy[Todd sighs] No, I am informed that this is, in fact, J-Kwon. J-Kwon, not Jay Sean. [Todd sighs]

I mean, I don't even hate this song. I kinda like this song a little. It's just something you don't think about – it just goes through you. You don't wake up in the morning wanting to hear ""Down"" by Jay Sean. It's not something you can connect to. I mean, ""Are you down?"" is not really a very romantic sentiment. ""Do you agree, agree, agree, agree, agree, agree? Are you comfortable with the terms of this proposal?"" I mean, if you're going to be repeating one word over and over again, why is it ""down?"" Why isn't it something like ""love"" or ""yours"" or ""forever"" or... uh, forever. Hey, hold on, lemme check something here.

[Todd plays the piano and sings]

Down, down
Baby, are you down, down, down, down?
It's like I've waited my whole life for this one night
It's gon' be me, you—

Oh, my God! It's ""Forever"" by Chris Brown!

[Clip: ""Forever"" by Chris Brown]

""Down"" by Jay Sean is the same as ""Forever"" by Chris Brown! I mean, the melodies are a little different but, mostly, it's the same song!
You won't be lonelyDouble your pleasureI mean, they got the same tempo, they got the same chord structure, they're both about whisking away on a magic, flying carpet to the eternal dance floor of love. There's not a major difference! This is great! This is just great because ""Forever"" was Chris Brown's only good song, and now we don't even have to listen to that anymore 'cause we've got Jay Sean's ""Down"" to replace it so we can just delete this guy from the cultural memory banks forever. Awesome. See, Jay Sean, you do have a purpose: you're the new and improved Chris Brown.

10,Paparazzi,"[Intro]
Yeah, okay, the second episode was ""Paparazzi"" by Lady Gaga.
The first episode did not go the way I'd planned [laughs]. It didn't get any hits, it was extremely difficult to do, and I coulda given up right there. And then I started coming up with ideas for ""Paparazzi"" 'cause this was right when Lady Gaga was making it known that she wasn't some disposable pop starlet, she was actually gonna be around for a while. And when I have a good idea, I pace. I pace furiously, and I was pacing a lot in preparation for the next episode. And that's how I knew I was gonna keep doing it, 'cause I was pacing, I loved... well. This was the first episode I actually tried showing people other than me. And it was helpful, especially showing my little brother, who was a ghostwriter for a lot of the early episodes. We were still working out the bugs, obviously, on episode two, but here it is. The second episode: ""Paparazzi"" by Lady Gaga.
[Review]
                                          LADY GAGA – PAPARAZZI                                                A pop song review[Todd plays ""Paparazzi"" on the piano]

Friends, there is a plague sweeping this nation of ours, reeking havoc on the cultural landscape, leaving nothing but destruction in its wake! A plague known only as Lady Gaga.

[Clip: ""Poker Face"" by Lady Gaga]

And no, this is not a mere trifle to be taken lightly. This is a serious problem, friends. More proof? Well, I got proof.

[Clip: Chris Daughtry performing ""Poker Face""]

[Clip: Weezer performing ""Poker Face""]

[Clip: Faith No More performing ""Poker Face""]

That was Faith No More, guys. If Lady Gaga has become so powerful that she can corrupt the majesty of Mike Patton, we've reached the point of serious concern. But the cover version of ""Poker Face"" that bothers me the most is by Lady Gaga.

[Clip: Lady Gaga performing ""Poker Face""]

You may not know this, but Lady Gaga is a Juilliard-trained child prodigy, and it really does show in this video. If you watch this video enough times, you'll notice two very important things: one, Lady Gaga is ridiculously talented and two, Lady Gaga is Satan. I'm not kidding. This video scares me to death.
I am marvelous[Todd covers his head] Ah! Don't eat me!

I knew that ""Poker Face"" was already a fairly evil song to begin with, but this makes it so much worse. Maybe it's that she's dressed like a Final Fantasy villain for no reason, or those weird, bug-like motions, or maybe it's just the fact that you can't see her eyes. What kind of person makes some creepy, weird video of themselves where you can't see their eyes‽ [Todd turns to the camera] That's just crazy, right‽

But I think what bothers me the most is that she could've been making these genuinely impressive torch songs forever, but instead she chooses to make music like this:

[Clip: ""LoveGame"" by Lady Gaga]
Have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stickAnd therein lies the great paradox of Lady Gaga: she's too smart, too talented to make bad pop music, but she's too shallow to not make bad pop music, and the only way she can deal with this is to become this over-the-top, semi-ironic caricature of pop stardom. Which is a great, original idea which no one's ever thought of before.

[Clip: ""Hollaback Girl"" by Gwen Stefani]

[Clip: ""Vogue"" by Madonna]

[Clip: ""Let's Dance"" by David Bowie]

Okay, maybe some people have thought of it before. But if there's something on which I can agree with even the dumbest pop stars, it's that we all hate the paparazzi.

[Clip: ""Paparazzi"" by Lady Gaga]

The paparazzi are worthless. They are the scum-sucking bottom-feeders of the entertainment world. If you had to rank the showbiz hierarchy, the paparazzi would be way at the bottom. And of course, right at the top are reviewers like myself. So, if Lady Gaga is going to focus her terrifying demonic energy on somebody, I'm glad it's those parasites. Go get 'em, Lady Gaga.
Papa—paparazzi""Pop a paparazzi."" You mean like ""pop 'em""? Pop 'em one right in the face? Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I can get behind this.
Baby there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa—paparazziWait...
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa—paparazzi[Todd defeatedly lays his head onto his piano]

Todd: Why am I even surprised‽ Why am I surprised? She's so vapidly in love with celebrity culture that she even loves the paparazzi. What is wrong with this woman‽ Paparazzi are the enemy! They made a whole movie—



—about how the paparazzi wanna destroy your life and eat your soul and they're going to enjoy doing it.

[Clip: ""Paparazzi"" (2004)]
I want to destroy your life and eat your soul, and I can't wait to do it.And what's this ""I'm your biggest fan"" nonsense?
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love meThe average paparazzo isn't assaulting Megan Fox at the airport or digging through Brad Pitt's garbage because they really, really like them. They just want a paycheck, Lady Gaga. You know that, right‽ You know what the paparazzi are, right‽ Do you even know the definition of the word‽
Not sure what it meansWell, that clears that up. You know, I'm not against stalker songs, per se. I mean, I love ""Every Breath You Take,"" everyone does. But ""Paparazzi"" – I can't seem to figure out what the metaphor of the song actually is. I mean, look:
Got my flash on, it's true, need that picture of youShe's a paparazzo.
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love meNo, she's an obsessed fan.
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means, but this photo of usShe's a fellow celebrity.
I'll be your girl, backstage at your showShe's a groupie.
Real good, we're dancing in the studio
Snap, snap to that shit on the radioShe's a blithering idiot. I don't know! Why am I even trying to look this deeply at it‽ The more I peel back the layers of Lady Gaga, the less I find! My only conclusion is that there's just nothing there. She just wants to conquer us all with her evil powers and use our skins as fabric for her endless array of stupid outfits! I mean, I'd like to think that she was a flash in the pan that's gonna burn herself out by next year, but I'm honestly worried that she's in this for the long haul. Is there nothing we can do about this woman before it's too late‽

11,Sweet Dreams,"[Intro]
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true

'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 2]
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention

I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow

Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save

We could feel the poison set in
""Perfect"" couldn't keep this love alive
You know that I love you so, I love you enough to let you go

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

I'm already gone, already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong

This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is

But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

Richer than the richest
More money, bitches
Yeah, coming to you live from the city of Houstatlantavegas
So what it do young nigga? One hundred

[Verse 1: Drake]
I am on a 24-hour champagne diet
Spilling while I'm sipping, I encourage you to try it
I'm probably just saying that cause I don't have to buy it
The club owner supply it, boy, I'm on that fly shit
I am what everybody in my past don't want me to be
Guess what? I made it!
I'm the motherfuckin' man, I just want you to see
Come take a look, get a load of this nigga
Quit fronting on me, don't come around
And try and gas me up, I like running on E
I, I-I-I'm on my Disney shit - Goofy flow
On records I'm Captain Hook, and my new car is ""Rufio""
Damn, where my roof just go?
I'm somebody that you should know
Get to shakin' somethin' cause that's what Drumma produced it for
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for
Like leaving girls that love me, and constantly seducing hoes
I'm losing my thoughts, I said ""Damn, where my roof just go?""
Top slipped off like Janet at the Super Bowl

[Chorus: Drake]
They can't help it and I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous, but bitch, I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow

[Verse 2: Birdman]
(Cash Money millionaires)
Yeah, richer than the richest, we certified getting it
CM, YM, Cash Money business
Higher than the ceiling, fly like a bird
Hit the Gucci store and later get served
We smoked out, with no roof on it
Them people passing, so we smash on 'em
Ballin' out, we keep the cash on deck
Lamborghinis and them Bentleys on the V-set
Louis lens iced up with the black diamonds
Cartier, Ferrari, the new Spider
No lie, I'm higher than I ever been
Born rich, born Uptown, born to win
Fully loaded, automatic 6 Benz
Candy paint, foreign lights with my bitch in
Born hustling, too big nigga to size me up
Kept stuntin', more money, burnin' up

[Chorus: Drake]
They can't help it and I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous, but bitch, I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Well I get paid every 24 hours
Money and the power
Come-come to V.I.P. and get a champagne shower
I don't have to worry because everything ours
And I got a big bouquet of Mary Jane's flowers
That kush
I promise that's my dude
But we don't smoke that Reggie Bush
And I'm with two women
Make you take a second look
We popping like champagne bottles
But we never shook
And we gon' be alright if we put Drake on every hook

25,Fifteen,"[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

[Verse 2: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing

And you're wondering why you can't get free

You'll get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch

Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe, but you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice

[Chorus]
He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery

Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

Run, run away
Don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time
But just remember

Ohh, yeah, yeah

Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say I love you enough?
Till it's to late, it's not too late

[Verse 2]
Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you
What would you wish you would've done?

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying

[Verse 2]
And if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
'Cause when we long for absolution
There'll no one on the line, yeah

Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking

Turn it all around or to throw it all away

Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying

It feels just like we're always running
Rolling through the motions every day

I just want us back to the way we were before

Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?

But a perfect simple kind of loving?
Baby, those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free

If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

With you, I've always been wide open, like a window or an ocean
There is nothing I've ever tried to hide
So when you leave me not knowing where you're going
I start thinking that we're looking, we're looking at goodbye
How about a strong shot of honesty?
Don't you owe that to me?

If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose

Consider me the past

55,Smile,"[Verse]
You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler than the flip-side of my pillow,  that's right
Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me
It lets me know that it's okay (yeah, it's okay)
And the moments when my good times start to fade

[Chorus]
You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that

It ain't the middle of the night
And it ain't even raining outside
It ain't exactly what I had in mind, for goodbye

At a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine
At a red light

I thought she was gonna say
Something 'bout that couple kids and crossing the street
Or something about this beautiful day
But she just looked me in the eye
Said ""it's over"", didn't try to lie or pick a fight
I might have seen it coming that way

Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town

In the backseat in front of me

I get all worked up then I let myself down

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility

You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

71,Why Don't We Just Dance,"[Verse 1]
Baby why don't we just turn that TV off?
Three hundred fifteen channels
Of nothing but bad news on
Well, it might be me, but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Guess the little bitty living room ain't going to look like much
When the lights go down and we move the couch
It's going to be more than enough
For my two left feet and our two hearts beating
Nobody's going to see us go crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

[Chorus]
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?

[Verse 2]
Baby, why don't you go put your best dress on?
Those high heeled shoes you love to lose
As soon as the tunes come on
On second thought, just the way you are
Is already driving me crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

[Chorus]
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?

You can go
You can start all over again
You can try to find a way to make another day go by
You can hide
Hold all your feelings inside
You can try to carry on when all you wanna do is cry

[Chorus]
And maybe someday we’ll figure all this out
Try to put an end to all our doubt
Try to find a way to make things better now that
Maybe someday we’ll live our lives out loud
We’ll be better off somehow, someday

[Verse 2]
Now we wait
And try to find another mistake
If you throw it all away, then maybe you can change your mind
You can run
And when everything is over and done
You can shine a little light on everything around you
Man, it’s good to be someone

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna wait
I just wanna know
I just wanna hear you tell me so
Give it to me straight
Tell it to me slow

[Chorus 2]

We’ll put an end to all our doubt
Try to find a way to just to feel better now that
Maybe someday we’ll live our lives out loud

73,Eight Second Ride,"[Verse 1 - Jake Owen]
I said, ""Hey girl, what's your name?
Haven't I seen you before?
I recognize them dark green eyes
When you do-si-doed across the floor""
""Are you alone, or are you with someone?""
She said, ""As a matter of fact I'm not""
So I took her hand, that's when it all began
And we headed towards the parking lot

[Chorus - Jake Owen]
And she said, ""Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I have not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high""
I said, ""Climb on up, but honey watch the cup
That I'm spittting my dip inside
And hold on tight cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride""

[Verse 2 -Jake Owen]
We went riding around rocking to the sound
Of ""A Country Boy Can Survive""
And I knew then she was my kindof a girl
Cause she was singing every single line
Then she slid on over put my hand on her shoulder
And I asked her what she wanted to do
She said, ""It really don't matter where we go
Just as long as I'm riding with you""

[Chorus-Jake Owen]
And she said, ""Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I am not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high""
I said, ""Climb on up, but honey watch the cup
That I'm spittting my dip inside
And hold on tight cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride""

[Bridge - Jake Owen]
So we headed out to Old Tobacco Road
Put the tailgate down and we made love
She said ""A true country boy is hard to find
But I found one wilder then any eight second ride""

[Chorus - Jake Owen]
And she said, ""Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I am not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high""

They wake up in the morning and they drink their coffee black
They love their woman one beat shy of a heart attack
On the way to work they might stop by a fishing hole
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they work, work, work, all week til the job gets done
Weekends they bar-b-que and have a cold one
They run on a big ol' heart and a pinch of Skoal
That's how country boys roll

[Chorus]
Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them falling in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll

[Verse 2]
Well if you don't know your way around
They'll draw you a map
And if you're broke and you ask
They'll give you the shirt off their back
All they need is a little gas
A few dollars to fold
That's how country boys roll

[Chorus]
Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels

91,(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To,"[Verse 1]
The moon was shining on the lake at night
The Slayer T-shirt fit the scene just right
Through smeared mascara
I looked into your eyes and saw a light

[Verse 2]
You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn’t like BB guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard
He let them use the pool all day for free

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the conversation stopped
And I looked down at my feet
I was next to you and you were right there next to me
Then I said

[Chorus]
Girl, if you’re wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
So make the move (make the move)
Cause I ain’t got all night

[Verse 3]
The rest of the summer was the best we’ve ever had
We watched Titanic and it didn’t make us sad
I took you to Best Buy
You took me home to meet your mom and dad

[Verse 4]
Your mom cooked meatloaf, even though I don’t eat meat
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent
His eyes were fixed to what was on TV

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring
Your folks were next to you
And you were right there next to me
And I said

[Chorus]
Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
I swear it's true
Without you, my heart is blue

[Bridge]
So much pain may come our way
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say
When the conversation stops and we’re facing our defeat
I’ll be next to you and you’ll be right there next to me
Then I’ll say

Yeah
Uh-huh
Um, uh-huh
Okay

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hello mothafucka, hey, hi, how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby, come to take a shit and urine
On these toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
The feds tryin' to clip us, but we ain't even trippin'

I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in

[Verse 2: Drake]
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me, I'm goin' in, and buckin' when the hook drop

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
It goes, hold up, wait one motherfuckin' minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfuckin' lieutenants
And if I said ""I'm goin' in"" then I motherfuckin' meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'ma motherfuckin' spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfuckin' in it
No need for a room, yeah you know I'm fuckin' in it
She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' wit it
She said ""I seen it all"", I say ""No you fuckin' didn't""
You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said ""I can't feel my legs"", I'm like ""Bitch, me neither""
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends
And I'ma be a legend even when my life end
And I'ma be a legend even when this night ends
Yeah I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothin' like them

When I get off of work on Friday after working like a dog all week
I go to meet the boys for a cold one at a little joint up the street
They got a jukebox in the corner full of old country tunes
Feed it five dollars worth of quarters is the first thing I always do

[Chorus]
'Cause I need a little twang, a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
Some peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train
To get that foot stomping honky tonking feeling going through my veins
I need a little twang, twang, twang

[Verse 2]
Well, I like a lot of kinds of music, I try to keep an open mind
Depending on the mood to strike me if I'm gonna stay till closing time
So when I wanna lift my spirits to get me feeling worth a dang
I know I'm gonna have to hear it 'cause I gotta have some Hank to hang

[Chorus]
'Cause I need a little twang, a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
Some peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train
To get that foot stomping honky tonking feeling going through my veins
I need a little twang, twang, twang

'Cause I need a little twang, a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings

Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther, I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

Going to lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play

Four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
Cause my bartender, she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the rum

And I'll grab my guitar and play

101,Happy,"[Verse 1]
Someone once told me
That you have to choose
What you win or lose
You can't have everything
Don't you take chances
You might feel the pain
Don't you love in vain
Cause love won't set you free

I could stand by the side
And watch this life pass me by
So unhappy
But safe as could be

[Chorus]
So what if it hurts me?
So what it I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
I'm just trying to be happy
I just wanna be happy, yeah

Holding on tightly
Just can't let it go
Just trying to play my role
Slowly disappear
But all these days

Different names

I can't stand by the side
Ooh, no
And watch this life pass me by
Pass me by

Wait on fate to send a sign

A passing storm, a siren sound
Can make me drop it all and pick up the phone
To hear her say that all's okay is all I need to know these days
Can't wait to see their faces when I get home

112,I Dreamed A Dream,"I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I prayed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hopes apart
As they turn your dreams to shame

And still I dreamed he'd come to me
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",Susan Boyle,Susan Boyle,2009,[62],1

I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show, your true colors
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow

Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you

Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart

I can't believe what you said to me
Last night we were alone
You threw your hands up
Baby, you gave up
You gave up
I can't believe how you looked at me with your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans
With your long hair and your cigarette stained lies

Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?

And I'll never love again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

I can't believe how you slurred at me with your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams on my bubble dreams, bubble dreams

He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye

But I'm a loser in love, so baby
Raise a glass to mend all the broken hearts of all my wrecked up friends

Could I give it all up for you?
And after all the boys and girls that we've been through, would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up, if I promise, boy, to you?
That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along

'Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
'Cause it's over when you said goodbye

But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone

But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all

I remember thinking how cool it would be
When we were going on an eight hour drive

Now I've got it on my phone

He fought against the Japanese

Mailed them from his base in the Philippines

With a company in Tokyo

Running-back on a football team
They burned a cross in his front yard
For asking out the home-coming queen

To a man with a dream

Then told myself in the mirror ""nigga, you ain't dead""
I'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic
I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga I got it
When you see me in the hood motherfucker don't talk to me

Then my rap shit worked, now I'm super stupid rich

Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here

Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it

Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2""
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the:

[Verse 3: Drake]
Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin' water, steady tryna swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me ""Shoppin' Bag Drizzy""
Or call me Mr. ""Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?""
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy
I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin' for much, all I want is the...

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (You gotta tell 'em, Trey)

I just don't know... how to say it... to you

And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray

Nigga, I know you don't call yourself hollering at my girl
Now I know you don't call yourself hollering at my girl
I keep her in Louboutin, Louis Vuitton
Gucci down to her feet, yup, just like me
I'm the one, with them ones
Fuck the price on the tag, just throw it in the bag

[Hook - The-Dream]
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Just throw it in the bag

[Fabolous talking over the Hook]
Ladies, y'all ready to go shopping?
Neiman Marcus on me and all that?
Yeah, come on then

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Look at price tags, where they do that at?
Heard that in A-T-L, when I'm in A-T-L
Just ask my baby gal, I treat that lady well
Ain't nothing so-so, and I know J.D. well
A couple Benzes, black, white, gray C.L
Got niggas looking like, ""Did we miss a Mercedes sale?""
Don't wonder what I do, just know they pay me well
They keep that Gucci and that Louis on my labi-el's
That's the way we feel -- must be nice, man
You with the right man, you ain't gotta price scan
Or ask how much, now what I look like?
Son I'm from Brooklyn -- what it look like?
You get it cause I got it, I got it so you get it
In Miami they say, ""Don't stop, get it, get it""
Mami do the Speedy, daddy do the duffle
Bag full of chips, we ain't talking Ruffles

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
See, I know what I'mma tell her
The same thing that the bank robber told the teller --
Just throw it in the bag
That's the way it supposed to be
A real nigga 'posed to help you out with the groceries
Just throw it in the bag
Paper or plastic, it's safer to ask it
So dead that nigga, I will pay for the casket
That Remy Mar' got him spitting plenty bars
Broke ass nigga, couldn't buy the mini bar
So get with Loso, he ain't got to know so
Such a gentleman, dozen bottles of that Rose Mo'
Oh you got a man? Well, you need a richer one
Meet me in the parking lot, the plates say ""GET U 1""
Meet me at the register, I'm there on the regular
Them niggas price checking, you can help them in a second
As we proceed to give you what you need
Like we breaking down the weed
Shorty, throw it in the bag

154,Ain't No Rest For The Wicked,"[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said, ""I never seen a man, who looks so all alone
Oh, could you use a little company?
If you pay the right price, your evening will be nice
And you can go and send me on my way.""
I said, ""You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?""
She looked at me and this is what she said:

[Chorus]
""Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good""

[Verse 2]
Not even 15 minutes later I'm still walking down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight
And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
He said, ""Give me all you've got, I want your money, not your life
But if you try to make a move I won't think twice.""
I told him, ""You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask:
What made you want to live this kind of life?""
He said:

[Chorus]
""There ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good""

[Verse 3]
Well now a couple hours past and I was sitting in my house
The day was winding down and coming to an end
And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend
I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same
Oh yes, we all seek out to satisfy those thrills

[Chorus]
You know there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
We got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free

But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over

Just know I’m right here hoping
That you’ll come in with the rain

[Verse 2]
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I’ve got you down, I know you by heart
And you don’t even know where I start

[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don’t wait for the sky to clear

[Chorus]
I’ll leave my window open
‘Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name
Just know I’m right here hoping
That you’ll come in with the rain

[Bridge]
I’ve watched you so long, screamed your name
I don’t know what else I can say

[Chorus]
But I’ll leave my window open
'Cause I’m too tired at night for all these games
Just know I’m right here hoping
That you’ll come in with the rain

Come g-g-get it, the business, I h-h-hit it, whose is it?
The Benz with the windows tinted, go on, lock it, dirty south
Shown in like them grown men, Goose, Patron, gin
L-let me go on in, sexy moanin', c-catch me jonesin'
N-no not never ever witnessed little mama off schedule
Got me achy, call me papi, hot as saki, fly as feathers
B-but robbed that, sh-shawty house staked, g-got that prowl cat

Miss Thang, million dollar game, Coke bottle frame
Make my wall of fame, let me know your name, I control the rain
I can make it better, matter of fact I'll make it wetter
Stormy weather with this cheddar all because you hot as ever
If you may lady, let me play baby, make my way baby

There was something in your eyes, and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance

Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always gonna be the same
Oh no, you'll never change

If it's true (true), that money is time, then watch this
Ain't tryin' to run out of time, so I purchase some watches

Wake up in the morning, now hop into my foreign
Walk into the bank and it's just like a house warming
Hey, we get the money by the minute

And when the bass start beatin and the waist I'm beatin
Done I got on my way I'm leavin

I said it's none of your concern, and she yelled ""You're a jerk!""
So I walked out the door, called Ben J
Told him it's a function he said I'm on my way
We pulled up to the party I take off my shirt and
Got geeked up, e'rybody jerkin
We was jerkin to the right, jerkin to the left
Then she popped up out of nowhere, she was still half dressed
She like f'real jerk, you lookin for this stuff

And I go through big problems cause your boy here a flirt

Then you say you brought it up, but the jerk is mine
You squeezin, I'm squeezin, but your style is whack
Why you comin to the front? You can push that back
Got your girl on the side, she tossin a lil' stuff
While she textin on the phone Ben J. hit it rough

Welcome
Welcome to The E.N.D
Do not panic, there is nothing to fear
Everything around you is changing
Nothing stays the same
This version of myself is not permanent
Tomorrow, I will be different
The Energy Never Dies
Energy cannot be destroyed, or created
It always is, and it always will be
This is the end, and the beginning..
Forever infinite
Welcome

Keep rocking and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin'd up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like in I'm a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (as hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, and kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I never thought I'd hear myself say (Mmh)
""Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today"" (Kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander-in-chief of my pimp shit flying high (Flying high)
Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky (Oh, shot me out the sky)
Hey, so now I'm crashing
Don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could?
Miss Independent, to the fullest (Oh)
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life (Oh)
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes love...

[Hook: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo]
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around) (Hey, oh, it comes around)

Sometimes love comes around (Ooh, whoa, yeah, comes around)
And it knocks you down (Oh)
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Ooh, when it knocks you down, knocks you down)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dream
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
So please, don't mess up the trick
Hey Young World, I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average?
For advice, OMG, you listen to that, bitch
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying, now I'm crashing
This is Bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm gon' ask him

[Verse 4: Keri Hilson]
So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
(Whoa, whoa) Mmh
I'll admit it, I was scared to act to love's call
(Whoa, whoa)
And if it hits better, make it worth the fall, until it comes around, hey

[Hook: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo, Both]
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around) (Comes around, whoa)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Get back up when it knocks you down)

She had a shiny little Beamer with the ragtop down
Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barkin' and a-waggin' around
And I just laughed and said ""Y'all get in""

[Verse 2]
She had on a new dress and she'd curled her hair
She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do, baby, I don't care
We can go to the show, or we can stay right here

[Chorus]
And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Verse 3]
Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancin' and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

[Chorus]
Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter

Girl you know you got me to hold on to

It's late at night and I can't sleep
Missing you just runs too deep
Oh, I can't breathe thinking of your smile

Every kiss I can't forget
This aching heart ain't broken yet
Oh God, I wish I could make you see

Another school, another house that will never be home
When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face

This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home

Young mom, on her own
She needs a little help, got nowhere to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out
'Cause a half-way house will never be a home

""Someday we'll find our place here in this world""

This is our temporary home, it's not where we belong
Windows and rooms that we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going

The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers, ""Don't cry for me, I'll see you all someday""
He looks up and says, ""I can see God's face""

This here's a tale for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down 'cause you're overzealous
Play hard to get, females get jealous
OK smarty, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by, you wish you could sex her
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin'
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'
Says she wants to dance 'cause she likes the groove
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move

[WILL WITH NEW DIRECTION BOYS]
Just bust a move!

[WILL]
You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls, just ugly faces
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope
New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theatre gets dark just to start the show
And then you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello
Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next? Hey, bust a move!

Tell a funny joke just to get some play

Girls are fakin', goodness sakin'
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man
So on the beach you're strollin', real high-rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen

And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'
A bridemaid looks and thinks that you're winkin'
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And then you're feelin' really fine 'cause the girl is stacked
Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'

The stars lean down to kiss you
And I lie awake and miss you
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere
'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly
But I'll miss your arms around me
I'd send a postcard to you dear
Because I wish you were here

[Verse 2]
I'll watch the night turn light blue
But it's not the same without you
Because it takes two to whisper quietly
The silence isn't so bad
'Til I look at my hands and feel sad
'Cause the spaces between my fingers are
Right where yours fit perfectly
I'll find repose in new ways
Though I haven't slept in two days
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone
But drenched in vanilla twilight
I'll sit on the front porch all night
Waist-deep in thought because when I think of you
I don't feel so alone

[Bridge]
I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone
As many times as I blink, I'll think of you tonight
I'll think of you tonight

When violet eyes get brighter
And heavy wings grow lighter
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again
And I'll forget the world that I knew
But I swear I won't forget you

Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

I've practiced this for hours, gon' 'round and 'round

And as I say it louder, I love how it sounds
'Cause I'm not taking the easy way out
Not wrappin' this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise

It came out like a river, once I let it out
When I thought that I wouldn't know how
Held onto it forever, just pushing it down
It felt so good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There's nothing here in this soul left to save
Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow

If I could see the future and how this plays out
I bet it's better than where we are now

It's easier to see the reason why

Why I need a credit card? What you thank this cash for? (What?!)
Hit the dealership and give 'em every dime he ask for
Just so I can see two-hundred sixty on the dashboard
If shinin 'gainst the law, somebody better get the task force
For me, hoes love me, lemme fuck 'em 'til their ass hoarse
Pimpin' 101, just come and see me take a crash course
You wanna count my money, go to college, need a math course
On a mad dash for a hundred milli runnin
Breakneck speed 'til I see a billi comin
I'm filthy rich and hungry, feel the grumblin in my stomach
I'm still stuntin off the chain, chasin nothin but some money
Put a couple pair of queens like I'm playin gin rummy
No cards, just broads when a nigga dick hard
Flooded offshore Audemars, lookin' like I caught a star
Put it in her wristwatch, ballin like a big shot

Bankrolls, no pennies, drop Rolls (roles), no Emmy's

You went to Bankhead, spot a drop head, I'm in it!
And bendin, a couple corners, hoppin on 20
Wit three or four women givin love like tennis
My boxers where her chin is, giving me the business
While I'm ridin through the city, gag, swallow, no spittin
Livin life, like I just got out of prison Wednesday night
If yo' chick is in my sight, then that chick is gettin right
Ay, I know niggas now with bitches think I'm hittin it and they right
They keep my name up out dey mouth and mind dey business, dey aight
Hey aight, if you hear me say aight, okay, aight?
Cause you know I got dem goons with me and I pay aight

And found him at the bar
I say hey man, what's going on
He said I don't know where to start

Sarah's old car's about to fall apart
And the washer quit last week
We had to put momma in the nursing home
And the baby's cutting teeth
I didn't get much work this week
And I got bills to pay
I said I know this ain't what you wanna hear
But it's what I'm gonna say

Sounds like life to me it ain't no fantasy
It's just a common case of everyday reality
Man I know it's tough but you gotta suck it up
To hear you talk you're caught up in some tragedy
It sounds like life to me

Well his face turned red and he shook his head
He said you don't understand
Three kids and a wife depend on me
And I'm just one man
To top it off I just found out
That Sarah's 2 months late
I said hey bartender set us up a round
We need to celebrate

Sounds like life to me plain old destiny
Yeah the only thing for certain is uncertainty
You gotta hold on tight just enjoy the ride

Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations

Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day they'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same

Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave, I have to live
I had to lead, I had to live

Hard to get through, since you’ve gone
So I do the only thing I know how to, to get by
I’m livin' for the night

[Verse 2]
I’ve drawn all the curtains in this old house
To keep the sun out, and off of my face
Friends stop by to check - in ‘cause I’ve checked out
I tell 'em I’m fine, I’m just livin' for the night

[Chorus]
Daylight can’t hide the tears I cry, the pain that came with your goodbye
The memories that keep me out of sight
Every night I venture out, into those neon arms that hold me tight
I’m livin' for the night

I’m a whole lot easier to talk to, when I’ve had a few, I settle down
Whiskey kills the man you’ve turned me into

I call it confident

Better yet, them thighs

If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

Were at the bar and we
Were having us some beers and
Swapping I don't cares
Talking politics

Habits we ain't kicked
We talked about God's grace
And all the hell we raised

Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damned if I know""

'Bout every girl we knew
What all we put them through
Like two old boys will do
We pondered life and death

He said ""These damn things will kill me yet""

He was a millionaire-y
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
But me, I'm doing well

To just say thanks and pray

My eyes are open wide
By the way, I made it through the day
I watched the world outside
By the way, I'm leaving out today

Well I just saw Halley's comet, she waved
Said, ""Why you always running in place?""

To make them realize, this is my life
I hope they understand

I'm not angry, I'm just saying...
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

I'm at war with the world and they
Try to pull me into the dark
I struggle to find my faith
As I'm slipping from your arms
It's getting harder to stay awake
And my strength is fading fast
You breathe into me at last

I'm awake I'm alive
Now I know what I believe inside
Now it's my time
I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life
Here (right here), right now (right now)

I know what I believe inside
I'm awake and I'm alive

[Verse 2]
I'm at war with the world 'cause I
Ain't never going to sell my soul

No matter what I can't be bought or sold
When my faith is getting weak
And I feel like giving in
You breathe into me again

That I’m a vegetarian and I ain’t fucking scared of him

Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love)
If today was your last day

[Bridge]
If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes (Takes)
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way (Way)
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

[Chorus 2]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?

261,You Found Me,"[Verse 1]
I found God on the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west was all but won
All alone smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?"" He said, ""Ask anything""

[Verse 2]
Where were you when everything was falling apart?
All my days were spent by a telephone
That never rang and all I needed was a call
That never came to the corner of First and Amistad

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?, Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

[Verse 3]
In the end, everyone ends up alone
Losing her, the only one who's ever known
Who I am, who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know how long she will be next to me

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?, Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late

Early morning the city breaks and I've been calling for years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages, you never send me no letters

262,Love Story,"[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

Man that look drives me wild

And only one has the time right

Ill just unplug it for today

And float down grand street in daylight
And float down grand street in daylight
And float down grand street in daylight
And float down grand street in daylight
And float down grand street in daylight

And with just half of a sunburn
New yellow lines that I earned

Step back and here comes the night time

I wanna see what's under there baby

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who's that peekin' in my window
You should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
We can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt, Tab
Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

My homies never see you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of X's and O's
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl

Babe, I swear you have nothing to worry about
Baby, I wanna see what's under there
It's easy, look lemme explain
Oh baby, yeah baby

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When you take the picture, cut off your face
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC Serch 'til I reach third base
And when I get home I'ma hit home plate
Wait, could this be considered our first date
Ye, the picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian, be a lady at it
You know what's a crazy thing
Some girls'll make you wait longer than A.C. Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty-three year old virgin
That's disrespectful baby, don't encourage him
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican, or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress White, but my swag so urban
Tryin my luck, I hit her with the text say
Baby you up, question mark
And she respond, YES-S-S-I-R

Like Ali got, I got the title back, prepare me to that
When the world needed Tip, ask where he was at
But when he need somethin back, nigga fade to black
Talk shit behind his back, you a hater for that
I don't expect nothin less, in the game of chess
You think five moves ahead and not behind
Niggas jumped up, cheered when I got my time
Like, ""Yeah! One whole year I got the grind""
But get me losin off your mind shawty, may I remind you that
There ain't another nigga who done been through what I been through
Time after time again, you better get some in you
When you, said it was over for him and you thought

Right now we all thinkin ""Damn, hopin not mine""
But when it's lights out for ya and you locked down
Ain't no tellin whether or not your lady went and got down
Wit the nigga cross town, cause he hot now
Rippin up your love letters, liftin up her night gown
Right now, somebody baby momma gettin piped down
Kids in the next room listenin, ""Momma pipe down!""
The thought hurt, don't it? But maybe she's strong enough
Or, ain't get that lonely, cause you wasn't gone long enough
But trust, it's just a temporarily setback
It's on when I get back, please don't forget dat!

I remember trying not to stare
The night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later
In the front porch light
Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
I thought I loved you then

[Chorus]
Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

[Verse 2]
I remember taking you back
To right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again
I thought I loved you then

Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

[Verse 3]
I can just see you
With a baby on the way
I can just see you
When your hair is turning grey
What I can't see
Is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I've said that before

[Chorus 2]
And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl

At this moment that we're in

But that all changed when she walked into my life
People ask me what it is
I tell them I don't know
There's just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife

[Chorus]

When she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
Because when she loves me I can live forever
When she loves me I am untouchable

282,Kiss A Girl,"[Intro]
To kiss and tell, it's just not my style
But the night is young, and it's been awhile and she broke my heart, broke it right in two
And it took some time but I'm feeling like I'm finally ready to find, find somebody new

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

[Verse 1]
It's that moment when you start closing in
First you're holding back, then surrendering
It can start a fire, light up the sky, such a simple thing
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

[Verse 2]
'Cause maybe tonight it could turn into the rest of our lives, oh yeah
Are you ready? Are you ready..to cross that line, put your lips on mine??
(Put your lips on mine baby)
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

[Verse 3]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic baby
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But no one should be lonely, I shouldn't be lonely

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

283,Strange,"[Verse 1]
I laid there feeling sorry for myself
In a bed of Kleenex
Stuffing chocolates in my mouth
On the phone with my best friend
Cussing my ex

He broke my heart
Felt like the world had ended
I cried myself to sleep
Thinking I can't get over him

[Chorus]
Strange, talk about luck
I woke up and the sun was shining
Strange, I ought to be in bed
With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love
Strange

[Verse 2]
Got half a mind
To spend my whole pay check
On one of those dresses
The strapless black ones
That are so famous
For teaching lessons

Drop by his place
Pick up the rest of my things
He'll tell me I look good
I'll laugh and say, yeah I will in time

[Chorus]

Strange, I ought to be in bed

Before I fall too fast
Kiss me quick, but make it last
So I can see how badly this will hurt me when you say goodbye
Keep it sweet, keep it slow
Let the future pass and don't let go
But tonight, I could fall too soon under this beautiful moonlight

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
But please don't catch me

[Verse 2]
See this heart won't settle down
Like a child running, scared from a clown
I'm terrified of what you do
My stomach screams just when I look at you
Run far away, so I can breathe
Even though you're far from suffocating me
I can't set my hopes too high, 'cause every 'Hello' ends with a 'Goodbye'

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling

I can't open up my heart without a care
But here I go, it's what I feel
And for the first time in my life, I know it's real

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling

If this is love, please don't break me
I'm giving up, so just catch me",Demi Lovato,Demi Lovato,2009,[89],1

Is there anybody up here?
Hello?
Welcome...2085. Twenty eighty-five it is

And caught me by surprise
Roamin' and I'm lonely
But I'm only

No, no, no I can't restrain it
There's a lot of stars in here ain't it?
But you shine so much they don't seem famous
Where'd you come from on this lonely night?
I swear God must have made lightning strike
And I bottled it up
You hit the red carpet and modeled it up
We hopped in the 'rari and throttled it up
Now everybody clappin', they bravoed it up
All just because it's more than a buzz
More than a drink, but I took a few sips
And let it do what it does
Now drunk textin'
Like its all about you
Like I can't spend another minute without you
You know the drinks let you say things you ain't allowed to
Things that you fear, but you're way to proud to
Say out loud
Cause niggas gonna clown you

People is around you
I'll put my mack berry down
I ain't tryin to hound you
Just tryin' to take you where the stars gonna surround you

And Uhmm, maybe white gown you
And Uhmm, maybe we should talk about all this after I pound you

Wait is it because we on the moon
Tell 'em to save the hate we'll be home soon

287,Too Many Rappers,"[Intro - Nas]
Mic check, mic check

[Hook - Nas] (Beastie Boys)
One (one), two (two), three (three)
Too many rappers, and there's still not enough MCs
It goes three (three), two (two), one (one)
MCA, Adrock, Mike D, that's how we get it done
Like ladies and gents, attention
Nas in the house with Beastie Boys
We can turn it out
Perpetrators, we can point 'em out
So if you got somethin' on your mind, let it out

[MCA]
Yo, I been in the game since before you was born
I might still be MCing even after you're gone
Strange thought, I know, but my skills still grow
The 80s, the 90s, 2000s, and so
On and on until the crack of dawn
Until the year 3000 and beyond
Stay up all night, and I MC and never die
Cause death is the cousin of sleep

[Ad-Rock]
Because I'm back with a bang, boogie, oogie-oogie
Strawberry Letter 23 like Shuggie
Oh my God, just look at me
Grandpa been rappin' since '83
I'm supersonic like J.J. Fad
Got crazy-ass shit pullin' out the bag
Don't forget the tartar sauce, yo, cause it's sad
All these crab rappers, they're rappin' like crabs

[Nas]
I have carte blanche, the vagabond
Nas is the narcissist, my pockets are rotund
I'm no killa, but compared to you, I'm more real'a
You ain't a shot, a mobster, or a drug dealer
A slug peeler, you're not
Mafioso, no
You ain't got the cut-throat in ya, beginner
I ain't tryin' to hear your racket
You work with police, dog, you snitch, you rat
You wear that jacket

[Mike D]
How many rappers must get dissed
Gimme eight bars, and watch me bless this
I start to reminisce, ooh, when I miss
The real hip hop with which I persist
Like rum in mojitos
Bullets and banditos
Matzoh balls in soup
Jackets and troop
Yes, y'all, this is one for the history books
Nasty Nas, what's the word?
Count it off on the hook

[Hook]

[MCA]
Cause this the type of lyric goes inside your brain
To blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame
My lyrics spin 'round like a hurricane twister
So get your hologram on off-a Wolf Blitzer
Too many rappers to shake a stick at
I oughta charge a tax for every weak rap I had to listen to
Cause we be makin' stacks like Stax Records
My squad, we gotta pact -- we're never coming wack

[Ad-Rock]
To all you crab rappers and hackers
And circuit benders tweaked on Splenda
I take the cake, I stole the mold
The golden microphone, well, that's mine to hold
And why all these biters all up in my crotchspace?
Sniffin', buffin', huffin'
And mean muggin' with a Blimpie Bluffin
Back up off me, suckas, you ain't sayin' nothin'

[Nas]
I'm broader than Broadway, I was the project hallway
Dual tape recorder, lacin' oratorials all day
I'm just getting started on this beat, this is foreplay
And when this song's finished, y'all can sing along with this
By the way, I have a strong fetish for Christian Louboutin steppers
I hear Russian blonde's the wettest
But anyway, I better pay homage to my fellas
And that's what's on my mind and the rhyme, who's next up?

[Mike D]
Mike D, the man of mystery
History in the makin', and now we're takin'
Titles, awards, and accolades
Scarin' the competition as I sharpen my blades
We come together like peanut butter and sandwiches
Like pen and paper, like Picasso and canvases
Rockin' stadiums and shitty bars
Go back in time, send a fax from my car

288,Beautiful,"[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

Yeah, to my babies: stay strong

291,Gives You Hell,"[Verse 1]
I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

[Chorus]
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

[Verse 2]
Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

[Pre-Chorus]
And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

[Chorus]
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell

[Verse 3]
Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself
Yeah, where'd it all go wrong?
But the list goes on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

[Chorus]
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell

Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell

[Bridge]
Now you'll never see
What you've done to me
You can take back your memories
They're no good to me
And here's all your lies
You can't look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look
That you wear so well

[Chorus]
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

Hello, tell me you know
Yeah, you figured me out
Something gave it away
It would be such a beautiful moment
To see the look on your face
To know that I know that you know now

[Verse 2]
And baby that's a case of my wishful thinking
You know nothing
Well you and I
Why, we go carrying on for hours on end
We get along much better
Than you and your boyfriend

[Chorus]
Well all I really wanna do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
But I still can't say it after all we've been through
And all I really want from you is to feel me
As the feeling inside keeps building
And I will find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me

[Verse 3]
How long, can I go on like this
Wishing to kiss you
Before I rightly explode?
This double life I lead isn't healthy for me
In fact it makes me nervous
If I get caught I could be risking it all

Cause maybe there's a lot that I miss
In case I'm wrong

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
If I should be so bold
I'd ask you to hold my heart in your hand
I'd tell you from the start how I've longed to be your man
But I never said a word
I guess I'm gonna miss my chance again

[Verse 4]
All I really wanna do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
But I still can't say it after all we've been through
And all I really want from you is to feel me
As the feeling inside keeps building
And I will find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me
If it kills me
I think it might kill me

Missed my alarm clock ringing
Woke up, telephone screaming
Boss man singing his same old song
Rolled in late about an hour
No cup of coffee, no shower

The same old worn out blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all

No complicated meaning

Pshh it happens

My trusty-rusty had a flat
I borrowed my neighbors cadillac
""I'll be right back,"" going down to wally world
That yellowed light turned red too quickly
Knew that truck the moment it hit me
Out stepped my ex and his new girl
""Sorry 'bout your neck baby""

But only when I'm gone have I been away too long

Any given time or place, I never will forget the disgrace on
Your face so full of love, will it ever be enough?

All the above (x7)

Listen! Really what do you see, when you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing, see me living my dreams
I've done been through the bottom, I've done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich, heading straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block, look how I rep for the hood
I got nothing but love, now that I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame, money ain't goin' to shame?
The new Benz is all white, call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built, see the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me, and I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me, but these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets, till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters, mad that I finally done made it
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

[Verse Two: Maino]
It's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nike's, picture you living my life
Picture you stuck in the cell, picture you wasting your life
Picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seeing me lately, I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't, I envision Obama
I envision in diamonds, I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it? Man I'm making a statement
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

300,Ignorance,"[Verse 1]
If I'm a bad person, you don't like me
Well, I guess I'll make my own way
It's a circle, a mean cycle
I can't excite you anymore
Where's your gavel? Your jury?
What's my offense this time?
You're not a judge, but if you're gonna judge me
Well, sentence me to another life

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna hear your sad songs
I don't wanna feel your pain
When you swear it's all my fault
’Cause you know we're not the same
We're not the same
Oh, we're not the same
Yeah, the friends who stuck together
We wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept that the change is good
It's good, it's good

[Chorus]
Well, you treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
I guess I'll go
I'd best be on my way out
You treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
I guess I'll go
I'd best be on my way out

[Post-Chorus]
Ignorance is your new best friend
Ignorance is your new best friend

[Verse 2]
This is the best thing that could have happened
Any longer and I wouldn't have made it
It's not a war, no, it's not a rapture
I'm just a person, but you can't take it
The same tricks that, that once fooled me
They won't get you anywhere
I'm not the same kid from your memory
Well, now I can fend for myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna hear your sad songs
I don't wanna feel your pain
When you swear it's all my fault
’Cause you know we're not the same

When I saw you over there, I didn't mean to stare
But my mind was everywhere, I wanna know you
Gonna guess that you're the kind to say what is on your mind

Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky (sky sky)

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Well, well, is that our little author?
Coming back, humming his hymns, a little altered
Your attention, put back on the flow like the department of water
Taking off with the dough, like Little Walter
Chess, yes, baby, I’m Jerry Lawler
Rebel with a cause, outlaw with the lawyer
Judge, jury, like a loop
Rap name Lupe, but my daddy named me warrior
This is his memorial, shoot

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
No, I ain’t that nigga trying to get a liquor line
When I be scripting lines, want this petition signed
It says I’m sick of dyin', sick of this prison time
I really love my people, I’m sick of pimping mine
Now if we Auto-Tune that shit
We can hear the songs from that opera groomed fat bitch
Telling us not to pursue it, just to shoe it like a blacksmith
We’re trapped, and moving round in circles like it’s Chapstick
And that’s the same encircled way of thinking that we chat with
We’ll wrap this around your head
Like the bandanas Fabolous used to wrap his hats with
Rather be in FEDS instead of National Geographics
Well, I’m not having it, nawwww

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So, I say hello and this is for the third time
To everybody out there who ain’t never heard mine
And if you have, then you know you ain’t never heard lying
Lu don’t moo, no, cow-ards, you only heard lines
Not a facade cherisher, I’d rather have the scars
I don’t idolize America, I’m dancing with the stars
Uh-huh, all of them? Yeah, they are, too
You look up and you see us shining down on you

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

Maybe you were right, maybe I could have changed
Sitting here alone tonight thinking 'bout a lot of things
What's a man to say when all the questions start
Hell I know deep down inside my broken heart

[Chorus]
Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And give you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway

[Verse 2]
I hate it when it's like this, baby it's like that now
Nothing I can say to you, you even care to talk about
How you going to dress it up, wrap it in a pretty bow
When it's gone, it's gone for good, baby at least I know

[Chorus]
Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And give you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway

Daughter, wife and mother

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all it's sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again

And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever

Please stay

315,Funny The Way It Is,"[Verse 1]
Lying in the park on a beautiful day
Sun shine on the grass and the children play
Siren’s passing, fire engine's red
Someone’s house is burning down on a day like this

The evening comes and we’re hanging out
On the front step and a car rolls by with the windows rolled down
And that War song is playing, “Why Can’t We Be Friends?”
Someone is screaming and crying in the apartment upstairs

[Chorus 1]
Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
Somebody’s going hungry and someone else is eating out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
Somebody’s heart is broken and it becomes your favorite song

[Verse 3]
The way your mouth feels in a lover's kiss
Like a pretty bird on a breeze or water to a fish
A bomb blast brings the building crashing to the floor
Hear the laughter while the children play war

[Chorus 2]
Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school, another’s dropping out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
On a soldier’s last breath, his baby’s being born

[Bridge]
Standing on the bridge, watch the water passing under me
It must’ve been much harder when there was no bridge, just water
Now the world is small, remember how it used to be
With mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars

[Breakdown]
Watch the sky in a jet plane, so far out of my reach
Is there someone up there looking down on me?
Boy chase a bird, so close but every time
He’ll never catch her, but he can’t stop trying

[Chorus 3]
Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school, another’s dropping out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
On a soldier’s last breath his baby’s being born
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
Somebody’s broken heart becomes your favorite song
Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school, another’s dropping out

Standing on a bridge, watch the water passing under me

I'm sure you feel the same way
Big Phil, this for you, pimpin'

Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)

And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, plus it hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake

The old me dead and gone away

The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situation
Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
‘Cause I hit you, you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make

She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again

Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend

Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention

You'll never live without
I know you want me, girl
'Cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know
You know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby
I'm the only one for you (*fart*)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
""Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!""
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Outro: Eminem]
So baby
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down

I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep (how do you sleep)

I tried my best at movin' on, have yet to find a girl like you
See things now, I didn't before now wishin' I had more time with you
How do you stay awake knowin' all I do is think of you
All the things we thought about then never will happen again
If I could just see you

If I had my way, I'll come and getcha girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

Baby all that I hear from my friends again, again and again (They come and ask about you, they say)
We saw your girl at the game
And damn we gotta say a big mistake by you
Not only does your body bang but I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you couldn't go to sleep, can't think, can't eat
'Til I come see you

Look
Now it's been about a year
And I'm tryin' to figure out, how could ya
Forget about who loves you the most, why would ya

Heal my heart, heal my brain and
Oh how I wish you could feel my pain
Cause I couldn't get you off my mind, if I tried

Twenty-four/seven, three six five
And my nights so cold, days so long
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone

Well it's gone and I'm trippin', how much I miss it
And you steady walkin' round, like I never existed
And it's hard to understand, you got another plan
Tryin' to play hard, that you got another man

But you'll never find another like moi
That'll ridin' you round in a drop-top car
Baby you're a star and it's time that you know it
So much love and it's time that we sow it

324,Where I'm From,"On a three-hour flight from Memphis to LA
I was silently celebrating my first-class upgrade
Laughing at my jeans and my boots beside those high-dollar shoes and Armani suits
When the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free
So if you'd like the first one can be on me
He said I'm heading back from business, in New York and Rome
Tell me son, where do you call home?

I said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames and
Gave their children Grandmother's maiden name
Yes, it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from

So we drank that round and then another
There wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover
He said I headed out west when I was barely 19
Just a kid chasing my dreams
And I said I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother
He's been fighting the cancer they discovered
But he called last night and said I think this is the end
So come take me home to my family and my friends

Where the quarterback dates the homecoming queen
The trucks a Ford and the tractor's green
And ""Amazing Grace"" is what we sing
Where there's a county fair every fall
And your friends are there no matter when you call
It may not sound like much but it's where I'm from

And as we stood to claim the bags we checked
He said I'll pray for your brother and did I mention that
Italian suits haven't always been my style
See I was the quarterback of my high school team
We took state back in '63 and my wife well she is still my homecoming queen

Cause I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames
Gave their children Grandmother's maiden name
Yes, it may not sound like much
I said it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from
Amazing Grace

332,No Boundaries,"[Verse 1]
Seconds, hours, so many days
You know what you want, but how long can you wait?
Every moment lasts forever, when you feel you’ve lost your way
And what if my chances are already gone?
Started believing that I could be wrong
But you give me one good reason
To fight and never walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
So here I am still holdin' on

[Chorus]
With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You’ll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you’ve almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries

[Verse 2]
I fought to the limit to stand on the edge
What if today is as good as it gets?
Don't know where the future's heading
But nothing's gonna bring me down
I've jumped every bridge and I've heard every lie
I've risked being safe, but I always knew why
I always knew why

[Pre-Chorus]
So here I am still holdin' on

With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe

Just when you’ve almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can

You can go higher
You can go deeper

That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it

I am champion, at beer pong

But, I could tell you a story or two
Um, yeah, of course, I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'till the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk

341,Always The Love Songs,"[Verse 1]
We used to pull off Highway 249
Had a cool little place where we'd go and hide on Friday night
And get away from the city lights
We'd find a little wood and build a fire
Somebody'd always bring a couple guitars
And we'd take turns singin' songs and watching it burn
We'd do ""Ramblin' Man"", ""Proud Mary"", and ""American Band""
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs

[Verse 2]
There was always a line that stuck in your head
That was said in a way you wished you could've said
But you both knew they were singin' it right to you
It felt so good those times you had
That feelin' of wanting somebody so bad
Made you weak in the heart, you couldn't take being apart
Honky Tonk drinkin' songs, we could do 'em all night long
But the ones we remember most

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs

[Bridge]
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time

And for peace to mend this world

So much is going wrong

Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra

Mmh, nobody's talking, 'cause talking just turns into screaming, oh

Gold emblem with, two M's in it (ha-hah)

Stop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!

Oh I, show you better than I can tell you (ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm the Magnificent with a sensational style
Far from bein' shallow 'cause she caught me with a smile
Try to figure out my style, baby that'll take a minute
But if all we got is time, you can't be actin' timid
So we back to playin' tennis, meanin' goin' back and forth
She the one that I adore, so I tried to enter raw
Conscience intervenes, concentratin' on my cream
I'm the king, make a move, pawns all the way to Queens
I'm a don, I'm a boss, I'm a profit, I'm a G
I'm a CEO, which means that I profit off of me
All white tees, still rockin' my Nike Airs
Fresh outta flight school, 'cause I'm fly right here
Ain't nothin' free, I'm chargin' to breathe air
If it's not on Maybach, really who the hell cares?
My money long, my nigga, my money strong
If you ain't gettin' money that mean you done somethin' wrong

I'm the Magnificent with a sensational style
Down to all of my automobiles, with no miles
Yellow Corvettes, black rally stripes
And I never phone ahead, all she do is hear the pipes
Project bitches, upscale kittens
Fuck her for a minute, that night we countin' digits
Maybach money so I always had a vision
I would always tell my niggas but, ain't nobody listened
Words work magic, haters wreak havoc
Ain't nothin' on my back but the delicates of fabrics
I made a transition from the thieves
To the biggest executive Def Jam's ever seen
Lyor's dream, Sean John suit
And a S. Dot ring, Chandon for my crew
Bad hoes in pursuit, Masspike on a two
Gunplay he a glue, goon with an attitude, holla

When I decorate a home, marble flowin' like the Nile

Yeah it start with 305, but we end at four pound
""Sak pase"" to Zoe Pound, for lifers in O-Town
All them Carol City killers, they're likin' it broke down
Money is a must, Tommy guns on a bus
Allan Zamren on the case so you know what you could suck
Wear red all the time, but really I'm color blind
Wanna catch my attention, nigga? Throw up a dollar sign
One time for the Crips, young G's buyin' cribs
And I smoke with Vice Lords when I visit Mississip'

But it's time to rape the game, like Puffy did Total

It is going to be OK

And when he drops her off at preschool

She says now do not you worry
This will only last a week or two

And she won't even know you're gone

Someday soon she will be a teenager
And at times he'll think she hates him
Then he'll walk her down the aisle
And he'll raise her veil
But right now she up and crying
And the truth is that he do not mind
As he kisses her good night
And she says her prayers
He lays down there beside her
Till her eyes are finally closed
And just watching her it breaks his heart
Cause he already knows

I'm Dre, from back in the day
From N.W.A, from black and the gray
From choking a bitch, to smacking her face
From stacking up bodies, to racking AKs up
From racking up hits, to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry, and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happenin' in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, as far as competition, faggot, there ain't none

Speak of the Devil, it's attack of the Rain Man
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrrunn, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon? No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent in a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way

Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen; say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy, I could spin
Vinn-vinn, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I pinch both, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain

[Chorus: Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way

And it's given me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl, you won't catch me CSI
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake

Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it

I got the Midas touch when it comes to rollin' shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smokin', you just holdin' shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
Won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off of puffing them trees

[Verse 7: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up, Cheech
Come on, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is Earth calling Shady, man, come on back—What?
Man, we're losing him, he won't even respond back, fuck!
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn, bitches!)

I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby, just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit, just—

I'm leaving (leaving), I'm leaving
No more wondering what you've been doing
Where you been sleeping

(It's over) I'm leaving
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2:]
So you walked in
The next morning
To find me smiling
Like nothing ever happened
You give me some excuse
Like you always do
I just kiss your cheek
And this is
What I tell you (you, you)

[Chorus:]
So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving (leaving), I'm leaving
No more wondering what you've been doing
Where you been sleeping
(It's over) I'm leaving
(It's over) I'm leaving
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge:]
How many times did
I fall for your lies?
How many times
Did I sit home and cry
Never questioning why, why
It just came to me
Like an epiphany
""How about if I just leave?""

[Chorus:]
So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving (leaving), I'm leaving

367,Crack A Bottle,"[Intro: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of : 17 rapes, 400 assaults and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world : Slim Shady !

[Refrain: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers ? Who's got the rubbers ?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Couplet 1: Eminem]
Ok, let's go
Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Fix your must, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of, my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fumunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts, me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I lay in the cutt
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect ? works every time !
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Refrain: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers ? Who's got the rubbers ?

[Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen : Dr. Dre !

[Couplet 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by they're like ""Oh my""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cause I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say, I love LA
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned ! Just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

[Refrain: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle

And I take great pleasure in introducing : 50 Cent !

[Couplet 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the don
I'm King Kong, get rolled, on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuana, do what you want
Nigga on and on, till the break of what
Get the paper man, I'm caking, you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I get what the fuck I want so what I trick
Fat ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes, I say move a bitch move

I learned the hard way real early in life
That money sure don't grow on a tree
And there's a few things that a dollar can't buy
The best things in life, they come free

So girl I can't buy you a big diamond ring
No house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Oh, but baby don't think I can't love you

I'm beat down girl, I'm dead on my feet

A couple of bags in her hand right in front of Macy's
And then I saw her at the food court sipping lemonade
Conversating on her cell phone, looking so amazing
And I said to myself

[Bridge]
She gon' wear my ring, she gon' take my name
Take her to the cookout, me and her gon' hang
Take her to my mama house, meet Smokey and them

I'll treat her like a queen, give her everything
She will be my girl till we old and gray
And I knew it from the moment
That I saw her lovely, lovely face

Still your rhyme skill's weak
You still need to grow feet, cuz this circus you trynna run's pharaonic
Twas daal writing your name lyrically Kal, cuz we both know you weak

This record a quick sweep
For dirt like ya, you know your act was derp, cuz you know you can't keep up with I
Is you outta your mind?
I can tell from your view that Khusco murdered I, when I got him to rewriting his verse
The picture is now clear that I'm too complex for your ass
And damn right, the track is mine drama queen
I'm only entertained by scary movies like eminem and 5'9""
And if you gon' talk your ass nice on the mic
Probly you should name your single hit without my ass on the line
Lyrically I'm underated
You said, I should stick to beats, you give me that, double complimentary
Your ass on respect mode, still you mouth to test your skill, talking about skill, hell sending you alphabetically
Look, I Ace with beats
See, I'm a rap Dea and you's a lunesta
There's power in my rap's like the Ee
F was you thinking G?

Juss this L enough to leave you with Cancer

Oh!!! Perhaps you do, say peace to rap, find yourself cuz you don't belong here
Six different paths heading the same direction
Here's a cue to your ass
Hope you Are ready for hell
I'm skipping the S, cuz there's no peace in this verse(I ain't no buddhist)
I do double me, cuz it's still T on this beat
You juss a V shape between a woman's legs boy

380,Viva La Vida,"LYRICS:

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now, in the mornings I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Up on my pills and salt, just pills and glands
I hear Jerusalum bells are ringing
Roman cavulry choirs are singing
""Be my mirror, my sword and shield""
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you go,  there was never, never an honest word but that was when I ruled the world

It was wicked and a wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I've become

Revolutainiers wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet and a lonely string
And I thought, ""who would have a job, being king?""
I hear Jerusalum bells are ringing
Roman cavulry choirs are singing
""Be my mirror, my sword and shield""
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you go, there was never, never an honest word but that was when I ruled the world

387,Lark On My Go-Kart,"[Verse 1]
Sitting on a truffet, puffing on the best cut buds
Trying to get butt from Miss Muffet
Me and Teddy Ruxpin sturring up a ruckus
Egging all the houses, smashing all the pumpkins
Suck a Dick Butkus, chumps can't funk with the punk kids
Ash Roth be the king of the blumpkins
Any Tim Duncan, spur of the moment
Let the whole world know I run shit, jump ship quick
Tell a friend that I'm dumb sick
Spit fungus that'll grow from a dung, trip
Twist to a front flip, son that was some trick
Watch all the dumb chicks hump when I bump this

[Verse 2]
Kinda like the blonde Bob Saget, Ash can get nasty
Pass me a blunt and some Captain
Chilling with an Ashley, heading to the mall
Sitting in the backseat, getting jerked off
Ten feet tall with the balls of a matador
Door-matted whore with your words, heard that before
Poor metaphor, pedicure, get your feet fixed
Walk in my shoes for a few, you gonna need it
Yeah, get your Wii Fit to practice your frees with
Need a few weeks before you can compete with
Razor Ramon flow, oh so sharp
You can take Kapowski, I'mma take Lark on my go-kart

[Verse 3]
Mario Kart skills are outrageous
Play me anyday and I'll be the best racist
Wait, no, erase it, meant to say racer
Traded in my cell phone for a new pager
Take off your Bluetooth now dot com
I'm at the grocery store with hot moms
About thirty five with at least two kids
We can make-out while my friend baby sits
All up in your fridge eating left-over shit
Tuna sandwich, Butterscotch Krimpets
Cheetos be my choice of chip
I enjoy for a bit, take a sip from my Ssips and split

[Bridge]
Roll that J up, is it rolled?
Yeah, roll it up, uhh

[Verse 4]
Hair like a troll doll, basketball shorts on
Yeah, I'm a dork but I'm still holding court
Ball up, baller, y'all take too long to get dolled up
Give a fuck if I look like I just woke up
Who am I trying to impress? Honey in the sun dress
With the breasts luscious just sent me a text

Once you've had a taste of perfection

You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

[Verse 2]
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth, oh
He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

How I could let myself let you go

Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
(Spending the night, spending the night)

Cause they're selling make-believe
And we don't buy that here

Well that old man's been working in that plant most all his life
Now his pension plan's been cut in half and he can't afford to die
And it's a crying shame, cause he ain't the one to blame

When I look down to see his calloused hands
Well let me tell you friend it gets me fightin' mad

Because in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While the boss man takes his bonus pay and jets on out of town
And DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground

You told me there's no need
To talk it out 'cause it's too late

I took your words and walked away
No looking back, I won't regret, no
I will find my way
I'm broken, but still I have to say

[Chorus]
It's alright, OK, I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry
Alright, OK, so don't you bother what I do

Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away

If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty

Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally

408,Gotta Be Somebody,"[Verse 1]
This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

[Verse 2]
Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit, this feels too right
It's just like déja vu, me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath
Could this be the end?
Is it that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

[Bridge]
Ooh, you can't give up (When you're looking for)
A diamond in the rough ('Cause you never know)
When it shows up (Make sure you're holding on)
'Cause it could be the one
The one you're waiting on

[Breakdown]
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh

[Chorus]
Nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

409,God Love Her,"[Verse 1]
Just a girl born in Dixie
Washed in the blood
And raised on the banks
Of the Mississippi mud
She always had a thing
About falling in love with a bad boy

Yeah, they could see it all coming
But her daddy never dreamed
She'd grow up that fast
You know what I mean
The way a girl gets
When she turns 17
Kind of crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her

[Chorus]
She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching' to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her

[Verse 2]
She kissed her mama goodbye
Said I'll be sure 'n phone you
She called from a truck stop
In Tucson Arizona
With amazing grace
We made California line
And then my gypsy life
Started taking its toll
And the fast lane got empty
And out of control
And just like an angel
She saved my soul from the devil

[Pre-Chorus]
She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her

[Chorus]
She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching' to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her

[Chorus]
Now she holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there

You see God love her

410,Things That Matter,"[Verse]
Sometimes he lets that boss get
In his head
He can't see passed that mountain
Of deadlines on his desk
Five o'clock, he's the last one
Out of the gate
And he gets cut off, flipped off, ticked off
Out on the interstate
And he wonders why this world won't
Leave him alone
Til he hears that little voice holler
Daddy's home

[Chorus]
Things that matter
Things that don't


She's held on to that grudge
All her life
And thirty years of anger
Since her dad walked out that night
She thinks of all the moments
That he's missed
All the birthdays, ballets, first dates
It seems too much to forget
She gets that call that said he
Don't have long
She walks in, he starts crying
The past is gone

[Chorus]
Things that matter
Things that don't

[Bridge]
Time ain't on our side
Don't wanna leave this world
With why didn't I, why didn't I
Yeah, why didn't I
Sometimes I take on this world
By myself
Thinking I got all the answers
Don't need anybody's help
When God was right there waiting
For me all along
To fall down on my knees
Surrender all

[Chorus]
Things that matter, things that don't
Things that matter, things that don't",Rascal Flatts,Rascal Flatts,2009,[85],1
411,Lifeline,"[Verse 1]
When I was a boy
I did not care about a thing
It was me and this world and a broken dream
I was blaming myself
For all that was going wrong
I was way out there
On the wrong side of town
And the ones that I loved
I started pushing them out
Then I realized
That it was all my fault

[Chorus]
I've been looking for a lifeline
For what seems like a lifetime
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline

[Verse 2]
So I put out my hand
And I asked for some help
We tore down the walls I built around myself
I was struck by the light
Then I fell to the ground

[Chorus]
I've been looking for a lifeline
For what seems like a lifetime
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline
Is there anybody out there?
Can you pull me from this ocean of despair?
I am drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline

[Bridge]
You know a heart of gold
Will not take you all the way
And in a world so cold
It is hard to keep the faith
I'm never going to fade away!

[Chorus]
I've been looking for a lifeline (looking for a lifeline)
For what seems like a lifetime (seems like a lifetime)
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline
Is there anybody out there? (Is there anybody out there?)
Can you pull me from this ocean of despair?
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline",Papa Roach,Papa Roach,2009,"[88, 81]",2

When I picked you up for our first date baby
Well, your pretty blue eyes, they were driving' me crazy
And the tiny little thought that was so amazing
Is they were looking at me
I held open the car door for you then you climbed
Inside and slid on over
To the other side.. I thought my, oh my

[Chorus]
Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree
It's a good thing and I'm wishing
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window
While the world is sleeping
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leaving
Till we're kissing on the porch swing
Oh my little sweet thing

[Verse 2]
Yeah I know I'm gonna see you first thing tomorrow
But I just couldn't wait so I had to borrow
Uncle Jake's mustang, its his favorite car
And so I can't stay long..
Standing here feeling like a love struck Romeo
All I wanna do is hold you close and steal a little
More time, is that such a crime?

415,Cowgirls Don't Cry,"[Verse 1]
Her Daddy gave her, her first pony
Then taught her to ride
She climbed high in that saddle
Fell I don't know how many times
He taught her a lesson that she learned
Maybe a little too well

[Chorus]
Cowgirls don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are going to show you in time
Soon enough your going to know why
It's going to hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry

[Verse 2]
She grew up
She got married
Never was quite right
She wanted a house, a home and babies
He started coming home late at night
She didn't let him see it break her heart
She didn't let him see her fall apart

[Chorus]
Cowgirls don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are going to show you in time
Soon enough your going to know why
It's going to hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry

[Verse 3]
Phone rang early one morning
Her momma's voice, she'd been crying
Said it's your daddy, you need to come home
This is it, I think he's dying
She laid the phone down by his head
The last words that he said

[Chorus-Reba McEntire]

But I'm scared of loving you
I'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair

But I'm scared of loving you
Am I the only one who thinks it's an impossible task
Why it don't last?
Is that too much to ask?
Why do we love love
When love seems to hate us?

Sorry if I sound so filled with gloom
You say you care and I know you do
But this is from my experience
And my conclusion only makes sense

Just cause I love you and you love me
It doesn't mean that we're meant to be
I can climb mountains, swim across the seas
But the most frightening thing is you and me

Is that too much to ask?
Why do we love love
When love seems to hate us?

Most circumstances, I know my fate
But in this love thing, I don't get the game
Why does it feel like those who give in
They only wind up losing a friend


Just cause I love you and you love me
It doesn't mean that we'll ever be
Fly across the ocean, sing for the queen
But the most frightening thing is you and me

I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears

But I'm scared of loving you
Am I the only one who thinks it's an impossible task
Why it don't last?
Is that too much to ask?
Why do we love love
When love seems to hate us?

I'm sure, though
I'm not sure
But if we never try, we'll never know
It's better to have loved
Than not to loved at all

Not trying is worse than to stumble and fall
And if we do, I'd rather it be with you
Cause at least there will be sweet memories
Oh, I'm not scared

I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears

But I'm scared of loving you
I'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair

420,You're Not Sorry,"[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you, honey and it never would have gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)

421,Lost,"[Verse 1: Gorilla Zoe]
Walking around looking for a way
But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world
A Labyrinth, a maze
Where yes men could easily be known
I ask them no questions
They give me no answers
Following the wise
But they're walking in pampers
Give me a cigarette
Smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers

[Hook 1: Gorilla Zoe]
I'm lost on a road
Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
And I'm swerving
On and off the road
I'm lost on a road
But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm livin in a rush
I don't understand this fuss
My brain is bout to bust

[Hook 2]
I think I'm losin it
I might be losin it
I just might lose
Am I losin my mind?
And I'm so confused I don't know what to do
And I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losin it?
Am I losin it?
I think I'm losin
I'm losin my mind
Am I losin it?
Am I losin it?
I think I'm losin
I'm losin my mind

[Verse 2]
I call up my girlfriend she dosen't answer
I hit the strip club and fuck with a dancer
Throwing my ones up, like I'm paying ransom
Told me I look good, she said I was handsome
So believed her, because I am lonely
Im just a loner, my life is a movie
Tonight we're just actors, and this is a sitcom
So tell me you love me, and tell me i'll get some

[Hook 1 & Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
I'm makin this money
Just to go spend it
Livin the good life
Hope nobody ends it
But who are you kidding?
Ay who are you lying to?
You know if they want you
Best believe they will find you

422,Last Call,"[Verse One]
I recognized your number
It's burned into my brain
Felt my heart beating faster
Every time it rang
Some things never change
That's why I didn't answer

[Chorus]
I bet you're in a bar
Listening to a country song
Glass of Johnny Walker Red
With no one to take you home
They're probably closing down
Saying, ""No more alcohol""
I bet you're in a bar
Cause I'm always your last call

[Verse Two]
I don't need to check that message
I know what it says
""Baby, I still love you""
Don't mean nothing when there's whiskey on your breath
That's the only love I get
So if you're calling...

[Chorus]
I bet you're in a bar
Listening to a cheatin' song
Glass of Johnny Walker Red
With no one to take you home
They're probably closing down
Saying, ""No more alcohol""
I bet you're in bar
Cause I'm always your last

[Bridge]
Call me crazy but
I think maybe
We've had our last call

I bet you're in a bar

Do you dream that the world will know your name?
So tell me your name
Do you care about all the little things, or anything at all?
I wanna feel all the chemicals inside, I wanna feel
I want a sunburn just to know that I'm alive
To know I'm alive

[Chorus:]

Tell me, do you believe?

If I can't see the sun, maybe I should go
Don't wake me 'cause I'm dreaming of angels on the moon

[Bridge 1:]
This is to one last day in the shadows
And to know a brother's love
This is to New York City angels
And the rivers of our blood
This is to all of us, to all of us

[Chorus:]
So don't tell me if I'm dying, 'cause I don't wanna know
If I can't see the sun, maybe I should go
Don't wake me 'cause I'm dreaming of angels on the moon
Where everyone you know never leaves too soon

[Bridge 2:]
Yeah, you can tell me all your thoughts
About the stars that fill polluted skies
And show me where you run to
When no one's left to take your side
But don't tell me where the road ends

No, I don't wanna know

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

And know a mother's love

It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind

So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

And for the stars and stripes

And cold beer on a Friday night

And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get your little chicken fried

433,Country Boy,"[Verse 1]
Excuse me ma'am, I saw you walking
I turned around, I'm not a stalker
Where you going? Maybe I can help you
My tank is full, I'd be obliged to take you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy

[Verse 2]
You sure look good sitting in my right seat
Buckle up and I'll take you through the five speeds
Wind it up or I can slow it way down
In the woods or right up town

I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
Yeah I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy

Big thirty-fives, whining on the asphalt
Grabbing mud and slinging up some red dirt
'Cause I'm a country boy
My mufflers loud, dual thrust tubes
Crank the music and the tone gets real good
Let me know when we're getting close
You can slide on out or we can head on down the road

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you want to go
'Cause I'm a country boy

[Bridge]
Bucket seats, soft as babies nude butt
Locking hubs to take you through a deep rut

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down winding roads
Yeah I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy

Yeah, I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride

434,More Like Her,"[Verse]
She's beautiful in her simple little way
She don't have too much to say when she gets mad
She understands; she don't let go of anything
Even when the pain gets really bad
I guess I should've been more like that
You had it all for a pretty little while
And somehow you made me smile when I was sad
You took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart
And then you realized you wanted what you had
I guess I should've been more like that

[Chorus]
I should have held on to my pride
I should have never let you lie
I guess you got what you deserved
I guess I should've been more like her

[Verse]
Forgiving you
Well, she's stronger than I am
You don't look much like a man from where I'm at
It's plain to see desperation showed it's truth
You love her, and she loves you with all she has
I guess I should've been more like that

[Chorus]
I should have held on to my pride
I should have never let you lie
I guess you got what you deserved
I guess I should've been more like her

She said, ""What kind of girl do you think that I are?
The kind that you meet in a bar?
You think you can get whatever you want cause you some kind of star""
No, I'm a comet; I just want you woman
Hey, if I were you then it would be me that I'd go home with
Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl, ""Ooh, he can get it"" - admit it
You did it! Let's hop a cab, and split it
I'm kiddin! We both goin' to where you livin'!
Eh-HAH!! I got you giggling like a piglet - oh, that's the ticket?
I hope you more like, Anita Baker, than Robin Givens
No, I don't know that lady, so let me quit it
I'm just stylefreein', freestylin' which I seldom do
This is what I'm tellin' you, to the bed I'm nailin' you
Like I've been in jail for two, years and then they let me loose

Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off
And them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than let them haters come and make the name off me
That's why

[Chorus: Akon]
I get it in 'til sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming ""Ahhh!""
Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid
Number one hustla get money
Why you wanna count a nigga money?
I'm a hustla and I don't need them!
One of them ya'll see! I'm so paid

[Verse 2: Young Jezzy]
She said, ""Young, why your voice so hoarse?""
I just sound like money, baby, I should've been a Porsche (vroom)
Paint look like a sugar free Red Bull
I'm so paid, you know I keep a pocket full
And that's before the taxes
Took my own gross net and hid it under my mattress
Used to get bored and count 20's for practice
Paper therapy we let money relax us
Gold chains around my neck just like Michael Phelps
I made a killing in the water, kill them in the water
Against all odds and I will not stop
They try and keep me on bottom, but I prefer the top
And my project chick, I moved her next to Joc
She said the house too small, I moved an extra block
So, baby, get your ass up, I need an extra block
I told her do the speed limit and no extra stops; and that's why

[Chorus: Akon]
I get it in 'til sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming ""Ahhh!""
Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid

Why you wanna count a nigga money?
I'm a hustla and I don't need them!
One of them ya'll see! I'm so paid

[Verse 3: Akon]
I am the boss it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off, that's all
Guess what? I won't be taking that fall
Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm paying them for
Ha ha, ain't that funny?
‘Cause niggas want war but ain't got money
‘Cause I've seen them all talking 'til they start gunning
Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing running
Yeah! Akon! Weezy!

Ahem, Big Money Weezy
White wife beater with the Sig underneath it
How do I feel? Bitch, I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers, disappear from the precinct
Yeah, I'm ballin', we ball out
Ball 'til we fall until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns at y'all house
Only to find out you live in a doll house
Damn, but I thought you was tough, though
We carry choppers on our necks; call it cut throat
We bury cowards on the set that they come from
We know magic, turn weed smoke to gun smoke
We bomb first when we ride
You in a hearse when you ride
I put my shoe down, baby
And I'm holding down Young Moolah, baby! That's why

They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag

When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

Born to a throne, stronger than Rome
A violent prone, poor people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, streets we would roam

Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest survival
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat

So we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now we say

When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

So many wars, settling scores
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor
I heard them say 'love is the way'
'Love is the answer,' that's what they say

But look how they treat us, make us believers
We fight their battles, then they deceive us
Try to control us, they couldn't hold us
'Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers

But we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering, when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that faithful day
It's not far away but for now we say

When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, and then is goes

When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, and then it goes
And then it goes

And everybody will be singing it
And you and I will be singing it
And we all will be singing it

When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, and then it goes

When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag

447,Love Lockdown,"[Produced by Kanye West & Jeff Bhasker]

[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-nooo!""
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

449,Light On,"[Verse 1]
Never really said too much
Afraid it wouldn't be enough
Just try to keep my spirits up when there's no point in grievin'
Doesn't matter anyway
Words could never make me stay
Words will never take my place when you know I'm leavin'

Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Something I rely on to get home
One I can feel at night, a naked light
A fire to keep me warm
Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when it's late at night you can look inside
You won't feel so alone

[Verse 2]
You know we've been down that road
What seems a thousand times before
My back to a closing door and my eyes to the seasons
That roll out underneath my heels
And you don't know how bad it feels
To leave the only one that I have ever believed in

Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Something I rely on to get home
One I can feel at night, a naked light
A fire to keep me warm
Try to leave a light on when I'm gone

And when it's late at night you can look inside
You won't feel so alone

Sometimes it feels like we've run out of luck
When the signal keeps on breaking up
When the wires cross in my brain
You'll start my heart again

450,If I Were A Boy,"[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus 2]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted

This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?

Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah

Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?

So I spend dough on these hoes strippin'
She ain't a politician, honey's a pole-itician

22-inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
That can arouse your ego
We've got mouths to feed so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
'Cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be

Wassup, boo? Yeah
Hahahaha, yeah

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Another shady mission
Tricks, like watching pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in Heaven, ‘cause being here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy
Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on who

No one else can do what you do for me
Take me away from the pain I feel inside

And we'll grow, trust I know
I wanna be the one whoooo…

477,Roll With Me,"Wake up in the morning
Get to living my life
Making sure im all that I can be
Went to church on sunday
There was a moment that came
I swear it was like the lord spoke right to me

So now Im slowing it down
And im looking around
And im loving this town
And im doing alright
Ain't worried about nothing
Except for the man I wanna be
Im thinking maybe its time
To be living the rhyme
When im singing a song
About nothing but right
And it sure would be nice
If you would roll with me

Saw a kid last winter
Only 20 years old
Being laid to rest
While his mom stood by his side
It sure was hard to watch those tears run down her face
Made me think how we all just have our time

So now Im slowing it down
And im looking around
And im loving this town
And im doing alright
Ain't worried about nothing
Except for the man I wanna be
Im thinking maybe its time
To be living the rhyme
When im singing a song
About nothing but right
And it sure would be nice
If you would roll with me

Who knows whats up ahead
I think id rather not know instead

So now Im slowing it down
And im looking around
And im loving this town
And im doing alright
Ain't worried about nothing
Except for the man I wanna be
Im thinking maybe its time
To be living the rhyme
When im singing a song
About nothing but right
And it sure would be nice

478,It's A New Day,"I went asleep last night
Tired from the fight
I've been fighting for tomorrow
All my life
Yea I woke up this morning
Feeling brand new
'Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming
Have finally come true

It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day

It's been a long time coming
Up the mountain kept runnin'
Souls of freedom kept hummin'
Channeling Harriet Tubman

Kennedy, Lincoln, and King
We gotta invest in that dream
It feels like we're swimming upstream
It feels like we're stuck in between
A rock and a hard place
We've been through the heartaches
And lived through the darkest days

If you and I made it this far
Well then hey, we can make it all the way
And they said no we can't
And we said yes we can
Remember it's you and me together

I woke up this morning
Feeling alright
I've been fightin' for tomorrow
All my life
Yea, I woke up this morning
Feeling brand new
Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming
Have finally came true

It's a new day
(it's a new day)
It's a new day
(it's a new day)
It's a new day
It's a new day!

It's been a long time waitin'
Waiting for this moment
Been a long time praying
Praying for this moment

We hope for this moment
And now that we own it
For life I will hold it
And I ain't gonna let it go

It's for fathers, our brothers
Our friends who fought for freedom
Our sisters, our mothers
Who died for us to be in this moment

Stop and cherish this moment
Stop and cherish this time

It's time for you and me
For us and we
That's you and me together

I woke up this morning
Feeling brand new
Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming
Have finally came true
Yea, I woke up this morning
Feeling alright

'Cause we weren't fighting for nothing
And the soldiers weren't fighting
For nothing
No, Martin wasn't dreaming for nothing
And Lincoln didn't change it for nothing
And children weren't crying for nothing

479,Here,"[Verse 1]
There's a place I've been looking for
That took me in and out of buildings
Behind windows, walls and doors
And I thought I found it
Couple times, even settled down
And I'd hang around just long enough
To find my way back out
I know now the place that I was trying to
Reach
Was you, right here in front of me

[Chorus]
And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breaking
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me heeere, right here (oh.. baby)

[Verse 2]
It's amazing what I let my heart go through
To get me where it got me
In this moment here with you
And it passed me by
God knows how many times
I was so caught up in holding
What I never thought I'd find
I know now, there's a million roads
I had to take
To get me in your arms this way

[Chorus]
And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breaking
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me heeeere

[Bridge]
In a love I never thought I'd get to get to
-here
And if that's the road
God made me take to be with you

[Chorus]
And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breaking
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears

That led to you and got me heeere, right here (right here)

Tip the man he'll ring the bell
Get her drunk she'll scream like hell
Dirty girl, gettin' down
Dance with guys from outta town
Grab her ass, actin' tough
Mess with her she'll fuck you up
No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight

She likes to shake her ass
She grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair
When I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down

Come together, leave alone

Doesn't take her long to make things right
But does it make her wrong to have the time of her life?
The time of her life
My girlfriend's a dick magnet
My girlfriend's gotta have it

She's a gold digger
Now you figure out it's over
Pull the trigger
Futures finished, there it went
Savings gone, the money spent
Look around and all I see
No good, bad and ugly
Man she's hot and fixed to be
The future ex-Miss Connolly

No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Mr. West is in the buildin'
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
Ayo I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the Pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
Hermès, Pastelle, I pass the dressin'
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess we should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it
""Why you so mad for? Why you gotta have it?""
‘Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
Tryin' to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
(No one on the corner…) Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans, ‘cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans, ‘cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps is the road to success
Where the niggas know you're thorough when the girls say yes
(Yes…) But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school, but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks, I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap
It's Hooooovaaaa
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda
Hooooovaaaa
Did you even have any doubt? After Doubt it was over

No one on the corner has swagger like moi
Chuch, but I'm too clean for the choir
I require what I desire, I got stripes: Adidas
Mamis scream ""¡Papi, no más!""
Run up in your shit, just me, no más
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these four guys
Now when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than the swag or dagger all metal
And my jewels blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows: stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet, make you feel special
Ha! What the fuck you boys talkin' 'bout?
I know it's us, ‘cause we the only thing to talk about

[Verse 4: T.I.]
You can go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the bird play
Kanyeezy for diversity, and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect, only spit to serve a purpose
You ain't livin' what you kickin', then you worthless
Lookin' from the surface
It may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off, blast off and have outstandin' quality
Sell a lot of records, I'll respect it and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit, hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

That you would ever feel the same way about me

Are you holding back like the way I do?
Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away-ay-ay
Going away-ay-ay

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hanging, spending time girl
Are we just friends? Is there more, is there more?

Something that will last, last forever, forever

I didn't wanna, but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn

I bust the windows out your car
You know I did it cause I left my mark
Wrote my initials with a crowbar
And then I drove off into the dark

After 5 whole years of this bullshit
Gave you all of me and you played with it

You could never feel how I felt that day
Until it happens, baby, you don't know pain
Oh, yeah, I did it. You should know it
I ain't sorry. You deserved it
After what you did to me
You deserved it. I ain't sorry no, no
You broke my heart, so I broke your car
You caused me pain, so I did the same
Even though what you did to me was much worse
I had to do something to make you hurt

Why am I the one who's still crying?

To not promise anything more than one night
Complicated situations
Only get worse in the morning light
Hey, I'm just lookin' for a good time

Tell me that you love me even if you don't
The rule is don't you ever even talk about forever
But you never say never in life

To not promise anything more than one night

I just wanna be alone tonight
I just wanna take a little breather
Cause lately all we do is fight
And every time it cuts me deeper
Cause somethin’s changed
You been actin’ so strange
And it’s taken its toll on me
It’s safe to say that I’m ready to let you leave

Without you
I live it up a little more every day
Without you

But it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away
Well I never thought I’d say I’m fine
Without you

490,All Summer Long,"It was 1989, my thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Splashing through the sand bar, talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life like when and where
We didn't have no Internet but man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things, we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun, we couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock 'n' roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer

Now nothing seems as strange as
When the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again
Man, I'd like to see that girl again

And we were trying different things and we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long

We were trying different things and we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

I go hard and get it in like a porn star
Follow my moves you wanna make it to the top
I'm OnStar for new born stars
Even when the camera stop
I'ma hundred million dollar movie, hand on my cock
Big Homie from the back block
When you first learned how to slap box
Then you even learned how to dribble the pill
Or to hand the pot, bring it back, rock
Number one rule: if your ass get popped
Don't chatterbox to the Matlocks
Death before dishonor, I'ma honor the code they created
Number 2 Rule and it might sound rude, but...

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard
I am gettin' it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go - go hard!",DJ Khaled,DJ Khaled Featuring Kanye West & T-Pain,2009,[100],1
499,Fall For You,"[Verse 1]
The best thing 'bout tonight's that we're not fighting
Could it be that we have been this way before?
I know you don't think that I am trying
I know you're wearing thin down to the core

[Chorus]
But hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find

[Verse 2]
This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
You always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed, but I have loved you from the start

[Chorus 2]
Oh, but hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
It's impossible…

[Bridge]
So breathe in so deep
Breathe me in, I'm yours to keep
And hold on to your words 'cause talk is cheap
And remember me tonight when you're asleep

[Chorus 3]
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find",Secondhand Serenade,Secondhand Serenade,2009,"[42, 36, 46]",3
500,Love Remains The Same,"A thousand times I’ve seen you standing
Gravity like a lunar landing
Make me want to run till I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you’re all I hear
Everything we know fades to black

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I had anymore to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

Find the place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city buzz, it sounds just like a fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur, they’re all the same

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I had anymore to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

So much more to say
So much to be done
Don’t you trick me out
We shall overcome
So all have stayed in place
We should have had the sun
Could have been inside
Instead we’re over here

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time, too long defending
You and I are done pretending

I never thought that I had anymore to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
Everything will change

I, oh I
I wish this could last forever
I, oh I
As if we could last forever

Love remains the same
Love remains the same",Gavin Rossdale,Gavin Rossdale,2009,"[46, 50, 43]",3
501,Lovebug,"[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Called you for the first time yesterday
Finally found the missing part of me
I felt so close, but you were far away
Left me without anything to say

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
I can't get your smile out of my mind
(I can't get you out of my mind)
I think about your eyes all the time
You're beautiful, but you don't even try
(You don't even, don't even try)
Modesty is just so hard to find

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
I kissed her for the first time yesterday
Everything I wished that it would be
Suddenly I forgot how to speak
Hopeless, breathless
Baby, can't you see?

[Breakdown: Joe Jonas]
Now I'm!
Yeah, oh!

[Chorus Variation: Joe Jonas]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Now I'm hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

Oh, lovebug again",Jonas Brothers,Jonas Brothers,2009,"[66, 49]",2
502,Fly On The Wall,"[Verse 1]
You don't understand what it is that makes me tick
But you wish you did
You always second guess
Wonder if I'll say yes
But you just lose out every time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If you only knew what I talked about
When I'm with my friends, just hanging out
Then you'd have the inside scoop on what to say, what to do
That way, when you play the game
Baby, you could never lose

[Chorus]
Don't you wish that you could be a
Fly on the wall?
A creepy little, sneaky little
Fly on the wall
All my precious secrets, yeah
You know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a
Fly on the wall?

[Verse 2]
You'd love to know the things I do
When I'm with my friends, and not with you
You always second guess
Wonder if there's other guys I’m flirting with
You should know by now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If you were my boyfriend, I'd be true to you
If I make a promise, I'm coming through
Don't you wish that you could see me
Every second of the day?
That way you would have no doubt
That, baby, I would never stray

[Chorus]
Don't you wish that you could be a
Fly on the wall?
A creepy little, sneaky little
Fly on the wall
All my precious secrets, yeah
You know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a
Fly on the wall?

[Bridge]
A little communication
Well, that'll go a long way
You're getting misinformation
Too much hearsay, hearsay
And what I say is
Come a little closer
And what I'm gonna say is

[Breakdown]
Don't ya?
Don't ya?
Don't ya?
Don't ya wish you were a?
Hey!

Hey
Lemme tell you
No
Oooh, baby

[Verse 1]
Tryna decide, tryna decide if I really wanna go out tonight
I never used to go out without ya', not sure I remember how to
Gonna be late, gonna be late, but all my girls gon' have to wait 'Cause I don't know if I like my outfit
I tried everything in my closet

[Chorus]
Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
Take 'em all off 'cause I feel a fool
Tryna to dress up when I'm missing you
I'mma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
In bed I lay in nothing but your t-shirt on, oh
With nothing but your t-shirt on

[Verse 2]
Hey, gotta be strong gotta be strong
But I'm really hurting now that you're gone
I thought maybe I'd do some shopping
But I couldn't get past the door and
Now, I don't know now
I don't know if I'm ever really gonna let you go
And I couldn't even leave my apartment
I'm stripped down, torn up about it

[Chorus]
Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
Take 'em all off 'cause I feel a fool
Tryna to dress up when I'm missing you

505,See You In My Nightmares,"[Intro: Kanye West & Lil Wayne]
I'm cold! (Yeah)
I'm cold! (Yeah)
I'm cold! (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
I got the right, to put up a fight
But not quite, 'cause you cut off my light
But my sight, is better tonight
And I might, see you in my nightmare
Ooh, how did you get there?
'Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell, yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I got my life, and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So good night, I'm headed out the door
Door, door, door, door
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And that you know

[Chorus: Kanye West]
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Okay, I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gon' do mine
You do you 'cause I'm just gon' be fine
Okay, I got you out my mind
And the night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well, now you know

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell everybody, everybody that you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
I got the right, to put up a fight
But not quite, 'cause you cut off my light
But my sight, is better tonight
And I might, see you in my nightmare
Ooh, how did you'd get there?
'Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Baby girl I'm finished, I thought we were committed
I thought we were cemented, I really thought we meant it
But now we just repent it, and now we just resent it
The clouds is in my vision, look how high that I be getting
And it's all because of you, girl we through
You think your shit don't stank but you are Mrs. P-U
And I don't see you with me no more
Now tell everybody that you know, that you know

[Chorus: Kanye West]
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know
That you know
Tell everybody that you know

506,Just A Dream,"[Verse 1]
It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

[Chorus]
Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

[Verse 2]
The preacher man said, ""Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

[Chorus]
Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream
Oh, baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
Oh, I'll never know
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

[Outro]
Oh, this is just a dream
Just a dream
Yeah, yeah",Carrie Underwood,Carrie Underwood,2009,[72],1
507,My Life,"[Intro: The Game]
Punk-ass motherfucker, checkin' shit
What you was gonna do?
Kill me in my sleep, you bitch-ass nigga?
2Pac, Biggie – shut the fuck up!
Fuckin' dogs, barkin' and shit
(Don't shoot, don't shoot!)
Fuck you, nigga!

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

[Verse 1: The Game]
Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away, like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away, like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide, I'm from a windy city, like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?
‘Cause that's Jesus, people – and Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Siegel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle
I need some meditation so I can lead my people
They askin', ""Why, why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?""
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

[Verse 2: The Game]
We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24's spinnin'? I earned 'em
And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson, ‘cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn, I know his mama proud; and since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like M.J.B. no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty like a Glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

[Verse 3: The Game]
Walk through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts
Listenin' to the Chronic album, playin' backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge (Compton, Compton)
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back, in my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life",The Game,The Game Featuring Lil Wayne,2009,[74],1
508,Run,"[Verse 1]
I'll sing it one last time for you
Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done
And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here

[Chorus]
Light up, light up, as if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder louder, and we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

[Verse 2]
To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbye
I nearly do

[Chorus]
Light up, light up, as if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder louder, and we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

[Chorus]
Light up, light up, as if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder louder, and we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say",Leona Lewis,Leona Lewis,2009,[81],1
509,Let It Go,"[Verse 1]
I've been caught sideways out here on the crossroads
Trying to buy back the pieces I lost of my soul
It's hard when the devil won't get off your back
It's like carrying around the past in a hundred pound sack

[Chorus]
Today I'm going to keep on walking
I'm going to hold my head up high
I'm going to leave it all behind
Today I'm going to stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away yeah wash it all away
I'm going to let it go oh yeah
I'm going to let it go oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Skeletons and ghosts are hiding in the shadows
Threatening me with all the things that they know
Choices and mistakes, they all know my name
But I'm through holding in and holding onto all that pain

[Chorus]
Today I'm going to keep on walking
I'm going to hold my head up high
I'm going to leave it all behind
Today I'm going to stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away yeah wash it all away
I'm going to let it go oh yeah
I'm going to let it go oh yeah

[Bridge]
I know I know I know I've been forgiven
I know I know I know I'm going to start living

[Chorus]
Today I'm going to keep on walking
I'm going to hold my head up high
I'm going to leave it all behind
Today I'm going to stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away Yeah wash it all away
I'm going to let it go oh yeah
I'm going to let it go oh yeah

[Outro]
Oh yeah",Tim McGraw,Tim McGraw,2009,[82],1
510,What About Now,"[Verse 1]
Shadows fill an empty heart
As love is fading
From all the things that we are
Are not saying
Can we see beyond the scars
And make it to the dawn?

[Verse 2]
Change the colors of the sky
And open up to
The ways you made me feel alive
The ways I loved you
For all the things that never died
To make it through the night
Love will find you

[Chorus]
What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?

[Verse 3]
The sun is breaking in your eyes
To start a new day
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace
As shadows fade into the light
I am by your side
Where love will find you

[Chorus]
What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?

[Bridge]
Now that we're here
Now that we've come this far
Just hold on
There is nothing to fear
For I am right beside you
For all my life
I am yours

[Chorus]
What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?

511,Anything Goes,"[Verse 1]
Normally this time of night, you wouldn't find me here
I'd be reaching for a good night kiss instead of one more beer
I'd never take a second look at the blond across the bar
Much less invite her over and let things go this far

[Chorus]
But anything goes, when everything's gone
You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong
So bring it on, anything goes, when everything's gone

[Verse 2]
Another morning after, a crazy night before
I'm searching for my blue jeans on the stranger's bedroom floor
Shouldn't I feel guilty? Well I don't feel a thing
I'd wake her up and say good bye but I can't recall her name
Anything goes, when everything's gone
You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong
So bring it on, anything goes, when everything's gone
If you'd a left a single thread for me to hold on to
I'd have one good reason not to do the things I do

[Chorus]
But anything goes, when everything's gone
You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong
So bring it on, anything goes, when everything's gone",Randy Houser,Randy Houser,2009,[98],1
