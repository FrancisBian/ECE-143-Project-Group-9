0,0,Because I Love You (The Postman Song),"I got your letter from the postman just the other day
So I decided to write you this song
And just to let you know exactly the way I feel
And let you know my love's for real

Because I love you
And I'll do anything
I'll give you my heart, my everything
Because I love you
I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide

If you should feel that I don't really care
And that you're starting to lose ground
Just let me reassure you that you can count on me
And that I'll always be around

Because I love you
My heart's an open door
Girl, won't you please come on in
Because I love you
I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide

If you should feel that I don't really care
And that you're starting to lose your ground
Just let me reassure you that you can count on me
And that I will always be around

Because I love you

1,1,Justify My Love,"[Verse 1]
I want to kiss you in Paris
I want to hold your hand in Rome
I want to run naked in a rainstorm
Make love in a train cross-country
You put this in me
So now what, so now what?

[Chorus]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love

[Verse 2]
I want to know you
Not like that
I don't want to be your mother
I don't want to be your sister either
I just want to be your lover
I want to have your baby
Kiss me, that's right, kiss me

[Chorus]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Yearning, burning
For you to justify my love

[Verse 3]
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Talk to me, tell me your dreams
Am I in them?
Tell me your fears
Are you scared?
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly!
Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me, that's right, love me
I want to be your baby

[Chorus]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
I'm open and ready
For you to justify my love

2,2,From A Distance,"From a distance
The world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance
The ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

From a distance
There is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope
It's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man

From a distance
We all have enough
And no one is in need
And there are no guns, no bombs and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed
From a Distance
We are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope
Playing songs of peace
They are the songs of every man

God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us
From a distance

From a distance
You look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance
I just cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for
From a distance
There is harmony
And it echoes through the land
And it's the hope of hopes
It's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man

It's the hope of hopes
It's the love of loves
This is the song of every man

3,3,Impulsive,"[Verse 1]
The secret of love
I thought I understood
The way it's supposed to be
I never imagined you could
Blow my theory apart
But now you're running away with my heart

[Chorus]
I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze
What I'm doing here
Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself
In your kiss

[Verse 2]
Arrows through hearts
Drawn on a misty window
You're taking me home in the rain
My heart it's beating don't say no
My head keeps saying, ""Take it slow""

[Chorus]
I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze
What I'm doing here
Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself
In your kiss

You're giving me a feeling
It's a sudden rush
Acting on the moment
Spontaneous
Ooh this is not like me
To follow my heart so easily

I am reckless, impulsive

But now you're running away with my heart, my heart

For the man to pour the coffee

And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in

And instead I pour the milk

Looking inside, does she see me?
No, she does not really see me
Cause she sees her own reflection

And I'm trying not to notice
That she's hitching up her skirt
And while she's straightening her stockings
Her hair has gotten wet

6,6,I'm Your Baby Tonight,"[Verse 1]
From the moment I saw you
I went outta my mind
Though I never believed in love at first sight
But you got a magic, boy
That I just can't explain
Well, you got a, you got a way
That you're making me feel
I can do, I can do anything for you, baby
I'll be down for you, baby
Lay all my cards out tonight
Just call on me, baby
I'll be there in a hurry
It's your move, so baby
Baby, decide

[Chorus]
Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

[Verse 2]
From the second you touched me
I was ready to die
I've never been fatal
You're my first time
I feel like an angel
Who just started to fly
Well, you got a, you got a way that you're making me
Feel I can, feel I can, do anything for you, baby
I will fly for you, baby
Hold on and enjoy the ride
I'm not in no hurry
We can fly all night, baby
It's your move, now, baby
Baby, let's fly

[Chorus]
Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight
Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

[Bridge 1]
Whatever I do, boy
It's all about you, baby
And ain't it the truth, boy
I'm helplessly in love with you
What else can I do, boy
But be there for you, baby
You got a, you got a way that you're making me
Feel I can, feel
I can do any, do anything

[Chorus]
Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight
Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

[Bridge 2]
Looks like I'm fatal
It's all on the table
And baby, you hold the cards
You got the magic
And I've got to have it
I don't want the pieces
I want every single part
I'll be your angel
I'm ready and able
Whatever you want is fine
Whenever you're ready
Just call on your lady
And I'll be your baby tonight, yeah

[Break]
I'm your baby tonight
I'm your baby tonight

Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight

7,7,Freedom,"[Chorus]
I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

[Verse 1]
Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around

[Verse 2]
Heaven knows we sure had some fun, boy
What a kick, just a buddy and me
We had every big-shot goodtime band on the run, boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race, got out of the place
Went back home, got a brand new face for the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don’t think that I’ll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around

[Bridge]
Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last
That's what you get
I say that's what you get
That's what you get for changing your mind
And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around

[Outro]
I'll hold on to my freedom
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now
I've got to live","['i', 'wont', 'let', 'you', 'down', 'i', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'you', 'up', 'gotta', 'have', 'some', 'faith', 'in', 'the', 'sound', 'its', 'the', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'that',

You got a smile so bright
You know you could've been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could've been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could've been a broom
And baby you smell so sweet
You know you could've been some perfume

[Chorus]
Well you could've been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do
I like the way you do the things you do

[Verse 2]
As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know you could have been an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a crook
And baby your so smart
You know you could have been a school book

[Chorus]
Well you could've been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do
I like the way you do the things you do

[Verse 3]
You make my life so rich
You know you could've been some money
And baby you're so sweet
You know you could have been some honey

Well you could've been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do
I like the way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower

10,10,Love Will Never Do (Without You),"[Verse 1]
Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They've all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together

[Verse 2]
There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow

[Chorus]
(They said it wouldn't last)
(We had to prove them wrong)
(Cause I've learned in the past)
(That love would never do without you)

[Verse 3]
Other guys have tried before
To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy it's you I can't do without

[Verse 4]
I feel better when I have you near me
Cause no other love around
Has quite the same, ooh ooh
Like you do, do, do, do babe

[Chorus]
(They said it wouldn't last)
(We had to prove them wrong)
(Cause I've learned in the past)
(That love would never do without you)
Do without you
Love would never do without you
Whoo!
Do without you

[Bridge]
Ooh
Ooh
Go on

(They said it)
(They said it wouldn't last) Whoo!

11,11,Something To Believe In,"[Verse 1]
Well I see him on the TV
Preachin' 'bout the promised lands
He tells me to believe in Jesus
And steals the money from my hands
Some say he was a good man
But Lord I think he sinned, yeah
Twenty-two years of mental tears
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back
Their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife and kids, no regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget
He cried ""Forgive me for what I've done there
Cause I never meant the things I did""

[Chorus]
And give me something to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in
Oh, Lord arise

[Verse 2]
My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
And they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down and cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
Like a lost soul out of place
And the mirror, mirror on the wall
Sees my smile it fades again

[Chorus]
And give me something to believe in (and give me something to believe in)
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in (and give me something to believe in)
Oh, Lord arise

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then
Road, you gotta take me home

[Verse 3]
I drive by the homeless sleeping on
A cold dark street
Like bodies in an open grave
Underneath the broken old neon sign
That used to read
Jesus Saves
A mile away live the rich folks
And I see how they're living it up
While the poor they eat from hand to mouth
The rich is drinkin' from a golden cup
And it just makes me wonder
Why so many lose, so few win

[Chorus]
And give me something to believe in
And give me something to believe in, if there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in, oh Lord arise

12,12,Love Takes Time,"[Verse 1]
I had it all but I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

[Chorus]
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
Because love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

[Verse 2]
Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly, I'm so incomplete
Lord, I need you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly

[Chorus]
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
Because love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

[Bridge]
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do, inside

[Chorus]
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was so blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside

(We're going to dance and have some fun)

[Intro: (Bootsy Collins)]
(Dig!)

[Verse 1: Lady Miss Kier, (Bootsy Collins), ((Q-Tip))]
The chills that you spill up my back keep me filled
With satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another (You know that's right)
Your groove I do deeply dig
No walls, only the bridge
My supper dish, my succotash wish ((Sing it, baby))
I couldn't ask for another ((Uh huh, uh huh))
[Slide whistle]
No, I couldn't ask for another
[Slide whistle]

[Chorus: Lady Miss Kier, (Bootsy Collins)]
[Slide whistle]
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart (Astronomical)
Groove is in the heart
(Watch out)

[Verse 2: Lady Miss Kier]
The depth of hula groove
Moves us to the nth hoop
We're gonna groove to Horton Hears a Who-who
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another
DJ Soul was on a roll
I've been told he can't be sold
He's not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious
I couldn't ask for another
[Slide whistle]

[Verse 3: Q-Tip, (Bootsy Collins)]
Unh, some looks in this torso, yeah
Hot, got a deal, you wanna know, wanna know
Delightful, truly delightful, lightful
Makin' it, doin' it, 'specially at a show, show
Feelin' kinda high like a Hendrix haze, haze
Music makes motion, moves like a maze, maze
All inside of me, side, heart especially, yeah
Note of the rhythm, where I wanna be, c'mon
Flowin', glowin' with electric eyes, eyes
You dip to the dive, baby yo, realize, yeah
When will you see the funky side of me?
Baby, you'll see that rhythm is the key, yeah
Get, get, wit' it, wit' it, can't think, quit it, quit it
Stomp on the street when I hear a funk beat, bloop
Playin' Pied Piper, follow what's true
Baby, just sing about the groove (Sing it)

[Chorus: Lady Miss Kier]
Groove is in the heart (na na na na na)
Groove is in the heart (na na na na na)
Groove is in the heart (na na na na na)

14,14,The First Time,"[Verse 1:]
You know I won't forget the times
We shared together holding hands
And walking in the park

Sometimes we'll have to do it all again
We were so happy then
I've no regrets

Can't you tell from
The look on my face
That I love you more today

[Chorus:]
The first time
I looked into your eyes
I cried
Do you remember the first time
We fell in love

You looked into my eyes
Wiped the tears away
The first time
When we fell in love

[Verse 2:]
Although some time has passed
I still remember
Just like it was yesterday
The time is moving fast

The love I have for you
Time won't ever change
I always feel the same
Now until the end

Memories we share
Will live forever
Deep inside my heart
I know I'll never forget

[Repeat Chorus:]

As you're walkin', out the door
Months go by, and I know for certain
It's not the love, I'm lookin' for

Some times, just for a moment
I reach out; hope you're still there

Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...
You were miles away...

It's hard to tell, what you're goin' through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
Open your heart, and chances are
What you're feelin', I'm feelin' too

If only, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had

Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most
You were miles away

When times were tough, and you were down and out
Who was there by your side?
Now you've gone; I'm so tired of bein' alone..
With only your promises...

Lonliness just fades away
Thoughts of you; just memories
No cryin' now, for what we're missin'
Time won't forget what you meant to me

Hold me, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had

Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most, whoa-oh

Your body starts to get the feeling
And what you're feeling is happiness

Let your body go as you listen
Let it flow to your system
It'll take control of your mind
And make you move your behind

As it grooves
You feel the tension
In the air and now you're hype
You're getting down 'cause
The sound is just your type

Gn and D-o-s-e
Sticking it to you right
So come on, come on and
Party hearty all night and

[Chorus:]
Wiggle it just a little bit
I wanna see you
Wiggle it just a little bit
As it grooves
Wiggle it just a little bit
I wanna see you
Wiggle it just a little bit
As it grooves

Once the dj lets it spin
It'll penetrate your skin
It'll penetrate your soul
And make you lose control

The D-o-s-e's coming at you
Invading you like a body snatcher
Wether if you're drink or sober
This here groove is
Taking over your body

And now you're partying like
You never partied before
You're jumping up and down
Like crazy on the dance floor

You're getting busy like a bee
And that's the truth
I got a feeling there's
A fire on the roof

[Repeat Chorus]
I bet you're moving your body
From side to side
I bet the groove
That you're hearing
Is keeping you satisfied

Dancing by yourself
Is bad for your health
So grab a cutie by the hand
And tell her that you wanna dance
As it grooves

As it grooves
You feel the tension
In the air and now you're hype
You're getting down because
The sound is just your type

Gn and D-o-s-e
Sticking it to you right
So come on, come on
Party hearty all night and

[Repeat Chorus]
As it grooves
As it grooves
As it grooves

Rotate your waist just a tad
Better yet, get bad
Get nasty, get naughty
And if you wanna crack a forty

But don't drink it
If you're driving
Word 'em up, y'all
I ain't jiving

Just kicking it live and making you
Wiggle it just a little bit

And now you're partying like
You've never partied before
You're jumping up and down
Like crazy on the dance floor

You're getting busy like a bee

18,18,After The Rain,"Look in the mirror, girl
By now you should know
You're living in a fantasy
And you can't let go

He never really loved you
From the start
The only thing he ever gave you
Was a broken heart

Don't be afraid to lose
What was never meant to be

Whoa, after the rain
Washes away the tears
And all the pain
Only after the rain
Can you live again

I know the emptiness
You feel inside
You're thinking if you break away
You'll never survive

I'm waiting as my heart
Beats just for you
Come on and take my hand
And I'll pull you through

But things will never change
Until you want them to

Whoa, after the rain
Washes away the tears
And all the pain
Only after the rain
Can you live again

Whoa, whoa, after the rain
(After the rain)
You'll see the sun appear
To light the way
Only after the rain
Can you hope to find
True love again

He never really loved you
From the start
The only thing he ever gave you
Was a broken heart

Come on and take my hand
And I'll pull you through
You know the time has come for you
To face the truth

After the rain
Washes away the tears
And all the pain
Only after the rain
Can you live again

Whoa, whoa, after the rain
(After the rain)
You'll see the sun appear
To light the way
Only after the rain
Can you hope to find
True love again

Whoa, whoa, after the rain
Can you love again

After the rain
Washes away the tears

Everybody dance now!
Everybody dance now!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Everybody dance now!
Yeah!

[Verse 1 - Freedom Williams]
Here is the dome, back with the bass
The jam is live in effect and I don't waste time
On the mike with a dope rhyme
Jump to the rhythm jump jump to the rhythm jump
And I'm here to combine
Beats and lyrics to make your shake your pants
Take a chance, come on and dance
Guys grab a girl, don't wait, make her twirl
It's your world and I'm just a squirrel
Tryin' to get a nut to move your butt
To the dance floor, so yo what's up
Hands in the air, come on say yeah
Everybody over here everybody over there
The crowd is live and I pursue this groove
Party people in the house
Move
(Let your mind)
Groove
(Put me on line)

[Chorus - Martha Wash]
Come on let's sweat, baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Everybody dance now

[Non-lyrical Vocalizing - Martha Wash]

Everybody dance now!
Everybody dance now!

[Verse 2 - Freedom Williams]
Pause, take a breath and go for yours
On my command now hit the dance floor
It's gonna make you sweat 'til you bleed
Is that dope enough, indeed
I paid the price, to control the dice
I'm more precise, to the point I'm nice
The music takes control, your heart and soul
Unfold, your body is free and a whole
Dance till you can't, dance
Till you can't dance no more
Get on the floor and get raw
Then come back and upside down
Easy now, let me see ya
Move
(Let your mind)
Groove
(Put me on line)
(The music is my life)

[Chorus - Martha Wash]
Everybody dance now!
Everybody dance now!
Everybody dance now!
Everybody dance now!
Come on let's sweat, baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you

21,21,Play That Funky Music,"[Intro]
Yo, Vanilla. Kick it one time, boy!

Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy

I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell
A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell
In ecstasy in the back of me
Well that's my DJ D-Shay cuttin' all them Z's
Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy
Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy

I'm lettin' my drug kick in
It controls my mouth and I begin
To just let it flow, let my concepts go
My posse's to the side yellin', Go Vanilla Go!

Smooth cause that's the way I will be
And if you don't give a damn, then
Why you starin' at me
So get off cause I control the stage
There's no dissin' allowed
I'm in my own phase
The girlies say they love me and that is ok
And I can dance better than any Kid 'N Play

Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music, white boy I can't hear you, say it
Play that funky music say it, say it, say
Play that funky music, white boy it, come on
Yea, a little bit louder
Now come on, come on

Stage 2—Yea the one ya' wanna listen to
It's off my head so let the beat play through
So I can funk it up and make it sound good
1-2-3 Yo—Knock on some wood
For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious
Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious
I'm an effect and that you can bet
I can take a fly girl and make her wet

I'm like Samson—Samson to Delilah
There's no denyin', You can try to hang
But you'll keep tryin' to get my style
Over and over, practice makes perfect
But not if you're a loafer

You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls
Soon—Oh my God, homebody, you probably eat
Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it!

Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music white boy Let's do it

VIP. Vanilla Ice yep, yep, I'm comin' hard like a rhino
Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino
So punks stop trying and girl stop cryin'
Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin'
Cause why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue
Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along
All through the ghetto groovin' this here song
Now you're amazed by the VIP posse

Steppin' so hard like a German Nazi
Startled by the bases hittin' ground
There's no trippin' on mine, I'm just gettin' down
Sparkamatic, I'm hangin' tight like a fanatic
You trapped me once and I thought that
You might have it
So step down and lend me your ear
'89 is my time! Yo, '90 is my year
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, I
Play that funky music white boy can't hear you

You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it
Your body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it
So don't be mad and don't be sad
Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad
You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure
Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure
So come up close and don't be square
You wanna battle me—Anytime, anywhere

You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong
So come on, everybody and sing this song

Say—Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go
Play that funky music Go white boy, go white boy, go
Lay down and boogie and play that funky music till you die
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, let me hear
Play that funky music white boy you say it, say it
Play that funky music A little louder now
Play that funky music, white boy Come on, Come on, Come on

22,22,Just Another Dream,"[Verse 1]
The stars say you're my best lover
Matched up like sugar for a cake
They say our love could conquer anything
I'd always hide my feelings
Keep them so cool and so contained
This time, it's something I just can't retain

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you give me a good vibe, don't you know, baby?
You give me funky love, funky love
Could this be what love's all about baby
Or is it just another dream?

[Chorus]
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?

[Verse 2]
Your voice it calls me everywhere
It haunts my room most every night
This thing has sure enough got me on the line
No chance for explanation
It seems my heart has led the way
Is this my chance to find mon amour parfait?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you give me a good vibe, don't you know, baby
You give me funky love, funky love
Could this be what love's all about baby
Or is it just another dream?

[Chorus]
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Love can be so misleading

[Verse 3]
I'd cross the Earth, both land and sea
When I feel that moment badgering me
Could be it's just illusion
But in feeling something good indeed
Is this where loving starts to mirror my dreams?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you give me a good vibe, don't you know, baby?
You give me funky love, funky love
Could this be what love's all about baby
Or is it just another dream?

[Chorus]
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?","['the', 'star', 'say', 'youre', 'my', 'best', 'lover', 'match', 'up', 'like', 'sugar', 'for', 'a', 'cake', 'they', 'say', 'our', 'love', 'could', 'conquer', 'anything', 'id', 'always', 'hide', 'my', 'feel', 'keep', 'them', 'so', 'cool', 'and', 'so', 'contain', 'this', 'time', 'its', 'something', 'i', 'just', 'cant', 'retain', 'cause', 'you', 'give', 'me', 'a', 'good', 'vibe', 'dont', 'you', 'know', 'baby', 'you', 'give', 'me', 'funky', 'love', 'funky', 'love', 'could', 'this', 'be', 'what', 'love', 'all', 'about', 'baby', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'be', 'this', 'for', 'real', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'be', 'this', 'for', 'real', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'be', 'this', 'for', 'real', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'be', 'this', 'for', 'real', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'your', 'voice', 'it', 'call', 'me', 'everywhere', 'it', 'haunt', 'my', 'room', 'most', 'every', 'night', 'this', 'thing', 'have', 'sure', 'enough', 'get', 'me', 'on', 'the', 'line', 'no', 'chance', 'for', 'explanation', 'it', 'seem', 'my', 'heart', 'have', 'lead', 'the', 'way', 'be', 'this', 'my', 'chance', 'to', 'find', 'mon', 'amour', 'parfait', 'cause', 'you', 'give', 'me', 'a', 'good', 'vibe', 'dont', 'you', 'know', 'baby', 'you', 'give', 'me', 'funky', 'love', 'funky', 'love', 'could', 'this', 'be', 'what', 'love', 'all', 'about', 'baby', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'be', 'this', 'for', 'real', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'be', 'this', 'for', 'real', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'be', 'this', 'for', 'real', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'be', 'this', 'for', 'real', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'mislead', 'id', 'cross', 'the', 'earth', 'both', 'land', 'and', 'sea', 'when', 'i', 'feel', 'that', 'moment', 'badger', 'me', 'could', 'be', 'its', 'just', 'illusion', 'but', 'in', 'feel', 'something', 'good', 'indeed', 'be', 'this', 'where', 'love', 'start', 'to', 'mirror', 'my', 'dream', 'cause', 'you', 'give', 'me', 'a', 'good', 'vibe', 'dont', 'you', 'know', 'baby', 'you', 'give', 'me', 'funky', 'love', 'funky', 'love', 'could', 'this', 'be', 'what', 'love', 'all', 'about', 'baby', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'be', 'this', 'for', 'real', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'be', 'this', 'for', 'real', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'be', 'this', 'for', 'real', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream', 'be', 'this', 'for', 'real', 'or', 'be', 'it', 'just', 'another', 'dream']",341,Cathy Dennis,Cathy Dennis,1990,"[24, 24, 25, 34, 41, 47, 56, 60, 71, 88]",10,Just Another Dream (Karaoke Version),https://open.spotify.com/track/5eN3Jb5XGDWsKn7zNpkZpu,5eN3Jb5XGDWsKn7zNpkZpu,spotify:track:5eN3Jb5XGDWsKn7zNpkZpu,"Sbi Karaoke Superstars - Martika, Tiffany & Cathy Dennis",31s08LNlpNyDJDAjLX9WFO,spotify:album:31s08LNlpNyDJDAjLX9WFO,SBI Audio Karaoke,5aChaGbuNya16HNAqdgwfR,spotify:artist:5aChaGbuNya16HNAqdgwfR,277.013,14.0,0.0,2013-11-06,0.725,0.636,0.0,-10.005,0.0,0.0456,0.0008869999999999998,0.8859999999999999,0.0304,0.8370000000000001,119.851,['karaoke'],[],1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.188

The signs are getting clearer
Clearer than you need
The writing's on the wall, for you to see

[Chorus 1]
You never thought you'd ever get the taste
You never thought that it could be this good
Just tell me what you want and I'll find the key
Reach out and touch it's all yours

[Chorus 2]
If you hang in long enough, you'll do it
Just hang in long enough

[Verse 2]
You're down on the ground, or so you say
You'd sell the hole in your pocket, if you could find a way
Don't ask me how I know, you don't wanna hear
It's been a long hard road, and the end is getting near

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
They always say
The best things in life are free
But you want to have everything
Well you're going to have to beg if you want it all

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
They'll let you out, then pull you in
Playing hell with your emotions
You'll feel like giving in

Look out
Ow!
Babe
Oh, babe

[Verse 1:]
People tell me
I can't have everything
But still I wanna have it all

They say I cannot succeed in life
That I'll get so far
And then I'll fall

I don't need no negative outlook
I don't need nobody putting me down
Don't they know that talk is useless?
Nothing's gonna keep my feet on the ground

[Chorus:]
Because I'm on the way up
I've got it all together
Nothing's gonna hold me back

Yeah, I'm on the way up
I'm only getting better
Now tell me what you think about that
Look out

[Verse 2:]
If and when you make it
All kinds of people come around
Some of them in your corner
Some of them put you down
But one thing they all agree on
Is that you are gonna change

When all along
They're the only ones
Who never ever remain the same
Now tell me which one of us changed?

Only fools dont take chances
If you wanna be on top
You gotta work every single moment
Cause another's after your spot

All the suckers scream and shout
They don't know what it's all about
This is my world
And I'm sorry
This table is reserved

[Repeat Chorus:]

Oh
Oh, yeah

[Repeat Chorus:]

People think I can't have everything
But I'm gonna get it all
I'm on the way up

Nothing's gonna make me fall

[Verse 1 - Sage]
You were going through the motions yet again
All alone, looked like you needed a friend
But what you needed was a little reminder
Seems like your only breaks are when you dream
If you’re not happy, why don’t you leave?
You can’t live life by just breathing

Riding the waves, constantly rave

Don’t be scared, do whatever you want

May joy and love take precedence

And you should do the same, and you should do the same
You should

Anything is possible
If you put your mind to it
Anything is possible
Just put your mind to it

Anything is possible
If you put your mind to it
Anything is possible

[Verse 1:]
Thought I couldn't slow him down
Long enough to look my way
Thought he was out of my league
Wouldn't give me time of day

Thought he was like all the rest
Love her
Leave her
No remorse

But I guess that I misjudged
And this thing just ran its course
He taught me

[Repeat Chorus:]
Anything is possible
If you put your mind to it
Anything is possible
Just put your mind to it

Anything is possible
If you put your mind to it
Anything is possible

Break it down now

No matter what it is
It's possible
Say, anything is possible
(Anything)
No matter what it is, it's possible
Say, anything is possible
(Anything)

No matter what it is, it's possible
Say, anything is possible
(Anything)
No matter what it is, it's possible
Say, anything is possible

[Verse 2:]
Much to my surprise
I felt a warm, not cold vibe
When he looked in my eyes
(Oh yeah, it's possible)

His bad boy front
Not charm
Was his disguise
Oh, whoa whoa
(Let me tell you)

He read so much into me
Listened so attentively
He liked me
I rest my case
Wasn't just a pretty face

[Bridge:]
If you set your mind
You can do anything you want
Not every guy is a bad guy

Don't stereotype
'Cause this guy
He proved me wrong
(Anything is possible)
He taught me

[Chorus:]
Anything is possible
Just put your mind to it
If you put your mind
You know you can do anything
Anything

Anything is possible
Anything is possible
Anything is possible

Just put your mind to it

33,33,Ice Ice Baby,"[Intro]
Yo VIP, let's kick it

[Hook]
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby

[Verse 1]
Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
""Will it ever stop?"" Yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gangway
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Hook]
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

[Verse 2]
Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
“Did you stop?” No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Hook]
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

[Verse 3]
Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say “Damn!”
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it

[Hook]
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

[Outro]
Yo man, let's get out of here
Word to your mother

Ice ice baby, too cold

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Bass

It's quarter to two
And I've still got you
On my mind, oh baby
I'm just a prisoner

Trapped in the chains
Of your love, it cuts like a knife
Imagining life without you
Oh, darling

I'm up to the challenge
And I'm willing to fight
I'd do anything to have you
With me tonight, oh baby

I'd swim a river
If the river was wide
I'd climb a mountain
If the mountain was high

I'd do anything, girl
Just to be by your side
I'm out of my mind
My love is a fire

It's heaven on earth
And we don't need words
To describe it
I'm lost in forever

I don't ever wanna come down
I was a fool
I broke every rule before you, girl

Searching for answers
And I've looked high and low
Now that I've found you, girl
I can't let you go, oh baby

Id swim a river
If the river was wide
Id climb a mountain
If the mountain was high

Id do anything, girl
Just to be by your side
I'm out of my mind
My love is a fire

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I'm burning up, can't cool down
Flames getting higher
Burning down to the ground

I'd swim a river
If the river was wide
I'd climb a mountain
If the mountain was high

I'd do anything, girl
Just to be by your side
I'm out of my mind
My love is a fire

I'd swim a river
If the river was wide
I'd climb a mountain
If the mountain was high

I'd do anything, girl
Just to be by your side
I'm out of my mind
My love is a fire

I'd swim a river
If the river was wide
I'd climb a mountain

36,36,Knockin' Boots,"(Tone Loc)
Attention all ladies
The Candyman is on the prowl
And for those that wanna get busy
You gots to speak up now

(Candyman)
This rhyme, this time
Is one of a kind, blowing yo mind
Like only the Candyman can
Like a heavyweight champion
Knockin'em out, another bout without a doubt
Once again you can scream and shout
When I rock the bells
Yell out my name
This is what you've been missing
Listen to my heart beat, while I'm whispering
I know your suffering
So sweet a Candyman sweet nothings
Hugging and tugging and rubbing
Loving it all, having a ball
All ya'll girlies next to me
Talking sex to me
We can't do that yet, but I bet will chill
(Candyman telling'em the truth)
Will still end up knockin the boots

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you

(Candyman)
At each and every show, thers's this groupie
Artis knows what she wants to do to me
She knows my name, knows every rap routine
But how she get in my limousine
Don't act fool, don't drool
I'm just a performer
I was cool but the room got warmer
Norma cornered me in
Her and a friend named Llynn, then
They checked me in to the Holiday Inn
I didn't let'em win, said my pockets was thin
She blew me a kiss
I knew she wasn't new to this
I didn't want to, but the devil made me do it
To the tic-toc ya don't stop
We knock boots till 6 o'clock, as we lay
All night long
And early in the morning she sang this song

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
(Girl I do)

(Candyman)
Tunnel of love is what I'm entering
When I mention it, you're surrending
Giving it up like a good girl has to
Living it up
Eventually you ask to stay
You're gonna pay for this
Just rest your breast on my chest, yes I'm impressed
With the way you cold love me down
I don't wanna sit down, I just wanna get down
I'm on the ground, down on my knees
Like James Brown singing Please, Please
Round two, I'm down to
Do, what it takes to make you
Understand I'm the Candyman
And I melt in your mouth, not in your hands
Hard as rock, yes I'm no sucka
The boots I knock make me one bad mutha
(Unh Unh...giggling) *2

Knockin, while I'm a hip-hoppin
Many people say my lyrics are shocking
Just because of the simple subject
Everyone should love this
Cause everybody does it
Whether they admit it or if they deny it
You betta keep quiet
Or else you might have to see a few skeletons
But girl thats irrevelent
Break out the bottle of Asti Spumante
Pop off the top and rock wit my posse
Fila Al, Big Dill, and D Fly
We ask the questions, you give the reply

I'm looking at what's on T.V
Pain and suffering
And the struggle to be free

It can't ever be denied and I
Never will ignore
But when I see you coming
I can take it all

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

Say you're mine
And give yourself to the
Feelings that you know
I'm needing
All that you can give me
All the things
That you do so well
Words are healing
Sweet anticipation
Making spells
As the shadows close in
Fall across all our yesterdays

Look into myself and reason
But I could never never see or
Make sense of the dealings

Turn around
Am I looking at salvation
Make me realize all that I am

39,39,Around The Way Girl,"[Intro: Sample]
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out
On your loving, your loving

[Verse 1]
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jams
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Let's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

[Verse 2]
Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me (to the bridge)
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

[Verse 3]
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
Witcha New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you, you're from around the way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way, girl
I'm asking you

40,40,So Close,"They met on the dance floor in the old high school gym
He fell like a rock, she kinda liked him
And his heart beat like thunder, as they moved cross the floor
When the music was over, she slipped out of his arms, and out the door

Yeah a man loves a woman, but he can't understand
Why she's sad when she stares, at the ring on her hand
Or she sits in some club, where the long shadows fall
Drops a coin in the jukebox, not the phone on the wall

So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow, maybe more than today
We're so close, so close, yet so far away

Some people think, if you really believe
That's what you need to solve all the mysteries
Yea I know someone, who just heads for the sun
She says ""I don't wanna be wise, I just wanna stay young""

So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow, though we're stuck in today
Baby we're so close, so close, yet so far away

There's a restless look in your eye tonight
There's a secret hurt in my heart
And the dream that pulls us together girl
Is a dream, that's gonna tear us, tear us apart

There's a restless look in your eye tonight
Oh, are you lookin' for some way out of here
We gotta fight to keep it together girl
For the dream, that keeps us

So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
Who would of thought girl that we'd end up this way
Getting so close, so close
So far away

We're living in a dream world
Yet we're livin' today girl
Just you and me baby

41,41,The Ghetto,"[Intro]
Talking bout the ghetto...funky, funky ghetto
Trying to survive, trying to stay alive

[Chorus]
The ghetto
The ghetto
(Talking bout the ghetto)
The ghetto
The ghetto
(Funky, funky ghetto)

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
Even though the streets are bumpy, lights burned out
Dope fiends die with a pipe in their mouth
Old school buddies not doing it right
Every day it's the same and it's the same every night
I wouldn't shoot you bro but I'd shoot that fool
If he played me close and tried to test my cool
Every day I wonder just how I'll die
Only thing I know is how to survive
There's only one rule in the real world
And that's to take care of you, only you and yours
Keep dealing with the hard times day after day
Might deal me some dope but then crime don't pay
Black man trying to break into my house again
Thought he got off dope doing time in the pen
Even though my brothers do me just like that
I get a lot of love so I'm giving it back to the ghetto

[Chorus]
The ghetto
(Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
The ghetto
(Funky, funky ghetto)
The ghetto
(Trying to live our lives)
The ghetto
(Won't ya tell 'em 'bout it Too $hort)

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
So just peep the game and don't call it crap
'Cause to me, life is one hard rap
Even though my sister smoked crack cocaine
She was nine months pregnant, ain't nothing changed
600 million on a football team
And her baby died just like a dope fiend
The story I tell is so incomplete
Five kids in the house, no food to eat
Don't look at me and don't ask me why
Mama's next door getting high
Even though she's got five mouths to feed
She'd rather spend her money on a H-I-T
I always tell the truth about things like this
I wonder if the mayor overlooked that list
Instead of adding to the task force send some help
Waiting on him I'd better help myself
Housing Authority and the O.P.D
All these guns just to handle me in the ghetto...

[Chorus]
The ghetto
(People are dyin')
The ghetto
(Children are cryin')
The ghetto
(Don't have enough to eat)
The ghetto
(Don't even have shoes on their feet)
The ghetto

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Even though they put us down and call us animals
We make real big banks and buy brand new clothes
Drive fancy cars, make love to stars
Never really saying just who we are
We use alias names like TOO $HORT
Sell you stuff you might kill for
Young kids grow up and that's all they know
Didn't teach him in school now he's slangin' dope
Only thing he knows is how to survive
But will he kill another brother before he dies?
In the ghetto, you keep one eye open
All day long, just hoping and hoping
You can pay your bills and not drink too much
Then the problems of life you'll be throwing up
Like me, but you don't see
Ten years from now, where will you be?

[Chorus]
The ghetto
(Tryin' to get out of the ghetto)
The ghetto
(But I got no place to go)
The ghetto
(Tryin' to survive in the heart of the ghetto)
The ghetto
(Ha, 'cause that's the only place that I know)

[Verse 4: Too $hort]
So much game in a Too $hort rap
Can't be white and whites can't be black
Why you wanna act like someone else?
All you gotta do is just be yourself
We're all the same color underneath
Short Dog is in the house, you better listen to me
Never be ashamed of what you are
Proud to be black, stand tall and hard
Even though some people give you no respect
Be intelligent, when you put 'em in check
'Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way
And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say
So if you don't listen, it's not my fault
I'll be getting paid and you'll be paying the cost
Sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth
While me and my people try to get out

[Chorus]

43,43,I Saw Red,"Ooh it must be magic
How inside your eyes I see my destiny
Every time we kiss
I feel you breathe your love so deep inside of me
If the moon and stars should fall
They'd be easy to replace
I would lift you up to heaven
And you would take their place

Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore

Everyday I wake up
I thank God that you are still a part of me
We've opened up the door to which
So many people never find the key
And if the sun should ever fail to send its light
We would burn a thousand candles
And make everything alright

Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore

I've been hurt and I've been blind
I'm not sure that I'll be fine
I never thought it would end this way

'Cause I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours

That's word, we pray (Pray, pray)
We got to pray just to make it today
I said we pray (Pray)
Oh yeah we pray (Pray)
We got to pray just to make it today
That's word, we pray

[Verse 1]
All my life I wanted to make it to the top
(That's word, we pray)
Some said I wouldn't, they told me no, but I didn't stop
(That's word, we pray)
Working hard, making those moves everyday
(That's word, we pray)
And on my knees, every night you know I pray

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now I just think that you can do whatever you want
(That's word, we pray)
I'm busting these rhymes making this money and I won't
(That's word, we pray)
Forget my people or my town or my ways
(That's word, we pray)
And on my knees every night I'm still gone pray

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Time and time and time and time and time again
(That's word, we pray)
I kept on knocking, but these people wouldn't let me in
(That's word, we pray)
I tried and tried and tried and tried to make a way
(That's word, we pray)
But nothing happened 'til that day I prayed

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Children dying, oh so fast from this and that
(That's word, we pray)
Need that money, working that dope, smoking that crack
(That's word, we pray)
Ten years old, stand outside, better look out
(That's word, we pray)
Dead and gone, never had a chance, what's it all about?

[Alternate Chorus]
That's word, we pray (Pray, pray)
We need to pray just to make it today
I said we pray (Pray)
Oh yeah we pray (Pray)
We need to pray just to make it today

[Verse 5]
On a mission start to doubt, here we go
(That's word, we pray)
Kicking back, read these words we need to know
(That's word, we pray)
Living high, living good, living long
(That's word, we pray)
Take a minute, bust a prayer and you good to go

[Alternate Chorus]

[Outro]
We're sending this one out to the Lord
And we thank you and we know we need to pray

45,45,New York Minute,"Harry got up, dressed all in black
Went down to the station, and he never came back
They found his clothing scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning now

He had a home, love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes as years unfurl
One day, he crossed some line, and he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, things can get pretty strange
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute

Lying here in the darkness, I hear the sirens wail
Somebody going to emergency, somebody's going to jail
You find somebody to love in this world, you better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, things can get a little strange
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute

And in these days, darkness falls early
And people rush home to the ones they love
You'd better take a fool's advice and take care of your own
One day they're here, next day they're gone

Pulled my coat around my shoulders, took a walk down through the park
Leaves were falling around me, groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock, a desperate lover left his mark
""Baby, I've changed, please come back""

What the head makes cloudy, the heart makes very clear
I know the days were so much brighter in the time when she was here
I know that somebody somewhere can make these dark clouds disappear
But until that day, I have to believe, I believe, I believe

In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, you can get out of the rain
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York, New York minute
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, you can get out of the rain
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, you can get out of the rain
In a New York minute, everything can change","['harry', 'get', 'up', 'dress', 'all', 'in', 'black', 'go', 'down', 'to', 'the', 'station', 'and', 'he', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'they', 'find', 'his', 'clothe', 'scatter', 'somewhere', 'down', 'the', 'track', 'and', 'he', 'wont', 'be', 'down', 'on', 'wall', 'street', 'in', 'the', 'morning', 'now', 'he', 'have', 'a', 'home', 'love', 'of', 'a', 'girl', 'but', 'men', 'get', 'lose', 'sometimes', 'as', 'years', 'unfurl', 'one', 'day', 'he', 'cross', 'some', 'line', 'and', 'he', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'in', 'this', 'world', 'but', 'i', 'guess', 'it', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'anymore', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'everything', 'can', 'change', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'things', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'strange', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'everything', 'can', 'change', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'lie', 'here', 'in', 'the', 'darkness', 'i', 'hear', 'the', 'sirens', 'wail', 'somebody', 'go', 'to', 'emergency', 'somebodys', 'go', 'to', 'jail', 'you', 'find', 'somebody', 'to', 'love', 'in', 'this', 'world', 'you', 'better', 'hang', 'on', 'tooth', 'and', 'nail', 'the', 'wolf', 'be', 'always', 'at', 'the', 'door', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'everything', 'can', 'change', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'things', 'can', 'get', 'a', 'little', 'strange', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'everything', 'can', 'change', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'and', 'in', 'these', 'days', 'darkness', 'fall', 'early', 'and', 'people', 'rush', 'home', 'to', 'the', 'ones', 'they', 'love', 'youd', 'better', 'take', 'a', 'fool', 'advice', 'and', 'take', 'care', 'of', 'your', 'own', 'one', 'day', 'theyre', 'here', 'next', 'day', 'theyre', 'go', 'pull', 'my', 'coat', 'around', 'my', 'shoulder', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'down', 'through', 'the', 'park', 'leave', 'be', 'fall', 'around', 'me', 'groan', 'city', 'in', 'the', 'gather', 'dark', 'on', 'some', 'solitary', 'rock', 'a', 'desperate', 'lover', 'leave', 'his', 'mark', 'baby', 'ive', 'change', 'please', 'come', 'back', 'what', 'the', 'head', 'make', 'cloudy', 'the', 'heart', 'make', 'very', 'clear', 'i', 'know', 'the', 'days', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'brighter', 'in', 'the', 'time', 'when', 'she', 'be', 'here', 'i', 'know', 'that', 'somebody', 'somewhere', 'can', 'make', 'these', 'dark', 'cloud', 'disappear', 'but', 'until', 'that', 'day', 'i', 'have', 'to', 'believe', 'i', 'believe', 'i', 'believe', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'everything', 'can', 'change', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'you', 'can', 'get', 'out', 'of', 'the', 'rain', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'everything', 'can', 'change', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'everything', 'can', 'change', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'you', 'can', 'get', 'out', 'of', 'the', 'rain', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'everything', 'can', 'change', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'everything', 'can', 'change', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'you', 'can', 'get', 'out', 'of', 'the', 'rain', 'in', 'a', 'new', 'york', 'minute', 'everything', 'can', 'change']",393,Don Henley,Don Henley,1990,"[48, 48, 49, 53, 58, 63, 73, 82]",8,New York Minute,https://open.spotify.com/track/2jxqu3v4AZAhUNvdAbDGet,2jxqu3v4AZAhUNvdAbDGet,spotify:track:2jxqu3v4AZAhUNvdAbDGet,The End Of The Innocence,12lDqJuZIqMk6DNe1fInFl,spotify:album:12lDqJuZIqMk6DNe1fInFl,Don Henley,5dbuFbrHa1SJlQhQX9OUJ2,spotify:artist:5dbuFbrHa1SJlQhQX9OUJ2,395.4,10.0,55.0,1989-01-01,0.551,0.289,8.0,-12.214,0.0,0.0262,0.334,0.0,0.0379,0.117,132.132,"['album rock', 'art rock', 'classic rock', 'country rock', 'folk', 'folk rock', 'heartland rock', 'mellow gold', 'pop rock', 'rock', 'roots rock', 'singer-songwriter', 'soft rock', 'yacht rock']",[],1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0.043

48,48,Where Does My Heart Beat Now,"[Verse 1]
So much to believe in, we were lost in time
Everything I needed
I feel in your eyes
Always thought of keeping
Your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave
Without a trace
Where do silent hearts go

[Chorus]
Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

[Verse 2]
Candle in the water, drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder
Come and rescue me
Driven by hunger
Of the endless dream
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go

[Chorus]
Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

[Verse 3]
Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly

[Chorus]
Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

[Bridge]
I've got someone to give my heart to
Feel it getting stronger and stronger
And stronger
And I feel inside

[Outro]
Hearts are made to last

Love appears at the worst
And even the best of times
Takes over your mind
Your heart is not your own

With a good heart and good intentions
And you could never leave your home

I went out, last night
See, that's when I met a sexy girl
She was lookin' so right
She said, ""I wanna take you for a trip around the world""

And by the look in her eyes
I could tell the girl was serious!
She wore no disguise, oh no..
So let's have some fun, yeah!

[Chorus]
(I thought it was me) - I thought it was me who makes the girl this way
(I thought it was me) - I came to find out she's like that every day
(I thought it was me) - I thought it was me that makes that girl so wild
(I thought it was me) - I found out she's like that with all the guys

[Michael Bivins]
Yo, I love bein a bachelor
Ricky said, ""Yo, that girl's a good catch for ya""
She and I choose to cruise in my love boat
My waterbed, kept us afloat
I had to prove my manhood
Show her that the B-I-V was DAMN good, understood?
I never had my boat rocked like that before, YO!!

[Ricky Bell]
The way we left the spot, all systems ready to go
She said, ""Sit back and relax, I'm runnin' the show""
I couldn't hesitate, it was much too late
That girl had got me straight, and I was ready to go, yeah!

Than the bread on the meat of my sandwich
I know you knocked the boots, cuz

[Ronnie DeVoe]
Naaaw, it wasn't even like that
She left the room to get comfy and cozy (wha?)
Then the R to the O to the N got nosey

[Ricky Bell]
Cruising guys was her favorite past-time
Takin' chances almost got her lifetime
She said, ""You only live oooooonce""
Stayin' loose, made many head turns
If you did her wrong, you just might get burned
So let's have some fun, yeah-HE!

58,58,Heat Of The Moment,"L.A. Reid and Babyface

There comes a time in every man's life
You're gonna do wrong
I made a mistake girl..Just let me..
Just let me explain

I can't believe it
Although I did it
I've never been that kinda man
I must admit it
I wasn't with it
But you were the best I've ever had

Right now I'm going thru some changes
I've always thought I was
A faithful kind of man
I never thought I would be tempted
Baby you licked my lips
And I said right now...right now

In the heat of the moment**
Baby I lost my head. Lost my mind
Didn't know what to do
In the heat of the moment
Baby I fell in lust with you

Now that I've done it
Oh how I want it
But I've got to be a stronger man
I love my lady
Can't lose my baby
Cause if she knew
I'd lose everything I have

Don't want to go thru no more changes
From now on I promise I will be a better man
But here you are again temptin'
Baby when you lick my lips. I said
Right now, right now

Repeat chorus**2x

Baby Baby you've got to slow down
From now on I promise I will be a better man
Now...Now I know that you know
That we can't carry on like this
Girl stop...just stop
Baby when you kissed my lips, I said
Right now...Right now

59,59,Close To You,"[Verse 1:]
She was a Jezebel
Miss Brixton queen
Living her life like a bad sweet dream
Telling me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

Spinning around
Like a wheel on fire
Walking the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escaping me

[Chorus:]
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

[Verse 2:]
I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you's just like a dream
Love is never what it seems

When we touch
And you're holding me the way you feel
Girl, you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true

[Chorus:]
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

[Verse 3:]
She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds me back
But she goes too far
Winding me up just to let me down

So emotional
Gagged and bound
There's more to this than meets the eye

A devil woman locked inside
With the formal rising
I was scared
I think I was possesed

[Chorus:]
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
Everytime your body's next to mine
Somethin' deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly

When we touch
Girl, you don't know
How it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real!

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

[Verse 4:]
She had an attitude
I can't explain
You never know if your in flame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on a countdown till I get hurt

Her blood was hot
She burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar

[Chorus:]
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
(She was a Jezebel
This bursting queen
Living her life like a bad sweet dream)

Telling me lies
When the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

I just wanna be close to you
(Spinning around like a wheel on fire)
Walkin' the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escaping me

I wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
(I just wanna be close to you, baby)
And show you the way I feel

I just wanna be close to you

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No, I don't wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)               with you
With you
(This world is only gonna break your heart)

[Verse 2]
What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you and

I don't wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)

Girl u remind me of my jeep and my s5
First I was on top of you now u sayin lets ride
Freakin yo body so good I give you wet thighs
When we get together you know we make the sex live
Take you to paradise while massaging u down
Feeling betta with twins ménagin u down
Make u explode and now I'm calming u down
So good that u don't want me to bother u now
Now listen here
Come and kick it with the players, ghetto majors and the thumpa sprayers
And we neva got no room for no haters
When we pull up on them 24 omegas
While I'm smoking on a gar seeing Vega
You by my side we be on one when we hangin
What earthquake say is wrong in a relationship
We a corporation lets take over the nation
Let me get up with u girl
Don't be trippin on yo guy he gone be up when the heat come out
'cause u could rub the lamp three times and still won't a muthaf**ka like me come out

Take u to the crib and sex u nonstop and
Bone thugs top droppin
Vip with the bottles poppin
So clean we gotta take a picture
So sexy I wanna get wit u
Girl I'll be singing thrilla
While u be squeezing pillows
And we can take a shower together
Get cozy in stormy weather
And if u ever going through something
I promise to make it betta
Ya just keep on lovin a thug
Massage and some sex when I tell u its time
U ain't neva gotta want for nothing
As long as u down and u ready to ride
I wanna give u them butterflies
Have yo head all off up in da sky
And we be going (weo weo weo weo)

Or pull up in the 7-4 to the fend (4 to the fend)
Won't u get in
While I'm steady blowin smoke in the wind (smoke in the wind)
Hoping to win
Now speakin words to my head in the bed
Then after we work then we can do it that one way
Lookin thick as a loaf of bread by legs
And u get at shakin the way the twista make the tongue play
And this is for tha love and the ladies
The fine women that be rollin Mercedes
Getting freaky and
And we be going (weo weo weo weo)

62,62,It Never Rains (In Southern California),"[Intro]
It never rains in southern California
I'll see you when I get there

[Verse 1: Raphael Saadiq]
I haven't seen your face in a year
I can't wait 'til I get there
Just to kiss and squeeze and hug
And girl, you know the rest, 'cause they tell me

[Chorus]
It never rains in southern California (And they tell me...)
It never rains in southern California

[Verse 2: Raphael Saadiq]
Maybe I'll take a flight out tonight
And you can pick me up about 8
I don't know what airline, girl
But I know it won't be late 'cause they tell me

[Chorus]
It never rains in southern California (They tell me...)
It never rains in southern California

[Verse 3: Raphael Saadiq]
Now I can't sleep at night
Without your 8 x 10 by my side
That day will come
For us to be together
I'm not worried 'bout a thing
Not even stormy weather...
Baby, baby, baby...

[Refrain]
Now, it may be cold on the East Coast
But on the other side of town, it never rains...

[Verse 4: Raphael Saadiq]
We have so much to talk about
A lot a catching up to do
I'll bring the diamond, girl
Because I'm so into you
'Cause they tell me...

[Chorus]
It never rains in southern California (They tell me...)
It never rains in southern California

[Verse 5: Raphael Saadiq]
Now since I'll be here at your place
Let's take a week's trip for two
We don't have to go to far
Just as long as I'm with you
'Cause they tell me...

[Chorus]
It never rains in southern California (And they tell me...)
It never rains in southern California

[Verse 6: Raphael Saadiq]
Can we just be alone
Without those other strangers calling your phone
Now I don't want to be that selfish kind of guy
But tonight let me take you on a natural high
Just me and you alone

[Refrain]
Now, it may be cold on the East Coast
But on the other side of town, it never rains...
Now, it may be cold on the East Coast
But on the other side of town, it never rains...
I'll see you when I get there

[Chorus]
It never rains in southern California
(I wanna be right there with you)
It never rains in southern California
(There's nothing else I'd rather do)
It never rains in southern California
(Baby, baby, baby)
It never rains in southern California
(I'll see you when I get there)

[Refrain]
Now, it may be cold on the east Coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...
Now, it may be cold on the East Coast
But on the other side of town, it never rains...
(I just wanna be with you)

[Chorus]
It never rains in southern California
(That's what they tell me)
It never rains in southern California
(Girl, I wanna be with you for the rest of my life)
It never rains in southern California
(Oh-oh, yeah)
It never rains in southern California
(Now, I want to...)
It never rains in southern California
(...hug you, squeeze you, I wanna see your pretty little smile)
It never rains in southern California
(Uh-hoo-hoo-woo-woo, woo...)

63,63,Shelter Me,"Everybody needs a little place they can hide
Somewhere to call their own
Don't let nobody inside
Every now and then we all need to let go
For some it's a doctor, for me it's rock and roll
For some it's a bottle
For some it's a pill
Some people read the Bible cause it's givin' them a thrill
Others point their finger if they don't like what they see
If you live in a glass house don't be throwing rocks at me

(Chorus)
We all need a little shelter
Just a little helper to get us by
We all need a little shelter
Just a little helper ohhh and it'll be alright

Check out Mr. Politician in his suit and tie
But when the doors are closed there ain't nothing he won't try
Meanwhile Mr. Medicine's treating his best friend's wife
Tipper led the war against the record industry
She said she saw the devil on her MTV
To look into the cabinet it takes more than a key
Just like Jimmy's skeleton's and his ministry

(Chorus)
For some it's a needle for some it's pill
Some people read the Bible cause it's giving them a thrill
You can spend your money before you get your pay
With a toss of the dice you can piss it all away

65,65,Can't Stop,"[Verse 1: Kevon Edmonds]
Last night, I had the time of my life
It's true
Oh, last night, I made love for the very first time
With you

[Pre-Chorus]
I never knew love could be so sweet, mmm...
It never made a difference to me, mmm, well well...
But ever since the day that you appeared
I'm telling you made the difference
Now love is so clear

[Chorus]
And I can't stop (Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
We're diggin' on we
And no I can't stop (Can't Stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me

[Verse 2: Kevon Edmonds]
Last night, you brought something special out of me
Ooh wee
And for the first time, girl
You made my dream a reality
Indeed

[Pre-Chorus]
I never thought love was meant for me, mmm...
I was blind and could not see, mmm, well well
You brought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you've made the difference
Now love is so clear

[Chorus]
And I can't stop (Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
We're diggin' on we
And I can't stop (Can't Stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
Ooh wee, girl

[Interlude: Melvin Edmonds]
I can't stop
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
We're diggin' on we, girl
I can't stop
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me

[Bridge: Kevon Edmonds]
You've got me thinking that I need protection
'Cause your love is so strong
I don't wanna do wrong
Girl, your love seems like it's true
I'm asking you just give me a call
And I'll give you my all

[Chorus]
Can't stop (I can't stop)

66,66,Go For It! (Heart And Fire),"Go for it, that's right, that's right [repeat 3]

To be or not to be, dope, that's the question
Are you gonna stop or keep on rushing
For the better, quicker than the next man
To be the best is the master plan
Go on with all you've got, give it your best shot
Don't ever think about trying to stop
Keep reaching, pushing, hoping for perfection
Make up your direction, don't ever stop for a moment
Prove you want it
If you got it flaunt it and get up on it
Go for yours, not for a minute but for all the time
You better so it cause I'm going for mine

Go for it, that's right, heart and fire yeah
Go go go, I see it in your eye
Go for it, heart and fire
Go go you've got to go for the feeling

It's time for the rhyme of the bold and the gifted
Listen closely and you'll get lifted
Higher than you ever been before
Get more than you bargained for for sure
Life can be a trick for of trouble
But you got to stand up and fight back double
Don't let nothing hold you back
Yo when life says stop you say go go go
Reaching, growing, teaching, knowing
Is that a preaching that each and every one of you are blowin
Get youself together, keep moving
Don't let nothing stop your flowing
Go for what you want, don't hold back
Cause I know you got the knack
So go farther than you've ever been before
I'm going for mine, go, so go for yours

Go for it, that's right, heart and fire yeah
Go go go, I see it in your eye

Up and down, ive climed these walls

The pictures of a happier couple
Just hang on the wall
And smile away through all the trouble
Side to side

Reminding me by the hour

I need you to this day
Imagine if I said I sometimes hear you call my name
Imagine if I said I still could love you
Imagine what you’d say
Imagine if I said I sometimes still can see your face

Think about all the things we shared
Think about all the times we cared
When all of your hopes have come and gone
Think about me and I’ll be there

There’s something in the air that feels like winter
The kind we used to know
Yesterday can seem like such a long, long time ago
Who could ever count the miles between us?
But now I know it’s true
Imagine if I said that all my dreams are dreams of you

Think about all the things we shared
Think about all the times we cared
When all of your dreams have come and gone
Think about me and I’ll be there
Think about images we’ve drawn
Think about all those empty songs
Whenever you’re sure that I won’t dare
Think about me and I’ll be gone

It took me a long, long time to learn
That love is a thing you have to earn
I finally realized it’s true
I just can’t make it without you

From the way you look and the way you dress
I can tell you ain't got no shame

And that's alright

You say you're from the city
And it all moves so fast
Got your fancy cars and your diamond rings
You don't need a love to last

And that's alright
'Cause I'm just a man

When you're ready to be bad
Just give it-Give it to me good

Me I'm just a rocker
Ain't got much to say
I never did things by the rules
Always did things my way

And that's alright
'Cause that's the way I am anyway

And he taught me how to live
He said ""Son, you gotta be someone-
Not takin' more than you give""

And that's alright
That's the way I am Palio

Every night I say a prayer
In the hopes that there's a Heaven
And everyday I'm more confused
As the saints turn into sinners

[Pre-Chorus]
All the heroes and legends
I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay
And I feel this empty place inside
So afraid that I've lost my faith

[Chorus]
Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Please show me the way

[Verse 2]
And as I slowly drift to sleep
For a moment dreams are sacred
I close my eyes and know there's peace
In a world so filled with hatred

[Pre-Chorus]
That I wake up each morning and turn on the news
To find we've so far to go
And I keep on hoping for a sign
So afraid I just won't know

[Chorus]
Show me the way, show me the way
Bring me tonight to the mountain
And take my confusion away
And show me the way

[Bridge]
And if I see a light, should I believe
Tell me how will I know

[Chorus]
Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Show me the way, show me the way
Give me the strength and the courage
To believe that I'll get there someday
And please show me the way

Can you tell me where we're going to?
Can you tell me what it is we really want to find
Is the truth really there?
Or is it right under our hair?
For all we know
It's been there all the time

[Chorus]
I say
Nothing comes from dreamers but dreams
I say
Sitting idle in our boat
While everyone else is down the stream

Nothing comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want to
But the world still goes around and round

Round and round
We go round and round and round
And what we're looking for still isn't found

Nothing comes from dreamers but dreams
I say

Can you tell me when we gonna get to it
I'm tired of fooling around
I said I want to do it
I learned my lesson young

I say
If you really want to have fun
Go for it and when you win
Say ""I go for it""

[Interlude]
One day
I'll make it in the big city
And I'll be looking for a girl who's pretty

One day
I'll make a play and she will say ok
'Cuz I plan to be a cool kitty

72,72,Giving You The Benefit,"[Intro:]
G-G-Giving you, giving you
G-G-Giving you, giving you
G-G-Giving you, giving you

Here we go
1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been trying to figure out your mind
And why you keep dissing me
Poor little me
And why you have a change of heart
Then turn it all around
And then try to put it on me
Poor little me

But don't you know
I can be a trip
I can make things hard
But baby I believe that you still got a heart
That's why I try to stop myself before I start
'Cause I can make it tough
I can make it rough
But I won't

[Chorus]
Well, I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out
Baby, work it on
Work it on out
(Work, work, work)
Baby, work it on
Work it on out
(Work, work, work)

Oooh, oooooooooh

[Verse 2]
Baby, how could you be hanging out on the town
And claim that you're missing me
Poor little me
When you knew all the time
That you could've been with your homegirl
Loving and a kissing on me
Sweet little me

But don't you know
If you wanna be a man
You gotta work real hard
If you wanna make me feel like I'm your number one
And nothing in the world should make us part
'Cause we can make it work
If you take away the hurt from the heart

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Oh) I can be a trip
But I choose not to
(Oh, oh) Deep inside of you
I think there's still good in you, boy
(Oh) Don't give me no reason not to trust you
(Oh, oh) Just take the benefit
Don't give me no lip
And I'll be sweet to you

[Chorus 2X]

I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit (woo)
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit (woo)
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit

I'll be giving you a minute or two
To try and work it out
(I wanna work it, baby)
I'll be giving you a minute or two
To try and work it out
(But don't you take too long, baby)

[Chorus 2X]

I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit (woo)
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit (woo)
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit","['gggiving', 'you', 'give', 'you', 'gggiving', 'you', 'give', 'you', 'gggiving', 'you', 'give', 'you', 'here', 'we', 'go', '1', '2', '3', '4', 'lately', 'ive', 'be', 'try', 'to', 'figure', 'out', 'your', 'mind', 'and', 'why', 'you', 'keep', 'diss', 'me', 'poor', 'little', 'me', 'and', 'why', 'you', 'have', 'a', 'change', 'of', 'heart', 'then', 'turn', 'it', 'all', 'around', 'and', 'then', 'try', 'to', 'put', 'it', 'on', 'me', 'poor', 'little', 'me', 'but', 'dont', 'you', 'know', 'i', 'can', 'be', 'a', 'trip', 'i', 'can', 'make', 'things', 'hard', 'but', 'baby', 'i', 'believe', 'that', 'you', 'still', 'get', 'a', 'heart', 'thats', 'why', 'i', 'try', 'to', 'stop', 'myself', 'before', 'i', 'start', 'cause', 'i', 'can', 'make', 'it', 'tough', 'i', 'can', 'make', 'it', 'rough', 'but', 'i', 'wont', 'well', 'ill', 'be', 'give', 'you', 'the', 'benefit', 'of', 'the', 'doubt', 'im', 'give', 'you', 'a', 'minute', 'to', 'try', 'to', 'work', 'it', 'on', 'out', 'ill', 'be', 'give', 'you', 'the', 'benefit', 'of', 'the', 'doubt', 'and', 'im', 'give', 'you', 'a', 'minute', 'to', 'try', 'to', 'work', 'it', 'on', 'out', 'baby', 'work', 'it', 'on', 'work', 'it', 'on', 'out', 'baby', 'work', 'it', 'on', 'work', 'it', 'on', 'out', 'oooh', 'oooooooooh', 'baby', 'how', 'could', 'you', 'be', 'hang', 'out', 'on', 'the', 'town', 'and', 'claim', 'that', 'youre', 'miss', 'me', 'poor', 'little', 'me', 'when', 'you', 'know', 'all', 'the', 'time', 'that', 'you', 'couldve', 'be', 'with', 'your', 'homegirl', 'love', 'and', 'a', 'kiss', 'on', 'me', 'sweet', 'little', 'me', 'but', 'dont', 'you', 'know', 'if', 'you', 'wanna', 'be', 'a', 'man', 'you', 'gotta', 'work', 'real', 'hard', 'if', 'you', 'wanna', 'make', 'me', 'feel', 'like', 'im', 'your', 'number', 'one', 'and', 'nothing', 'in', 'the', 'world', 'should', 'make', 'us', 'part', 'cause', 'we', 'can', 'make', 'it', 'work', 'if', 'you', 'take', 'away', 'the', 'hurt', 'from', 'the', 'heart', 'but', 'i', 'choose', 'not', 'to', 'i', 'think', 'theres', 'still', 'good', 'in', 'you', 'boy', 'dont', 'give', 'me', 'no', 'lip', 'and', 'ill', 'be', 'sweet', 'to', 'you', 'i', 'wanna', 'give', 'it', 'im', 'give', 'you', 'the', 'benefit', 'i', 'wanna', 'give', 'it', 'im', 'give', 'you', 'the', 'benefit', 'ill', 'be', 'give', 'you', 'a', 'minute', 'or', 'two', 'to', 'try', 'and', 'work', 'it', 'out', 'ill', 'be', 'give', 'you', 'a', 'minute', 'or', 'two', 'to', 'try', 'and', 'work', 'it', 'out', 'i', 'wanna', 'give', 'it', 'im', 'give', 'you', 'the', 'benefit', 'i', 'wanna', 'give', 'it', 'im', 'give', 'you', 'the', 'benefit']",350,Pebbles,Pebbles,1990,"[76, 76, 62, 44, 32, 23, 13, 4, 4, 4, 7, 12, 17, 22, 29, 32, 40, 48, 58, 76]",20,Giving You The Benefit,https://open.spotify.com/track/2nNKXDFRz6cog1kolC3efq,2nNKXDFRz6cog1kolC3efq,spotify:track:2nNKXDFRz6cog1kolC3efq,Always,76yiSp9zZ5y5tjqIpTsaXw,spotify:album:76yiSp9zZ5y5tjqIpTsaXw,Pebbles,702AvACMk5mieXIYlC2Gxx,spotify:artist:702AvACMk5mieXIYlC2Gxx,341.96,11.0,31.0,1990-01-01,0.706,0.8,5.0,-10.496,0.0,0.0468,0.14400000000000002,0.00137,0.0998,0.931,103.074,"['freestyle', 'new jack swing', 'quiet storm', 'urban contemporary']",[],1.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.16699999999999998
73,73,Just A Little Bit Longer,"You say you're hurting oh cause
They say I'm flirting oh no
You just can't take it anymore
Your friends say I'm no good for you
But in my heart I'm so true
A partner for life we can be sure
You've asked me for some time to clear you're mind
I stayed away, it hurts so much
Without your touch
Now I'm back and you say

Chorus:
Just a little bit longer baby
Cause my love keeps growing stronger
A little more time to say
But in my head a love song plays
For you and me

We played in the rain together
That feeling lives on forever
Memories that bring tears of joy
We've had our share of bad times too
Hurthing each other me and you
It's brought us much closer in the end
Just too much we've both fought for
To put it all down the drain
I've stayed away just for a while
But now you're driving me insane

Chorus

I said all there is to say now
Hoping that you'll make me stay
Believe me I'm yearning for you girl
Hope there's a place in your heart
That remembers the good from the start
Just put me back where I belong
You asked me for some time to clear your mind
I stayed away, it hurts so much
Without your touch now I'm back and you say

74,74,Deeper Shade Of Soul,"Mellow...that's my style

Surprise, surprise! So you rub your eyes
Never knew UDS, so cool as ice?
Hear the vibes man, they'll stupefy
Ducks categorize us as hardcriers
That's a lie, we know why we're occupiers
No blurs, but obscure styles, these are higher
Profiles are low - as soon as we go
As a breeze straight from a deeper shade of soul

(Chorus)
A deeper shade of soul, yeah
A deeper shade of soul
A deeper shade of soul, yeah
A deeper shade of soul

Five souls play the head role
Excite the middle between the two poles
The globe rotates from new to old
UDS take both to reach the souls
Narrow mind clydes (suckers!), still holding a pose
What we pour 'n flow when we come close
To the contrary, they pinch their earlobes
They call it rogue-rock, but it's a deeper shade of soul

(Chorus)

We blend everythin', with the color of skin
Under the skin, we're in like Flynn
Ducks stare at us, as soon as we begin
To innovate the frame of thought they're in
Again, music's got to do with only feeling
It's not where you're from, it's 'can' they yield in
The stuff that we rock and what we're giving
A piece of the mind connects with rhythm

76,76,And So It Goes,"In every heart there is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along

I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much
My silence is my self defense

And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon I suppose

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too

77,77,Cherry Pie,"[Intro]
Dirty, rotten, filthy, stinkin...

[Chorus]
She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water, such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good, makes a grown man cry
Sweet Cherry Pie

[Verse 1]
Well, swingin' on the front porch, swingin' on the lawn
Swingin' where we want 'cause there ain't nobody home
Swingin' to the left and swingin' to the right
If I think about baseball, I'll swing all night, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Swingin' in the living room, swingin' in the kitchen
Most folks don't 'cause they're too busy bitchin'
Swingin' in there 'cause she wanted me to feed her
So I mixed up the batter and she licked the beater

[Pre-Chorus]
I scream, you scream, we all scream for her
Don't even try 'cause you can't ignore her

[Chorus]
She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water, such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good, make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie, oh yeah
She's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face, ten miles wide
Looks so good, bring a tear to your eye
Sweet cherry pie

[Verse 2]
Swingin' to the drums, swingin' to guitar
Swingin' to the bass in the back of my car
Ain't got money, ain't got no gas
But we'll get where we're goin' if we swing real fast

[Pre-Chorus]
I scream, you scream, we all scream for her
Don't even try 'cause you can't ignore her

[Chorus]
She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water, such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good, make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie, oh yeah
She's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face, ten miles wide
Looks so good, bring a tear to your eye
Sweet cherry pie, yeah, pie

[Bridge]
(Swing it!)
All night long
(Swing it!)
Like a trained professional

[Verse 3]
Swingin the bathroom, swingin' on the floor
Swingin' so hard, we forgot to lock the door
In walks her daddy standin' 6 foot 4
He said, ""You ain't gonna swing with my daughter no more""

[Chorus]
She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water, such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good, make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie, oh yeah
She's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face, ten miles wide
Looks so good, bring a tear to your eye
Sweet cherry pie
Sweet cherry pie, yeah, huh

Come on, come on!

Come on, come on!

""Crash!""

{Angel}
Crash, here I go, watch the flash
Light as it shines, bright in the night
Rhymes I recite, rhymes that you might like
Maybe not, in fact I don't really care
So I just came here, to get you hyped
I'm like fire, get your body filled with desired
Start to dance!

(chorus)
All together, let's just party
All together, let's just have some fun
Knocks me off my feet
Makes me want to get down
To the funky beat, to the funky sound

{Kayel}
Crash, sounds like thunder and lightning
Electricity, fire, but exciting
That's the way it sounds to you
Now you know what you gotta do
Step up, jump up, make a move
Just shake, check out this groove
It's a jam for the underground youth
So whatcha gonna do?

(repeat chorus)2X
Crash, she don't need no introduction
The bomb, bombshell, of seduction

{Michelle}
Crash, I'm breaking, ain't no mistaking
Which one of you is gonna move
As my body starts to groove
I know you're clocking, I feel you watching
Now is time for me to start stomping
Vanilla child is coming through
I'm gonna show you what to do
As TKA drops rhymes with me
We'll harmonize in ectasy
But as you know it's not complete
'Til a woman speaks her piece
But it's time for me to go so, Yo!
I got something here, I got something here
I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got something here!
I got something here, I got something here
I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got something here!

{Tony}
Crash, that's our music, this is it now
It's time to use it
Move, groove, improve
We'll do you Miss
And if you like it, you can do this dance
Now get on the floor and
Give yourself a chance
Thinking about it? No doubt about
You can dance
Have fun! That's what we say
When you're slamming with the
T, the K, and the A!

(chorus)
All together, let's just party
All together, let's just have some fun
Knocks me off my feet
Makes me want to get down
To the funky beat, to the funky sound

Let's funky, let's funky, let's dance

80,80,Use It Up And Wear It Out,"[Round 1: Iron Solomon]
So, you're retiring, aren't you?
Your time is borrowed
You'll be dead by tomorrow
Say goodbye to Arsonal
I gave you a chance rapping first: The Life of Pablo
Your final battle's with Loaded Lux, 'cause he got the best showmanship
But your Iron match is second-to-last 'cause my pen ultimate!
ONCE AGAIN, YOU HERE...UP IN ANOTHER CRACKER'S STATE!
UP ON ANOTHER CRACKER'S STAGE!
(UP IN ANOTHER CRACKER'S FACE!)
Brothers and sisters, let's thank the God over our heads
That we don't EVER HAVE TO HEAR THAT FUCKING SLOGAN AGAIN!
Bitch, I will speed past you after you retire
You just a pit stop
I'm the gift shop: you had to see me on your way out to get props!
You old Okwerdz got burned, Whoopi Goldberg lesbian lovin'
Gotta picture sucking dick just to have sex with a woman!
You old showboating, fake-wrestling rapper Hulk Hogan
Can't write enough bars for one round without four slogans
I thought a job that you oughta try when you duck out would be a crossing guard
You'd be good at holding up signs on a bus route!
See, in his bars, he's the hardest
But divide the art from the artist
And Ars' is the most harmless on my ""People I Wanna Harm"" list
I only took money 'cause the price I charged was high
He lacked the credit, so everybody else on the card declined
I FUCKING HATE...that y'all gave me Arsonal
Bro, I'd rather be sippin' liquor
Watching Patrick and Kenny bicker 'bout which rapper's the bigger wigger
Help me understand how a hustler from your hood would do
Cook coke and the crack rock
That's the process you put it through
Sell the rock to the fiends to get high, they cook it, too
So, why, when we saw you with Tay, Roc was cooking YOU!?
I don't see how people condone your seat at the throne
When, even in Jersey, you second seed is a Jones
And leaving your home, you don't do nothing unique, you a clone
On UDubb the only time he on a league of his own!
You fill the house with your homies, your right-hands, so everyone claps
On the road, you behind every round: you a mudflap!
Like, in Detroit, we thought that you'd be riding down with C's
The type of rowdy G's who move on every side of town with ease
You acting harder than a jerkoff that's right about to skeet
And how you handled yourself had you flying out the D!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
But Arsonal's squeezing Tommy's, shottys
Holding heat for homi's
Made a killing in his building, and didn't leave the lobby
I'm thinking Wilson from Home Improvement
Y'all on the fence if you believe him, probably
'Cause we hear him talking 'bout the tool, man, but never seen a body!
Bitch, you won't squeeze a button to fire burners!
You holding heat for nothin'
If Ars pull a handle, and rounds come out, it's a pizza oven!
I keeps a fucking ratchet on my side like a cheating husband
Teach him somethin', open up his mind like a deep discussion
Or feed him punches 'til he sleep like the Reaper cousin
Your bitch is bad
She has to face me: I'm the repercussions!
I got her on her knees for somethin', like she think Jesus comin'
But I'm an atheist, 'cause she's the one that I be leavin' nuttin'!
GOD! GOD! GOD! GOD!
Your girl finna pray in more than a religious way
Adam and Eve: this bone I gave her made her who she is today!
Bro, I hit her with some dick to suck, and never let her spit it up
And ever since I taught her how to swallow, now her shit is nuts!
I put it all in her butt crack, then squirted on her spine
Don't call it a comeback!

[Round 1: Arsonal]
Once again, I'm here!
This the last time y'all gon' see me
Ain't no ""Sike, I lied!""
I hope you motherfuckers believe me
They said, ""Ars', you got Solomon!""
I said, ""The white boy who been ducking me since the Fight Klub?""
They said, ""Right! Yuh!""
Ideas came in: I lit up like a lightbulb
I said, ""Well, his wife love dressing up like a nurse, wearing tight scrubs...""
She like Angela from Power
She ready to suck a nigga dick quick in the nightclub
This is not easy
You will not beat me
I will have your Jewish bitch having full-blown-out conversations in Swahili
You gon' know she got some NIGGA DICK when she show up to your battle, rocking a daishiki!
Talking 'bout black power
Telling you that you ass to your face: Rikishi!
You wanted to talk about my bitch, so let's talk about your bitch
My voice a little hoarse, too
Your bitch, I walked past her and her purse talked
It said, ""Snatch me!""...I reverse-walk
I tried to get the sixteen digits off the front of the card
I...only seen the first part
Snitching what they do in your borough
That shit the worst talk
9 been on me since I came out the pussy: this shit a birthmark!
Suge, he got a thousand dollars in his pocket...I snatch a band off him!
I walk away, he give me the finger
I come back, and chop his hand off him!
First white boy I seen on Smack DVD, first time I ran 'cross him
But he'll never be a nigga
Why? Soon as he sunbathe, I'll knock the tan off him!
Switch that: I said I flip page
Today, I walked in the venue with a switchblade, and a pistol
If I let it ring at you, do that mean y'all engaged?
I hit Solomon in his ribcage
Me? I'm just trying to avoid the big raid!
Police ask me where I was at between 9 and 10
I looked at them, and said, ""Probably in the 5th grade!""
I'm the driver and the shooter, nigga!
Street fighter like Ken and Ryu
But I'm darker, AND my head nappy
I'm feeling like a cooner, nigga!
Everybody got their arms extended: we doing Zumba, nigga!
NO WORRIES! HAKUNA MATATA: TIMON AND PUMBAA, NIGGA!
I'm killing scrap
I conceal the strap, I'm for real with that!
Aim it at son roof: one button'll push your ceiling back!
I'm finna zip him UP!
Bring the red leather from ""Thriller"" back
You a CRACKER that can't say ""NIGGA!""
You gotta DEAL with that!
You a green-eyed Jew with a mean IQ
If you had five heartbeats left, nigga, ask yourself, ""What would Leon do?""
The beam on my Glock Crippin': that shit NEON blue!
I put on a show every time I suit up, just like Deon do
This how I get 'round vets
Lipo surgery: leave you ten pounds less
You ain't capitalize off yo' name, nigga, and flip 'round checks
You the original white boy from the DVDs! How you just NOW flex!?
You KNOW I'm a stand-up nigga
That's why we ain't had a sit-down YET!
I own UDubb, I get my OWN bread!
I'm on point off-top like a Conehead
I'm trying to figure out what YOU on...like my niggas ask when they phone dead!
Man...oh yeah! (*chuckles*)
You a check and a Lux warm-up!
Miyagi know ain't no cloning Daniel
You a Jew-ass cracker! I should KICK you with some Jehovah sandals!
What kind of iron are you known to handle!?
Me, my arm be fully extended
Look like I'm shootin' out a Roman Candle!
LONG nose! Shit be looking like a swordfish!
Oh, my Sig official, too: I ain't gotta forge shit!
I burn down on him, reach for the Glock with the long grip
And...beat Iron with the hammer like a swordsmith!
I said, CAH-RIIIIIIP! You niggas see the loccin'!
Shit get REAL when a G approach him!
Strays flyin' will raise Iron like hemoglobin!
Aye, Aaron, nigga! I'm about that iron for REAL!
Go 'Pac with the steel
Bishop style, how I'm POPPIN' the steel!
Bulldog from Baton Rouge when you get shot in your grill
With a New Orleans .44
Let's see if SOLOMON HEAL!
You a pelican!
And you finally ran into Darrell again
You CRACKA-ass CRACKER! You Metlife melanin
My shit is REAL, my shit is RAW, my shit is AUTHENTIC!!
And you can't spell BARS without putting (that Ars' in it!)

[Round 2: Iron Solomon + (Arsonal)]
You actually wanna be that close...when you're spitting your verse in my face?
You feel more comfortable being in my personal space?
Bro, what the shit be goin' on inside of yo' mind
That you convinced that you recitin' dope lines?
In yo' rhymes, you wanna put my skin and religion under a microscope? Fine
You exposed me, Ars'...I been white this whole time!
You lost to Pat, Bishop, Shotty...Shotty...
And today, when I beat you
It's badminton...you just keep gettin' played by white people!
So I'mma scalp Ars' and stuff his dreads under my black hat
Then tap-tap just to give him G Mayne Frost flashbacks!
YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!
I thought you was gangsta, had a squad that moved wit'cha
I thought dude was bigger
But, dawg, you let him call you a-
MMMMMMM!!!
It's time to look inward-
(Exactly! Exactly! EXACTLY!)
It's time to look inward
Are you Darrell the bus driver, or Ars' the thug?
Are you really committed to this Crippin'!?
Maybe you are a Blood...
I mean, I guess it's true
You moved to Florida, which is best for you
A swing state that can never choose
So they flip-flop between red and blue!
Is it that you stupid, dude!?
(*chuckles*)
OH! The marijuana got you confused!
Every time this square gets twisted, he switches colors like a Rubik's Cube!
Bro, my man Quill is a real Grape
You hang out with Blood friends
A and Lyt are like day and night
You not down with son set!
So stop chasin' the Purple Grapes
And just study the Purple Tape
Why you still tryna perpetrate?
Darrell, you are 38!
Yo, but these younger kids who actually believe this chump's a Crip
Is throwin' up the 6, and don't even have a cousin that's from the clique
Now every time a pussy opens up his lips
You're the dickhead who started that fuckin' shit like, ""Just the tip...""
WHAT!? WHAT!? What!?
Yo...to get through these next bars, I need a drink
Someone pour a shot up
Baby girl had a brain tumor
When I think of her poor father, I might cry
So my eyes wide, 'cause if I blink, they'll just pour water
It's hard to think, 'cause as a father...I JUST WISH IT WAS YOUR DAUGHTER!!!
So I could put her out of her misery
My ox'll do it tenderly
A gentleman, he'll open up her ribs for me: that's chivalry
Then I'll Kennedy her memory
I'm just messin' with her mentally
I'll finger-FUCK the hole, I'm literally adding insult to injury!
I'm disrespectful, disrespectful
Maybe I'll just take your wife
I'll lay the pipe like great advice
It's easy to give it to her, but it's hard for her to take it right
I'll bang your baby moms in the baby room
Bust my babies twice on her baby wipes
MAKE YOU RUB IT IN HER PUSSY THE NEXT TIME YOU CHANGE HER DIAPS!
Then I'm dippin' to the kitchen to switch the grease with my snot-rockets
Eatin' his Hot Pockets, and feedin' the dog chocolates
Bro...none of that's clever
That's why I didn't fuck with you ever!
'Cause everything you could do...ANYONE CAN DO BETTER!
How is it even disrespect-ful if these are empty threats?
That's why I second-guess this disrespectful Ars' in your bars we've never met
Offstage, he speaks to me polite
So I'll believe the hype
The day that Shotgun Suge teach himself to read and write!
Look, the disrespect is make-believe
He ain't what he has claimed to be
A hateful scream the latest meme
The lamest way to paint his scene
A parlor trick, a crazy theme
It's just a crutch, a lazy scheme
See, Ars's pen is average
That's why everything you say is mean!
You're not nice, you're not nice, man
But when this cockroach's head gets ripped off
He still survives...it's just that he doesn't ever evolve
So now the highest perch you can aspire to when you write a verse
Is that you and Hitman Holla's pens can be tied for worst
And y'all are top-tier? I need some different recognition
'Cause I don't wanna be top-tier if this fits the definition!
Yo, to be honest, I'm only battlin' you here tonight
'Cause after Diz, Nigel needs another two years to write!

[Round 2: Arsonal]
Word to Hitler, I can't stand you (Jew), so I'ma concentrate on your camp now
If Anne Frank was still alive, I'd tell that bitch get on her knees and pull my pants down
Take this load! All of it!
Then go cum-swap wit' ya aunt now
Soon as I play wit' the .30, it got a ring ASAP
I feel like Durant now
I'm usin' 100 percent of my brain
My subject matter's Limitless
Let me finish this
Them Nazi niggas, they moved off Hitler's fists
You always talked a good game, but only showed up to the scrimmages
That's why your great-grandparents ain't never make it on Schindler's list!
No rules to the sermon
Maneuver I'm swervin', it's time I skate off
You Jews is determined
My Ruger is German: I'm lettin' eight off (Adolf)
Durin' Hanukkah, I'mma disrespect your yarmulke...knock it straight off!
Stab you in your chest wit' a knife and kick the handle til it break off
Nigga, my mind demented, I'm all kind of ig'nant
Nine extended, I was ridin' wit' it in a Honda Civic, steady mobbin' wit' it
I flew from Jersey to LA, then drove to Compton wit' it
Now I'm in your face 'bout to go upside your noggin' wit' it
Is that you (Jew)? When I'm comin' at you (Jew)
Word to the Book of Matthew
Hands sharp, but I'm strapped too
Draw on him: no tattoo
Clap you with a .30 clip that's longer than Shaq's shoe
If there was a logo for disrespect, then I'll be the statue
I'm in a different bag
I'm face-to-face with you like my vision bad
Remember, you still white! Don't make me O.J. Simpson mad!
'Cause you'll get that Nicole treatment with a different stab
Holidays missed his ass
I'll make you (Jew) the Ghost Of Christmas Past
I'll nut in your bitch belly and let it sit in her navel
We just chilled, no Netflix and I didn't have cable
I walk in your mother house and sit at that table
Then say, ""You Jewish bitch, what you gon' do when I chop yo' son hand off?
How the fuck you plan on spinnin' that dreidel!?""
Your career ain't come wit' a spare, you never could re-tire
Jewish lawyers the best, y'all borin' so y'all could be liars
But to tell the truth, on the hood, we bias
I mean because we black
All we gotta do is sticks together: yeah, that would (wood) be fire
Now I said was that you (Jew) that let this germ in (German)!?
Well God bless you
.32's all special
You ain't my amigo I off set you
I done knocked out a couple of fans: I Artest you
You on the ID channel they lettin' the dogs fetch you
They like, ""Ars', you 'bout to retire, so what's next?""
You said, oh you think I'm finna 'bout to go back to them bus checks
You like, ""Oh no. You think you finna blow cause you got a battle with Lux next.""
Well I could give a fuck less
You just another white boy that got me upset
One bet, and I got the money
100 thou' that you never make it on Funk Flex!
Huh!?
This food for thought, I had to vent, I'm just talkin' real
Cracker, you ain't tryin' to know how them divorces feel
Court appeals, bein' sued for quarter mils
Fightin' for your custody, not knowin' how your daughter feel
Nigga, just the thought is real
Where my people come from? I was taught is real (Israel)
Now I'm tryin' to figure out what I'm taught is real
They tried to say Jesus was white, nothin' 'bout that thought is real (Israel)
I ain't tryin' to hear (hare) that-
C'mon, son! What!?
I ain't tryin' to hear (hare) that...now I know how the tortoise feel!
I love droppin' jewels, but I'm a student first
So let me teach you 'bout these vibes in this universe
My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
You can't spell ""bars"" (without puttin' that ""Ars"" in it!)

[Round 3: Iron Solomon]
My G, all that struggle and religion, that was true shit, bro
Jesus wasn't white...but he was Jewish, tho!
Bro, your legacy's already ruined, dude
And I'm already up two on you
So I got a round to waste (waist) on this body: let's hula hoop
What's poppin' Surf? What's poppin', Tsu?
After all that snitchin', the cops pursued you out the blue
Or your bars was slippin', so you got a room with Ah Di Boom
So Surf's inside the Feds
Oh, and stop hidin' behind them dreads
Well, I don't need a green light to swing right on Red!
I'm talkin' Suge! O! Surf! Who else in the squad want it!?
Where's Jai!? I'm tryin' to get all of your four hunted (400)
Put it on my schedule
Y'all couldn't touch my pedistal
You fuckin' up my edible
What's this tough guy credible?
Which part of this thug life is this one-dimensional
Some guy's right testicle, punchline festival
Did you really take this battle to discuss my genitals!?
Tell your slut wife to suck my one-eyed tentacle!
I cannot condone
And I hope I'm not alone
A man writing rhymes about balls that are not his own!
Bro, Mook and Clips got Pythagoras stuck in Darrell's mind
'Cause that angle will just be the sum of them other square's lines
You not original, in anything
I'm an O.G., the vet, the king
Of course I'm gaining weight, Ars', 'cause GOATS eat EVERYTHING!
So I'm incredibly fat
You too slender to scrap
The fuck made you think you'd do better with Mass!?

{fake chokes}

Yo, I swore this was shit I would not do
Y'all think I'd really do this fuck shit? BITCH, I AM NOT YOU!
Yo, from the first time I heard a kick drum and snare, I knew this love was rare
I'd never disrespect the craft by comin' unprepared
Like this money-hungry culture vulture who just doesn't care
About his bars as much as what he's gonna wear or how he does his hair!
Y'all know that one Arsonal move, where he do the head twirl?
And leave like a single lock hangin' like a Superman curl
Bro, you a damn girl! I'll do you like Fetty Wap did
And use extension to weave a Bald Head in your long dreads
I'm playin, I'm playin'
I don't hold my own burners on me
I got muscle that bear arms like a shirt with no sleeves
Blood homies who carry Eagles, one word and they squeeze
I'll have pops teach him 'bout the birds and the bees (B's)
So send your locs to harm me, my local army is an oligarchy
They'll be more Grapes popped in the mouth than a toga party!
My homies call it cow-tippin' when we go to war
Because the soldiers all in the field to push the beef overboard
And when you on the ground layin' on the flo' flappin'
Just to make it a closed casket
I'm shootin' down with the chrome clappin'
Got me lookin' like Rone rappin'
This is like Conrad versus Joe Jackson!
'Cause you might punch on a mic (Mike), but I toe-tag 'em!
Bro, don't you have Lux next?
You better learn how to suck less
You ain't ready for that work 'cause I'm the drug test
And you flunked this!
But if tonight, A survives, then Loaded will be the way he dies
We live in different states so I just booked this battle to say ""Goodbye""
Rest in peace

[Round 3: Arsonal]
This last round...
You right, I ain't give a fuck! (*chuckles*)
But our lifestyles, I'd compare 'em
While you was watchin' 7th Heaven, we was livin' Jason's Lyric
At 18, you was already famous and still livin' wit' yo' parents
At 18, nigga, 'bout 18 of my li'l niggas turned to spirits
I was livin' a horror story
You was livin' Dexter's Laboratory!
I got two of my li'l niggas rotatin', watchin' the corner for me
(*snaps fingers*)
At the snap of a finger, niggas'll kidnap your daughter for me
Give the little bitch a bubble bath, and put piranhas in the water for me!
Me? I'm quick to draw on a nigga...I'll autograph ya
You want these shells to peel before I kill the kid, or the morning after?
Man, where you used to be in life, and where you are now...that's a big drop
'Cause back then, you ain't pretend, and you was doin' it for hip-knot
But now you sound like you coulda been the newest member of Slipknot!
But I get it...you gotta water an Iron down for it to get hot!
See, I'm exposin' Iron, while I'm holdin' iron
Steady loadin' iron
Your career slowin' down
I guess whoever picked you (Jew), they control the dyin'
I mean, I been cold like I'm low on iron
It steam at the press of a button: now it's a bunch of little holes in Iron!
C'mon, man, my status been legend
I'm trend-settin', Ralph Lauren-dressin'
This a dream within a dream: Leonardo'll call that Inception!
This like me puttin' an Asian in his place, the way I'm chin-checkin'
I'd baptize your daughter
Hold that bitch under the water: fuck a swim lesson!
This a bit twisted
Your mom ain't suck my dick, but the bitch kissed it
I got a sawed-off that bang heavy metal: that's a limp biscuit
I'm really from that!
Niggas really died where we hung at!
I'm from a block where you liable to die
When you go the store, you might not come back!
Bruh! I promise you
Where I'm from, they don't want you to be successful and alive
They don't want that!
You can't do two things at once
I'm from a block where you can't walk and chew gum at!
My shit is real, my shit is raw...
Nah, y'all don't want that!
I ain't done rap!
Solomon, my dick, you could suck that!
Since you like talkin' 'bout dick, I know you want that!
FUCK THAT!
[Arsonal slaps Iron's hat off of his head]
It's over!
My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic!
You can't spell ""bars"" without puttin' that Ars' in it!

[Iron Solomon]
3-0!

[Arsonal]
You DIED!
I love y'all, King of the Dot!
It's forever, you know it!",[],0,King of the Dot,Pat & Mick,1990,"[84, 84, 86]",3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0
81,81,Melt In Your Mouth,"Mm-hmm...
This one goes out
To all the suckers out there
Who thought I was soft
When I dropped Knockin' Boots
For the ladies
But I'm-a come correct this time
And do something a little bit different
(Who you gonna cook this to, man?)
Mmm, the ladies

Melt in your mouth, not in your hand
The C-A to the -ndy was the M-A-N
I'm like no other man, 'cause you know no other man can
Be an undercover lover and a soul brother man
On the other hand, introduce me to your mother and
I wouldn't be surprised if she's my number one fan
Here I stand a full six-feet-three
And the perfect match has to be when you meet me
Under a palm tree in the middle of the beach
Bring a towel or a sheet like the boots with sand on my feet
After we eat what we brought on the pier
I hear your earrings jingle like a chandelier
As you premiere what you hear is not a simile
But it's meant to be the poetry as me, a K-I-N-G
There'll never be another Candyman
Because I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Lip smacking good, good to the last drop
If I didn't have to go, I know you never would stop
I'm on the top of your list for the best French kiss
I assist on your one last wish, and since
I'm not the type to fall in love on sight
I'm-a let you hold me tight for just one night
Since I write the rhymes to make the whole world sing
It doesn't mean a thing when you call me the king
And bells won't ring 'til I walk down the aisle
You could smile, but that won't be for a long while
It'll take more than a killer behind to change my mind
I'm not blind, I know the time
See, I'm not the kind to write a rhyme while you laugh
Ha, ha, ha, girl, I get half
So as I see it, you don't need a wedding band
'Cause I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Thirst quenching, did I mention
Give a chick an inch and she'll want an extension
Pictured on my heiny right behind me is the man of the house
Suggesting that I burn the hell out
You begin to count, but no doubt, you call my cellular phone
Because I melt in your mouth like a snow cone
On and on as the saga continues
Here's another page on the menu
When you see the Candyman, you see me as a hot hor d'oeuvre
And you got a lot of nerve
First come, first served is the usual procedure
After I tell you that I need you
Featured with any kind of line that I think what's best for you
Because I wanna get next to you
Sex with you is just one small part of the plan
Because I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth, not in your hand
The C-A to the -ndy was the M-A-N
I'm like no other man, 'cause you know no other man can

But it's meant to be the poetry as me, a K-I-N-G

82,82,This Is Ponderous,"This is ponderous, man, really ponderous

I had this dream the other night
I went to work one day
And nobody remembered who I was
So, I decided to take the day off

On my way out
I run into my boss and he says
Hey, you look familiar
I said, thanks, people say that
A lot in these dreams

Then the horns kicked in
And my shoes started to squeak

Then all of a sudden
I'm standing on a beach
In some tropical part of the world
And there's this sign that says
'Aren't you supposed to be at work'
Sort of screamed out at me

Then I remembered
I'd been here in other dreams
But usually there was a water polo game
And a girl who could talk with her eyes

And she'd say
'Can you see what I'm saying'
Then the horns kicked in
And my shoes started to squeak

Before I knew it
I was walking near a lake
When a phone rings
And the operator speaks to me
In a language I don't understand

Oom papachucka maka nanu singow
Meling kapalana wani domo chingpow
Heddy kapalua cuma jenising tea
Oomama chucka pana one is now three

Then the horns kicked in
And my shoes started to squeak

Before long, I was coming up
On this really weird part of my dream
You know, the part where
I know how to tap dance
But I can only do it
While wearing golf shoes

Now, I'm back on the beach
Walking with this girl
Who talks with her eyes
This time she says
'I think you see what I'm saying'

Then just before I woke up
It started to rain in Southern California

Oom papachucka maka nanu singow
Meling kapalana wani domo chingpow
Heddy kapalua cuma jenising tea
Oomama chucka pana one is now three

A girl who could talk with her eyes
'Can you see what I'm saying'

Aren't you supposed to be at work

I'll get used to it
Hearts don't break they just bend
I'll come bouncing back
You barely left a scratch on me

You were nothing
But a little play thing
And your love bite
It was only a sting
Baby when you went
It hardly made a dent in me

It was just a fleshwound in my pride
It ain't no tragedy that I can't survive

I'm lyin' to myself every night
Without you baby nothing's been right
No matter what I say
Can't make you go away
I'm lyin' to myself that's the truth
It's killing me being without you
You're the only one
Not fooling anyone
I'm lyin' to myself

I won't lie here
Alone in this bed
Broken record
Of your voice in my head
'Cause nothing that you said
Had any real effect on me

There's not a thing that I would change
No not much only everything
Just to have you again

I'm lyin' to myself every night
Without you baby nothing's been right
No matter what I say
Can't make you go away
I'm lyin' to myself

I can't deny it anymore
Gotta get you back in my life
'Cause that's all I've been living for

The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other

""EARTH: THE OLDEST COMPUTER"" is still playing

The door swings open.  The Boy stands up quickly.  The Boy doesn’t run.  Dude 2 takes the Boy at gunpoint. Cops wouldn’t take a hostage.  He didn’t see a badge. Dude 1 and Dude 2 weren't cops. Shit. He should've known by the way they were dressed

Dude 2

Don’t move or I’ll shoot!

...Fuck

Masked Guy 1

Your partners are dead muthafucka!

There were three of them.  Each of them had guns

Dude 2

Put the guns down or I’ll shoot him!

Silence

The room is tense

This would play.  Or the exact opposite of the moment inspired by Scarlett and Bill in Lost in Translation when they find a connection at the end no matter how fleeting it was.  I think “Just Like Honey” was playing, but it’s just too sweet

He felt a sharp burning sensation, and fell forward in slow motion

He saw flashing lights as he heard gunshots… fading slowly

The Boy sees Fam mouth his name but doesn’t hear anything.  Fam is shaking the Boy.  The Boy feels his heartbeat [BEATING HEART EMOJI] like that one time at camp.  The Boy thinks of the silent calm of floating in the pool and how he’d like it to end that way…his way

[Verse 1:]
There's a feeling
Stuck in my bones
In the night
Was flying right up alone

But there is something
In the air of my lungs
Breathing you
Needing you my love

[PreChorus:]
Now the fire's burning up my head
Nothing could get in the way I feel for you
I got a spell on you
You bring my heart up with the love you give
Taking my hand cause we're halfway there to love
My love

[Hook:]
I'm higher than the moon
With the love between us two
I collided into you oooh into you
There was nothing I could do
You're breaking all my rules
I collided into you oooh into you
Collided into you

[Verse 2:]
There's a feeling
That's finally been found
I never knew
I needed you until now
(Never knew ooh ooh)
There's been days
I've been stuck on the ground
(Stuck on the ground)
With your heart
I found my love by your side

[PreChorus 2:]
Now the fire's burning up my head
Nothing could get in the way I feel for you
I got a spell on you
You bring my heart up with the love you give
Taking my hand cause we're halfway there to love
My love

[Hook:]
I'm higher than the moon
With the love between us two
I collided into you oooh into you
There was nothing I could do
You're breaking all my rules
I collided into you oooh into you
Collided into you

[Bridge:]
Ooh I collided with your body
Ooh my hands all over you it’s a party
Ooh show me what you do on that molly
I just want ya, to know I want ya

No temporary love
This here is pertinent
Sent from above
Tell me what you're gonna do
It's just me and you

[Chorus:]
And I'm higher than the moon
With the love between us two
I collided into you oooh into you

And I'm higher than the moon
With the love between us two
I collided into you oooh into you
There was nothing I could do
You're breaking all the rules
I collided into you oooh into you
Collided into you","['theres', 'a', 'feel', 'stick', 'in', 'my', 'bone', 'in', 'the', 'night', 'be', 'fly', 'right', 'up', 'alone', 'but', 'there', 'be', 'something', 'in', 'the', 'air', 'of', 'my', 'lungs', 'breathe', 'you', 'need', 'you', 'my', 'love', 'now', 'the', 'fire', 'burn', 'up', 'my', 'head', 'nothing', 'could', 'get', 'in', 'the', 'way', 'i', 'feel', 'for', 'you', 'i', 'get', 'a', 'spell', 'on', 'you', 'you', 'bring', 'my', 'heart', 'up', 'with', 'the', 'love', 'you', 'give', 'take', 'my', 'hand', 'cause', 'be', 'halfway', 'there', 'to', 'love', 'my', 'love', 'im', 'higher', 'than', 'the', 'moon', 'with', 'the', 'love', 'between', 'us', 'two', 'i', 'collide', 'into', 'you', 'oooh', 'into', 'you', 'there', 'be', 'nothing', 'i', 'could', 'do', 'youre', 'break', 'all', 'my', 'rule', 'i', 'collide', 'into', 'you', 'oooh', 'into', 'you', 'collide', 'into', 'you', 'theres', 'a', 'feel', 'thats', 'finally', 'be', 'find', 'i', 'never', 'know', 'i', 'need', 'you', 'until', 'now', 'theres', 'be', 'days', 'ive', 'be', 'stick', 'on', 'the', 'grind', 'with', 'your', 'heart', 'i', 'find', 'my', 'love', 'by', 'your', 'side', 'now', 'the', 'fire', 'burn', 'up', 'my', 'head', 'nothing', 'could', 'get', 'in', 'the', 'way', 'i', 'feel', 'for', 'you', 'i', 'get', 'a', 'spell', 'on', 'you', 'you', 'bring', 'my', 'heart', 'up', 'with', 'the', 'love', 'you', 'give', 'take', 'my', 'hand', 'cause', 'be', 'halfway', 'there', 'to', 'love', 'my', 'love', 'im', 'higher', 'than', 'the', 'moon', 'with', 'the', 'love', 'between', 'us', 'two', 'i', 'collide', 'into', 'you', 'oooh', 'into', 'you', 'there', 'be', 'nothing', 'i', 'could', 'do', 'youre', 'break', 'all', 'my', 'rule', 'i', 'collide', 'into', 'you', 'oooh', 'into', 'you', 'collide', 'into', 'you', 'ooh', 'i', 'collide', 'with', 'your', 'body', 'ooh', 'my', 'hand', 'all', 'over', 'you', 'it’s', 'a', 'party', 'ooh', 'show', 'me', 'what', 'you', 'do', 'on', 'that', 'molly', 'i', 'just', 'want', 'ya', 'to', 'know', 'i', 'want', 'ya', 'no', 'temporary', 'love', 'this', 'here', 'be', 'pertinent', 'send', 'from', 'above', 'tell', 'me', 'what', 'youre', 'gonna', 'do', 'its', 'just', 'me', 'and', 'you', 'and', 'im', 'higher', 'than', 'the', 'moon', 'with', 'the', 'love', 'between', 'us', 'two', 'i', 'collide', 'into', 'you', 'oooh', 'into', 'you', 'and', 'im', 'higher', 'than', 'the', 'moon', 'with', 'the', 'love', 'between', 'us', 'two', 'i', 'collide', 'into', 'you', 'oooh', 'into', 'you', 'there', 'be', 'nothing', 'i', 'could', 'do', 'youre', 'break', 'all', 'the', 'rule', 'i', 'collide', 'into', 'you', 'oooh', 'into', 'you', 'collide', 'into', 'you']",344,Leon Waldo,The Party,1990,"[91, 91, 85, 88, 79, 81, 83, 85, 94]",9,We Found Love,https://open.spotify.com/track/3SbQwZ0Iu7fMxkB0R2NE95,3SbQwZ0Iu7fMxkB0R2NE95,spotify:track:3SbQwZ0Iu7fMxkB0R2NE95,Worlds Top 100 Wedding Party Playlist - The Greatest Ever Celebration Hits - The Perfect Wedding Soundtrack,1s7dAAAvPZBUXVC1M5IjyP,spotify:album:1s7dAAAvPZBUXVC1M5IjyP,Party Rockers Inc,5i4Hn9K5EkFmEYkc7lKOuW,spotify:artist:5i4Hn9K5EkFmEYkc7lKOuW,213.0,100.0,0.0,2014-12-17,0.797,0.759,6.0,-7.03,1.0,0.0457,0.0488,0.0059,0.0817,0.464,127.996,[],[],1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.20400000000000001

89,89,The Obvious Child,"[Verse 1 - Paul Simon]
I'm accustomed to a smooth ride
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
I don't expect to sleep through the night
Some people say a lie's a lie's a lie
But I say why
Why deny the obvious child?
Why deny the obvious child?

And in remembering a road sign
I am remembering a girl when I was young
And we said these songs are true
These days are ours
These tears are free
And hey
The cross is in the ballpark
The cross is in the ballpark

[Chorus - Paul Simon]
We had a lot of fun
We had a lot of money
We had a little son and we thought we'd call him ""Sonny""
Sonny gets married and moves away
Sonny has a baby and bills to pay
Sonny gets sunnier
Day by day by day by day

[Verse 2 - Paul Simon]
I've been waking up at sunrise
I've been following the light across my room
I watch the night receive the room of my day
Some people say the sky is just the sky
But I say:
Why deny the obvious child?
Why deny the obvious child?

[Bridge - Paul Simon]
Sonny sits by his window and thinks to himself
How it's strange that some rooms are like cages
Sonny's yearbook from high school
Is down from the shelf
And he idly thumbs through the pages
Some have died
Some have fled from themselves
Or struggled from here to get there
Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls
Runs his hand through his thinning brown hair

[Outro - Paul Simon]
Well I'm accustomed to a smoother ride
Maybe I'm a dog that's lost his bite
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
I don't expect to sleep the night

Seems like forever that she's been on my mind
But nothing has changed
She thinks I'm a waste of her time

(There she goes) she don't know what she's missing
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight
I'll do all I can
Till she understands my desire

I've been on the outside looking in
Let me into your heart, oh
There's nothing on earth that should keep us apart
Baby

I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
'Cause I can't live without your love
Mmm, your love

(So I wait) Here for an answer
And wonder if tomorrow will be like yesterday
I'll keep holding on
Can't go on living this way, baby

I've been on the outside looking in
Bring my tears to an end, oh
I realize there's no use for me to pretend
Oh yeah

I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone

I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone

Never around to love me, you're always gone
Cause you're hanging out, breaking the rules

Always carrying on with the gang

You won't realize 'til it's too late

You'll do anything if given a chance
Scheming, planning lies to get what you need
So full of promises that you never keep
Don't you tell yourself that it's okay
Sick and tired of all of your games
And you want me to stay, ah, better change
Makes no sense to me, your crazy ways

Sitting here all alone
Wondering why you're not at home
Isn't it what have I done
What have I done?
I'm trying so hard to please you, girl
I'm trying to get inside your world
Can't you see you're all I need
Your love is what I need

The kind of love that'll always be special

Love me just for me over and over again

Remember baby, you said we'd go
Time to let our feelings show
Let me in, you said to me
That's what you said to me
Your lies became a crying shame
A search for wealth, fortune and fame
This day I can't fulfill your needs
Love wasn't what you were looking for

(Love me just for me.) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The kind of love that'll always be special

Could you care (Would you care) for me (for me) every minute, every hour
Come on.  (Love me.) Come on, say you love me
Say that you love me.  Just say that you need me

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

I had a girl, but all she seemed to care about was materialistic things
Yeah, I know what you mean
It wasn't like you couldn't give it to her, but that was all she wanted
Well, I'll keep searching this big old world until I find my lucky star
And when I do, I'll ask her to love me just for me

And I want you back
How many times I'm gonna say I'm sorry?
(How many times?)
Oh, yes, I'm sorry

How can something so good go so bad?
How can something so right go so wrong?

You can run, and you can hide
But I'm not leaving less you come with me
We've had our problems but I'm on your side
You're all I need, please believe in me

Tic Tac Toe is a game I used to play
When I was little I used to say
I got the X and I got the O
It don't matter cause it's Tic-Tac--Toe

Now I'm a little bit older
I like to play just a little bit bolder
I like gettin' girls and givin' em pearls
And their legs across my shoulders

I love to go to the disco
See a fly girl and say hello
They just look me in the eye and pass right by
With that booty shakin' like Jello

I like to speak cause that's bein' nice
It makes me mad when I have to speak twice
But that's the game that girls like to play
It's just Tic-Tac-Toe and roll the other way

[Chorus]
X, and O. As in yes, and no
X, and O. As in sex, maybe so

X is for yes and O is for no
X is for sex or maybe so
You might get some if you play this game
All girls love it but smooth is their game

[Verse 2]
That's why they just walk right by
Laughin', gigglin', shakin' that pie
Girls are what you what when you come up to them
So don't play dumb and try to school em

That's when you got to be real cool
Jump in the biz and act a fool
Pull out the portable car phone
Next thing you know you'll be drivin' em home

On the way there you're thinkin' bout one thing
Girls ain't dumb they know you want the wild thing
You through the X and go for the kiss
They throw the O and go for the dis

[Chorus]

[Refrain]
Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?
Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?
Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?
Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I met this girl by the name of Judy
Kind of cute with a real nice booty
Hard to get and likes to play tough
Cause she knows I want the funky stuff
When I spoke, she wouldn't even speak
Til she saw me in the biz that week
Took her to the movies and bought her a treat
Went to my house and made the bed squeak

Yeah that Judy puts up a fight
But I won with the X cause I rolled that night
Just when things started to feel good
We rolled a little fast and we broke the wood
My dad got up cause he heard some knockin'
Thought it was a crook me and Judy was rockin'
Came to my room opened up the door
Son whatcha doin'?
Playin Tic-Tac-Toe

That all the people of the world got together on the same wavelength
And began helping one another
Now in this dream, universal love was the theme of the day
Peace and understanding and it happened this way""

The sick, the hungry, had smiles on their faces
The tired and the homeless had family all around
The streets and the cities were all beautiful places
And the walls came tumblin' down

People of the world all had it together
Had it together for the boys and the girls
And the children of the world look forward to a future
Remember

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away

All the trees in the forest stood strong and tall again
Everything was clean and pretty and safe for you and me
The worst of enemies became the best of friends

Had it together for the boys and the girls

101,101,Love Is A Killer,"Only a fool believes
It's better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
So I don't wanna take that fall
It's a long long long way down

I'm hurt
Love struck me down again
Enticed me in and pulled the pin
Blew my tender heart sky high
Now in my pain I'm asking why
As I'm crying
Should I give it my last try
Or say goodbye

Love is a killer
A homicidal fiend
Love is a killer
It'll be the death of me
I got a target on my back
For a cupid dressed in black
Love is a killer
It's killing me

Love so sweetly beckoning
I've seen your face
Called your name
I tasted tears you cried
Lived in shadows in my mind
Frozen here in time
Don't leave me here to die

Love is a killer
A homicidal fiend
Love is a killer
It'll be the death of me
I've got a target on my back
For a cupid dressed in black
Love is a killer
It's killing me

You fascinate and yet frustrate
Demand so much of me, yeah
I've had enough
It's tearing me up inside
Cross my heart, hope to survive
You got a smoking gun
Well don't shoot my love, no!

You're a killer
A homicidal fiend
Love is a killer
It'll be the death of me
I've got a target on my back

Love is a killer, no, no

You've said that you love me
You held me in your arms
And said you'd never ever leave me
(You'd never, ever leave)
And all these promises you've kept
Have erased the past when I once wept
You made my fantasies come true
My heart belongs to you
You're my dream boy
You show me your love in every way
You're faithful to me every day
Now I know that dreams come true
You're my dream boy
My friends told me that I'll be lucky
To have a girl like you
'Cause all the girls I ever had
Their love was never true
(Their love was never true)
And you have brought me happiness
I treasure the day when we first met
Never ever gonna let you go
Because I love you so
You're my dream girl
You don't neglect me in any way
You make me feel special every day
Now I know that dreams come true
You're my dream boy
You came and filled my heart with joy
And I can smile again
'Cause I found a love that will never end
You say that I'm your dream boy
That I fill your heart with joy
But you're my dream girl
You're all I want in this world
You give me the love I need
I know we were meant to be
Talk to me
When you hold me in your arms
I feel so safe and warm
When you look into my eyes
You have me hypnotized
You give me all your love
You're all I'm thinking of
You made my dreams come true
My heart belongs to you
You're my dream boy
(You're my dream girl)
You show me your love in every way
You're faithful to me everyday

I double-cross you
And you get mysterious mail
I've tried hard not to shock you
It's hard not to
With the things I could say

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Don't we try
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?
Why
Don't we try
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?

[Verse 2]
You lock your letters in a box
And you've hidden the key
I go one better
I'm indebted
To a contact magazine

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Don't we try
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?
Why
Don't we try
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for us?

[Bridge]
Everybody's got to live together
Just to find a little peace of mind there
If you give up your affairs forever
I will give up mine
But it's hard
So hard

[Verse 3]
I'm always hoping you'll be faithful
But you're not, I suppose
We've both given up smoking
'Cause it's fatal
So whose matches are those?

Tell me why
Don't we try
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?

We make it so hard

Tell me why

104,104,The Boomin' System,"[Intro]
Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumping
Yeah, aight, but we need a beat that they can front to
Oh, that'll work, be funky
You know what I'm sayin'?
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
Funky
(Cars ride by)
For all the cars out there
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
And all the brothers
That like to front in their rides
(Cars ride by)
Check it out

[Verse 1]
You know it's funky, funky, funky 'cause you heard it from hearsay
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around
12 o'clock at night with your windows down
Headlights breakin' 'cause your batteries drain
Armor All on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots
Leanin to the side, people everywhere
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
'Cause they don't understand why I act this way
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by
And the girls be on my jock 'cause my system's fly

[Chorus]
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)

[Verse 2]
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
'Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this
Mind your business
Now pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While I'm checkin' out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
I'm frontin', and I don't care if you know
The backseat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne?
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise, it's 3 o'clock
The girlies, they smile, they see me comin'
I'm steady hummin, I got the Funky Drummer drumming
My trunk be shakin', vibratin' and rattlin'
Pumpin so loud, all the shorties be babblin'
My right-hand man's here without the swing
Every chance I get I'm showin' off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
'Cause I'm frontin' in my ride and my word is bond

[Chorus]
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)

[Verse 3]
Sunroof open, so I can feel the wind blow
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the O to the O to the L to the I to the N
To the F to the R to the O to the N to the T to the I to the N
That means I'm chillin'
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back, so I can get real cozy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say: I want BASS
I want a hit, I want a dose
You're rollin' up smilin', but you can't come close
'Cause my system is pumpin' loud
Like Rakim said: I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE
Tell the cops: you gots to chill with EPMD
This is something devastatin' that'll break your trunk
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk

[Chorus]
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin', word
So next time you're in your ride pumpin' it up
Just remember
It's cool

You won't belong to me
I let you down
I walk around and see your night skyline
I feel the light but you don't want to stay
So lonely now, just let me off downtown

Set it free, set it free
Set it free, set it free

When I said it was over, you aimed at my heart
Won't be long for I'm leavin', oh my love
But I feel it forever no time in my life
You can call that the livin' on my own so free

[Chorus:]
Everybody everybody
Everybody everybody
Everybody everybody
Everybody everybody

[Verse 2:]
You took me easy and then let me go
I never was you see, that cheatin' kind
You feel alright, you never look for me
So long, it's time I gotta get on back

Set it free, set it free
Set it free, set it free

When I said it was over, you aimed at my heart
Won't be long for I'm leavin', oh my love
But I feel it forever no time in my life
You can call that the livin' on my own so free

106,106,Romeo,"Check this out

I want the best
I won't settle for less
Since Cupid shot my heart
I'm stressed

The love I feel is real strong
I can't prolong
Drop the beat and let's do this

I can't believe the way
I fell in love with you, girl
You caught me by surprise

A dream come true
It was you
I didn't even know your name
Oh, no

Now you've got me thinking
Bout you every single day, girl
I can't get you off my mind

Cupid shot his arrow in my heart
And I'm not the same, no, no

Just like a fairytale
I would sail oceans blue
To get to you
Valentine, please be mine
I want you, girl

(CHORUS)
I'll be your Romeo
I love you so, I can't let go
(I can't let go) of these
Feelings in my heart
I'll be your Romeo
I love you so, I can't let go
(I can't let go) of these
Feelings in my heart

I like the way you give me
Your affection every night, girl
You really turn me on

It makes my day when you say
You're never gonna let me go
Oh, no

Now everything around me
Just reminds me more of you, girl
I miss you when you're gone

Cupid shot his arrow in my heart
And there's something
You should know
You should know, know, know

Just like a movie screen
A love scene of me and you
The things we do
Casanova, move over
I want you, girl

(CHORUS)
I'll be your Romeo
I love you so, I can't let go
(I can't let go) no, no, no

Hello, fly girl
How you doing
It's Dr.Ice and Dino
With the love just for you

And hey, I'm coming
Right and exact
Gonna be your romeo
To state a fact

? to express
How I feel about you

Don't move slow
Just kinda go with the flow
And let your hair down low
For me, your Romeo

(CHORUS)
I'll be your Romeo
I really love you so
I'll never let you go
I really, really love you","['check', 'this', 'out', 'i', 'want', 'the', 'best', 'i', 'wont', 'settle', 'for', 'less', 'since', 'cupid', 'shoot', 'my', 'heart', 'im', 'stress', 'the', 'love', 'i', 'feel', 'be', 'real', 'strong', 'i', 'cant', 'prolong', 'drop', 'the', 'beat', 'and', 'let', 'do', 'this', 'i', 'cant', 'believe', 'the', 'way', 'i', 'fell', 'in', 'love', 'with', 'you', 'girl', 'you', 'catch', 'me', 'by', 'surprise', 'a', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'it', 'be', 'you', 'i', 'didnt', 'even', 'know', 'your', 'name', 'oh', 'no', 'now', 'youve', 'get', 'me', 'think', 'bout', 'you', 'every', 'single', 'day', 'girl', 'i', 'cant', 'get', 'you', 'off', 'my', 'mind', 'cupid', 'shoot', 'his', 'arrow', 'in', 'my', 'heart', 'and', 'im', 'not', 'the', 'same', 'no', 'no', 'just', 'like', 'a', 'fairytale', 'i', 'would', 'sail', 'oceans', 'blue', 'to', 'get', 'to', 'you', 'valentine', 'please', 'be', 'mine', 'i', 'want', 'you', 'girl', 'ill', 'be', 'your', 'romeo', 'i', 'love', 'you', 'so', 'i', 'cant', 'let', 'go', 'feel', 'in', 'my', 'heart', 'ill', 'be', 'your', 'romeo', 'i', 'love', 'you', 'so', 'i', 'cant', 'let', 'go', 'feel', 'in', 'my', 'heart', 'i', 'like', 'the', 'way', 'you', 'give', 'me', 'your', 'affection', 'every', 'night', 'girl', 'you', 'really', 'turn', 'me', 'on', 'it', 'make', 'my', 'day', 'when', 'you', 'say', 'youre', 'never', 'gonna', 'let', 'me', 'go', 'oh', 'no', 'now', 'everything', 'around', 'me', 'just', 'remind', 'me', 'more', 'of', 'you', 'girl', 'i', 'miss', 'you', 'when', 'youre', 'go', 'cupid', 'shoot', 'his', 'arrow', 'in', 'my', 'heart', 'and', 'theres', 'something', 'you', 'should', 'know', 'you', 'should', 'know', 'know', 'know', 'just', 'like', 'a', 'movie', 'screen', 'a', 'love', 'scene', 'of', 'me', 'and', 'you', 'the', 'things', 'we', 'do', 'casanova', 'move', 'over', 'i', 'want', 'you', 'girl', 'ill', 'be', 'your', 'romeo', 'i', 'love', 'you', 'so', 'i', 'cant', 'let', 'go', 'hello', 'fly', 'girl', 'how', 'you', 'do', 'its', 'drice', 'and', 'dino', 'with', 'the', 'love', 'just', 'for', 'you', 'and', 'hey', 'im', 'come', 'right', 'and', 'exact', 'gonna', 'be', 'your', 'romeo', 'to', 'state', 'a', 'fact', '', 'to', 'express', 'how', 'i', 'feel', 'about', 'you', 'dont', 'move', 'slow', 'just', 'kinda', 'go', 'with', 'the', 'flow', 'and', 'let', 'your', 'hair', 'down', 'low', 'for', 'me', 'your', 'romeo', 'ill', 'be', 'your', 'romeo', 'i', 'really', 'love', 'you', 'so', 'ill', 'never', 'let', 'you', 'go', 'i', 'really', 'really', 'love', 'you']",332,Dino (Dean Esposito),Dino,1990,"[99, 80, 61, 52, 41, 23, 11, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 24, 26, 33, 42, 53, 69]",18,Romeo,https://open.spotify.com/track/1UCRESSRnELCF9W2BaiJbr,1UCRESSRnELCF9W2BaiJbr,spotify:track:1UCRESSRnELCF9W2BaiJbr,Tutto il mondo è un paese?,6QmIX34N1ZWp9PnLiTL0Fr,spotify:album:6QmIX34N1ZWp9PnLiTL0Fr,Lando e Dino,7n0lzHt8P9QczAwhpuIvlp,spotify:artist:7n0lzHt8P9QczAwhpuIvlp,43.78100000000001,34.0,1.0,2010-10-20,0.613,0.645,8.0,-10.083,1.0,0.373,0.94,0.0,0.355,0.722,116.306,[],[],1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.128

Johnny Seven's coming over the sea
He's taking your time
When you want to be free

Holding out a helping hand
Are you ready for a real career
Will you be so cool
When it's happening here

It don't say nothing that I haven't heard
If what I hear is true
You won't keep the law with a broken word
So what are you gonna do

Heart like a wheel
Turning away
From anything that's real
Heart like a wheel
Changing in time
Beating colder steel

Pass the message around the world
The medium is in retreat
The power is here
And packing some heat

Sell your soul to a holy war
Set the captive free
We make no promises anymore
But it isn't fooling me

Heart like a wheel
Turning away
From anything that's real
Heart like a wheel
Changing in time
Beating colder steel

You can't keep the wheels turning anymore
With anger, blood, and fear
Or make any friends with an M16
When you blast your way through here
Oh

Heart like a wheel
Turning away
From anything that's real
Heart like a wheel
Changing in time
Beating colder steel

Heart like a wheel
Turning away
From anything that's real

110,110,New Power Generation,"[Intro]
Lay down your funky weapon
Yeah y'all, here we go
Pumping the big noise in the 90's

[Verse 1]
Pardon me for living, but this is my world too
I can't help that what's cool to us might be strange to you
Pardon me for breathing, can we borrow some of your air?
The problem with you and your kind is that you don't know love is there

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for

[Chorus]
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
The only thing that's in our way is you
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do

[Verse 2]
Pardon me for thinking, but there's something under my hair
I bet you thought the lights were on but no one's living there
You think that if you tell enough lies they will see the truth?
I hope they bury your old ideas the same time they bury you

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for

[Chorus]
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
The only thing that's in our way is you
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do

[Interlude]
We are the new
We are the new, we are the new
Making love and music
New power, we stand

[Verse 3]
Pardon us for caring, we didn't know it was against the rules (shout it out)
If we only want to love one another
Then tell me now who's the fool (tell me, tell me)
No father, no mother, no sister, no brother, nobody can make me stop
Said if you didn't come to party child, I think you better get up of my block

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for

[Chorus]
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
The only thing that's in our way is you
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
Go on and get up off my block
The only thing that's in our way is you
Get up off my block, because
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
Love is there if you'd just open up to it
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do
If you'd just believe your whole world would change

[Outro]
New power generation, you've got to rearrange
We are the new power generation, you've got to give up all the fight
We are the new power generation
We got to try to love one another, baby
We are the new power generation
We are the new power generation","['lay', 'down', 'your', 'funky', 'weapon', 'yeah', 'yall', 'here', 'we', 'go', 'pump', 'the', 'big', 'noise', 'in', 'the', '90s', 'pardon', 'me', 'for', 'live', 'but', 'this', 'be', 'my', 'world', 'too', 'i', 'cant', 'help', 'that', 'whats', 'cool', 'to', 'us', 'might', 'be', 'strange', 'to', 'you', 'pardon', 'me', 'for', 'breathe', 'can', 'we', 'borrow', 'some', 'of', 'your', 'air', 'the', 'problem', 'with', 'you', 'and', 'your', 'kind', 'be', 'that', 'you', 'dont', 'know', 'love', 'be', 'there', 'lay', 'down', 'your', 'funky', 'weapon', 'come', 'join', 'us', 'on', 'the', 'floor', 'make', 'love', 'and', 'musics', 'the', 'only', 'things', 'worth', 'fight', 'for', 'we', 'be', 'the', 'new', 'power', 'generation', 'we', 'want', 'to', 'change', 'the', 'world', 'the', 'only', 'thing', 'thats', 'in', 'our', 'way', 'be', 'you', 'your', 'old', 'fashion', 'music', 'your', 'old', 'ideas', 'be', 'sick', 'and', 'tire', 'of', 'you', 'tell', 'us', 'what', 'to', 'do', 'pardon', 'me', 'for', 'think', 'but', 'theres', 'something', 'under', 'my', 'hair', 'i', 'bet', 'you', 'think', 'the', 'light', 'be', 'on', 'but', 'no', 'ones', 'live', 'there', 'you', 'think', 'that', 'if', 'you', 'tell', 'enough', 'lie', 'they', 'will', 'see', 'the', 'truth', 'i', 'hope', 'they', 'bury', 'your', 'old', 'ideas', 'the', 'same', 'time', 'they', 'bury', 'you', 'lay', 'down', 'your', 'funky', 'weapon', 'come', 'join', 'us', 'on', 'the', 'floor', 'make', 'love', 'and', 'musics', 'the', 'only', 'things', 'worth', 'fight', 'for', 'we', 'be', 'the', 'new', 'power', 'generation', 'we', 'want', 'to', 'change', 'the', 'world', 'the', 'only', 'thing', 'thats', 'in', 'our', 'way', 'be', 'you', 'your', 'old', 'fashion', 'music', 'your', 'old', 'ideas', 'be', 'sick', 'and', 'tire', 'of', 'you', 'tell', 'us', 'what', 'to', 'do', 'we', 'be', 'the', 'new', 'we', 'be', 'the', 'new', 'we', 'be', 'the', 'new', 'make', 'love', 'and', 'music', 'new', 'power', 'we', 'stand', 'if', 'we', 'only', 'want', 'to', 'love', 'one', 'another', 'no', 'father', 'no', 'mother', 'no', 'sister', 'no', 'brother', 'nobody', 'can', 'make', 'me', 'stop', 'say', 'if', 'you', 'didnt', 'come', 'to', 'party', 'child', 'i', 'think', 'you', 'better', 'get', 'up', 'of', 'my', 'block', 'lay', 'down', 'your', 'funky', 'weapon', 'come', 'join', 'us', 'on', 'the', 'floor', 'make', 'love', 'and', 'musics', 'the', 'only', 'things', 'worth', 'fight', 'for', 'we', 'be', 'the', 'new', 'power', 'generation', 'we', 'want', 'to', 'change', 'the', 'world', 'the', 'only', 'thing', 'thats', 'in', 'our', 'way', 'be', 'you', 'your', 'old', 'fashion', 'music', 'your', 'old', 'ideas', 'be', 'sick', 'and', 'tire', 'of', 'you', 'tell', 'us', 'what', 'to', 'do', 'we', 'be', 'the', 'new', 'power', 'generation', 'we', 'want', 'to', 'change', 'the', 'world', 'go', 'on', 'and', 'get', 'up', 'off', 'my', 'block', 'the', 'only', 'thing', 'thats', 'in', 'our', 'way', 'be', 'you', 'get', 'up', 'off', 'my', 'block', 'because', 'your', 'old', 'fashion', 'music', 'your', 'old', 'ideas', 'love', 'be', 'there', 'if', 'youd', 'just', 'open', 'up', 'to', 'it', 'be', 'sick', 'and', 'tire', 'of', 'you', 'tell', 'us', 'what', 'to', 'do', 'if', 'youd', 'just', 'believe', 'your', 'whole', 'world', 'would', 'change', 'new', 'power', 'generation', 'youve', 'get', 'to', 'rearrange', 'we', 'be', 'the', 'new', 'power', 'generation', 'youve', 'get', 'to', 'give', 'up', 'all', 'the', 'fight', 'we', 'be', 'the', 'new', 'power', 'generation', 'we', 'get', 'to', 'try', 'to', 'love', 'one', 'another', 'baby', 'we', 'be', 'the', 'new', 'power', 'generation', 'we', 'be', 'the', 'new', 'power', 'generation']",473,Prince,Prince,1990,"[89, 67, 64, 67, 70]",5,New Power Generation,https://open.spotify.com/track/231Ymyur5JtUCbzDgDJwcX,231Ymyur5JtUCbzDgDJwcX,spotify:track:231Ymyur5JtUCbzDgDJwcX,Music from Graffiti Bridge,2tHDc9g2bu1rz62xIjX1GE,spotify:album:2tHDc9g2bu1rz62xIjX1GE,Prince,5a2EaR3hamoenG9rDuVn8j,spotify:artist:5a2EaR3hamoenG9rDuVn8j,219.506,17.0,26.0,1990-08-17,0.7170000000000001,0.809,0.0,-9.358,1.0,0.0636,0.0486,1.08e-06,0.0297,0.679,111.279,"['funk', 'funk rock', 'minneapolis sound', 'motown']",[],1.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.121
111,111,Praying For Time,"These are the days of the open hand, they will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man, whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor, and most of us are not sure
If we have too much, but we'll take our chances
'Cause god's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way he must have let us all out to play
Turned his back, and all god's children crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand, oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man, your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say ""What's mine is mine and not yours""
I may have too much but i'll take my chances
'Cause god's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
'Cause he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love, there's so much to hate

Oh, baby

Some lovers dazzle me
With their limousines and pearls
They wine and dine you
And they promise you the world

But then the party's over
Everything is changed
The fire's gone
And nothing else remains

With you
It's more than just a passion

I know that love will last

Of knowing how to love
And getting hooked on those
Who never could get enough

I can take another chance
Cause you know the meaning of a true romance

Girl, when you gon' dial my heart?
Watch out!

I've been sitting here
Trying to figure out
How she does it to me
I don't understand how
She takes her man and changes his personality

She rocks it to the East
She rocks it to the West
I need some time
Cause my head is such a mess

I know
She's crazy 'bout me too
It's ridiculous, baby
I don't know what to do

You've got me going

Okay
What's ups with the Young Einstein posse?
Talkin' about a girl that's
Funky
Can't you see?
She's got me going
Showing the moves
I've never been shown
She's got us all whipped
Even my little brother

(Yo, word to your mother)
You know what?
When she's around
I feel shaky
Yo, she got us all going crazy

I'm a different man
Doing the best I can
Keeping my sanity
You know, babe
She knows the way I feel for her
Word to my mother

She rocks me to the East
She rocks me to the West
Slow down, baby
I got pains in my chest
(I'm having a heart attack)

Don't fight this feeling
You know you want me too
Don't play games with me, baby
I ain't got time to lose
Sing

With all my heart
I pledged my love forever
You've got my word
You and I will always be together

There may be times we have a disagreement
This love`s too strong
To ever let it come between us

I will keep this love alive
I will
Because otherwise

[Chorus:]
Me minus you equals blue
Can't imagine what I'd ever do
If it ever came to
Me minus you equals blue

[Verse 2:]
I can`t stand the thought of us apart
Like so many hearts
Beating in the dark
It'll never be me minus you

Each day I learn
A little more about you
And I know for sure that
I never want to be without you

We're gonna stay so true to this relation
Me without your loving
Is such a sad equation, baby

I will keep this love alive, baby
I will
Because otherwise

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I can't stand the thought of us apart
Like so many hearts
Beating in the dark
It`ll never be

What we got can`t get much better
I will never change your thing
Baby, we're so good together
That I never, never, ever
Want it to be me

120,120,Policy Of Truth,"[Verse 1]
You had something to hide
Should have hidden it, shouldn't you?
Now you're not satisfied
With what you're being put through

[Chorus]
It's just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth

[Verse 2]
Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilised
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you'd only lied

[Chorus]
It's too late to change events
It's time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth

[Post-Chorus]
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before

[Verse 3]
Now you're standing there tongue-tied
You'd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell

[Chorus]
You'll see your problems multiplied
If you continually decide
To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth

[Post-Chorus]
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before","['you', 'have', 'something', 'to', 'hide', 'should', 'have', 'hide', 'it', 'shouldnt', 'you', 'now', 'youre', 'not', 'satisfy', 'with', 'what', 'youre', 'be', 'put', 'through', 'its', 'just', 'time', 'to', 'pay', 'the', 'price', 'for', 'not', 'listen', 'to', 'advice', 'and', 'decide', 'in', 'your', 'youth', 'on', 'the', 'policy', 'of', 'truth', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'different', 'now', 'it', 'use', 'to', 'be', 'so', 'civilise', 'you', 'will', 'always', 'wonder', 'how', 'it', 'could', 'have', 'be', 'if', 'youd', 'only', 'lie', 'its', 'too', 'late', 'to', 'change', 'events', 'its', 'time', 'to', 'face', 'the', 'consequence', 'for', 'deliver', 'the', 'proof', 'in', 'the', 'policy', 'of', 'truth', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'what', 'you', 'swear', 'the', 'time', 'before', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'what', 'you', 'swear', 'the', 'time', 'before', 'now', 'youre', 'stand', 'there', 'tonguetied', 'youd', 'better', 'learn', 'your', 'lesson', 'well', 'hide', 'what', 'you', 'have', 'to', 'hide', 'and', 'tell', 'what', 'you', 'have', 'to', 'tell', 'youll', 'see', 'your', 'problems', 'multiply', 'if', 'you', 'continually', 'decide', 'to', 'faithfully', 'pursue', 'the', 'policy', 'of', 'truth', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'what', 'you', 'swear', 'the', 'time', 'before', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'what', 'you', 'swear', 'the', 'time', 'before', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'what', 'you', 'swear', 'the', 'time', 'before', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'what', 'you', 'swear', 'the', 'time', 'before', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'what', 'you', 'swear', 'the', 'time', 'before', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'what', 'you', 'swear', 'the', 'time', 'before', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'what', 'you', 'swear', 'the', 'time', 'before', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'what', 'you', 'swear', 'the', 'time', 'before']",219,Depeche Mode,Depeche Mode,1990,"[93, 85, 62, 47, 28, 15, 18, 20, 20, 21, 26, 30, 32, 41, 59, 77]",16,Policy of Truth - Live,https://open.spotify.com/track/5pEkt88uwNG4xfwSiOgsqC,5pEkt88uwNG4xfwSiOgsqC,spotify:track:5pEkt88uwNG4xfwSiOgsqC,Live in Berlin Soundtrack,7snShfFKLewVZTggBIsXJn,spotify:album:7snShfFKLewVZTggBIsXJn,Depeche Mode,762310PdDnwsDxAQxzQkfX,spotify:artist:762310PdDnwsDxAQxzQkfX,326.573,21.0,41.0,2014-11-17,0.611,0.945,8.0,-6.7410000000000005,1.0,0.0384,0.00395,0.114,0.975,0.552,113.987,"['dance rock', 'new romantic', 'new wave', 'permanent wave', 'synthpop']",[],1.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.001999999999999995

122,122,Doin' The Do,"(Oooh, ah, oooh, ah
Oooh, ah, oooh, ah)

It's me again, yes, how did you guess?
'Cause last time you were really impressed
And I'm bolder, c-c-cold, gettin' colder
And at the very same time I heat up at the party

And solder but not with solar power
For far too long made mistakes
And allowed a fat and ugly thing get in my way

Now I'm suitable and MC, I'm no inbetween
Top of the rank like Pearl and Dean
And if you can't take the heat get out the kitchen
Ain't got no time for your boo-boo-be

Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do
Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do

Hoodlum, that what you called me
Rebellious, you can't ignore me
But never mind, 'cause I know that I'm sweeter
Your time is up so put more money in your meter

You say I bully though I know I'm no goody-goody
But what do I know is that I'm fully in control
You're on a roll, fat as a rolypoly and on the whole

You think that I'm a threat
'Cause I'm the best you could ever get
I never make the teachers' pet
And ease yourself, I know you despise me
You criticize and override me

But I'm better and a whole lot cleverer
A go-getter, you know, a trend setter
I'm all the rage and all the craze
Come on, change the record, gotta turn the page

Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do
Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do

I'm sorry if I upset ya
To get the better of me I wouldn't let ya
Any time of the day I could get ya
You come runnin' to me, yes, I bet ya

Ain't goin' out like a sucker
There's no need to huff and puffa
'Cause, baby, I am tougher than you think
So you just gotta suffer

Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do
Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do

You might play bold but Betty Boo is bolder
Cold gettin' dumb, cold gettin' colder
Spent half the time lookin' over your shoulder
There ain't another MC who could be the queen

You have never been considered as anyone hype
So tonight I'm gonna take time out
To wipe that smile off your face
You're a side effect like an aftertaste

So face the facts, I do the job well
And hell, why not, I got a lot so tell me
What you're sayin', I'm not playin'
Somebody's gotta go and I'm stayin', Jack

Get back, exactly, you got me right
Get up, get with it or get outta my sight
Because I'm hot and sizzly, put you in the mood
Someone like you puts me off my food

Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do
Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do

Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do
Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do","['oooh', 'ah', 'oooh', 'ah', 'its', 'me', 'again', 'yes', 'how', 'do', 'you', 'guess', 'cause', 'last', 'time', 'you', 'be', 'really', 'impress', 'and', 'im', 'bolder', 'cccold', 'gettin', 'colder', 'and', 'at', 'the', 'very', 'same', 'time', 'i', 'heat', 'up', 'at', 'the', 'party', 'and', 'solder', 'but', 'not', 'with', 'solar', 'power', 'for', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'make', 'mistake', 'and', 'allow', 'a', 'fat', 'and', 'ugly', 'thing', 'get', 'in', 'my', 'way', 'now', 'im', 'suitable', 'and', 'mc', 'im', 'no', 'inbetween', 'top', 'of', 'the', 'rank', 'like', 'pearl', 'and', 'dean', 'and', 'if', 'you', 'cant', 'take', 'the', 'heat', 'get', 'out', 'the', 'kitchen', 'aint', 'get', 'no', 'time', 'for', 'your', 'booboobe', 'betty', 'boo', 'betty', 'boo', 'just', 'doin', 'the', 'do', 'and', 'you', 'be', 'through', 'and', 'theres', 'nothing', 'you', 'can', 'do', 'betty', 'boo', 'betty', 'boo', 'just', 'doin', 'the', 'do', 'and', 'you', 'be', 'through', 'and', 'theres', 'nothing', 'you', 'can', 'do', 'hoodlum', 'that', 'what', 'you', 'call', 'me', 'rebellious', 'you', 'cant', 'ignore', 'me', 'but', 'never', 'mind', 'cause', 'i', 'know', 'that', 'im', 'sweeter', 'your', 'time', 'be', 'up', 'so', 'put', 'more', 'money', 'in', 'your', 'meter', 'you', 'say', 'i', 'bully', 'though', 'i', 'know', 'im', 'no', 'goodygoody', 'but', 'what', 'do', 'i', 'know', 'be', 'that', 'im', 'fully', 'in', 'control', 'youre', 'on', 'a', 'roll', 'fat', 'as', 'a', 'rolypoly', 'and', 'on', 'the', 'whole', 'you', 'think', 'that', 'im', 'a', 'threat', 'cause', 'im', 'the', 'best', 'you', 'could', 'ever', 'get', 'i', 'never', 'make', 'the', 'teachers', 'pet', 'and', 'ease', 'yourself', 'i', 'know', 'you', 'despise', 'me', 'you', 'criticize', 'and', 'override', 'me', 'but', 'im', 'better', 'and', 'a', 'whole', 'lot', 'cleverer', 'a', 'gogetter', 'you', 'know', 'a', 'trend', 'setter', 'im', 'all', 'the', 'rage', 'and', 'all', 'the', 'craze', 'come', 'on', 'change', 'the', 'record', 'gotta', 'turn', 'the', 'page', 'betty', 'boo', 'betty', 'boo', 'just', 'doin', 'the', 'do', 'and', 'you', 'be', 'through', 'and', 'theres', 'nothing', 'you', 'can', 'do', 'betty', 'boo', 'betty', 'boo', 'just', 'doin', 'the', 'do', 'and', 'you', 'be', 'through', 'and', 'theres', 'nothing', 'you', 'can', 'do', 'im', 'sorry', 'if', 'i', 'upset', 'ya', 'to', 'get', 'the', 'better', 'of', 'me', 'i', 'wouldnt', 'let', 'ya', 'any', 'time', 'of', 'the', 'day', 'i', 'could', 'get', 'ya', 'you', 'come', 'runnin', 'to', 'me', 'yes', 'i', 'bet', 'ya', 'aint', 'goin', 'out', 'like', 'a', 'sucker', 'theres', 'no', 'need', 'to', 'huff', 'and', 'puffa', 'cause', 'baby', 'i', 'be', 'tougher', 'than', 'you', 'think', 'so', 'you', 'just', 'gotta', 'suffer', 'betty', 'boo', 'betty', 'boo', 'just', 'doin', 'the', 'do', 'and', 'you', 'be', 'through', 'and', 'theres', 'nothing', 'you', 'can', 'do', 'betty', 'boo', 'betty', 'boo', 'just', 'doin', 'the', 'do', 'and', 'you', 'be', 'through', 'and', 'theres', 'nothing', 'you', 'can', 'do', 'you', 'might', 'play', 'bold', 'but', 'betty', 'boo', 'be', 'bolder', 'cold', 'gettin', 'dumb', 'cold', 'gettin', 'colder', 'spend', 'half', 'the', 'time', 'lookin', 'over', 'your', 'shoulder', 'there', 'aint', 'another', 'mc', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'the', 'queen', 'you', 'have', 'never', 'be', 'consider', 'as', 'anyone', 'hype', 'so', 'tonight', 'im', 'gonna', 'take', 'time', 'out', 'to', 'wipe', 'that', 'smile', 'off', 'your', 'face', 'youre', 'a', 'side', 'effect', 'like', 'an', 'aftertaste', 'so', 'face', 'the', 'facts', 'i', 'do', 'the', 'job', 'well', 'and', 'hell', 'why', 'not', 'i', 'get', 'a', 'lot', 'so', 'tell', 'me', 'what', 'youre', 'sayin', 'im', 'not', 'playin', 'somebodys', 'gotta', 'go', 'and', 'im', 'stayin', 'jack', 'get', 'back', 'exactly', 'you', 'get', 'me', 'right', 'get', 'up', 'get', 'with', 'it', 'or', 'get', 'outta', 'my', 'sight', 'because', 'im', 'hot', 'and', 'sizzly', 'put', 'you', 'in', 'the', 'mood', 'someone', 'like', 'you', 'put', 'me', 'off', 'my', 'food', 'betty', 'boo', 'betty', 'boo', 'just', 'doin', 'the', 'do', 'and', 'you', 'be', 'through', 'and', 'theres', 'nothing', 'you', 'can', 'do', 'betty', 'boo', 'betty', 'boo', 'just', 'doin', 'the', 'do', 'and', 'you', 'be', 'through', 'and', 'theres', 'nothing', 'you', 'can', 'do', 'betty', 'boo', 'betty', 'boo', 'just', 'doin', 'the', 'do', 'and', 'you', 'be', 'through', 'and', 'theres', 'nothing', 'you', 'can', 'do', 'betty', 'boo', 'betty', 'boo', 'just', 'doin', 'the', 'do', 'and', 'you', 'be', 'through', 'and', 'theres', 'nothing', 'you', 'can', 'do']",593,Betty Boo,Betty Boo,1990,"[96, 91, 90, 93]",4,"Doin' The Do -

123,123,Release Me,"[Intro]
I know that it's time for a change
Mmm but when that change comes
Will it still feel the same?

[Verse 1]
How many times have I tried
To turn this love around?
I don't wanna give up but, baby
It's time I had two feet on the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you release me?
Can you release me?

[Verse 2]
Now that you're gone
I can't help myself from wondering
Ohh, if you'd have come down from your high
Would we've been all right?

[Pre-Chorus]
Release me
Can you release me?

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Come on, darlin', hear me, darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me
Release me, release me

[Verse 3]
I'm not going back to you anymore
Finally my weakened heart is healing
Though very slow
So stop coming around my door
'Cause you're not gonna find what you're looking for

[Chorus]
Ohh, come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
Somehow it's just not that easy
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me

[Bridge]
Now tell me
What is this power you've got on me?
What is this power? Ohh

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, baby
Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me

[Outro]
Release me, release me

I've heard of true loves that lasted forever
I guess there is a way
And I've heard of true loves that needed each other
More and more each day

[Pre-Chorus]
What is love when there's no one that cares?
Next time you need my love I'll be there
Be right by your side

[Chorus]
Let's try it again, try it again
Let's try it again
My love for you, it has no end
Let's try it again, 'til the end
All because I love you

[Verse 2]
I've heard of two loves that stayed with each other
Didn't wander through the night
And I've heard of two loves that prayed for each other
Didn't argue, fuss or fight

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I know just what love's all about
Next time you need my love I won't doubt, doubt your love again

[Chorus]
Let's try it again, try it again
Let's try it again
My love for you, it has no end
Let's try it again, 'til the end
All because I love you

[Outro]
You gotta try it again
My love for you, it has no end
You know and I know it's all because I love you

Let's try it again (Let's try it again), try it again
(Let's try it again) Let's try it again

Hey, little sister, she's got a lot of time
She's got a lot of money
Don't you know that ain't enough?
Hey, pretty thing, all dressed up
For the main attraction
Like a baby doll looking for love

And she doesn't need a reason
She just hears a calling to the wild, hey, yeah

God gave man the breath of life
To grow up strong and to take a wife
To change the world and love is the ritual
You learn to walk and talk and laugh and cry
Work your fingers to the bone till the day you die
And above it all, love is the ritual

Hey, little man, beatin' his chest
And flexing his muscles
Gun for hire, he shoots for a star
Hey, like a handsome prince
Walkin' down the street in his shinin' armor
Romeo in search of his heart

There's a method to this madness
And a message callin' to the wild, hey

God gave man the breath of life
To grow up strong and to take a wife
To change the world and love is the ritual
You learn to walk and talk and laugh and cry
Give your heart and soul till the day you die
And above it all, love is the ritual

Come on dance, little sister
Little sister wants to dance
All night looking for true romance
When in a black leather jacket walks little brother
To rock her world, to be her lover

So, signal all the children
Send a message calling to the wild, hey
God gave man the breath of life
To grow up strong and to take a wife
To change the world and love is the ritual
So you walk and talk and laugh and cry
Work your fingers to the bone till the day you die
And above it all, love is the ritual

Resolution slips away again
Right through my fingers, back into my heart
Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark
Sometimes I think I'm blind
Or I may be just paralyzed
Because the plot thickens every day
And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away
But I know, there's a picture beneath
Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens....
Because I'm somewhere in between
My love and my agony
You see, I'm somewhere in between
My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together
Layin' face down on the ground
My fingers in my ears to block the sound
My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight
Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight
Droplets of ""yes"" and ""no""
In an ocean of ""maybe""
From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline
From the top, another downhill slope of mine
But I know, the equilibrium's there
Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens
Because I'm somewhere in between
My love and my agony
You see, I'm somewhere in between
My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together

Anywhere that you are, my love is right here
With any tick of the clock
Life can change it's course
But my love will not
My love is a rock

Headed out into uncharted waters
What you feel is your only guide
And each step that you take brings you closer
Just trust what you feel inside
Cause something's telling you to keep on going
Telling you that your aim is true
Could be the voice of reason, or just blind devotion
Whatever it is, it's calling out to you, singing....

My love is a rock, an immovable force
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here

Life can change it's course
But my love will not
My love is a rock

Mixed messages shoot through a wire
Tender turmoil in your voice
Change is spreading through you like a fire
Bridges are burning, you made your choice
And as you're searching for peace in your world
You may find yourself spinning around, and around, and around
While the pain you've endured
Only serves to make you surer
Of the strength you have found, and then...

My love is a rock, an immovable force
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here
With any tick of the clock
Life can change it's course
But my love will not
My love is a rock

You may not be looking for love, but love may find you
You may choose to close your eyes and run
You may leave love far behind you
In your eyes I can see the future
In your heart I can always trust
In your mind I will live on forever
In your arms I will turn to dust
These are feelings like I have never known
The song of my very soul
I can no longer silently sing it
I'm gonna take it to the mountain and let it roll singing.....

My love is a rock, an immovable force
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here
With any tick of the clock
Life can change it's course
Some things are here and then gone before you know
Some things disappear without a chance to grow

Start up happy and end up sad days
Talking about that Murphy's law chill
If it can go wrong, yes it will

Went to the store to cop some groceries
Friday night and I had the munchies
Filled the cart till it could not take it
One more bag of chips would break it

Went to the cheek out stood in line
Behind me a girl who was just too fine
Got in the ear while they rang the total
Reached for my wallet uh oh a bolo

Not my day I felt like a dummy
Went to the store and forgot the money

Me and amy under the covers
Scene is hot potential lovers
Demon in the sack is her reputation
In school then she is graduation

Touching holding heavy breathing
I knew I'd get it she is not about teasing
Left on the light so I could see reaction
Amy is a freak guaranteed satisfaction

She is soft as bubble bath
I am as hard as chinese math
Ready for the ultimate affection
Took out a pack obtain my protection

Rolled it on one hard stroke
It was my last and yes it broke

Yeah!
So good
My, my, my, my
You look so sweet
Listen

[Verse 1]
Put on your red dress and slip on your high heels
And some of that sweet perfume, it sure smells good on you
Slide on your lipstick, and let all your hair down
'Cause baby, when you get through I'm gonna show off you

[Bridge]
Tonight will be a special night
No matter where we go
And I'm so proud to be with you
I just want to let you know

[Chorus]
You got my sayin' my, my, my, my, my, my
You sure look good tonight
And you're so damn fine
I wanna say my, my, my, my, my, my (Uh-huh)
You sure look good tonight (Tonight, after all this time)

[Verse 2]
Slip on your nightgown, step in our bedroom
First I wanna take some time, I just wanna look at you
Girl, you are so fine, I can't believe my eyes
And all that I wanna do, I wanna make love to you, oh

Tonight will be a special night
A minute more to come
And I'm so proud to be with you
So proud to share your love

[Chorus]
My, my, my, my, my, my

I wanna say my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

Let me, let me show you how sweet it's gonna be
I wanna show you things that you never
You never, ever, ever seen before

Put your nightgown on
Let your hair hang low
Step into our room

Turn around, make your move
Turn around, make your move

I can feel you staring, your eyes undressing me
Every time I'm near you boy, my heart skips a beat
Stop anticipating, don't play hide and seek
My love's for the taking if you're playing for keeps

Every little thing you do
Is saying that you want me, too
But you keep your heart behind the wall of ice
Every single breath you take
Is another second that you waste
I don't like the shy boys
Open up your eyes boy

Turn around, make your move
Wait too long and you might lose
Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine
Turn around, make your move
Nothing's wrong, just say you do
Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine

Yeeah, do it now

Nothing comes from nothing, I won't give it away
I'm wonderin' if you love me, because you never say
Don't play with my passion, I can't read your mind
Boy let's see some action, show me some kind of sign

If I opened up my heart, would you even know where to start
Am I guessing wrong about your feelings?
Is it all a fantasy, that I think you wanna be?
Explain to my affection, have I got your attention?

Turn around, make your move
Wait too long and you might lose
Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine
Turn around, make your move
Nothing's wrong, just say you do
Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine oh mine

Tell me where I'm goin' wrong
Have I been misled?
Is it something that I said?
Or didn't sa-aay-yaa-aay-yaa

Every little thing you do
Is saying that you want me, too
But you keep your heart behind the wall of ice
Every single breath you take
Is another second that you waste
I don't like the shy boys
Open up your eyes boy

Turn around, make your move
Wait too long and you might lose

Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine
Turn around, make your move
Wait too long and you might lose
Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine

I know, I know you wanna be mine
I know, I know you wanna be mine
I know, I know you wanna be mine
I know, I know!

I know, you wanna be mine
I know, you wanna be mine
You wanna be mine, You wanna be mine

132,132,Time For Letting Go,"Ive been holding back words
And waiting for time
Theres a lesson here somewhere
I know its mine
And though ill remember the promise we made
Promises dont justify feeling this way, any more

Its time for letting go
We can't hide what we both know
But ooooh , ooooh the hurt grows
Everytime i think its over

Youve been keepin all your secrets inside
I know the truth now baby, you dont have to hide
But my mind wanders , to the very first day
What a shame things had to turn out this way

Its time for letting go
We can't hide what we both know
But ooooh , oooh
The hurt grows , everytime i think its over

No words, could bring back your affection
And no lies, could keep me holdin on
Holdin on and holdin on

Now i know that its
Time for letting go
We can't hide what we both know
But oooh , oooh the hurt grows
Everytime i think its over
Its time to realize
That were both just living lies
And way down deep inside
The time is telling me its time for letting go

Let it go
I keep tellin myself over and over
Let it go .....................
But my loves still strong
But i just can't keep holding on

Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it, 'cause it happens too fast
And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass
It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it, so sweet
But it makes no difference 'cause it knocks you off your feet

[Chorus]
You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
It's cryin', bleedin', lyin' on the floor
So you lay down on it and you do it some more
You've got to share it, so you dare it
Then you bare it and you tear it

[Chorus]
You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face, but you can't grab it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
It's sad, it happened, and it's a shame

[Chorus]
You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face, but you can't grab it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Move, dance and lose it
You got a body that moves
Then use it

And I'm never late

Never slip on the beat
Cause it's wicked
Grab the mic real tight
Cause it's kicking

Then get with mine

135,135,Days Like These,"The sun was shining
The sky was crying
It just tore apart
And down came the rain

And I was soaking
Yeah I was freezing
But I was feeling
No kind of pain

Come a fireball
I held it in my hand
You see before you
A man who's known greatness

I had a vision
A revelation
I took a look inside of me
And I am a sensation

Days like these
I feel like I can change the world
Days like these
I feel like I can change the world

It's either easy
Or it's impossible
And if you ain't got it
You ain't never gonna get it

But once you find it
You gotta grab it
Reach down your own throat
And yank it to the surface

That may be brutal
May be gory
But whatever else it is
It's my story

And I believe it
Yeah, I can see it
I sing it out, shout it out
Gimme death or glory

Days like these
I feel like I can change the world
Days like these
I feel like I can change the world

Days like these, days like these
I think I'll move a mountain or two
Days like these, days like these
Anything you want you know
I'll get it for you

Days like these
I feel like I can change the world

The sun was shining
I was crying
I saw a thousand people
Singing in the rain

And I was thinking
About the Indians
And how they say true wisdom
Only comes from pain

Come a rumbling
Humbling feeling
Like things will never
Ever be the same

But what doesn't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Today I'm strong enough
And anyway, I love the rain

Days like these

136,136,Have You Seen Her,"Ah yeah, I'm glad I put this tape in
I'm just gon' cruise down the road
Look at the stars in the sky
And drift off into the sweet memories that I have
Of a love that my heart has been searching for
For so long, and I know somewhere
If I keep looking, that love I'll find
The picture grows clearer and clearer
From the back to the front of my mind
And like love, a love I know I'll have
The girl that I want, she'll be mine, she'll be fly, and it'll last

I see her face and I can't let go
She's in my dreams and my heart, so let me know
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that love
She's a thought and a vision in my memory
I haven't met her, but tell me where could she be
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that special love
(love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that the Hammer definetly needs
(please be mine)
Baby be mine
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
So why don't you be mine
The search is going on
From coast to coast
A women for the man, who's propping the most
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is beating strong
This love cannot be wrong
I need her and I want her, so come on to my home
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
I'm a keep looking
At the movies, in my car, on my stereo
At a game of Different World or the Cosby Show
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
Yo veo, tell me what's up
At the track, at the club, or out buying dub
If you've seen her, then I'll have her, cause I'm in love
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is hurting so bad
(love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that I know I need
(please be mine)
Be mine baby
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
Why don't you be mine
(baby, be mine)
Where could she be?
At the store around the corner
Or wondering at night
Or chilling with another brother holding the mic
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
Hammer, you know I'm looking
Calling all my friends all around the place
Guy, Levert, or my homey Rob Base
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
If you've peeped her out, tell me
Yo, veo on the phone
Ted, Dre, or Ed Lover
Fab Five, homeys won't you help a young brother
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
I got a picture in my mind
The thought is so clear of the love I need here
Like D-B magic, and why don't you appear
(have you seen her?)
Oh baby, why don't you appear
(tell me have you seen her?)
I can see yo' face
I'm seeing her face, again and again
Come knocking at my door, and you know I'll let you in
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
Oh, my sweet love
Searching 'round the world, what more can I say?
The girl is hard to see like an unseen VJ

So many times you stole my heart away
Before I say the things I want to say
I need to know that you will be the one for, one for me
I'd like to know how far this love will go
I want to be the one who's left to know
That this won't only be a memory
Just tell me what you see, just what this love can be

Chorus:
Just look into my eyes
And tell me what you see
Promises were broken
Now it's you girl that I need
Just look into my eyes
You see a rainbow we can share
Please don't let this be another lie
Just look into my eyes
Just look into my eyes

--- have got me --- this other day
Just tell me what, I need to hear you say
I want to play those games I used to play
Baby can't you see, just what you do to me
It's hard enough to find a love thats true
How heaven knows girl I wanted to be with you
Some other times I've left it up to you
Just open up your heart, and girl just turn the key

Chorus

How I need you girl to find a love so true
Just take my hand and show me what this means to you
A special lover all our dreams come true
Just look into my eyes and share this dream just me and you

138,138,All I'm Missing Is You,"Oh!

[Verse 1:]
I got these friends
They walk around so considered
Bragging to the end
Like a car and clothes
Is all that's needed

What about the simple part
Give out of the heart?
Without love
It's never gonna be enough
I got the toys, I got the car
I got the friends
But

Hanging with the boys
Is not the kind of time I want to spend
But I know there's something more
Something I've been waiting for
I knew it was true
The moment I saw you

[Chorus:]
In my heart, in my head
In my life, in my bed
All I'm missing is you

Every day, every night
Of my life would be right
All I'm missing is you
Oh, girl
All I'm missing is you yeah

[Verse 2:]
Doing all I can
But every since I met you, baby
I'm a traveling man
If only else real love can save me

I'm reaching out to you
Baby, what else can I do?
But it's gonna be right
To get you into my life

In this crazy world
I've been searching for the answer
Then I saw you, girl
I found out what my heart's been after

Could have been another day
But if I looked the other way
Then I couldn't have known
What I've been missing all along

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
With all that
I know
Still this
Fill me with you

Girl, you know
I got it going on
But all I'm missing is you
You, baby
Oh, yeah
All I'm missing is a-you

[Repeat Chorus:]

I need your loving
Give me that love
Gimme that loving

Wish you in my bed, babe

Q-Vo, aqui estoy, MC Kid Frost
Yo soy jefe, patron, yes, the big boss
My cuete's loaded, it's full of balas
I put it in your face and you won't say nada
Vatos, cholos, you call us what you will
You say we are assassins an we are sent to kill
It's in my blood to be an Aztec Warrior
Go to any extreme and hold no barriers
Chicano and I'm Brown and I'm proud
Guantes, chingaso, simon, ese let’s get down
Right now, in the dirt
What's the matter? You afraid you're gonna get hurt?
I'm with my homeboys, my camaradas
Kickin' back con mi ganga y para mi no vale nada
Yo soy chingon ese, like Al Capone ese
Controlo a todos solo never try to sweat me
Some of you don't know what's happening que pasa
It's not for you anyway, cuz this is for the Raza

[Hook (x2)]
This for La Raza, Raza
This for La Raza, Raza

[Verse 2: Kid Frost]
The foreign tongue I’m speaking is known as  alo
Y sabes que loco? Yo soy muy malo
Tu no sabes nada, your brains is hallow
Been hit in the head too many times with a palo
Still you trying to act cool, but you should know
You're so cool that I'mma call you a culo
You’re just a pee-wee, you can’t get none ever
You're on the leva
Your own barrio doesn't back you up
They just look at your ass and call you a poo butt
And so I look and I laugh and say que pasa
Yeah, this is for the Raza

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 3: Kid Frost]
Cruising in the calle, headed for the bolo
No want to go with me, so I had to go solo
And when I go out alone I'm packed
I don’t sweat the chavalas when I know that I’m strapped
Every time that I pack my piece
I pull it out quick, all the nonsense will cease
Just like the song when you're 18 With A Bullet
Got my finger on a trigger, I'm not afraid to pull it
If it gets out of hand I know some mafiosos
Who can pull out cuetes on some stupid ass babosos
Sitting there wondering what's happened, que pasa
Yeah, this is for the Raza

In a cellophane dress
Then they bid me a sweet farewell
Last time I saw them
They were kissing so softly
To the sound of wedding bells

145,145,Lies,"[Chorus]
Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lies, lies, just a devil in disguise

[Verse 1: Dawn Robinson]
It's the same game
Played in many ways
Everyone is the victim too
It's just a waste of time
Made for simple minds
So why do people insist on lies?

[Pre-Chorus: Cindy Herron]
I'll live my life a different way
Refuse to let myself become a victim
Getting caught up in a vicious web of lies

[Chorus]
Lies (they can hurt you), lies (and destroy you)
Using lies as alibis (watch out for lies)
Lies, lies, just a devil in disguise
(Just a devil in disguise)

[Verse 2: Dawn]
The nation's leaders as well as teachers
Practice lies as a way of life, yes they do
So think before you speak
'Cause what you sow you reap
The truth will always be brought to light

[Pre-Chorus: Cindy]
Will we ever learn one day
That telling lies will always lead to madness
Misery and sometimes pain

[Chorus]
Lies, lies, using lies as alibis (using lies as alibis)
Lies, lies, just a devil in disguise (and it's made for simple minds)
Lies, lies, using lies as alibis (made for simple minds)
Lies, lies (you've got to think about it), just a devil in disguise
(Those lies)

[Rap: Debbie T]
Lies and deceit, yes, it's running real rampant
Communities suffering, yo, I can't stand it
When we think of lies, we tend to think of politicians
But what about the husband who's on a mission?
Lying to his wife so he can get it on and get some
Coming back home with a dumb expression
Written on a face that's guilty as a criminal
It's time to change your attitude
People do you hear me though?
Listen, to a funky rhyme that's kickin' knowledge that we need
We lie about our hair and we know we got a weave
Politicians lie about the things they're gonna do
And they re-lie the tale, affects me and you
A smoker lies about the money that he stole
And a dope dealer never tells you how he got his gold
I guess what Debbie T. is really trying to say
When you break it all down, we're really all the same

[Pre-Chorus: Cindy]
I'll live my life a different way
Refuse to let myself become a victim
Caught up in a vicious web of lies

[Chorus]
Lies, lies, using lies as alibis (using lies)
Lies (stop lying), lies, just a devil in disguise (stop cheating)
Lies, lies, using lies as alibis (oh yeah, they'll ruin your life)
Lies (you better think twice), lies, just a devil in disguise
Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lies, lies, just a devil in disguise
Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lies, lies, just a devil in disguise","['lie', 'lie', 'use', 'lie', 'as', 'alibi', 'lie', 'lie', 'just', 'a', 'devil', 'in', 'disguise', 'its', 'the', 'same', 'game', 'play', 'in', 'many', 'ways', 'everyone', 'be', 'the', 'victim', 'too', 'its', 'just', 'a', 'waste', 'of', 'time', 'make', 'for', 'simple', 'mind', 'so', 'why', 'do', 'people', 'insist', 'on', 'lie', 'ill', 'live', 'my', 'life', 'a', 'different', 'way', 'refuse', 'to', 'let', 'myself', 'become', 'a', 'victim', 'get', 'catch', 'up', 'in', 'a', 'vicious', 'web', 'of', 'lie', 'lie', 'lie', 'just', 'a', 'devil', 'in', 'disguise', 'the', 'nations', 'leaders', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'teachers', 'practice', 'lie', 'as', 'a', 'way', 'of', 'life', 'yes', 'they', 'do', 'so', 'think', 'before', 'you', 'speak', 'cause', 'what', 'you', 'sow', 'you', 'reap', 'the', 'truth', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'bring', 'to', 'light', 'will', 'we', 'ever', 'learn', 'one', 'day', 'that', 'tell', 'lie', 'will', 'always', 'lead', 'to', 'madness', 'misery', 'and', 'sometimes', 'pain', 'lie', 'and', 'deceit', 'yes', 'its', 'run', 'real', 'rampant', 'communities', 'suffer', 'yo', 'i', 'cant', 'stand', 'it', 'when', 'we', 'think', 'of', 'lie', 'we', 'tend', 'to', 'think', 'of', 'politicians', 'but', 'what', 'about', 'the', 'husband', 'whos', 'on', 'a', 'mission', 'lie', 'to', 'his', 'wife', 'so', 'he', 'can', 'get', 'it', 'on', 'and', 'get', 'some', 'come', 'back', 'home', 'with', 'a', 'dumb', 'expression', 'write', 'on', 'a', 'face', 'thats', 'guilty', 'as', 'a', 'criminal', 'its', 'time', 'to', 'change', 'your', 'attitude', 'people', 'do', 'you', 'hear', 'me', 'though', 'listen', 'to', 'a', 'funky', 'rhyme', 'thats', 'kickin', 'knowledge', 'that', 'we', 'need', 'we', 'lie', 'about', 'our', 'hair', 'and', 'we', 'know', 'we', 'get', 'a', 'weave', 'politicians', 'lie', 'about', 'the', 'things', 'theyre', 'gonna', 'do', 'and', 'they', 'relie', 'the', 'tale', 'affect', 'me', 'and', 'you', 'a', 'smoker', 'lie', 'about', 'the', 'money', 'that', 'he', 'steal', 'and', 'a', 'dope', 'dealer', 'never', 'tell', 'you', 'how', 'he', 'get', 'his', 'gold', 'i', 'guess', 'what', 'debbie', 't', 'be', 'really', 'try', 'to', 'say', 'when', 'you', 'break', 'it', 'all', 'down', 'be', 'really', 'all', 'the', 'same', 'ill', 'live', 'my', 'life', 'a', 'different', 'way', 'refuse', 'to', 'let', 'myself', 'become', 'a', 'victim', 'catch', 'up', 'in', 'a', 'vicious', 'web', 'of', 'lie', 'lie', 'lie', 'use', 'lie', 'as', 'alibi', 'lie', 'lie', 'just', 'a', 'devil', 'in', 'disguise', 'lie', 'lie', 'use', 'lie', 'as', 'alibi', 'lie', 'lie', 'just', 'a', 'devil', 'in', 'disguise']",333,En Vogue,En Vogue,1990,"[97, 67, 41, 38, 43, 45, 48, 58, 63, 74, 82]",11,Lies,https://open.spotify.com/track/5hyHsOQUnWQMBPWX8KZuID,5hyHsOQUnWQMBPWX8KZuID,spotify:track:5hyHsOQUnWQMBPWX8KZuID,Born To Sing,5G7LmJHqy7cLklwTm1ARYa,spotify:album:5G7LmJHqy7cLklwTm1ARYa,En Vogue,5fikk4h5qbEebqK2Fc6e48,spotify:artist:5fikk4h5qbEebqK2Fc6e48,256.333,12.0,22.0,1990-04-03,0.775,0.759,10.0,-9.836,0.0,0.0735,0.13699999999999998,2.32e-06,0.0611,0.958,99.591,"['dance pop', 'girl group', 'hip hop', 'hip pop', 'neo soul', 'new jack swing', 'quiet storm', 'r&b', 'urban contemporary']",[],1.0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.376

Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

149,149,Thieves In The Temple,"[Chorus]
Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

[Verse 1]
They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt you
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Love if you're there come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when you're around
But I'll surely die
If you're not there

[Chorus]
Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

[Verse 2]
I feel like I'm looking for my soul (Soul)
Like a poor man looking for gold (Gold)
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Voices from the sky say rely on your best friend to pull you through
But even if I wanted to I couldn't really truly because my only friend is you

Come on

[Hook]
There are thieves in the temple tonight

[Verse 3]
Kicking me in my heart, tearing me all apart
(Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart)
Because me and you could have been a work of art
Thieves in the temple
Baby don't you know I'm holding on
The best that I can
Love please help me be
The better man

[Hook]
Better than the thieves in the temple
In the temple tonight
Oh, thieves in the temple (Tonight) tonight
Hurt me

[Chorus]
Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

[Hook]
Thieves in the temple

[Verse 4]
You said you loved me! (Thieves in the temple)
You said I was your friend! (Thieves in the temple)
You were supposed to take care of me! (Love come quick) {Thieves in the temple}
You lie! Love come (Lie!) in a hurry (Lie!)

150,150,Slow Love,"(Doc's House)
(The camera pans around the place. No one is home.)
Radio: October is inventory time. So right now, Statler Toyota is making the best deals of the year on all 1985 model Toyotas. You won't find a better car with a better price with better service anywhere in Hill Valley...
Television: The Senate is expected to vote on this today. In other news, officials at The Pacific Nuclear Research Facility have denied the rumor that the case of missing plutonium was in fact stolen from their vault two weeks ago. A Libyan terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the alleged theft, however, the officials now infer the crepency to a simple clerical error. The FBI...
(The door opens and Marty McFly walks in, his skateboard rolls to a stop by the bed. Under the bed we can see a box that is marked Plutonium.)
Marty: Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on?
(He looks around and realizes that no one is home. He decides to test out the Amps. He hooks up his guitar and turns the amp all the way up. He hits one note and the speakers blow out, throwing him back into some boxes.)
Marty: Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. (the phone begins to ring. He answers it.) Yo.
Doc: (on phone) Marty, is that you?
Marty: Hey, hey, Doc, where are you?
Doc: (on phone) Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.
Marty: Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?
Doc: (on phone) Yeah.
Marty: What's going on? Where have you been all week?
Doc: (on phone) Working.
Marty: Where's Einstein, is he with you?
Doc: (on phone) Yeah, he's right here.
Marty: You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.
Doc: (on phone) My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.
Marty: Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.
Doc: (on phone) Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.
Marty: Right.
(All of a sudden all the clocks in the room begin going off. It's very loud.)
Doc: (on phone) Are those my clocks I hear?
Marty: Yeah, it's 8:00.
Doc: (on phone) They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.
Marty: Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25?
Doc: (on phone) Precisely.
Marty: Damn. I'm late for school.
(Hangs up the phone and heads out. He grabs on to the tail end of a car and rides his skateboard to school.)
(School)
(Marty arrives but his girlfriend, Jennifer, is waiting for him.)
Marty: Hello, Jennifer.
Jennifer: Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row.
(Hallway)
Jennifer: Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.
Marty: Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.
Strickland: Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nuttcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble.
Marty: Oh yes sir.
Strickland: You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went here. He was a slacker too.
Marty: Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?
Strickland: I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother McFly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.
Marty: Yeah, well history is gonna change.
(Auditorium - After school)
(Marty's band is getting ready to try out.)
Audition Judge: Next, please.
Marty: Alright, we're the Pinheads.
(They begin to play the opening to ""Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis and the News.)
Audition Judge: Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please?
(Town Square)
(Marty and Jennifer are sitting on a bench near the Clock Tower.)
Election Van: Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name.
Marty: I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.
Jennifer: Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.
Marty: Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music.
Jennifer: But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.
Marty: Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.
Jennifer: That's good advice, Marty.
Marty: Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, ""Get out of here, kid, you got no future."" I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man.
Jennifer: C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.
Marty: (spots a really sweet looking Truck.) Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake? Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars.
Jennifer: Stop it.
Marty: What?
Jennifer: Does your mom know about tomorrow night?
Marty: No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun.
Jennifer: She's just trying to keep you respectable.
Marty: Well, she's not doing a very good job.
(They go to kiss but a woman shoves a flyer in their faces.)
Woman: Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.
Marty: Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. (drops a quarter into her collection tin.)
Woman: Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer.
Marty: Right.
Woman: (walks off) Save the clock tower.
Marty: Where were we?
Jennifer: Right about here.
(They kiss right as Jennifer's Dad drives up.)
Jennifer's Dad: Jennifer.
Jennifer: It's my dad.
Marty: Right.
Jennifer: I've gotta go.
Marty: I'll call you tonight.
Jennifer: I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. (writes the number on the back of the Clock Tower flyer.) Bye.
(Marty's House)
Marty: Perfect, just perfect.
(Marty arrives in time to see a Tow Truck driving up with what's left of his Dad's Car. Inside Biff Tannen is griping at George McFly, Marty's father. George is a skinny man, and very nerdy.)
Biff: I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed.
George: Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blind spot before when I would drive it. (spots Marty) Hi, son.
Biff: But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?
George: Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage?
Biff: My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?
George: Uh?
Biff: And where's my reports?
George: Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till…
Biff: Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? (George doesn't say anything.) Would you?
George: Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright?
Biff: Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. (George looks down and Biff smacks his head.) Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. (Goes to the fridge to get a beer.) I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead? Say hi to your mom for me. (leaves)
George: (turns to see Marty's disappointed expression) I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.
Marty: The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue?
George: I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry.
(Dinner Table - Later)
(The whole family is having dinner. George is working on his reports and watching TV. David and Linda, Marty's siblings are there as well. David is dressed in his work clothes, a fast food restaurant outfit.)
George: Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance.
David: He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches.
(Marty's mother, Loraine, enters and drops a cake onto the table. She's a plump woman who tends to drink somewhat.)
Lorraine: Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line.
Marty: Uncle Jailbird Joey?
David: He's your brother, Mom.
Linda: Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison.
Lorraine: We all make mistakes in life, children.
David: God dammit, I'm late.
Lorraine: David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.
David: C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. (kisses George's head.) Woo, time to change that oil.
(George laughs at that.)
Linda: Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice.
Lorraine: I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble.
Linda: Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.
Lorraine: I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy.
Linda: Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody.
Lorraine: Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father.
Linda: That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car.
Lorraine: It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.
Linda: Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.
Lorraine: What was it, George, bird watching?
George: (looks up from the TV) What Lorraine, what?
Lorraine: Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him.
Linda: Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance.
Lorraine: No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him.
(Bedroom - 1:00 am)
(Marty's asleep in his clothes. The phone rings, and Marty wakes up and answers it.)
Doc: (on phone) Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?
Marty: Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.
Doc: Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?
Marty: Um, yeah, I'm on my way.
(Twin Pines Mall)
(Marty shows up but doesn't see Doc. He walks over to Doc's dog, Einstein.)
Marty: Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc?
(Suddenly the back of an 18-wheeler opens up and Doc drives slowly out in the Delorean.)
Doc: Marty, you made it.
Marty: Yeah.
Doc: Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life.
Marty: Um, well it's a Delorean, right?
Doc: Bare with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.
Marty: Doc, is that a de…
Doc: Never mind that now, never mind that now.
Marty: Alright, I'm ready.
Doc: Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. (gestures for Einstein to get into the car) C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it.
Marty: Whoa, whoa, okay.
Doc: Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch.
Marty: Right check, Doc.
Doc: Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.
Marty: You have this thing hooked up to the car?
(The doc picks up a remote control device.)
Doc: Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. (The car heads straight for them picking up speed all the while. It hits 88 MPH just as it reaches them and it disappears. Leaving behind fire track marks on the pavement.) Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.
Marty: Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein.
Doc: Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact.
Marty: Where the hell are they.
Doc: The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine.
Marty: Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of the Delorean? Doc: The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out! (he shoves Marty out of the way just as the car reappears. It's covered in ice.)
Marty: What, what is it hot?
Doc: It's cold, damn cold. (Doc opens the car door with his foot.) Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking.
Marty: He's alright.
Doc: He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. (leans into the car and points out the time circuit) First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tells you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You input the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.
Marty: What, I don't get what happened.
Doc: That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porcelain was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. (motions to the flux capacitor.)This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.
Marty: The flux capacitor.
Doc: It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.
Marty: This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?
Doc: Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.
Marty: Uh, plutonium, (lowers the camera) wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?
Doc: Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. (Marty picks the camera up again) No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.
Marty: Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off?
Doc: Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts.
Marty: Jesus.
Doc: Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload.
(A few minutes later both Doc and Marty are fully clothed in radiation suits. Doc injects a rod of plutonium into the Delorean, then removes his helmet.)
Doc: Safe now, everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. (goes to climb in the Delorean) Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics.
Marty: The future, it's where you're going?
Doc: That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series.
Marty: Uh, Doc.
Doc: Huh?
Marty: Uh, look me up when you get there.
Doc: Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of? I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back? One pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. (Einstein begins to whine) What is it Einy? (Spots the Libyans in their van) Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.
Marty: Who, who?
Doc: Who do you think, (points) the Libyans.
Marty: Holy shit.
Doc: Unroll their fire.
Marty: Doc, wait.
(The Libyans corner Doc and shoot him.)
Marty: No!! Bastards!! (They go after him and he jumps in the Delorean and takes off.)
Libyan: Go. Go. (they follow)
Marty: C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. (floors the gas, and as soon as the car reaches 88 MPH he is sent back to 1955.)
Marty: Ahh. Ahh.
(Hill Valley Outskirts - 1955)
(Marty crashes into Old Man Peabody's Barn. The Peabody's wake up and rush out to the barn.)
Mother: Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa?
Father: Looks like a airplane, without wings.
Son: That ain't no airplane, look.
(Holds up his alien comic, which shows an alien craft that looks a lot like the Delorean. They all hold their breath as the door opens and Marty gets out. His radiation hood is over his face, and they think he's an alien.)
Mother & Father: Ahh.
Father: Children. (they high tale it out of the barn.)
Marty: Listen, woah. (he trips but gets back up.) Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.
(Marty opens the barn door.)
Son: It's already mutated intro human form, shoot it.
Father: Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. (Marty ducks and scrambles back into the Delorean. He takes off running over a pine on the way.) My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.
(Road)
(Marty spots a sign for the neighborhood that he lives in. It's just about to be built.)
Marty: Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. (stops a car that's driving by) Woah, hey, listen, you gotta help me.
Woman: Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.
(They quickly drive off.)
Marty: Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.
(Hill Valley)
(Marty wanders around and spots another Election Van driving around.)
Election Van: Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...
(A man throws a newspaper away and Marty picks it up and sees the date as November 5th, 1955.)
Marty: This has gotta be a dream.
(He spots a coffee shop and goes in.)
(Coffee Shop)
Lou: Hey kid, what you do, jump ship?
Marty: What?
Lou: What's with the life preserver?
(Marty looks down at his jacket vest.)
Marty: I just wanna use the phone.
Lou: Yeah, it's in the back.
Marty: (goes and looks through the white pages in the phone book) Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. (He tries calling but there's no answer. So he goes over to the bar.) Do you know where 1640 Riverside…
Lou: Are you gonna order something, kid?
Marty: Yeah, gimme a Tab.
Lou: Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something.
Marty: Right, gimme a Pepsi free.
Lou: You wanna a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.
Marty: Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay?
Lou: Without any sugar.
(He gives Marty a cup of coffee and takes the money. Suddenly a younger Biff Tannen walks in.)
Biff: Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing.
(Marty turns, thinking they're talking to him.)
Marty: Biff.
(Biff ignores Marty and continues talking to the guy next to him.)
Biff: Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug.
(Marty looks over and there sits his father.)
George: Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing?
Biff: Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly?
George: Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday…
Biff: Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you?
George: Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.
Biff: Uh, no, no, no, no. (Notices that Marty is watching them.) What are you looking at, butt-head?
Guy 1: Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown.
Biff: Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?
George: Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.
Biff: Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly.
George: Okay.
Biff: I don't wanna see you in here again.
George: Yeah, alright, bye-bye. (goes back to eating his cereal, but sees Marty still watching him.) What?
Marty: You're George McFly.
George: Yeah, who are you?
Goldie: Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?
George: Well, they're bigger than me.
Goldie: Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?
Lou: Watch it, Goldie.
Goldie: No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.
Marty: That's right, he's gonna be mayor.
Goldie: Yeah, I'm…mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor.
Lou: A colored mayor, that'll be the day.
Goldie: You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town.
Lou: Good, you could start by sweeping the floor.
Goldie: Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.
(Marty smiles at that, and turns back to talk to George, but he's gone. He looks outside and sees George riding off on his bike, and he runs outside.)
Marty: Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike.
(Street)
(Marty spots his dad's bike leaning up against a tree, and looks up to see his father in the tree looking through a pair of binoculars. He looks to see what his father is looking at and sees a half-undressed girl through a bedroom window.)
Marty: He's a peeping tom. (George falls out of the tree and is about to be hit by an oncoming car.) Dad! (Marty shoves him out of the way and gets hit by the car himself.)
Sam: (to George) Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? (George grabs his bike and rides off.) Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house.
(Bedroom)
(Marty jerks awake. He's in a bed in a darkened room. He hears someone moving around.)
Marty: Mom, is that you?
Lorraine: There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.
Marty: I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible.
Lorraine: Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955.
Marty: 1955? (he jerks up in bed just as Loraine turns on the light.) You're my mo…you're my mo….
Lorraine: My name's Lorraine. Lorraine Baines.
(She sits down on the opposite bed.)
Marty: Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin.
Lorraine: Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head.
Marty: Ah, where're my pants?
Lorraine: (points) Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.
Marty: Calvin. Why do you keep calling me Calvin?
Lorraine: Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?
Marty: Actually, people call me Marty.
Lorraine: Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. (she gets up and goes to sit next to him) Do you mind if I sit here?
Marty: No, fine, no , good, fine, good.
Lorraine: That's a big bruise you have there.
Marty: Ah. (he backs away from her touch and falls off the bed.)
(Lorraine's mother calls out from downstairs.)
Stella: Loraine, are you up there?
Lorraine: God, it's my mother. Put your pants back on.
(She throws his pants to him, and he catches them dropping the blanket in the process. She grins at him before ducking out of the room.)
(Downstairs)
(A few minutes later Marty is walking down the stairs with Lorraine and her mother.)
Stella: So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?
Marty: Excuse me.
Stella: Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver.
Marty: Uh, coast guard.
Stella: Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god.
Sam: What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age.
Stella: Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.
(Marty leans down to talk to Joey.)
Marty: So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.
Stella: Yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.
Marty: Well, uh, listen, uh, I really…
Lorraine: (jerks Marty down into the chair next to her.) Sit here, Marty.
Stella: Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner.
(Sam pulls the TV into the doorway of the dining room.)
Sam: Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.
Lorraine: Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television?
Marty: Well yeah, you know we have two of them.
Milton: Wow, you must be rich.
Stella: Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets.
Marty: Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space.
Milton: What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.
Marty: Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.
Milton: What's a rerun?
Marty: You'll find out.
Stella: You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?
Marty: (glances at Lorraine) Yeah, I think maybe you do.
Stella: Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you.
Marty: You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home.
Stella: Oh.
Marty: Yet.
Stella: Oh.
Marty: Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is?
Sam: It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple.
Marty: A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive.
Sam: Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?
Lorraine: Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughtta spend the night? After all, Dad almost killed him with the car.
Stella: That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility.
Marty: Well gee, I don't know.
Lorraine: And he could sleep in my room. (she grabs Marty's thigh under the table.)
Marty: (jumps up) I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. (leaves)
Stella: He's a very strange young man.
Sam: He's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.
(Doc's House)
(Instead of living in his small workshop, Doc now lives in a very large house. Marty knocks on the door. As he turns his back, waiting for Doc to answer the door, the door opens a crack and Doc peaks out. When Marty turns Doc slams the door shut.)
Marty: Doc?
(Doc opens the door fully now. He's got some strange contraption on his head. He pulls Marty into the living room.)
Doc: Don't say a word.
Marty: Doc.
Doc: I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything, anything about you.
Marty: Listen, Doc.
Doc: Quiet.
Marty: Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty.
Doc: Don't tell me anything.
(Doc puts a suction cup on Marty's forehead.)
Marty: Doc, you gotta help…
Doc: Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance?
Marty: Yeah, exactly.
Doc: Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?
Marty: No.
Doc: Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary?
Marty: (he pulls the suction cup off his forehead) Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.
Doc: (grabs Marty's shoulders) My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. (takes off the contraption.)
Marty: Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works.
Doc: Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine.
Marty: Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984.
(Doc takes the picture with a pair of tongs and looks at it.)
Doc: Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair.
(He tosses the photo back at Marty.)
Marty: I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me.
Doc: So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985?
Marty: Ronald Reagan.
Doc: Ronald Reagan? The actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? (he grabs some papers and runs outside towards his workshop) I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady.
Marty: Whoa, wait, Doc.
Doc: And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury.
Marty: Look, you gotta listen to me.
Doc: I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. (he slams the workshop door in Marty's face.)
Marty: No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. You were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.
(Doc swings the door open and looks at Marty with astonishment.)
(Workshop)
(Marty is rewinding the video he shot of the time travel test with 1985 Doc.)
Marty: Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it.
Doc: After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. (He holds up a crude drawing of the flux capacitor.)
Marty: Flux capacitor.
Doc: It works, (laughs), it works. I finally invent something that works.
Marty: Bet your ass it works.
Doc: Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.
Marty: Okay Doc, this is it.
(1985 Doc pops up on the screen.)
1985 Doc: Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind…
Doc: Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man.
1985 Doc: Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of…
Doc: Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing?
Marty: Well, this is a radiation suit.
Doc: Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.
Marty: whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc.
1985 Doc: No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity…
Doc: What did I just say?
(Marty rewinds the tape and plays it again.)
1985 Doc: No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.
Doc: One point twenty-one gigawatts! One point twenty-one gigawatts! Great Scott. (runs out of the workshop.)
Marty: (calling after him) What the hell is a gigawatt?
(House)
(Doc is now sitting in an armchair.)
Doc: How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. (he picks up a photo and starts talking to it.) Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't.
(Marty comes in.)
Marty: Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium.
Doc: I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.
Marty: Whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.
Doc: Is she pretty?
Marty: Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. (shows Doc what Jennifer wrote on the back of the Clock Tower flier.) That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.
Doc: Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.
Marty: What did you say?
Doc: A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike.
Marty: We do now.
(He holds out the flier and Doc takes it and reads it.)
Doc: This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future.
Marty: Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around.
Doc: Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?
Marty: Yeah, sure, okay.
Doc: Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?
Marty: (guiltily) Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents.
Doc: Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. (Marty gives it to him) Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.
Marty: His head's gone, it's like it's been erased.
Doc: Erased from existence.
(School)
(Marty and Doc walk up to the school.)
Marty: Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.
Doc: Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next.
Marty: This sounds pretty heavy.
Doc: Weight has nothing to do with it.
(Hallway)
Doc: Which one's your pop?
Marty: That's him.
(Marty points out George who's walking down the hall. He has a 'kick me' sign on his back and guys keep going by and kicking him in the butt.)
George: Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature.
Doc: Maybe you were adopted.
George: Okay, real mature guys. (He drops his books.) Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books?
Strickland: McFly.
Marty: That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?
Strickland: Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life?
George: No.
Doc: What did your mother ever see in that kid?
Marty: I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car…(pause)…hit me with the car.
Doc: That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid.
(Marty walks over to George.)
Marty: Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.
George: Yeah.
Marty: Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. (he takes George over to where Lorraine is at her locker.) Lorraine.
Lorraine: (surprised) Calvin.
Marty: I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.
George: (tries to make a move on her) Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you.
Lorraine: (to Marty) How's your head?
Marty: Well uh, good, fine.
Lorraine: Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? (the bell rings) I'm sorry I have to go. (to her friends as she passes by Doc) Isn't he a dream boat?
Marty: Doc, she didn't even look at him.
Doc: This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father.
Marty: Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me?
Doc: Precisely.
Marty: Whoa, this is heavy.
Doc: There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?
Marty: What?
Doc: The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social…
Marty: What, well you mean like a date?
Doc: Right.
Marty: What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties?
Doc: Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are there common interests? What do they like to do together?
Marty: Nothing.
Doc: Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.
Marty: Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time.
Doc: Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance.
(Lunchroom)
(Marty sits down across from George at a table. George is writing in a notebook.)
Marty: George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Loraine. What are you writing?
George: Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.
Marty: Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. (he reaches for the notebook, but George jerks it back.)
George: Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories.
Marty: Why not?
George: Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand.
Marty: (thinks about his band audition) Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Loraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance.
George: Really.
Marty: Oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her.
George: What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What is she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.
Marty: Who?
George: (points over at Lorraine's table.) Biff.
(Biff is sitting at Lorraine's table, and he's trying to grope her.)
Biff: C'mon, c'mon.
Lorraine: Leave me alone.
Biff: You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you.
Lorraine: (she slaps him) Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl.
Biff: Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet.
Lorraine: Get your meat hooks off of me.
Marty: You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, (Biff stands up and he's at least a foot taller than Marty) uh please.
Biff: So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a… (spots Strickland over Marty's shoulder) since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here.
(Street)
(George is walking home and Marty catches up to him.)
Marty: George.
George: Why do you keep following me around?
Marty: Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.
George: But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.
Marty: Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break.
George: Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.
(He runs inside his house and shuts the door behind him.)
Marty: (to himself) Science Fiction Theater.
(George's Room - Night)
(Marty arrives in his radiation suit and helmet. He places headphones on George's head as he sleeps, and then pops a Van Halen tape into the walkman and presses play. George wakes up with a jerk, holding his head.)
George: Who are you?
(Marty presses play again and George falls silent.)
Marty: Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan.
(George turns and looks at the cover of a book that's by his head, and the alien looks almost exactly like Marty does in his radiation suit.)
(Gas Station - Day)
(Marty is trying to open up a bottle of Coke. George runs up. He's very disheveled.)
George: Marty. Marty. Marty.
Marty: Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day?
George: I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Loraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.
Marty: Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the café. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George?
(George takes the bottle of Coke and opens it for Marty. They begin walking over to the Café.)
George: Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain.
Marty: Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay?
George: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Marty: Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her.
George: Okay, but I don't know what to say.
Marty: Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind.
George: Nothing's coming to my mind.
Marty: Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born.
George: What, what?
Marty: Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, (George takes out a pad of paper and begins to write this all down.)…tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?
George: I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.
Marty: Yeah okay.
George: Oh.
Marty: Let's go.
George: Oh.
(Coffee Shop)
(They enter the coffee shop.)
Marty: Will you take care of that?
George: Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. (he takes a drink and then goes over to Lorraine's table.) Lorraine, my density has popped me to you.
Lorraine: What?
George: Oh, what I meant to day was…
Lorraine: Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?
George: Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and you're my density. I mean, I'm your destiny.
Lorraine: Oh.
(Biff and his friends walk in.)
Biff: Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you?
George: Well, Biff.
Biff: Alright, punk, now…
Marty: Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?
(Marty runs out.)
Lorraine: That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream.
(Outside)
(Marty runs over to a kid who's on a scooter.)
Marty: Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Kid: Hey.
Marty: I'll get it back to you, alright?
(Marty breaks off the top part of the scooter, leaving a 1955 version of a skateboard. He takes off on it.)
Kid: You broke it. Wow, look at him go.
Biff: Let's get him.
Girl: What's that thing he's on?
Boy: It's a board with wheels.
Lorraine: He's an absolute dream.
(Biff and his friends hop into Biff's car and take off after Marty. They manage to catch up to him. He's on his board right in front of their car. He holds on to the hood since he can't get away.)
Marty: Ah. Whoa.
(Biff spots a manure truck and heads straight for it.)
Biff: I'm gonna ram him.
(Marty manages to get out of the way, and Biff heads straight for the manure truck.)
Biff & his friends: Shit.
(They hit the truck and it dumps a load of manure into the car and onto them. Marty walks over to the kid he borrowed the 'skateboard' from and gives it back to him.)
Marty: Thanks a lot, kid.
Biff: I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
(Everyone is standing outside of the Coffee Shop talking about what just happened.)
Girlfriend #1: Where does he come from?
Girlfriend #2: Yeah, where does he live?
Lorraine: I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
(Doc's Workshop)
(Doc is watching the video of 1985 Doc. Marty walks in and sees him.)
1985 Doc: My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.
Marty: Doc.
Doc: Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit.
Marty: Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape.
Doc: Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.
Marty: You don't understand.
Doc: I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.
Marty: You're…you're right.
Doc: Let me show you my plan for sending you home. (Walks over to a very nice model of the town of Hill Valley.) Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.
Marty: Its good.
Doc: Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the Clock Tower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at 10:04 PM lightning will strike the Clock Tower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. (Marty releases the car. It races down the main street in the model. When it hits the 'wire' Doc has hooked up it accelerates. It flies off the table in flames and lands in a pile of rags, setting them on fire.) Huhh. (Doc quickly races to put the fire out.)
Marty: You instill me with a lot of confidence, Doc.
Doc: Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your Pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out?
Marty: Uh, I think so.
Doc: What did she say?
(There's a knock at the door before Marty can answer. Doc goes to see who it is.)
Doc: It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.
(They cover the Delorean with a sheet and Doc opens the door. Lorraine walks in a little nervously until she spots Marty.)
Lorraine: Hi, Marty.
Marty: Uh, Loraine. How did you know I was here?
Lorraine: I followed you.
Marty: Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.
Lorraine: Hi.
Marty: Hello.
Lorraine: Marty, this may seem a little forward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday.
Marty: Uh, you mean nobody's asked you?
Lorraine: No, not yet.
Marty: What about George?
Lorraine: George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you?
Marty: Yeah.
(Saturday Morning)
(George's Backyard)
(George is hanging up laundry.)
George: I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.
Marty: Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.
George: Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life.
Marty: Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.
George: I'm gonna be at the dance.
Marty: Right, and where am I gonna be?
George: You're gonna be in the car with her.
Marty: Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me.
George: Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Marty: Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.
George: Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her…
Marty: No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say…(pause while he waits for George to say something) …your line, George.
George: Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. (pause) Do you really think I oughta swear?
Marty: Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Loraine live happily ever after.
George: Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.
Marty: George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self-confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.
(Saturday Night)
(Main Street)
(Doc and Marty are setting up the Delorean for the trip back to 1985.)
Radio: This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.
Doc: Are you sure about this storm?
Marty: When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.
Doc: You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.
Marty: I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future…
Doc: No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.
(Coffee Shop)
(Marty is writing Doc a letter.)
Marty: Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.
(Main Street)
Cop: Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?
Doc: Oh, just a little weather experiment.
Cop: What you got under here?
Doc: Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.
Cop: You got a permit for that?
Doc: Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it.
(While Doc isn't looking Marty slips the letter into the pocket of his jacket, then he leaves to pick up Lorraine.)
(School Parking Lot)
(Marty and Lorraine arrive at the dance. Marty's very nervous.)
Marty: Do you mind if we park for a while?
Lorraine: That's a great idea. I'd love to park.
Marty: Huh?
Lorraine: Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before.
Marty: (shocked) What?
Lorraine: (takes her jacket off, and her dress shows a bit of cleavage) Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong?
Marty: (looks away) No no. (looks back to see Lorraine take a drink of alcohol from a flask she had in her purse.) Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?
Lorraine: I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.
Marty: Yeah well, you shouldn't drink.
Lorraine: Why not?
Marty: Because, you might regret it later in life.
Lorraine: Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.
(He goes to take a drink but spits it out when she lights a cigarette.)
Marty: Jesus, you smoke too?
Lorraine: Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.
(The Dance)
(George is off to the side dancing by himself.)
Marvin Barry: We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where.
(The Parking Lot)
Lorraine: Marty, why are you so nervous?
Marty: Loraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?
Lorraine: Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date.
Marty: Ah well, sort of.
Lorraine: I think I know exactly what you mean.
Marty: You do?
Lorraine: You know what I do in those situations?
Marty: What?
Lorraine: I don't worry. (she leans over and kisses him, then leans back with a weird look on her face.) This is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?
Marty: Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense.
Lorraine: Someone's coming.
(Marty thinks it's George, but is surprised when the car door is jerked open and Biff drags him out of the car.)
Biff: You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.
Lorraine: Let him go, Biff, you're drunk.
Biff: Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me.
Lorraine: Stop it.
Biff: C'mon.
Lorraine: Stop it.
Biff: C'mon.
Marty: Leave her alone, you bastard.
Biff: You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show.
(The guys drag Marty off.)
(Back of the Auditorium)
(Biff's guys run up and dump Marty in the trunk of a car.)
Guy 1: Let's put him in there.
Guy 2: Yeah.
Guy 1: That's for messing up my hair.
(They slam the trunk shut and one of the band members gets out of the car.)
Starlighter: What the hell you doing to my car?
Guy 2: Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you.
Marvin Barry: Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood.
Guy 1: Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? (they run off)
Marty: (in the trunk) C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo.
Marvin Barry: Lorenzo, where're you keys?
Marty: The keys are in the trunk.
Marvin Barry: Say that again.
Marty: I said the keys are in here.
(Parking Lot)
(George runs out to the car where Loraine is and jerks the car door open.)
George: Hey you, get your damn hands off…(sees that it's BifF) oh.
Biff: I think you got the wrong car, McFly.
Lorraine: George, help me, please.
Biff: Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.
George: No, Biff, you leave her alone.
Biff: Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it.
(Biff grabs George's arm and twists it.)
Lorraine: Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop.
(Back of the Auditorium)
Marvin Barry: Give me a hand, Lorenzo. (Pops the trunk open) Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand.
(Marty quickly climbs out.)
Marty: Who's are these? (tosses the keys to one of the guys)
Starlighter: Thanks, thanks a lot.
(Parking Lot)
Lorraine: You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go.
(Biff shoves her down, and George watches in horror. George then doubles up his fist when Biff isn't looking and when Biff looks back George decks him. Biff falls down and is out cold. George can't believe what he did. Then he holds out a hand to Loraine.)
George: Are you okay?
(Lorraine takes his hand and he helps her up. They walk off into the dance.)
Girlfriend: Who is that guy.
Boyfriend: That's George McFly.
Girlfriend: That's George McFly?
Marty: Excuse me.
(Main Street)
(The wind picks up and thunder rolls.)
Doc: The storm.
(Back of the Auditorium)
(The guys from the band are still outside trying to figure out what to do since Marvin's hand is busted up.)
Marty: Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.
Starlighter: Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him.
Marty: Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.
Marvin Barry: Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.
(The Dance)
(Marty is up on stage with the Band playing the guitar. They're playing 'Earth Angel'.)
Marvin Barry: This is for all you lovers out there.
Lorraine: George, aren't you gonna kiss me?
George: I, I don't know.
(This kid cuts in on George and Loraine. Marty begins to disappear.)
Kid: Scram, McFly.
Starlighter: (to Marty) Hey boy, are you alright?
Marty: I can't play.
Lorraine: George. George.
Marty: George.
George: (to kid) Excuse me. (he shoves the kid out of the way and kisses Loraine.)
(Marty comes back and both his brother and sister show up in the picture again.)
Marvin Barry: Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one.
Marty: Uh, well, I gotta go.
Marvin Barry: C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks.
Marty: Something that really cooks. (to audience) Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. (to band) Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. (they begin to play 'Johnny Be Good')
Boyfriend: Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going.
Girlfriend: George you ever think of running for class president?
(Marvin goes backstage and makes a phone call.)
Marvin Barry: (into phone) John, John, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Barry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this.
(Marty finishes the song with a wild guitar solo. Everyone stops dancing and stares at him.)
Marty: I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.
(Side Door)
Marty: Lorraine.
Lorraine: Marty, that was very interesting music.
Marty: Uh, yeah.
Lorraine: I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.
Marty: Great good, good, Loraine, I had a feeling about you two.
Lorraine: I have a feeling too.
Marty: Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.
Lorraine: Marty, will we ever see you again?
Marty: I guarantee it.
George: Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advise, I'll never forget it.
Marty: Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids (Lorraine blushes) and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.
George: Okay.
(Marty leaves)
Lorraine: Marty, such a nice name.
(Main Street)
Doc: Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. (Marty shows up.) You're late, do you have no concept of time?
Marty: Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked.
Doc: What?
Marty: He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life.
Doc: Never?
Marty: No, why, what's a matter?
Doc: Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.
Marty: Right.
Doc: Well, I guess that's everything.
Marty: Thanks.
Doc: Thank you. In about thirty years.
Marty: I hope so.
Doc: Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine.
Marty: Right.
(Doc puts his hands in his pockets. He feels the letter and pulls it out. He looks at it then holds it out to Marty.)
Doc: What's the meaning of this.
Marty: You'll find out in thirty years.
Doc: It's about the future, isn't it?
Marty: Wait a minute.
Doc: It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous.
Marty: Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it.
Doc: No, I refuse to except the responsibility.
(Doc rips up the letter.)
Marty: In that case, I'll tell you strait out.
(But before Marty can tell Doc what's going to happen in the future lightening strikes a tree and a limb falls down and unplugs the cable that runs from the clock tower to the cable in the middle of the street.)
Doc: Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you.
Marty: Right, I got it.
Doc: Ahh.
Marty: Doc.
(Doc climbs up to the top of the Clock Tower so they can fix the cable.)
Doc: C'mon, c'mon let's go.
Marty: (ties the rope to the cable) Alright, take it up, go. Doc.
(Doc lifts the cable up. Since Doc is at the top of the Clock Tower he can't hear what Marty is saying.)
Doc: Huh?
Marty: I have to tell you about the future.
Doc: Huh?
Marty: I have to tell you about the future.
(Doc almost falls off the Clock Tower.)
Doc: Ahh.
Marty: On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc.
Doc: Ohh, no.
Marty: No, Doc.
Doc: Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry.
Marty: Yeah.
(Down the Street)
(Marty reaches the white line, and stops the car. He hops out and attaches the hook to the back of the car and then climbs back into the Delorean.)
Marty: Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. (the car dies) No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. (the car starts. The alarm goes off and Marty floors it.)
(Main Street)
(Doc just manages to get the cables hooked up correctly as the Delorean comes rushing down the street. Just as he gets the cables together the lightening strikes and passes through the cable and he's thrown back.)
Doc: Ahh.
(In the Delorean)
Marty: Doc.
(Main Street)
(Marty hits 88 MPH and disappears into the future.)
Doc: Yeah!!
(Main Street - 1985)
Red: Crazy drunk drivers.
Marty: Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. (the car has died again) No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans.
(Marty takes off running and reaches the Mall just as his other self sees Doc get shot.)
Marty #1: No, bastards.
(The other Marty jumps into the Delorean and takes off.)
Libyan: Go.
(Our Marty watches as the Delorean hits 88 MPH and takes off into the past. He runs over to Doc who is laying, unmoving, on the ground.)
Marty: Doc, Doc. Oh, no. (The Doc sits up behind him. Marty turns and sees that Doc is alive.) You're alive. (Doc pulls down zipper on his jump suit to reveal a bullet proof vest.) Bullet proof vest? How did you know? (Doc pulls out the letter that has been taped back together.) I never got a chance to tell you. What about all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum?
Doc: Well, I figured, what the hell.
(Marty's House)
(Doc has dropped Marty off.)
Marty: About how far ahead are you going?
Doc: About 30 years, it's a nice round number.
Marty: Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47.
Doc: I will.
Marty: Take care.
Doc: You too.
Marty: Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.
Doc: You bet.
(Doc drives off and Marty heads inside his house.)
(The Next Day)
(Marty wakes up in his bed.)
Marty: What a nightmare.
(He gets up and walks into the living room and does a double take. Everything has completely changed. Everything is now upscale. Linda and David are both dressed for work. They're wearing suits.)
Linda: Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight.
David: Linda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.
Linda: Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?
David: I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.
Marty: What the hell is this?
Linda: Breakfast.
David: What did you sleep in your clothes again last night.
Marty: Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave.
David: Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?
Marty: Yeah.
(Lorraine and George walk in the back door. Lorraine is skinny and they both look great.)
Lorraine: I think we need a rematch.
George: Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating?
Lorraine: No.
George: Hello.
Lorraine: Good morning.
Marty: Mom, Dad. (he falls over)
Lorraine: Marty, are you alright?
George: Did you hurt your head?
(Marty gets back up.)
Marty: You guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.
Lorraine: Why thank you, Marty. (George walks around her and as he does he pats her on the bottom.) George. Good morning, sleepyhead. Good morning, Dave, Linda.
David: Good morning, Mom.
Linda: Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called.
Lorraine: Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?
Marty: What, what, ma?
Lorraine: Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks.
Marty: Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked.
George: Wrecked?
David: Wrecked? When did this happen?
George: Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.
David: Why am I always the last one to know about these things?
(George goes over and opens the front door to reveal Biff waxing the undamaged car.)
George: See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.
Biff: Just finishing up the second coat now.
George: Now Biff, don't con me.
Biff: I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat.
George: That Biff, what a character. (goes back inside) Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him…
Loraine: We never would have fallen in love.
George: That's right.
(Suddenly Biff runs in carrying a box.)
Biff: Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.
Loraine: Ah, honey, your first novel.
George: Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.
Biff: Oh, oh Marty, here's you keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.
Marty: Keys?
(Garage)
(Marty walks out to the garage. He finds a brand new black four by four. Just like the one he was admiring a few days ago. Jennifer walks up.)
Jennifer: How about a ride, Mister?
Marty: Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you.
Jennifer: Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week.
Marty: I haven't.
Jennifer: You okay, is everything alright?
Marty: Aw yeah, everything is great.
(Suddenly there is a flash of light and Doc pulls into the driveway in the Delorean. He hops out and runs over to Marty.)
Doc: Marty you gotta come back with me.
Marty: Where?
Doc: Back to the future.
(Doc goes over to the garbage can and starts digging through it.)
Marty: Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?
(Doc holds up some trash.)
Doc: I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car.
(He begins dumping the trash into Mr. Fusion.)
Marty: No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin.
Doc: Well, bring her along. This concerns her too.
Marty: Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?
Doc: No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.
(They all climb into the car. And Doc backs up into the street.)
Marty: Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88.
Doc: Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.

Silence fills my room
But in a memory
I hear you calling me
Close my eyes
And I'm there with you
Like it was yesterday
But then it fades away

Take me back
Turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
(Warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again

If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers
Not apart
If wishes came true

Now you're gone
And I'm on my own
Feeling lost inside since you said goodbye
In my dreams
I still feel your touch
Lying next to me
Feeling ecstasy

Take me back
Turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
(Warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again

If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers
Not apart
If wishes came true

I love you madly
I need you badly
Give our love one more chance

If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers
Not apart

153,153,Breakdown,"In the beginning, your love was true
And I gave to you
My inner emotions, yo
I was a slave to you
If time can heal all wounds
Then I feel one
The path of the broken heart is what we'll run

You treat me fine
So you say
If I walk away
I'm justified
Cause I cried each and every day

We used to talk
Hold hands for a long walk
Stretch on the beach for tans on the broad cold
Call me up late at night for a small kiss
The movies, the mall
It ain't easy being dissed
You love me
But time can change in a big way


The deck is strong but the hull, it'll give way
You used to give the best to me, come next to me
Take some for self and give all the rest to me
But that's dwindled, I sit by the window
Hope for the rain to stop and get rekindled
Love to us at first reinforced it
But now when I call you sound like you lost it
If this is true then I say this to you
Tell me what to do, do...

Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our love affair is crumbling down
Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our true love is finally coming to its end

I get to the point sometimes when I think back
You don't really love me, nah
I shouldn't think that
Friends they rif and say that you'll diss me
A week's gone by
And you don't even miss me

So if I tell you what I feel
You gotta tell me if it's real
You're breaking down my heart
And tearing me apart
And I appeal for you to stop
And notice me and get very close to me

You used to be my one and only
Now you're a ghost to me
Although my love will never stop
I think we're headed for a drop

You used to take me out a lot
Buy me flowers in a pot
Twenty five forget-me-nots going to the malt shop
Sharing everything we got
Tell me why you changed the plot
You don't even come
Or put a coin in the slot

Like a fish that is baiting
I'm tired of waiting
You said you would meet me at six
Now it's eight and I'm tired of crying
Hurt intensifying
The romance's shy
I'm trying and sighing and dying

Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our love affair is crumbling down
Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our true love is finally coming to its end

Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our love affair is crumbling down
Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our true love is finally coming to its end

(Our love is breaking down)
You used to be so sweet to me
(Our love is breaking down)
We used to be so happy
(Our love is breaking down)
A better love could not be found
(Our love is breaking down)
But now our love is breaking down

The love I found you put me down
You lost me
You cost me
A whole bunch of time
Now you boss me around

It's rainy, it's sunny
My eyeballs are runny
I'm just like your money
You break me and honey
You come back to score like a ship with a shore
And therefore I can't take it no more

Together
Tougher than leather
Through any kind of weather
And I never thought that it would sever
Or come to this, I try to miss
But I don't see you enough
Or let alone get a kiss
I'd like to grace the place you ace hang out or embrace

So I could suck your face
And get a taste
Sometimes I state 'em
And often hate 'em
But our love has come to this an ultimatun

I'm not your superwoman
Just assuming
That you will come home and caress me
I'm human, sweetheart

I'm tender up and surrender
I don't wanna go out like this
But I'm the best in this gender
My love is forsaken
My heartbeat is shaken
I'm not gonna make it
And no, I can't fake it

So love me or leave me
But don't disbelieve me
Accept me, reject me
But don't disrespect me
So get it together
So we can exist and reminisce bliss, bliss

by Mr. Yorick

Volume 1

They order, said I, this matter better in France. - You have been in France? said my gentleman, turning quick upon me, with the most civil triumph in the world. - Strange! quoth I, debating the matter with myself, That one and twenty miles sailing, for ’tis absolutely no further from Dover to Calais, should give a man these rights: - I’ll look into them: so, giving up the argument, - I went straight to my lodgings, put up half a dozen shirts and a black pair of silk breeches, - “the coat I have on,” said I, looking at the sleeve, “will do;” - took a place in the Dover stage; and the packet sailing at nine the next morning, - by three I had got sat down to my dinner upon a fricaseed chicken, so incontestably in France, that had I died that night of an indigestion, the whole world could not have suspended the effects of the droits d’aubaine; - my shirts, and black pair of silk breeches, - portmanteau and all, must have gone to the King of France; - even the little picture which I have so long worn, and so often have told thee, Eliza, I would carry with me into my grave, would have been torn from my neck! - Ungenerous! to seize upon the wreck of an unwary passenger, whom your subjects had beckoned to their coast! - By heaven!  Sire, it is not well done; and much does it grieve me, ’tis the monarch of a people so civilized and courteous, and so renowned for sentiment and fine feelings, that I have to reason with! -

But I have scarce set a foot in your dominions. -


CALAIS.


When I had fished my dinner, and drank the King of France’s health, to satisfy my mind that I bore him no spleen, but, on the contrary, high honour for the humanity of his temper, - I rose up an inch taller for the accommodation.

- No - said I - the Bourbon is by no means a cruel race: they may be misled, like other people; but there is a mildness in their blood.  As I acknowledged this, I felt a suffusion of a finer kind upon my cheek - more warm and friendly to man, than what Burgundy (at least of two livres a bottle, which was such as I had been drinking) could have produced.

- Just God! said I, kicking my portmanteau aside, what is there in this world’s goods which should sharpen our spirits, and make so many kind-hearted brethren of us fall out so cruelly as we do by the way?

When man is at peace with man, how much lighter than a feather is the heaviest of metals in his hand! he pulls out his purse, and holding it airily and uncompressed, looks round him, as if he sought for an object to share it with. - In doing this, I felt every vessel in my frame dilate, - the arteries beat all cheerily together, and every power which sustained life, performed it with so little friction, that ’twould have confounded the most physical précieuse in France; with all her materialism, she could scarce have called me a machine. -

I’m confident, said I to myself, I should have overset her creed.

The accession of that idea carried nature, at that time, as high as she could go; - I was at peace with the world before, and this finish’d the treaty with myself. -

- Now, was I King of France, cried I - what a moment for an orphan to have begg’d his father’s portmanteau of me!


THE MONK.  CALAIS.


I had scarce uttered the words, when a poor monk of the order of St. Francis came into the room to beg something for a his convent.  No man cares to have his virtues the sport of contingencies - or one man may be generous, as another is puissant; - sed non quoad hanc - or be it as it may, - for there is no regular reasoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours; they may depend upon the same causes, for aught I know, which influence the tides themselves: ’twould oft be no discredit to us, to suppose it was so: I’m sure at least for myself, that in many a case I should be more highly satisfied, to have it said by the world, “I had had an affair with the moon, in which there was neither sin nor shame,” than have it pass altogether as my own act and deed, wherein there was so much of both.

- But, be this as it may, - the moment I cast my eyes upon him, I was predetermined not to give him a single sous; and, accordingly, I put my purse into my pocket - buttoned it - set myself a little more upon my centre, and advanced up gravely to him; there was something, I fear, forbidding in my look: I have his figure this moment before my eyes, and think there was that in it which deserved better.

The monk, as I judged by the break in his tonsure, a few scattered white hairs upon his temples, being all that remained of it, might be about seventy; - but from his eyes, and that sort of fire which was in them, which seemed more temper’d by courtesy than years, could be no more than sixty: - Truth might lie between - He was certainly sixty-five; and the general air of his countenance, notwithstanding something seem’d to have been planting-wrinkles in it before their time, agreed to the account.

It was one of those heads which Guido has often painted, - mild, pale - penetrating, free from all commonplace ideas of fat contented ignorance looking downwards upon the earth; - it look’d forwards; but look’d as if it look’d at something beyond this world. - How one of his order came by it, heaven above, who let it fall upon a monk’s shoulders best knows: but it would have suited a Bramin, and had I met it upon the plains of Indostan, I had reverenced it.

The rest of his outline may be given in a few strokes; one might put it into the hands of any one to design, for ’twas neither elegant nor otherwise, but as character and expression made it so: it was a thin, spare form, something above the common size, if it lost not the distinction by a bend forward in the figure, - but it was the attitude of Intreaty; and, as it now stands presented to my imagination, it gained more than it lost by it.

When he had entered the room three paces, he stood still; and laying his left hand upon his breast (a slender white staff with which he journey’d being in his right) - when I had got close up to him, he introduced himself with the little story of the wants of his convent, and the poverty of his order; - and did it with so simple a grace, - and such an air of deprecation was there in the whole cast of his look and figure, - I was bewitch’d not to have been struck with it.

- A better reason was, I had predetermined not to give him a single sous.


THE MONK.  CALAIS.


- ’Tis very true, said I, replying to a cast upwards with his eyes, with which he had concluded his address; - ’tis very true, - and heaven be their resource who have no other but the charity of the world, the stock of which, I fear, is no way sufficient for the many great claims which are hourly made upon it.

As I pronounced the words great claims, he gave a slight glance with his eye downwards upon the sleeve of his tunic: - I felt the full force of the appeal - I acknowledge it, said I: - a coarse habit, and that but once in three years with meagre diet, - are no great matters; and the true point of pity is, as they can be earn’d in the world with so little industry, that your order should wish to procure them by pressing upon a fund which is the property of the lame, the blind, the aged and the infirm; - the captive who lies down counting over and over again the days of his afflictions, languishes also for his share of it; and had you been of the order of mercy, instead of the order of St. Francis, poor as I am, continued I, pointing at my portmanteau, full cheerfully should it have been open’d to you, for the ransom of the unfortunate. - The monk made me a bow. - But of all others, resumed I, the unfortunate of our own country, surely, have the first rights; and I have left thousands in distress upon our own shore. - The monk gave a cordial wave with his head, - as much as to say, No doubt there is misery enough in every corner of the world, as well as within our convent - But we distinguish, said I, laying my hand upon the sleeve of his tunic, in return for his appeal - we distinguish, my good father! betwixt those who wish only to eat the bread of their own labour - and those who eat the bread of other people’s, and have no other plan in life, but to get through it in sloth and ignorance, for the love of God.

The poor Franciscan made no reply: a hectic of a moment pass’d across his cheek, but could not tarry - Nature seemed to have done with her resentments in him; - he showed none: - but letting his staff fall within his arms, he pressed both his hands with resignation upon his breast, and retired.


THE MONK.  CALAIS.


My heart smote me the moment he shut the door - Psha! said I, with an air of carelessness, three several times - but it would not do: every ungracious syllable I had utter’d crowded back into my imagination: I reflected, I had no right over the poor Franciscan, but to deny him; and that the punishment of that was enough to the disappointed, without the addition of unkind language. - I consider’d his gray hairs - his courteous figure seem’d to re-enter and gently ask me what injury he had done me? - and why I could use him thus? - I would have given twenty livres for an advocate. - I have behaved very ill, said I within myself; but I have only just set out upon my travels; and shall learn better manners as I get along.


THE DESOBLIGEANT.  CALAIS.


When a man is discontented with himself, it has one advantage however, that it puts him into an excellent frame of mind for making a bargain.  Now there being no travelling through France and Italy without a chaise, - and nature generally prompting us to the thing we are fittest for, I walk’d out into the coach-yard to buy or hire something of that kind to my purpose: an old désobligeant in the furthest corner of the court, hit my fancy at first sight, so I instantly got into it, and finding it in tolerable harmony with my feelings, I ordered the waiter to call Monsieur Dessein, the master of the hotel: - but Monsieur Dessein being gone to vespers, and not caring to face the Franciscan, whom I saw on the opposite side of the court, in conference with a lady just arrived at the inn, - I drew the taffeta curtain betwixt us, and being determined to write my journey, I took out my pen and ink and wrote the preface to it in the désobligeant.


PREFACE.  IN THE DESOBLIGEANT.


It must have been observed by many a peripatetic philosopher, That nature has set up by her own unquestionable authority certain boundaries and fences to circumscribe the discontent of man; she has effected her purpose in the quietest and easiest manner by laying him under almost insuperable obligations to work out his ease, and to sustain his sufferings at home.  It is there only that she has provided him with the most suitable objects to partake of his happiness, and bear a part of that burden which in all countries and ages has ever been too heavy for one pair of shoulders.  ’Tis true, we are endued with an imperfect power of spreading our happiness sometimes beyond her limits, but ’tis so ordered, that, from the want of languages, connections, and dependencies, and from the difference in education, customs, and habits, we lie under so many impediments in communicating our sensations out of our own sphere, as often amount to a total impossibility.

It will always follow from hence, that the balance of sentimental commerce is always against the expatriated adventurer: he must buy what he has little occasion for, at their own price; - his conversation will seldom be taken in exchange for theirs without a large discount, - and this, by the by, eternally driving him into the hands of more equitable brokers, for such conversation as he can find, it requires no great spirit of divination to guess at his party -

This brings me to my point; and naturally leads me (if the see-saw of this désobligeant will but let me get on) into the efficient as well as final causes of travelling -

Your idle people that leave their native country, and go abroad for some reason or reasons which may be derived from one of these general causes:-


Infirmity of body,
Imbecility of mind, or
Inevitable necessity.


The first two include all those who travel by land or by water, labouring with pride, curiosity, vanity, or spleen, subdivided and combined ad infinitum.

The third class includes the whole army of peregrine martyrs; more especially those travellers who set out upon their travels with the benefit of the clergy, either as delinquents travelling under the direction of governors recommended by the magistrate; - or young gentlemen transported by the cruelty of parents and guardians, and travelling under the direction of governors recommended by Oxford, Aberdeen, and Glasgow.

There is a fourth class, but their number is so small that they would not deserve a distinction, were it not necessary in a work of this nature to observe the greatest precision and nicety, to avoid a confusion of character.  And these men I speak of, are such as cross the seas and sojourn in a land of strangers, with a view of saving money for various reasons and upon various pretences: but as they might also save themselves and others a great deal of unnecessary trouble by saving their money at home, - and as their reasons for travelling are the least complex of any other species of emigrants, I shall distinguish these gentlemen by the name of


Simple Travellers.


Thus the whole circle of travellers may be reduced to the following heads:-


Idle Travellers,
Inquisitive Travellers,
Lying Travellers,
Proud Travellers,
Vain Travellers,
Splenetic Travellers.


Then follow:


The Travellers of Necessity,
The Delinquent and Felonious Traveller,
The Unfortunate and Innocent Traveller,
The Simple Traveller,


And last of all (if you please) The Sentimental Traveller, (meaning thereby myself) who have travell’d, and of which I am now sitting down to give an account, - as much out of Necessity, and the besoin de Voyager, as any one in the class.

I am well aware, at the same time, as both my travels and observations will be altogether of a different cast from any of my forerunners, that I might have insisted upon a whole nitch entirely to myself; - but I should break in upon the confines of the Vain Traveller, in wishing to draw attention towards me, till I have some better grounds for it than the mere Novelty of my Vehicle.

It is sufficient for my reader, if he has been a traveller himself, that with study and reflection hereupon he may be able to determine his own place and rank in the catalogue; - it will be one step towards knowing himself; as it is great odds but he retains some tincture and resemblance, of what he imbibed or carried out, to the present hour.

The man who first transplanted the grape of Burgundy to the Cape of Good Hope (observe he was a Dutchman) never dreamt of drinking the same wine at the Cape, that the same grape produced upon the French mountains, - he was too phlegmatic for that - but undoubtedly he expected to drink some sort of vinous liquor; but whether good or bad, or indifferent, - he knew enough of this world to know, that it did not depend upon his choice, but that what is generally called choice, was to decide his success: however, he hoped for the best; and in these hopes, by an intemperate confidence in the fortitude of his head, and the depth of his discretion, Mynheer might possibly oversee both in his new vineyard; and by discovering his nakedness, become a laughing stock to his people.

Even so it fares with the Poor Traveller, sailing and posting through the politer kingdoms of the globe, in pursuit of knowledge and improvements.

Knowledge and improvements are to be got by sailing and posting for that purpose; but whether useful knowledge and real improvements is all a lottery; - and even where the adventurer is successful, the acquired stock must be used with caution and sobriety, to turn to any profit: - but, as the chances run prodigiously the other way, both as to the acquisition and application, I am of opinion, That a man would act as wisely, if he could prevail upon himself to live contented without foreign knowledge or foreign improvements, especially if he lives in a country that has no absolute want of either; - and indeed, much grief of heart has it oft and many a time cost me, when I have observed how many a foul step the Inquisitive Traveller has measured to see sights and look into discoveries; all which, as Sancho Panza said to Don Quixote, they might have seen dry-shod at home.  It is an age so full of light, that there is scarce a country or corner in Europe whose beams are not crossed and interchanged with others. - Knowledge in most of its branches, and in most affairs, is like music in an Italian street, whereof those may partake who pay nothing. - But there is no nation under heaven - and God is my record (before whose tribunal I must one day come and give an account of this work) - that I do not speak it vauntingly, - but there is no nation under heaven abounding with more variety of learning, - where the sciences may be more fitly woo’d, or more surely won, than here, - where art is encouraged, and will so soon rise high, - where Nature (take her altogether) has so little to answer for, - and, to close all, where there is more wit and variety of character to feed the mind with: - Where then, my dear countrymen, are you going? -

We are only looking at this chaise, said they. - Your most obedient servant, said I, skipping out of it, and pulling off my hat. - We were wondering, said one of them, who, I found was an Inquisitive Traveller, - what could occasion its motion. - ’Twas the agitation, said I, coolly, of writing a preface. - I never heard, said the other, who was a Simple Traveller, of a preface wrote in a désobligeant. - It would have been better, said I, in a vis-a-vis.

- As an Englishman does not travel to see Englishmen, I retired to my room.


CALAIS.


I perceived that something darken’d the passage more than myself, as I stepp’d along it to my room; it was effectually Mons. Dessein, the master of the hôtel, who had just returned from vespers, and with his hat under his arm, was most complaisantly following me, to put me in mind of my wants.  I had wrote myself pretty well out of conceit with the désobligeant, and Mons. Dessein speaking of it, with a shrug, as if it would no way suit me, it immediately struck my fancy that it belong’d to some Innocent Traveller, who, on his return home, had left it to Mons. Dessein’s honour to make the most of.  Four months had elapsed since it had finished its career of Europe in the corner of Mons. Dessein’s coach-yard; and having sallied out from thence but a vampt-up business at the first, though it had been twice taken to pieces on Mount Sennis, it had not profited much by its adventures, - but by none so little as the standing so many months unpitied in the corner of Mons. Dessein’s coach-yard.  Much indeed was not to be said for it, - but something might; - and when a few words will rescue misery out of her distress, I hate the man who can be a churl of them.

- Now was I the master of this hôtel, said I, laying the point of my fore-finger on Mons. Dessein’s breast, I would inevitably make a point of getting rid of this unfortunate désobligeant; - it stands swinging reproaches at you every time you pass by it.

Mon Dieu! said Mons. Dessein, - I have no interest - Except the interest, said I, which men of a certain turn of mind take, Mons. Dessein, in their own sensations, - I’m persuaded, to a man who feels for others as well as for himself, every rainy night, disguise it as you will, must cast a damp upon your spirits: - You suffer, Mons. Dessein, as much as the machine -

I have always observed, when there is as much sour as sweet in a compliment, that an Englishman is eternally at a loss within himself, whether to take it, or let it alone: a Frenchman never is: Mons. Dessein made me a bow.

C’est bien vrai, said he. - But in this case I should only exchange one disquietude for another, and with loss: figure to yourself, my dear Sir, that in giving you a chaise which would fall to pieces before you had got half-way to Paris, - figure to yourself how much I should suffer, in giving an ill impression of myself to a man of honour, and lying at the mercy, as I must do, d’un homme d’esprit.

The dose was made up exactly after my own prescription; so I could not help tasting it, - and, returning Mons. Dessein his bow, without more casuistry we walk’d together towards his Remise, to take a view of his magazine of chaises.


IN THE STREET.  CALAIS.


It must needs be a hostile kind of a world, when the buyer (if it be but of a sorry post-chaise) cannot go forth with the seller thereof into the street to terminate the difference betwixt them, but he instantly falls into the same frame of mind, and views his conventionist with the same sort of eye, as if he was going along with him to Hyde-park corner to fight a duel.  For my own part, being but a poor swordsman, and no way a match for Monsieur Dessein, I felt the rotation of all the movements within me, to which the situation is incident; - I looked at Monsieur Dessein through and through - eyed him as he walk’d along in profile, - then, en face; - thought like a Jew, - then a Turk, - disliked his wig, - cursed him by my gods, - wished him at the devil. -

- And is all this to be lighted up in the heart for a beggarly account of three or four louis d’ors, which is the most I can be overreached in? - Base passion! said I, turning myself about, as a man naturally does upon a sudden reverse of sentiment, - base, ungentle passion! thy hand is against every man, and every man’s hand against thee. - Heaven forbid! said she, raising her hand up to her forehead, for I had turned full in front upon the lady whom I had seen in conference with the monk: - she had followed us unperceived. - Heaven forbid, indeed! said I, offering her my own; - she had a black pair of silk gloves, open only at the thumb and two fore-fingers, so accepted it without reserve, - and I led her up to the door of the Remise.

Monsieur Dessein had diabled the key above fifty times before he had found out he had come with a wrong one in his hand: we were as impatient as himself to have it opened; and so attentive to the obstacle that I continued holding her hand almost without knowing it: so that Monsieur Dessein left us together with her hand in mine, and with our faces turned towards the door of the Remise, and said he would be back in five minutes.

Now a colloquy of five minutes, in such a situation, is worth one of as many ages, with your faces turned towards the street: in the latter case, ’tis drawn from the objects and occurrences without; - when your eyes are fixed upon a dead blank, - you draw purely from yourselves.  A silence of a single moment upon Mons. Dessein’s leaving us, had been fatal to the situation - she had infallibly turned about; - so I begun the conversation instantly. -

- But what were the temptations (as I write not to apologize for the weaknesses of my heart in this tour, - but to give an account of them) - shall be described with the same simplicity with which I felt them.


THE REMISE DOOR.  CALAIS.


When I told the reader that I did not care to get out of the désobligeant, because I saw the monk in close conference with a lady just arrived at the inn - I told him the truth, - but I did not tell him the whole truth; for I was as full as much restrained by the appearance and figure of the lady he was talking to.  Suspicion crossed my brain and said, he was telling her what had passed: something jarred upon it within me, - I wished him at his convent.

When the heart flies out before the understanding, it saves the judgment a world of pains. - I was certain she was of a better order of beings; - however, I thought no more of her, but went on and wrote my preface.

The impression returned upon my encounter with her in the street; a guarded frankness with which she gave me her hand, showed, I thought, her good education and her good sense; and as I led her on, I felt a pleasurable ductility about her, which spread a calmness over all my spirits -

- Good God! how a man might lead such a creature as this round the world with him! -

I had not yet seen her face - ’twas not material: for the drawing was instantly set about, and long before we had got to the door of the Remise, Fancy had finished the whole head, and pleased herself as much with its fitting her goddess, as if she had dived into the Tiber for it; - but thou art a seduced, and a seducing slut; and albeit thou cheatest us seven times a day with thy pictures and images, yet with so many charms dost thou do it, and thou deckest out thy pictures in the shapes of so many angels of light, ’tis a shame to break with thee.

When we had got to the door of the Remise, she withdrew her hand from across her forehead, and let me see the original: - it was a face of about six-and-twenty, - of a clear transparent brown, simply set off without rouge or powder; - it was not critically handsome, but there was that in it, which, in the frame of mind I was in, attached me much more to it, - it was interesting: I fancied it wore the characters of a widow’d look, and in that state of its declension, which had passed the two first paroxysms of sorrow, and was quietly beginning to reconcile itself to its loss; - but a thousand other distresses might have traced the same lines; I wish’d to know what they had been - and was ready to inquire, (had the same bon ton of conversation permitted, as in the days of Esdras) - “What ailelh thee? and why art thou disquieted? and why is thy understanding troubled?” - In a word, I felt benevolence for her; and resolv’d some way or other to throw in my mite of courtesy, - if not of service.

Such were my temptations; - and in this disposition to give way to them, was I left alone with the lady with her hand in mine, and with our faces both turned closer to the door of the Remise than what was absolutely necessary.


THE REMISE DOOR.  CALAIS.


This certainly, fair lady, said I, raising her hand up little lightly as I began, must be one of Fortune’s whimsical doings; to take two utter strangers by their hands, - of different sexes, and perhaps from different corners of the globe, and in one moment place them together in such a cordial situation as Friendship herself could scarce have achieved for them, had she projected it for a month.

- And your reflection upon it shows how much, Monsieur, she has embarrassed you by the adventure -

When the situation is what we would wish, nothing is so ill-timed as to hint at the circumstances which make it so: you thank Fortune, continued she - you had reason - the heart knew it, and was satisfied; and who but an English philosopher would have sent notice of it to the brain to reverse the judgment?

In saying this, she disengaged her hand with a look which I thought a sufficient commentary upon the text.

It is a miserable picture which I am going to give of the weakness of my heart, by owning, that it suffered a pain, which worthier occasions could not have inflicted. - I was mortified with the loss of her hand, and the manner in which I had lost it carried neither oil nor wine to the wound: I never felt the pain of a sheepish inferiority so miserably in my life.

The triumphs of a true feminine heart are short upon these discomfitures.  In a very few seconds she laid her hand upon the cuff of my coat, in order to finish her reply; so, some way or other, God knows how, I regained my situation.

- She had nothing to add.

I forthwith began to model a different conversation for the lady, thinking from the spirit as well as moral of this, that I had been mistaken in her character; but upon turning her face towards me, the spirit which had animated the reply was fled, - the muscles relaxed, and I beheld the same unprotected look of distress which first won me to her interest: - melancholy! to see such sprightliness the prey of sorrow, - I pitied her from my soul; and though it may seem ridiculous enough to a torpid heart, - I could have taken her into my arms, and cherished her, though it was in the open street, without brushing.

The pulsations of the arteries along my fingers pressing across hers, told her what was passing within me: she looked down - a silence of some moments followed.

I fear in this interval, I must have made some slight efforts towards a closer compression of her hand, from a subtle sensation I felt in the palm of my own, - not as if she was going to withdraw hers - but as if she thought about it; - and I had infallibly lost it a second time, had not instinct more than reason directed me to the last resource in these dangers, - to hold it loosely, and in a manner as if I was every moment going to release it, of myself; so she let it continue, till Monsieur Dessein returned with the key; and in the mean time I set myself to consider how I should undo the ill impressions which the poor monk’s story, in case he had told it her, must have planted in her breast against me.


THE SNUFF BOX.  CALAIS.


The good old monk was within six paces of us, as the idea of him crossed my mind; and was advancing towards us a little out of the line, as if uncertain whether he should break in upon us or no. - He stopp’d, however, as soon as he came up to us, with a world of frankness: and having a horn snuff box in his hand, he presented it open to me. - You shall taste mine - said I, pulling out my box (which was a small tortoise one) and putting it into his hand. - ’Tis most excellent, said the monk.  Then do me the favour, I replied, to accept of the box and all, and when you take a pinch out of it, sometimes recollect it was the peace offering of a man who once used you unkindly, but not from his heart.

The poor monk blush’d as red as scarlet.  Mon Dieu! said he, pressing his hands together - you never used me unkindly. - I should think, said the lady, he is not likely.  I blush’d in my turn; but from what movements, I leave to the few who feel, to analyze. - Excuse me, Madame, replied I, - I treated him most unkindly; and from no provocations. - ’Tis impossible, said the lady. - My God! cried the monk, with a warmth of asseveration which seem’d not to belong to him - the fault was in me, and in the indiscretion of my zeal. - The lady opposed it, and I joined with her in maintaining it was impossible, that a spirit so regulated as his, could give offence to any.

I knew not that contention could be rendered so sweet and pleasurable a thing to the nerves as I then felt it. - We remained silent, without any sensation of that foolish pain which takes place, when, in such a circle, you look for ten minutes in one another’s faces without saying a word.  Whilst this lasted, the monk rubbed his horn box upon the sleeve of his tunic; and as soon as it had acquired a little air of brightness by the friction - he made me a low bow, and said, ’twas too late to say whether it was the weakness or goodness of our tempers which had involved us in this contest - but be it as it would, - he begg’d we might exchange boxes. - In saying this, he presented his to me with one hand, as he took mine from me in the other, and having kissed it, - with a stream of good nature in his eyes, he put it into his bosom, - and took his leave.

I guard this box, as I would the instrumental parts of my religion, to help my mind on to something better: in truth, I seldom go abroad without it; and oft and many a time have I called up by it the courteous spirit of its owner to regulate my own, in the justlings of the world: they had found full employment for his, as I learnt from his story, till about the forty-fifth year of his age, when upon some military services ill requited, and meeting at the same time with a disappointment in the tenderest of passions, he abandoned the sword and the sex together, and took sanctuary not so much in his convent as in himself.

I feel a damp upon my spirits, as I am going to add, that in my last return through Calais, upon enquiring after Father Lorenzo, I heard he had been dead near three months, and was buried, not in his convent, but, according to his desire, in a little cemetery belonging to it, about two leagues off: I had a strong desire to see where they had laid him, - when, upon pulling out his little horn box, as I sat by his grave, and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it, which had no business to grow there, they all struck together so forcibly upon my affections, that I burst into a flood of tears: - but I am as weak as a woman; and I beg the world not to smile, but to pity me.


THE REMISE DOOR.  CALAIS.


I had never quitted the lady’s hand all this time, and had held it so long, that it would have been indecent to have let it go, without first pressing it to my lips: the blood and spirits, which had suffered a revulsion from her, crowded back to her as I did it.

Now the two travellers, who had spoke to me in the coach-yard, happening at that crisis to be passing by, and observing our communications, naturally took it into their heads that we must be man and wife at least; so, stopping as soon as they came up to the door of the Remise, the one of them who was the Inquisitive Traveller, ask’d us, if we set out for Paris the next morning? - I could only answer for myself, I said; and the lady added, she was for Amiens. - We dined there yesterday, said the Simple Traveller. - You go directly through the town, added the other, in your road to Paris.  I was going to return a thousand thanks for the intelligence, that Amiens was in the road to Paris, but, upon pulling out my poor monk’s little horn box to take a pinch of snuff, I made them a quiet bow, and wishing them a good passage to Dover. - They left us alone. -

- Now where would be the harm, said I to myself, if I were to beg of this distressed lady to accept of half of my chaise? - and what mighty mischief could ensue?

Every dirty passion, and bad propensity in my nature took the alarm, as I stated the proposition. - It will oblige you to have a third horse, said Avarice, which will put twenty livres out of your pocket; - You know not what she is, said Caution; - or what scrapes the affair may draw you into, whisper’d Cowardice. -

Depend upon it, Yorick! said Discretion, ’twill be said you went off with a mistress, and came by assignation to Calais for that purpose; -

- You can never after, cried Hypocrisy aloud, show your face in the world; - or rise, quoth Meanness, in the church; - or be any thing in it, said Pride, but a lousy prebendary.

But ’tis a civil thing, said I; - and as I generally act from the first impulse, and therefore seldom listen to these cabals, which serve no purpose, that I know of, but to encompass the heart with adamant - I turned instantly about to the lady. -

- But she had glided off unperceived, as the cause was pleading, and had made ten or a dozen paces down the street, by the time I had made the determination; so I set off after her with a long stride, to make her the proposal, with the best address I was master of: but observing she walk’d with her cheek half resting upon the palm of her hand, - with the slow short-measur’d step of thoughtfulness, - and with her eyes, as she went step by step, fixed upon the ground, it struck me she was trying the same cause herself. - God help her! said I, she has some mother-in-law, or tartufish aunt, or nonsensical old woman, to consult upon the occasion, as well as myself: so not caring to interrupt the process, and deeming it more gallant to take her at discretion than by surprise, I faced about and took a short turn or two before the door of the Remise, whilst she walk’d musing on one side.


IN THE STREET.  CALAIS.


Having, on the first sight of the lady, settled the affair in my fancy “that she was of the better order of beings;” - and then laid it down as a second axiom, as indisputable as the first, that she was a widow, and wore a character of distress, - I went no further; I got ground enough for the situation which pleased me; - and had she remained close beside my elbow till midnight, I should have held true to my system, and considered her only under that general idea.

She had scarce got twenty paces distant from me, ere something within me called out for a more particular enquiry; - it brought on the idea of a further separation: - I might possibly never see her more: - The heart is for saving what it can; and I wanted the traces through which my wishes might find their way to her, in case I should never rejoin her myself; in a word, I wished to know her name, - her family’s - her condition; and as I knew the place to which she was going, I wanted to know from whence she came: but there was no coming at all this intelligence; a hundred little delicacies stood in the way.  I form’d a score different plans. - There was no such thing as a man’s asking her directly; - the thing was impossible.

A little French débonnaire captain, who came dancing down the street, showed me it was the easiest thing in the world: for, popping in betwixt us, just as the lady was returning back to the door of the Remise, he introduced himself to my acquaintance, and before he had well got announced, begg’d I would do him the honour to present him to the lady. - I had not been presented myself; - so turning about to her, he did it just as well, by asking her if she had come from Paris?  No: she was going that route, she said. - Vous n’êtes pas de Londres? - She was not, she replied. - Then Madame must have come through Flanders. - Apparemment vous êtes Flammande? said the French captain. - The lady answered, she was. - Peut être de Lisle? added he. - She said, she was not of Lisle. - Nor Arras? - nor Cambray? - nor Ghent? - nor Brussels? - She answered, she was of Brussels.

He had had the honour, he said, to be at the bombardment of it last war; - that it was finely situated, pour cela, - and full of noblesse when the Imperialists were driven out by the French (the lady made a slight courtesy) - so giving her an account of the affair, and of the share he had had in it, - he begg’d the honour to know her name, - so made his bow.

- Et Madame a son Mari? - said he, looking back when he had made two steps, - and, without staying for an answer - danced down the street.

Had I served seven years apprenticeship to good breeding, I could not have done as much.


THE REMISE.  CALAIS.


As the little French captain left us, Mons. Dessein came up with the key of the Remise in his hand, and forthwith let us into his magazine of chaises.

The first object which caught my eye, as Mons. Dessein open’d the door of the Remise, was another old tatter’d désobligeant; and notwithstanding it was the exact picture of that which had hit my fancy so much in the coach-yard but an hour before, - the very sight of it stirr’d up a disagreeable sensation within me now; and I thought ’twas a churlish beast into whose heart the idea could first enter, to construct such a machine; nor had I much more charity for the man who could think of using it.

I observed the lady was as little taken with it as myself: so Mons. Dessein led us on to a couple of chaises which stood abreast, telling us, as he recommended them, that they had been purchased by my lord A. and B. to go the grand tour, but had gone no further than Paris, so were in all respects as good as new. - They were too good; - so I pass’d on to a third, which stood behind, and forthwith begun to chaffer for the price. - But ’twill scarce hold two, said I, opening the door and getting in. - Have the goodness, Madame, said Mons. Dessein, offering his arm, to step in. - The lady hesitated half a second, and stepped in; and the waiter that moment beckoning to speak to Mon. Dessein, he shut the door of the chaise upon us, and left us.


THE REMISE.  CALAIS.


C’est bien comique, ’tis very droll, said the lady, smiling, from the reflection that this was the second time we a had been left together by a parcel of nonsensical contingencies, - c’est bien comique, said she. -

- There wants nothing, said I, to make it so but the comic use which the gallantry of a Frenchman would put it to, - to make love the first moment, and an offer of his person the second.

’Tis their fort, replied the lady.

It is supposed so at least; - and how it has come to pass, continued I, I know not; but they have certainly got the credit of understanding more of love, and making it better than any other nation upon earth; but, for my own part, I think them arrant bunglers, and in truth the worst set of marksmen that ever tried Cupid’s patience.

- To think of making love by sentiments!

I should as soon think of making a genteel suit of clothes out of remnants: - and to do it - pop - at first sight, by declaration - is submitting the offer, and themselves with it, to be sifted with all their pours and contres, by an unheated mind.

The lady attended as if she expected I should go on.

Consider then, Madame, continued I, laying my hand upon hers:-

That grave people hate love for the name’s sake; -

That selfish people hate it for their own; -

Hypocrites for heaven’s; -

And that all of us, both old and young, being ten times worse frightened than hurt by the very report, - what a want of knowledge in this branch of commence a man betrays, whoever lets the word come out of his lips, till an hour or two, at least, after the time that his silence upon it becomes tormenting.  A course of small, quiet attentions, not so pointed as to alarm, - nor so vague as to be misunderstood - with now and then a look of kindness, and little or nothing said upon it, - leaves nature for your mistress, and she fashions it to her mind. -

Then I solemnly declare, said the lady, blushing, you have been making love to me all this while.


THE REMISE.  CALAIS.


Monsieur Dessein came back to let us out of the chaise, and acquaint the lady, the count de L-, her brother, was just arrived at the hotel.  Though I had infinite good will for the lady, I cannot say that I rejoiced in my heart at the event - and could not help telling her so; - for it is fatal to a proposal, Madame, said I, that I was going to make to you -

- You need not tell me what the proposal was, said she, laying her hand upon both mine, as she interrupted me. - A man my good Sir, has seldom an offer of kindness to make to a woman, but she has a presentiment of it some moments before. -

Nature arms her with it, said I, for immediate preservation. - But I think, said she, looking in my face, I had no evil to apprehend, - and, to deal frankly with you, had determined to accept it. - If I had - (she stopped a moment) - I believe your good will would have drawn a story from me, which would have made pity the only dangerous thing in the journey.

In saying this, she suffered me to kiss her hand twice, and with a look of sensibility mixed with concern, she got out of the chaise, - and bid adieu.


IN THE STREET.  CALAIS.


I never finished a twelve guinea bargain so expeditiously in my life: my time seemed heavy, upon the loss of the lady, and knowing every moment of it would be as two, till I put myself into motion, - I ordered post horses directly, and walked towards the hotel.

Lord! said I, hearing the town clock strike four, and recollecting that I had been little more than a single hour in Calais, -

- What a large volume of adventures may be grasped within this little span of life by him who interests his heart in every thing, and who, having eyes to see what time and chance are perpetually holding out to him as he journeyeth on his way, misses nothing he can fairly lay his hands on!

- If this won’t turn out something, - another will; - no matter, - ’tis an assay upon human nature - I get my labour for my pains, - ’tis enough; - the pleasure of the experiment has kept my senses and the best part of my blood awake, and laid the gross to sleep.

I pity the man who can travel from Dan to Beersheba, and cry, ’Tis all barren; - and so it is: and so is all the world to him who will not cultivate the fruits it offers.  I declare, said I, clapping my hands cheerily together, that were I in a desert, I would find out wherewith in it to call forth my affections: - if I could not do better, I would fasten them upon some sweet myrtle, or seek some melancholy cypress to connect myself to; - I would court their shade, and greet them kindly for their protection. - I would cut my name upon them, and swear they were the loveliest trees throughout the desert: if their leaves wither’d, I would teach myself to mourn; and, when they rejoiced, I would rejoice along with them.

The learned Smelfungus travelled from Boulogne to Paris, - from Paris to Rome, - and so on; - but he set out with the spleen and jaundice, and every object he pass’d by was discoloured or distorted. - He wrote an account of them, but ’twas nothing but the account of his miserable feelings.

I met Smelfungus in the grand portico of the Pantheon: - he was just coming out of it. - ’Tis nothing but a huge cockpit, said he: - I wish you had said nothing worse of the Venus of Medicis, replied I; - for in passing through Florence, I had heard he had fallen foul upon the goddess, and used her worse than a common strumpet, without the least provocation in nature.

I popp’d upon Smelfungus again at Turin, in his return home; and a sad tale of sorrowful adventures had he to tell, “wherein he spoke of moving accidents by flood and field, and of the cannibals that each other eat: the Anthropophagi:” - he had been flayed alive, and bedevil’d, and used worse than St. Bartholomew, at every stage he had come at. -

- I’ll tell it, cried Smelfungus, to the world.  You had better tell it, said I, to your physician.

Mundungus, with an immense fortune, made the whole tour; going on from Rome to Naples, - from Naples to Venice, - from Venice to Vienna, - to Dresden, to Berlin, without one generous connection or pleasurable anecdote to tell of; but he had travell’d straight on, looking neither to his right hand nor his left, lest Love or Pity should seduce him out of his road.

Peace be to them! if it is to be found; but heaven itself, were it possible to get there with such tempers, would want objects to give it; every gentle spirit would come flying upon the wings of Love to hail their arrival. - Nothing would the souls of Smelfungus and Mundungus hear of, but fresh anthems of joy, fresh raptures of love, and fresh congratulations of their common felicity. - I heartily pity them; they have brought up no faculties for this work; and, were the happiest mansion in heaven to be allotted to Smelfungus and Mundungus, they would be so far from being happy, that the souls of Smelfungus and Mundungus would do penance there to all eternity!


MONTREUIL.


I had once lost my portmanteau from behind my chaise, and twice got out in the rain, and one of the times up to the knees in dirt, to help the postilion to tie it on, without being able to find out what was wanting. - Nor was it till I got to Montreuil, upon the landlord’s asking me if I wanted not a servant, that it occurred to me, that that was the very thing.

A servant!  That I do most sadly, quoth I. - Because, Monsieur, said the landlord, there is a clever young fellow, who would be very proud of the honour to serve an Englishman. - But why an English one, more than any other? - They are so generous, said the landlord. - I’ll be shot if this is not a livre out of my pocket, quoth I to myself, this very night. - But they have wherewithal to be so, Monsieur, added he. - Set down one livre more for that, quoth I. - It was but last night, said the landlord, qu’un milord Anglois présentoit un écu à la fille de chambre. - Tant pis pour Mademoiselle Janatone, said I.

Now Janatone, being the landlord’s daughter, and the landlord supposing I was young in French, took the liberty to inform me, I should not have said tant pis - but, tant mieux.  Tant mieux, toujours, Monsieur, said he, when there is any thing to be got - tant pis, when there is nothing.  It comes to the same thing, said I.  Pardonnez-moi, said the landlord.

I cannot take a fitter opportunity to observe, once for all, that tant pis and tant mieux, being two of the great hinges in French conversation, a stranger would do well to set himself right in the use of them, before he gets to Paris.

A prompt French marquis at our ambassador’s table demanded of Mr. H-, if he was H- the poet?  No, said Mr. H-, mildly. - Tant pis, replied the marquis.

It is H- the historian, said another, - Tant mieux, said the marquis.  And Mr. H-, who is a man of an excellent heart, return’d thanks for both.

When the landlord had set me right in this matter, he called in La Fleur, which was the name of the young man he had spoke of, - saying only first, That as for his talents he would presume to say nothing, - Monsieur was the best judge what would suit him; but for the fidelity of La Fleur he would stand responsible in all he was worth.

The landlord deliver’d this in a manner which instantly set my mind to the business I was upon; - and La Fleur, who stood waiting without, in that breathless expectation which every son of nature of us have felt in our turns, came in.


MONTREUIL.


I am apt to be taken with all kinds of people at first sight; but never more so than when a poor devil comes to offer his service to so poor a devil as myself; and as I know this weakness, I always suffer my judgment to draw back something on that very account, - and this more or less, according to the mood I am in, and the case; - and I may add, the gender too, of the person I am to govern.

When La Fleur entered the room, after every discount I could make for my soul, the genuine look and air of the fellow determined the matter at once in his favour; so I hired him first, - and then began to enquire what he could do: But I shall find out his talents, quoth I, as I want them, - besides, a Frenchman can do every thing.

Now poor La Fleur could do nothing in the world but beat a drum, and play a march or two upon the fife.  I was determined to make his talents do; and can’t say my weakness was ever so insulted by my wisdom as in the attempt.

La Fleur had set out early in life, as gallantly as most Frenchmen do, with serving for a few years; at the end of which, having satisfied the sentiment, and found, moreover, That the honour of beating a drum was likely to be its own reward, as it open’d no further track of glory to him, - he retired à ses terres, and lived comme il plaisoit à Dieu; - that is to say, upon nothing.

- And so, quoth Wisdom, you have hired a drummer to attend you in this tour of yours through France and Italy! - Psha! said I, and do not one half of our gentry go with a humdrum compagnon du voyage the same round, and have the piper and the devil and all to pay besides?  When man can extricate himself with an équivoque in such an unequal match, - he is not ill off. - But you can do something else, La Fleur? said I. - O qu’oui! he could make spatterdashes, and play a little upon the fiddle. - Bravo! said Wisdom. - Why, I play a bass myself, said I; - we shall do very well.  You can shave, and dress a wig a little, La Fleur? - He had all the dispositions in the world. - It is enough for heaven! said I, interrupting him, - and ought to be enough for me. - So, supper coming in, and having a frisky English spaniel on one side of my chair, and a French valet, with as much hilarity in his countenance as ever Nature painted in one, on the other, - I was satisfied to my heart’s content with my empire; and if monarchs knew what they would be at, they might be as satisfied as I was.


MONTREUIL.


As La Fleur went the whole tour of France and Italy with me, and will be often upon the stage, I must interest the reader a little further in his behalf, by saying, that I had never less reason to repent of the impulses which generally do determine me, than in regard to this fellow; - he was a faithful, affectionate, simple soul as ever trudged after the heels of a philosopher; and, notwithstanding his talents of drum beating and spatterdash-making, which, though very good in themselves, happened to be of no great service to me, yet was I hourly recompensed by the festivity of his temper; - it supplied all defects: - I had a constant resource in his looks in all difficulties and distresses of my own - I was going to have added of his too; but La Fleur was out of the reach of every thing; for, whether ’twas hunger or thirst, or cold or nakedness, or watchings, or whatever stripes of ill luck La Fleur met with in our journeyings, there was no index in his physiognomy to point them out by, - he was eternally the same; so that if I am a piece of a philosopher, which Satan now and then puts it into my head I am, - it always mortifies the pride of the conceit, by reflecting how much I owe to the complexional philosophy of this poor fellow, for shaming me into one of a better kind.  With all this, La Fleur had a small cast of the coxcomb, - but he seemed at first sight to be more a coxcomb of nature than of art; and, before I had been three days in Paris with him, - he seemed to be no coxcomb at all.


MONTREUIL.


The next morning, La Fleur entering upon his employment, I delivered to him the key of my portmanteau, with an inventory of my half a dozen shirts and silk pair of breeches, and bid him fasten all upon the chaise, - get the horses put to, - and desire the landlord to come in with his bill.

C’est un garcon de bonne fortune, said the landlord, pointing through the window to half a dozen wenches who had got round about La Fleur, and were most kindly taking their leave of him, as the postilion was leading out the horses.  La Fleur kissed all their hands round and round again, and thrice he wiped his eyes, and thrice he promised he would bring them all pardons from Rome.

- The young fellow, said the landlord, is beloved by all the town, and there is scarce a corner in Montreuil where the want of him will not be felt: he has but one misfortune in the world, continued he, “he is always in love.” - I am heartily glad of it, said I, - ’twill save me the trouble every night of putting my breeches under my head.  In saying this, I was making not so much La Fleur’s eloge as my own, having been in love with one princess or another almost all my life, and I hope I shall go on so till I die, being firmly persuaded, that if ever I do a mean action, it must be in some interval betwixt one passion and another: whilst this interregnum lasts, I always perceive my heart locked up, - I can scarce find in it to give Misery a sixpence; and therefore I always get out of it as fast as I can - and the moment I am rekindled, I am all generosity and good-will again; and would do anything in the world, either for or with any one, if they will but satisfy me there is no sin in it.

- But in saying this, - sure I am commanding the passion, - not myself.


A FRAGMENT.


- The town of Abdera, notwithstanding Democritus lived there, trying all the powers of irony and laughter to reclaim it, was the vilest and most profligate town in all Thrace.  What for poisons, conspiracies, and assassinations, - libels, pasquinades, and tumults, there was no going there by day - ’twas worse by night.

Now, when things were at the worst, it came to pass that the Andromeda of Euripides being represented at Abdera, the whole orchestra was delighted with it: but of all the passages which delighted them, nothing operated more upon their imaginations than the tender strokes of nature which the poet had wrought up in that pathetic speech of Perseus, O Cupid, prince of gods and men! &c.  Every man almost spoke pure iambics the next day, and talked of nothing but Perseus his pathetic address, - “O Cupid! prince of gods and men!” - in every street of Abdera, in every house, “O Cupid!  Cupid!” - in every mouth, like the natural notes of some sweet melody which drop from it, whether it will or no, - nothing but “Cupid! Cupid! prince of gods and men!” - The fire caught - and the whole city, like the heart of one man, open’d itself to Love.

No pharmacopolist could sell one grain of hellebore, - not a single armourer had a heart to forge one instrument of death; - Friendship and Virtue met together, and kiss’d each other in the street; the golden age returned, and hung over the town of Abdera - every Abderite took his eaten pipe, and every Abderitish woman left her purple web, and chastely sat her down and listened to the song.

’Twas only in the power, says the Fragment, of the God whose empire extendeth from heaven to earth, and even to the depths of the sea, to have done this.


MONTREUIL.


When all is ready, and every article is disputed and paid for in the inn, unless you are a little sour’d by the adventure, there is always a matter to compound at the door, before you can get into your chaise; and that is with the sons and daughters of poverty, who surround you.  Let no man say, “Let them go to the devil!” - ’tis a cruel journey to send a few miserables, and they have had sufferings enow without it: I always think it better to take a few sous out in my hand; and I would counsel every gentle traveller to do so likewise: he need not be so exact in setting down his motives for giving them; - They will be registered elsewhere.

For my own part, there is no man gives so little as I do; for few, that I know, have so little to give; but as this was the first public act of my charity in France, I took the more notice of it.

A well-a-way! said I, - I have but eight sous in the world, showing them in my hand, and there are eight poor men and eight poor women for ’em.

A poor tatter’d soul, without a shirt on, instantly withdrew his claim, by retiring two steps out of the circle, and making a disqualifying bow on his part.  Had the whole parterre cried out, Place aux dames, with one voice, it would not have conveyed the sentiment of a deference for the sex with half the effect.

Just Heaven! for what wise reasons hast thou ordered it, that beggary and urbanity, which are at such variance in other countries, should find a way to be at unity in this?

- I insisted upon presenting him with a single sous, merely for his politesse.

A poor little dwarfish brisk fellow, who stood over against me in the circle, putting something first under his arm, which had once been a hat, took his snuff-box out of his pocket, and generously offer’d a pinch on both sides of him: it was a gift of consequence, and modestly declined.  - The poor little fellow pressed it upon them with a nod of welcomeness. - Prenez en - prenez, said he, looking another way; so they each took a pinch. - Pity thy box should ever want one! said I to myself; so I put a couple of sous into it - taking a small pinch out of his box, to enhance their value, as I did it.  He felt the weight of the second obligation more than of the first, - ’twas doing him an honour, - the other was only doing him a charity; - and he made me a bow down to the ground for it.

- Here! said I to an old soldier with one hand, who had been campaigned and worn out to death in the service - here’s a couple of sous for thee. - Vive le Roi! said the old soldier.

I had then but three sous left: so I gave one, simply, pour l’amour de Dieu, which was the footing on which it was begg’d. - The poor woman had a dislocated hip; so it could not be well upon any other motive.

Mon cher et très-charitable Monsieur. - There’s no opposing this, said I.

Milord Anglois - the very sound was worth the money; - so I gave my last sous for it.  But in the eagerness of giving, I had overlooked a pauvre honteux, who had had no one to ask a sous for him, and who, I believe, would have perished, ere he could have ask’d one for himself: he stood by the chaise a little without the circle, and wiped a tear from a face which I thought had seen better days. - Good God! said I - and I have not one single sous left to give him. - But you have a thousand! cried all the powers of nature, stirring within me; - so I gave him - no matter what - I am ashamed to say how much now, - and was ashamed to think how little, then: so, if the reader can form any conjecture of my disposition, as these two fixed points are given him, he may judge within a livre or two what was the precise sum.

I could afford nothing for the rest, but Dieu vous bénisse!

- Et le bon Dieu vous bénisse encore, said the old soldier, the dwarf, &c.  The pauvre honteux could say nothing; - he pull’d out a little handkerchief, and wiped his face as he turned away - and I thought he thanked me more than them all.


THE BIDET.


Having settled all these little matters, I got into my post-chaise with more ease than ever I got into a post-chaise in my life; and La Fleur having got one large jack-boot on the far side of a little bidet, and another on this (for I count nothing of his legs) - he canter’d away before me as happy and as perpendicular as a prince. - But what is happiness! what is grandeur in this painted scene of life!  A dead ass, before we had got a league, put a sudden stop to La Fleur’s career; - his bidet would not pass by it, - a contention arose betwixt them, and the poor fellow was kick’d out of his jack-boots the very first kick.

La Fleur bore his fall like a French Christian, saying neither more nor less upon it, than Diable!  So presently got up, and came to the charge again astride his bidet, beating him up to it as he would have beat his drum.

The bidet flew from one side of the road to the other, then back again, - then this way, then that way, and in short, every way but by the dead ass: - La Fleur insisted upon the thing - and the bidet threw him.

What’s the matter, La Fleur, said I, with this bidet of thine?  Monsieur, said he, c’est un cheval le plus opiniâtre du monde. - Nay, if he is a conceited beast, he must go his own way, replied I.  So La Fleur got off him, and giving him a good sound lash, the bidet took me at my word, and away he scampered back to Montreuil. - Peste! said La Fleur.

It is not mal-à-propos to take notice here, that though La Fleur availed himself but of two different terms of exclamation in this encounter, - namely, Diable! and Peste! that there are, nevertheless, three in the French language: like the positive, comparative, and superlative, one or the other of which serves for every unexpected throw of the dice in life.

Le Diable! which is the first, and positive degree, is generally used upon ordinary emotions of the mind, where small things only fall out contrary to your expectations; such as - the throwing once doublets - La Fleur’s being kick’d off his horse, and so forth. - Cuckoldom, for the same reason, is always - Le Diable!

But, in cases where the cast has something provoking in it, as in that of the bidet’s running away after, and leaving La Fleur aground in jack-boots, - ’tis the second degree.

’Tis then Peste!

And for the third -

- But here my heart is wrung with pity and fellow feeling, when I reflect what miseries must have been their lot, and how bitterly so refined a people must have smarted, to have forced them upon the use of it. -

Grant me, O ye powers which touch the tongue with eloquence in distress! - what ever is my cast, grant me but decent words to exclaim in, and I will give my nature way.

- But as these were not to be had in France, I resolved to take every evil just as it befell me, without any exclamation at all.

La Fleur, who had made no such covenant with himself, followed the bidet with his eyes till it was got out of sight, - and then, you may imagine, if you please, with what word he closed the whole affair.

As there was no hunting down a frightened horse in jack-boots, there remained no alternative but taking La Fleur either behind the chaise, or into it. -

I preferred the latter, and in half an hour we got to the post-house at Nampont.


NAMPONT.  THE DEAD ASS.


- And this, said he, putting the remains of a crust into his wallet - and this should have been thy portion, said he, hadst thou been alive to have shared it with me. - I thought, by the accent, it had been an apostrophe to his child; but ’twas to his ass, and to the very ass we had seen dead in the road, which had occasioned La Fleur’s misadventure.  The man seemed to lament it much; and it instantly brought into my mind Sancho’s lamentation for his; but he did it with more true touches of nature.

The mourner was sitting upon a stone bench at the door, with the ass’s pannel and its bridle on one side, which he took up from time to time, - then laid them down, - look’d at them, and shook his head.  He then took his crust of bread out of his wallet again, as if to eat it; held it some time in his hand, - then laid it upon the bit of his ass’s bridle, - looked wistfully at the little arrangement he had made - and then gave a sigh.

The simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him, and La Fleur amongst the rest, whilst the horses were getting ready; as I continued sitting in the post-chaise, I could see and hear over their heads.

- He said he had come last from Spain, where he had been from the furthest borders of Franconia; and had got so far on his return home, when his ass died.  Every one seemed desirous to know what business could have taken so old and poor a man so far a journey from his own home.

It had pleased heaven, he said, to bless him with three sons, the finest lads in Germany; but having in one week lost two of the eldest of them by the small-pox, and the youngest falling ill of the same distemper, he was afraid of being bereft of them all; and made a vow, if heaven would not take him from him also, he would go in gratitude to St. Iago in Spain.

When the mourner got thus far on his story, he stopp’d to pay Nature her tribute, - and wept bitterly.

He said, heaven had accepted the conditions; and that he had set out from his cottage with this poor creature, who had been a patient partner of his journey; - that it had eaten the same bread with him all the way, and was unto him as a friend.

Every body who stood about, heard the poor fellow with concern. - La Fleur offered him money. - The mourner said he did not want it; - it was not the value of the ass - but the loss of him. - The ass, he said, he was assured, loved him; - and upon this told them a long story of a mischance upon their passage over the Pyrenean mountains, which had separated them from each other three days; during which time the ass had sought him as much as he had sought the ass, and that they had scarce either eaten or drank till they met.

Thou hast one comfort, friend, said I, at least, in the loss of thy poor beast; I’m sure thou hast been a merciful master to him. - Alas! said the mourner, I thought so when he was alive; - but now that he is dead, I think otherwise. - I fear the weight of myself and my afflictions together have been too much for him, - they have shortened the poor creature’s days, and I fear I have them to answer for. - Shame on the world! said I to myself. - Did we but love each other as this poor soul loved his ass - ’twould be something. -


NAMPONT.  THE POSTILION.


The concern which the poor fellow’s story threw me into required some attention; the postilion paid not the least to it, but set off upon the pavé in a full gallop.

The thirstiest soul in the most sandy desert of Arabia could not have wished more for a cup of cold water, than mine did for grave and quiet movements; and I should have had an high opinion of the postilion had he but stolen off with me in something like a pensive pace. - On the contrary, as the mourner finished his lamentation, the fellow gave an unfeeling lash to each of his beasts, and set off clattering like a thousand devils.

I called to him as loud as I could, for heaven’s sake to go slower: - and the louder I called, the more unmercifully he galloped. - The deuce take him and his galloping too - said I, - he’ll go on tearing my nerves to pieces till he has worked me into a foolish passion, and then he’ll go slow that I may enjoy the sweets of it.

The postilion managed the point to a miracle: by the time he had got to the foot of a steep hill, about half a league from Nampont, - he had put me out of temper with him, - and then with myself, for being so.

My case then required a different treatment; and a good rattling gallop would have been of real service to me. -

- Then, prithee, get on - get on, my good lad, said I.

The postilion pointed to the hill. - I then tried to return back to the story of the poor German and his ass - but I had broke the clue, - and could no more get into it again, than the postilion could into a trot.

- The deuce go, said I, with it all!  Here am I sitting as candidly disposed to make the best of the worst, as ever wight was, and all runs counter.

There is one sweet lenitive at least for evils, which Nature holds out to us: so I took it kindly at her hands, and fell asleep; and the first word which roused me was Amiens.

- Bless me! said I, rubbing my eyes, - this is the very town where my poor lady is to come.


AMIENS.


The words were scarce out of my mouth when the Count de L-’s post-chaise, with his sister in it, drove hastily by: she had just time to make me a bow of recognition, - and of that particular kind of it, which told me she had not yet done with me.  She was as good as her look; for, before I had quite finished my supper, her brother’s servant came into the room with a billet, in which she said she had taken the liberty to charge me with a letter, which I was to present myself to Madame R- the first morning I had nothing to do at Paris.  There was only added, she was sorry, but from what penchant she had not considered, that she had been prevented telling me her story, - that she still owed it to me; and if my route should ever lay through Brussels, and I had not by then forgot the name of Madame de L-, - that Madame de L- would be glad to discharge her obligation.

Then I will meet thee, said I, fair spirit! at Brussels; - ’tis only returning from Italy through Germany to Holland, by the route of Flanders, home; - ’twill scarce be ten posts out of my way; but, were it ten thousand! with what a moral delight will it crown my journey, in sharing in the sickening incidents of a tale of misery told to me by such a sufferer?  To see her weep! and, though I cannot dry up the fountain of her tears, what an exquisite sensation is there still left, in wiping them away from off the cheeks of the first and fairest of women, as I’m sitting with my handkerchief in my hand in silence the whole night beside her?

There was nothing wrong in the sentiment; and yet I instantly reproached my heart with it in the bitterest and most reprobate of expressions.

It had ever, as I told the reader, been one of the singular blessings of my life, to be almost every hour of it miserably in love with some one; and my last flame happening to be blown out by a whiff of jealousy on the sudden turn of a corner, I had lighted it up afresh at the pure taper of Eliza but about three months before, - swearing, as I did it, that it should last me through the whole journey. - Why should I dissemble the matter?  I had sworn to her eternal fidelity; - she had a right to my whole heart: - to divide my affections was to lessen them; - to expose them was to risk them: where there is risk there may be loss: - and what wilt thou have, Yorick, to answer to a heart so full of trust and confidence - so good, so gentle, and unreproaching!

- I will not go to Brussels, replied I, interrupting myself. - But my imagination went on, - I recalled her looks at that crisis of our separation, when neither of us had power to say adieu!  I look’d at the picture she had tied in a black riband about my neck, - and blush’d as I look’d at it. - I would have given the world to have kiss’d it, - but was ashamed. - And shall this tender flower, said I, pressing it between my hands, - shall it be smitten to its very root, - and smitten, Yorick! by thee, who hast promised to shelter it in thy breast?

Eternal Fountain of Happiness! said I, kneeling down upon the ground, - be thou my witness - and every pure spirit which tastes it, be my witness also, That I would not travel to Brussels, unless Eliza went along with me, did the road lead me towards heaven!

In transports of this kind, the heart, in spite of the understanding, will always say too much.


THE LETTER.  AMIENS.


Fortune had not smiled upon La Fleur; for he had been unsuccessful in his feats of chivalry, - and not one thing had offered to signalise his zeal for my service from the time that he had entered into it, which was almost four-and-twenty hours.  The poor soul burn’d with impatience; and the Count de L-’s servant coming with the letter, being the first practicable occasion which offer’d, La Fleur had laid hold of it; and, in order to do honour to his master, had taken him into a back parlour in the auberge, and treated him with a cup or two of the best wine in Picardy; and the Count de L-’s servant, in return, and not to be behindhand in politeness with La Fleur, had taken him back with him to the Count’s hotel.  La Fleur’s prevenancy (for there was a passport in his very looks) soon set every servant in the kitchen at ease with him; and as a Frenchman, whatever be his talents, has no sort of prudery in showing them, La Fleur, in less than five minutes, had pulled out his fife, and leading off the dance himself with the first note, set the fille de chambre, the maître d’hôtel, the cook, the scullion, and all the house-hold, dogs and cats, besides an old monkey, a dancing: I suppose there never was a merrier kitchen since the flood.

Madame de L-, in passing from her brother’s apartments to her own, hearing so much jollity below stairs, rung up her fille de chambre to ask about it; and, hearing it was the English gentleman’s servant, who had set the whole house merry with his pipe, she ordered him up.

As the poor fellow could not present himself empty, he had loaded himself in going up stairs with a thousand compliments to Madame de L-, on the part of his master, - added a long apocrypha of inquiries after Madame de L-’s health, - told her, that Monsieur his master was au désespoire for her re-establishment from the fatigues of her journey, - and, to close all, that Monsieur had received the letter which Madame had done him the honour - And he has done me the honour, said Madame de L-, interrupting La Fleur, to send a billet in return.

Madame de L- had said this with such a tone of reliance upon the fact, that La Fleur had not power to disappoint her expectations; - he trembled for my honour, - and possibly might not altogether be unconcerned for his own, as a man capable of being attached to a master who could be wanting en égards vis à vis d’une femme! so that when Madame de L- asked La Fleur if he had brought a letter, - O qu’oui, said La Fleur: so laying down his hat upon the ground, and taking hold of the flap of his right side pocket with his left hand, he began to search for the letter with his right; - then contrariwise. - Diable! then sought every pocket - pocket by pocket, round, not forgetting his fob: - Peste! - then La Fleur emptied them upon the floor, - pulled out a dirty cravat, - a handkerchief, - a comb, - a whip lash, - a nightcap, - then gave a peep into his hat, - Quelle étourderie!  He had left the letter upon the table in the auberge; - he would run for it, and be back with it in three minutes.

I had just finished my supper when La Fleur came in to give me an account of his adventure: he told the whole story simply as it was: and only added that if Monsieur had forgot (par hazard) to answer Madame’s letter, the arrangement gave him an opportunity to recover the faux pas; - and if not, that things were only as they were.

Now I was not altogether sure of my étiquette, whether I ought to have wrote or no; - but if I had, - a devil himself could not have been angry: ’twas but the officious zeal of a well meaning creature for my honour; and, however he might have mistook the road, - or embarrassed me in so doing, - his heart was in no fault, - I was under no necessity to write; - and, what weighed more than all, - he did not look as if he had done amiss.

- ’Tis all very well, La Fleur, said I. - ’Twas sufficient.  La Fleur flew out of the room like lightning, and returned with pen, ink, and paper, in his hand; and, coming up to the table, laid them close before me, with such a delight in his countenance, that I could not help taking up the pen.

I began and began again; and, though I had nothing to say, and that nothing might have been expressed in half a dozen lines, I made half a dozen different beginnings, and could no way please myself.

In short, I was in no mood to write.

La Fleur stepp’d out and brought a little water in a glass to dilute my ink, - then fetch’d sand and seal-wax. - It was all one; I wrote, and blotted, and tore off, and burnt, and wrote again. - Le diable l’emporte! said I, half to myself, - I cannot write this self-same letter, throwing the pen down despairingly as I said it.

As soon as I had cast down my pen, La Fleur advanced with the most respectful carriage up to the table, and making a thousand apologies for the liberty he was going to take, told me he had a letter in his pocket wrote by a drummer in his regiment to a corporal’s wife, which he durst say would suit the occasion.

I had a mind to let the poor fellow have his humour. - Then prithee, said I, let me see it.

La Fleur instantly pulled out a little dirty pocket book cramm’d full of small letters and billet-doux in a sad condition, and laying it upon the table, and then untying the string which held them all together, run them over, one by one, till he came to the letter in question, - La voila! said he, clapping his hands: so, unfolding it first, he laid it open before me, and retired three steps from the table whilst I read it.


THE LETTER.


Madame,

Je suis pénétré de la douleur la plus vive, et réduit en même temps au désespoir par ce retour imprévù du Caporal qui rend notre entrevûe de ce soir la chose du monde la plus impossible.

Mais vive la joie! et toute la mienne sera de penser à vous.

L’amour n’est rien sans sentiment.

Et le sentiment est encore moins sans amour.

On dit qu’on ne doit jamais se désesperér.

On dit aussi que Monsieur le Caporal monte la garde Mercredi: alors ce cera mon tour.

Chacun à son tour.

En attendant - Vive l’amour! et vive la bagatelle!

Je suis, Madame,

Avec tous les sentimens les plus respectueux et les plus tendres,

tout à vous,

JAQUES ROQUE.


It was but changing the Corporal into the Count, - and saying nothing about mounting guard on Wednesday, - and the letter was neither right nor wrong: - so, to gratify the poor fellow, who stood trembling for my honour, his own, and the honour of his letter, - I took the cream gently off it, and whipping it up in my own way, I seal’d it up and sent him with it to Madame de L-; - and the next morning we pursued our journey to Paris.


PARIS.


When a man can contest the point by dint of equipage, and carry all on floundering before him with half a dozen of lackies and a couple of cooks - ’tis very well in such a place as Paris, - he may drive in at which end of a street he will.

A poor prince who is weak in cavalry, and whose whole infantry does not exceed a single man, had best quit the field, and signalize himself in the cabinet, if he can get up into it; - I say up into it - for there is no descending perpendicular amongst ’em with a “Me voici! mes enfans” - here I am - whatever many may think.

I own my first sensations, as soon as I was left solitary and alone in my own chamber in the hotel, were far from being so flattering as I had prefigured them.  I walked up gravely to the window in my dusty black coat, and looking through the glass saw all the world in yellow, blue, and green, running at the ring of pleasure. - The old with broken lances, and in helmets which had lost their vizards; - the young in armour bright which shone like gold, beplumed with each gay feather of the east, - all, - all, tilting at it like fascinated knights in tournaments of yore for fame and love. -

Alas, poor Yorick! cried I, what art thou doing here?  On the very first onset of all this glittering clatter thou art reduced to an atom; - seek, - seek some winding alley, with a tourniquet at the end of it, where chariot never rolled or flambeau shot its rays; - there thou mayest solace thy soul in converse sweet with some kind grisette of a barber’s wife, and get into such coteries! -

- May I perish! if I do, said I, pulling out the letter which I had to present to Madame de R-  - I’ll wait upon this lady, the very first thing I do.  So I called La Fleur to go seek me a barber directly, - and come back and brush my coat.


THE WIG.  PARIS.


When the barber came, he absolutely refused to have any thing to do with my wig: ’twas either above or below his art: I had nothing to do but to take one ready made of his own recommendation.

- But I fear, friend! said I, this buckle won’t stand. - You may emerge it, replied he, into the ocean, and it will stand. -

What a great scale is every thing upon in this city thought I. - The utmost stretch of an English periwig-maker’s ideas could have gone no further than to have “dipped it into a pail of water.” - What difference! ’tis like Time to Eternity!

I confess I do hate all cold conceptions, as I do the puny ideas which engender them; and am generally so struck with the great works of nature, that for my own part, if I could help it, I never would make a comparison less than a mountain at least.  All that can be said against the French sublime, in this instance of it, is this: - That the grandeur is more in the word, and less in the thing.  No doubt, the ocean fills the mind with vast ideas; but Paris being so far inland, it was not likely I should run post a hundred miles out of it, to try the experiment; - the Parisian barber meant nothing. -

The pail of water standing beside the great deep, makes, certainly, but a sorry figure in speech; - but, ’twill be said, - it has one advantage - ’tis in the next room, and the truth of the buckle may be tried in it, without more ado, in a single moment.

In honest truth, and upon a more candid revision of the matter, The French expression professes more than it performs.

I think I can see the precise and distinguishing marks of national characters more in these nonsensical minutiae than in the most important matters of state; where great men of all nations talk and stalk so much alike, that I would not give ninepence to choose amongst them.

I was so long in getting from under my barber’s hands, that it was too late to think of going with my letter to Madame R- that night: but when a man is once dressed at all points for going out, his reflections turn to little account; so taking down the name of the Hôtel de Modene, where I lodged, I walked forth without any determination where to go; - I shall consider of that, said I, as I walk along.


THE PULSE.  PARIS.


Hail, ye small sweet courtesies of life, for smooth do ye make the road of it! like grace and beauty, which beget inclinations to love at first sight: ’tis ye who open this door and let the stranger in.

- Pray, Madame, said I, have the goodness to tell me which way I must turn to go to the Opéra Comique? - Most willingly, Monsieur, said she, laying aside her work. -

I had given a cast with my eye into half a dozen shops, as I came along, in search of a face not likely to be disordered by such an interruption: till at last, this, hitting my fancy, I had walked in.

She was working a pair of ruffles, as she sat in a low chair, on the far side of the shop, facing the door.

- Tres volontiers, most willingly, said she, laying her work down upon a chair next her, and rising up from the low chair she was sitting in, with so cheerful a movement, and so cheerful a look, that had I been laying out fifty louis d’ors with her, I should have said - “This woman is grateful.”

You must turn, Monsieur, said she, going with me to the door of the shop, and pointing the way down the street I was to take, - you must turn first to your left hand, - mais prenez garde - there are two turns; and be so good as to take the second - then go down a little way and you’ll see a church: and, when you are past it, give yourself the trouble to turn directly to the right, and that will lead you to the foot of the Pont Neuf, which you must cross - and there any one will do himself the pleasure to show you. -

She repeated her instructions three times over to me, with the same goodnatur’d patience the third time as the first; - and if tones and manners have a meaning, which certainly they have, unless to hearts which shut them out, - she seemed really interested that I should not lose myself.

I will not suppose it was the woman’s beauty, notwithstanding she was the handsomest grisette, I think, I ever saw, which had much to do with the sense I had of her courtesy; only I remember, when I told her how much I was obliged to her, that I looked very full in her eyes, - and that I repeated my thanks as often as she had done her instructions.

I had not got ten paces from the door, before I found I had forgot every tittle of what she had said; - so looking back, and seeing her still standing in the door of the shop, as if to look whether I went right or not, - I returned back to ask her, whether the first turn was to my right or left, - for that I had absolutely forgot. - Is it possible! said she, half laughing.  ’Tis very possible, replied I, when a man is thinking more of a woman than of her good advice.

As this was the real truth - she took it, as every woman takes a matter of right, with a slight curtsey.

- Attendez! said she, laying her hand upon my arm to detain me, whilst she called a lad out of the back shop to get ready a parcel of gloves.  I am just going to send him, said she, with a packet into that quarter, and if you will have the complaisance to step in, it will be ready in a moment, and he shall attend you to the place. - So I walk’d in with her to the far side of the shop: and taking up the ruffle in my hand which she laid upon the chair, as if I had a mind to sit, she sat down herself in her low chair, and I instantly sat myself down beside her.

- He will be ready, Monsieur, said she, in a moment. - And in that moment, replied I, most willingly would I say something very civil to you for all these courtesies.  Any one may do a casual act of good nature, but a continuation of them shows it is a part of the temperature; and certainly, added I, if it is the same blood which comes from the heart which descends to the extremes (touching her wrist) I am sure you must have one of the best pulses of any woman in the world. - Feel it, said she, holding out her arm.  So laying down my hat, I took hold of her fingers in one hand, and applied the two forefingers of my other to the artery. -

- Would to heaven! my dear Eugenius, thou hadst passed by, and beheld me sitting in my black coat, and in my lack-a-day-sical manner, counting the throbs of it, one by one, with as much true devotion as if I had been watching the critical ebb or flow of her fever. - How wouldst thou have laugh’d and moralized upon my new profession! - and thou shouldst have laugh’d and moralized on. - Trust me, my dear Eugenius, I should have said, “There are worse occupations in this world than feeling a woman’s pulse.” - But a grisette’s! thou wouldst have said, - and in an open shop!  Yorick -

- So much the better: for when my views are direct, Eugenius, I care not if all the world saw me feel it.


THE HUSBAND.  PARIS.


I had counted twenty pulsations, and was going on fast towards the fortieth, when her husband, coming unexpected from a back parlour into the shop, put me a little out of my reckoning. - ’Twas nobody but her husband, she said; - so I began a fresh score. - Monsieur is so good, quoth she, as he pass’d by us, as to give himself the trouble of feeling my pulse. - The husband took off his hat, and making me a bow, said, I did him too much honour - and having said that, he put on his hat and walk’d out.

Good God! said I to myself, as he went out, - and can this man be the husband of this woman!

Let it not torment the few who know what must have been the grounds of this exclamation, if I explain it to those who do not.

In London a shopkeeper and a shopkeeper’s wife seem to be one bone and one flesh: in the several endowments of mind and body, sometimes the one, sometimes the other has it, so as, in general, to be upon a par, and totally with each other as nearly as man and wife need to do.

In Paris, there are scarce two orders of beings more different: for the legislative and executive powers of the shop not resting in the husband, he seldom comes there: - in some dark and dismal room behind, he sits commerce-less, in his thrum nightcap, the same rough son of Nature that Nature left him.

The genius of a people, where nothing but the monarchy is salique, having ceded this department, with sundry others, totally to the women, - by a continual higgling with customers of all ranks and sizes from morning to night, like so many rough pebbles shook long together in a bag, by amicable collisions they have worn down their asperities and sharp angles, and not only become round and smooth, but will receive, some of them, a polish like a brilliant: - Monsieur le Mari is little better than the stone under your foot.

- Surely, - surely, man! it is not good for thee to sit alone: - thou wast made for social intercourse and gentle greetings; and this improvement of our natures from it I appeal to as my evidence.

- And how does it beat, Monsieur? said she. - With all the benignity, said I, looking quietly in her eyes, that I expected. - She was going to say something civil in return - but the lad came into the shop with the gloves. - Á propos, said I, I want a couple of pairs myself.


THE GLOVES.  PARIS.


The beautiful grisette rose up when I said this, and going behind the counter, reach’d down a parcel and untied it: I advanced to the side over against her: they were all too large.  The beautiful grisette measured them one by one across my hand. - It would not alter their dimensions. - She begg’d I would try a single pair, which seemed to be the least. - She held it open; - my hand slipped into it at once. - It will not do, said I, shaking my head a little. - No, said she, doing the same thing.

There are certain combined looks of simple subtlety, - where whim, and sense, and seriousness, and nonsense, are so blended, that all the languages of Babel set loose together, could not express them; - they are communicated and caught so instantaneously, that you can scarce say which party is the infector.  I leave it to your men of words to swell pages about it - it is enough in the present to say again, the gloves would not do; so, folding our hands within our arms, we both lolled upon the counter - it was narrow, and there was just room for the parcel to lay between us.

The beautiful grisette looked sometimes at the gloves, then sideways to the window, then at the gloves, - and then at me.  I was not disposed to break silence: - I followed her example: so, I looked at the gloves, then to the window, then at the gloves, and then at her, - and so on alternately.

I found I lost considerably in every attack: - she had a quick black eye, and shot through two such long and silken eyelashes with such penetration, that she look’d into my very heart and reins. - It may seem strange, but I could actually feel she did. -

It is no matter, said I, taking up a couple of the pairs next me, and putting them into my pocket.

I was sensible the beautiful grisette had not asked above a single livre above the price. - I wish’d she had asked a livre more, and was puzzling my brains how to bring the matter about. - Do you think, my dear Sir, said she, mistaking my embarrassment, that I could ask a sous too much of a stranger - and of a stranger whose politeness, more than his want of gloves, has done me the honour to lay himself at my mercy? - M’en croyez capable? - Faith! not I, said I; and if you were, you are welcome.  So counting the money into her hand, and with a lower bow than one generally makes to a shopkeeper’s wife, I went out, and her lad with his parcel followed me.


THE TRANSLATION.  PARIS.


There was nobody in the box I was let into but a kindly old French officer.  I love the character, not only because I honour the man whose manners are softened by a profession which makes bad men worse; but that I once knew one, - for he is no more, - and why should I not rescue one page from violation by writing his name in it, and telling the world it was Captain Tobias Shandy, the dearest of my flock and friends, whose philanthropy I never think of at this long distance from his death - but my eyes gush out with tears.  For his sake I have a predilection for the whole corps of veterans; and so I strode over the two back rows of benches and placed myself beside him.

The old officer was reading attentively a small pamphlet, it might be the book of the opera, with a large pair of spectacles.  As soon as I sat down, he took his spectacles off, and putting them into a shagreen case, return’d them and the book into his pocket together.  I half rose up, and made him a bow.

Translate this into any civilized language in the world - the sense is this:

“Here’s a poor stranger come into the box - he seems as if he knew nobody; and is never likely, was he to be seven years in Paris, if every man he comes near keeps his spectacles upon his nose: - ’tis shutting the door of conversation absolutely in his face - and using him worse than a German.”

The French officer might as well have said it all aloud: and if he had, I should in course have put the bow I made him into French too, and told him, “I was sensible of his attention, and return’d him a thousand thanks for it.”

There is not a secret so aiding to the progress of sociality, as to get master of this short hand, and to be quick in rendering the several turns of looks and limbs with all their inflections and delineations, into plain words.  For my own part, by long habitude, I do it so mechanically, that, when I walk the streets of London, I go translating all the way; and have more than once stood behind in the circle, where not three words have been said, and have brought off twenty different dialogues with me, which I could have fairly wrote down and sworn to.

I was going one evening to Martini’s concert at Milan, and, was just entering the door of the hall, when the Marquisina di F- was coming out in a sort of a hurry: - she was almost upon me before I saw her; so I gave a spring to once side to let her pass. - She had done the same, and on the same side too; so we ran our heads together: she instantly got to the other side to get out: I was just as unfortunate as she had been, for I had sprung to that side, and opposed her passage again. - We both flew together to the other side, and then back, - and so on: - it was ridiculous: we both blush’d intolerably: so I did at last the thing I should have done at first; - I stood stock-still, and the Marquisina had no more difficulty.  I had no power to go into the room, till I had made her so much reparation as to wait and follow her with my eye to the end of the passage.  She look’d back twice, and walk’d along it rather sideways, as if she would make room for any one coming up stairs to pass her. - No, said I - that’s a vile translation: the Marquisina has a right to the best apology I can make her, and that opening is left for me to do it in; - so I ran and begg’d pardon for the embarrassment I had given her, saying it was my intention to have made her way.  She answered, she was guided by the same intention towards me; - so we reciprocally thank’d each other.  She was at the top of the stairs; and seeing no cicisbeo near her, I begg’d to hand her to her coach; - so we went down the stairs, stopping at every third step to talk of the concert and the adventure. - Upon my word, Madame, said I, when I had handed her in, I made six different efforts to let you go out. - And I made six efforts, replied she, to let you enter. - I wish to heaven you would make a seventh, said I. - With all my heart, said she, making room. - Life is too short to be long about the forms of it, - so I instantly stepp’d in, and she carried me home with her. - And what became of the concert, St. Cecilia, who I suppose was at it, knows more than I.

I will only add, that the connexion which arose out of the translation gave me more pleasure than any one I had the honour to make in Italy.


THE DWARF.  PARIS.


I had never heard the remark made by any one in my life, except by one; and who that was will probably come out in this chapter; so that being pretty much unprepossessed, there must have been grounds for what struck me the moment I cast my eyes over the parterre, - and that was, the unaccountable sport of Nature in forming such numbers of dwarfs. - No doubt she sports at certain times in almost every corner of the world; but in Paris there is no end to her amusements. - The goddess seems almost as merry as she is wise.

As I carried my idea out of the Opéra Comique with me, I measured every body I saw walking in the streets by it. - Melancholy application! especially where the size was extremely little, - the face extremely dark, - the eyes quick, - the nose long, - the teeth white, - the jaw prominent, - to see so many miserables, by force of accidents driven out of their own proper class into the very verge of another, which it gives me pain to write down: - every third man a pigmy! - some by rickety heads and hump backs; - others by bandy legs; - a third set arrested by the hand of Nature in the sixth and seventh years of their growth; - a fourth, in their perfect and natural state like dwarf apple trees; from the first rudiments and stamina of their existence, never meant to grow higher.

A Medical Traveller might say, ’tis owing to undue bandages; - a Splenetic one, to want of air; - and an Inquisitive Traveller, to fortify the system, may measure the height of their houses, - the narrowness of their streets, and in how few feet square in the sixth and seventh stories such numbers of the bourgeoisie eat and sleep together; but I remember Mr. Shandy the elder, who accounted for nothing like any body else, in speaking one evening of these matters, averred that children, like other animals, might be increased almost to any size, provided they came right into the world; but the misery was, the citizens of were Paris so coop’d up, that they had not actually room enough to get them. - I do not call it getting anything, said he; - ’tis getting nothing. - Nay, continued he, rising in his argument, ’tis getting worse than nothing, when all you have got after twenty or five and twenty years of the tenderest care and most nutritious aliment bestowed upon it, shall not at last be as high as my leg.  Now, Mr. Shandy being very short, there could be nothing more said of it.

As this is not a work of reasoning, I leave the solution as I found it, and content myself with the truth only of the remark, which is verified in every lane and by-lane of Paris.  I was walking down that which leads from the Carousal to the Palais Royal, and observing a little boy in some distress at the side of the gutter which ran down the middle of it, I took hold of his hand and help’d him over.  Upon turning up his face to look at him after, I perceived he was about forty. - Never mind, said I, some good body will do as much for me when I am ninety.

I feel some little principles within me which incline me to be merciful towards this poor blighted part of my species, who have neither size nor strength to get on in the world. - I cannot bear to see one of them trod upon; and had scarce got seated beside my old French officer, ere the disgust was exercised, by seeing the very thing happen under the box we sat in.

At the end of the orchestra, and betwixt that and the first side box, there is a small esplanade left, where, when the house is full, numbers of all ranks take sanctuary.  Though you stand, as in the parterre, you pay the same price as in the orchestra.  A poor defenceless being of this order had got thrust somehow or other into this luckless place; - the night was hot, and he was surrounded by beings two feet and a half higher than himself.  The dwarf suffered inexpressibly on all sides; but the thing which incommoded him most, was a tall corpulent German, near seven feet high, who stood directly betwixt him and all possibility of his seeing either the stage or the actors.  The poor dwarf did all he could to get a peep at what was going forwards, by seeking for some little opening betwixt the German’s arm and his body, trying first on one side, then the other; but the German stood square in the most unaccommodating posture that can be imagined: - the dwarf might as well have been placed at the bottom of the deepest draw-well in Paris; so he civilly reached up his hand to the German’s sleeve, and told him his distress. - The German turn’d his head back, looked down upon him as Goliah did upon David, - and unfeelingly resumed his posture.

I was just then taking a pinch of snuff out of my monk’s little horn box. - And how would thy meek and courteous spirit, my dear monk! so temper’d to bear and forbear! - how sweetly would it have lent an ear to this poor soul’s complaint!

The old French officer, seeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion, as I made the apostrophe, took the liberty to ask me what was the matter? - I told him the story in three words; and added, how inhuman it was.

By this time the dwarf was driven to extremes, and in his first transports, which are generally unreasonable, had told the German he would cut off his long queue with his knife. - The German look’d back coolly, and told him he was welcome, if he could reach it.

An injury sharpen’d by an insult, be it to whom it will, makes every man of sentiment a party: I could have leap’d out of the box to have redressed it. - The old French officer did it with much less confusion; for leaning a little over, and nodding to a sentinel, and pointing at the same time with his finger at the distress, - the sentinel made his way to it. - There was no occasion to tell the grievance, - the thing told himself; so thrusting back the German instantly with his musket, - he took the poor dwarf by the hand, and placed him before him. - This is noble! said I, clapping my hands together. - And yet you would not permit this, said the old officer, in England.

- In England, dear Sir, said I, we sit all at our ease.

The old French officer would have set me at unity with myself, in case I had been at variance, - by saying it was a bon mot; - and, as a bon mot is always worth something at Paris, he offered me a pinch of snuff.


THE ROSE.  PARIS.


It was now my turn to ask the old French officer “What was the matter?” for a cry of “Haussez les mains, Monsieur l’Abbé!” re-echoed from a dozen different parts of the parterre, was as unintelligible to me, as my apostrophe to the monk had been to him.

He told me it was some poor Abbé in one of the upper loges, who, he supposed, had got planted perdu behind a couple of grisettes in order to see the opera, and that the parterre espying him, were insisting upon his holding up both his hands during the representation. - And can it be supposed, said I, that an ecclesiastic would pick the grisettes’ pockets?  The old French officer smiled, and whispering in my ear, opened a door of knowledge which I had no idea of.

Good God! said I, turning pale with astonishment - is it possible, that a people so smit with sentiment should at the same time be so unclean, and so unlike themselves, - Quelle grossièrté! added I.

The French officer told me, it was an illiberal sarcasm at the church, which had begun in the theatre about the time the Tartuffe was given in it by Molière: but like other remains of Gothic manners, was declining. - Every nation, continued he, have their refinements and grossièrtés, in which they take the lead, and lose it of one another by turns: - that he had been in most countries, but never in one where he found not some delicacies, which others seemed to want.  Le POUR et le CONTRE se trouvent en chaque nation; there is a balance, said he, of good and bad everywhere; and nothing but the knowing it is so, can emancipate one half of the world from the prepossession which it holds against the other: - that the advantage of travel, as it regarded the sçavoir vivre, was by seeing a great deal both of men and manners; it taught us mutual toleration; and mutual toleration, concluded he, making me a bow, taught us mutual love.

The old French officer delivered this with an air of such candour and good sense, as coincided with my first favourable impressions of his character: - I thought I loved the man; but I fear I mistook the object; - ’twas my own way of thinking - the difference was, I could not have expressed it half so well.

It is alike troublesome to both the rider and his beast, - if the latter goes pricking up his ears, and starting all the way at every object which he never saw before. - I have as little torment of this kind as any creature alive; and yet I honestly confess, that many a thing gave me pain, and that I blush’d at many a word the first month, - which I found inconsequent and perfectly innocent the second.

Madame do Rambouliet, after an acquaintance of about six weeks with her, had done me the honour to take me in her coach about two leagues out of town. - Of all women, Madame de Rambouliet is the most correct; and I never wish to see one of more virtues and purity of heart. - In our return back, Madame de Rambouliet desired me to pull the cord. - I asked her if she wanted anything - Rien que pour pisser, said Madame de Rambouliet.

Grieve not, gentle traveller, to let Madame de Rambouliet p-ss on. - And, ye fair mystic nymphs! go each one pluck your rose, and scatter them in your path, - for Madame de Rambouliet did no more. - I handed Madame de Rambouliet out of the coach; and had I been the priest of the chaste Castalia, I could not have served at her fountain with a more respectful decorum.


THE FILLE DE CHAMBRE.  PARIS.


What the old French officer had delivered upon travelling, bringing Polonius’s advice to his son upon the same subject into my head, - and that bringing in Hamlet, and Hamlet the rest of Shakespeare’s works, I stopp’d at the Quai de Conti in my return home, to purchase the whole set.

The bookseller said he had not a set in the world.  Comment! said I, taking one up out of a set which lay upon the counter betwixt us. - He said they were sent him only to be got bound, and were to be sent back to Versailles in the morning to the Count de B-.

- And does the Count de B-, said I, read Shakespeare?  C’est un esprit fort, replied the bookseller. - He loves English books! and what is more to his honour, Monsieur, he loves the English too.  You speak this so civilly, said I, that it is enough to oblige an Englishman to lay out a louis d’or or two at your shop. - The bookseller made a bow, and was going to say something, when a young decent girl about twenty, who by her air and dress seemed to be fille de chambre to some devout woman of fashion, come into the shop and asked for Les Egarements du Coeur et de l’Esprit: the bookseller gave her the book directly; she pulled out a little green satin purse run round with a riband of the same colour, and putting her finger and thumb into it, she took out the money and paid for it.  As I had nothing more to stay me in the shop, we both walk’d out at the door together.

- And what have you to do, my dear, said I, with The Wanderings of the Heart, who scarce know yet you have one? nor, till love has first told you it, or some faithless shepherd has made it ache, canst thou ever be sure it is so. - Le Dieu m’en garde! said the girl. - With reason, said I, for if it is a good one, ’tis pity it should be stolen; ’tis a little treasure to thee, and gives a better air to your face, than if it was dress’d out with pearls.

The young girl listened with a submissive attention, holding her satin purse by its riband in her hand all the time. - ’Tis a very small one, said I, taking hold of the bottom of it - she held it towards me - and there is very little in it, my dear, said I; but be but as good as thou art handsome, and heaven will fill it.  I had a parcel of crowns in my hand to pay for Shakespeare; and, as she had let go the purse entirely, I put a single one in; and, tying up the riband in a bow-knot, returned it to her.

The young girl made me more a humble courtesy than a low one: - ’twas one of those quiet, thankful sinkings, where the spirit bows itself down, - the body does no more than tell it.  I never gave a girl a crown in my life which gave me half the pleasure.

My advice, my dear, would not have been worth a pin to you, said I, if I had not given this along with it: but now, when you see the crown, you’ll remember it; - so don’t, my dear, lay it out in ribands.

Upon my word, Sir, said the girl, earnestly, I am incapable; - in saying which, as is usual in little bargains of honour, she gave me her hand: - En vérité, Monsieur, je mettrai cet argent àpart, said she.

When a virtuous convention is made betwixt man and woman, it sanctifies their most private walks: so, notwithstanding it was dusky, yet as both our roads lay the same way, we made no scruple of walking along the Quai de Conti together.

She made me a second courtesy in setting off, and before we got twenty yards from the door, as if she had not done enough before, she made a sort of a little stop to tell me again - she thank’d me.

It was a small tribute, I told her, which I could not avoid paying to virtue, and would not be mistaken in the person I had been rendering it to for the world; - but I see innocence, my dear, in your face, - and foul befall the man who ever lays a snare in its way!

The girl seem’d affected some way or other with what I said; - she gave a low sigh: - I found I was not empowered to enquire at all after it, - so said nothing more till I got to the corner of the Rue de Nevers, where, we were to part.

- But is this the way, my dear, said I, to the Hotel de Modene?  She told me it was; - or that I might go by the Rue de Gueneguault, which was the next turn. - Then I’ll go, my dear, by the Rue de Gueneguault, said I, for two reasons; first, I shall please myself, and next, I shall give you the protection of my company as far on your way as I can.  The girl was sensible I was civil - and said, she wished the Hotel de Modene was in the Rue de St. Pierre. - You live there? said I. - She told me she was fille de chambre to Madame R-. - Good God! said I, ’tis the very lady for whom I have brought a letter from Amiens. - The girl told me that Madame R-, she believed, expected a stranger with a letter, and was impatient to see him: - so I desired the girl to present my compliments to Madame R-, and say, I would certainly wait upon her in the morning.

We stood still at the corner of the Rue de Nevers whilst this pass’d. - We then stopped a moment whilst she disposed of her Egarements du Coeur &c. more commodiously than carrying them in her hand - they were two volumes: so I held the second for her whilst she put the first into her pocket; and then she held her pocket, and I put in the other after it.

’Tis sweet to feel by what fine spun threads our affections are drawn together.

We set off afresh, and as she took her third step, the girl put her hand within my arm. - I was just bidding her, - but she did it of herself, with that undeliberating simplicity, which show’d it was out of her head that she had never seen me before.  For my own part, I felt the conviction of consanguinity so strongly, that I could not help turning half round to look in her face, and see if I could trace out any thing in it of a family likeness. - Tut! said I, are we not all relations?

When we arrived at the turning up of the Rue de Gueneguault, I stopp’d to bid her adieu for good and all: the girl would thank me again for my company and kindness. - She bid me adieu twice. - I repeated it as often; and so cordial was the parting between us, that had it happened any where else, I’m not sure but I should have signed it with a kiss of charity, as warm and holy as an apostle.

But in Paris, as none kiss each other but the men, - I did, what amounted to the same thing -

- I bid God bless her.


THE PASSPORT.  PARIS.


When I got home to my hotel, La Fleur told me I had been enquired after by the Lieutenant de Police. - The deuce take it! said I, - I know the reason.  It is time the reader should know it, for in the order of things in which it happened, it was omitted: not that it was out of my head; but that had I told it then it might have been forgotten now; - and now is the time I want it.

I had left London with so much precipitation, that it never enter’d my mind that we were at war with France; and had reached Dover, and looked through my glass at the hills beyond Boulogne, before the idea presented itself; and with this in its train, that there was no getting there without a passport.  Go but to the end of a street, I have a mortal aversion for returning back no wiser than I set out; and as this was one of the greatest efforts I had ever made for knowledge, I could less bear the thoughts of it: so hearing the Count de - had hired the packet, I begg’d he would take me in his suite.  The Count had some little knowledge of me, so made little or no difficulty, - only said, his inclination to serve me could reach no farther than Calais, as he was to return by way of Brussels to Paris; however, when I had once pass’d there, I might get to Paris without interruption; but that in Paris I must make friends and shift for myself. - Let me get to Paris, Monsieur le Count, said I, - and I shall do very well.  So I embark’d, and never thought more of the matter.

When La Fleur told me the Lieutenant de Police had been enquiring after me, - the thing instantly recurred; - and by the time La Fleur had well told me, the master of the hotel came into my room to tell me the same thing, with this addition to it, that my passport had been particularly asked after: the master of the hotel concluded with saying, He hoped I had one. - Not I, faith! said I.

The master of the hotel retired three steps from me, as from an infected person, as I declared this; - and poor La Fleur advanced three steps towards me, and with that sort of movement which a good soul makes to succour a distress’d one: - the fellow won my heart by it; and from that single trait I knew his character as perfectly, and could rely upon it as firmly, as if he had served me with fidelity for seven years.

Mon seigneur! cried the master of the hotel; but recollecting himself as he made the exclamation, he instantly changed the tone of it. - If Monsieur, said he, has not a passport (apparemment) in all likelihood he has friends in Paris who can procure him one. - Not that I know of, quoth I, with an air of indifference. - Then certes, replied he, you’ll be sent to the Bastile or the Chatelet au moins. - Poo! said I, the King of France is a good natur’d soul: - he’ll hurt nobody. - Cela n’empêche pas, said he - you will certainly be sent to the Bastile to-morrow morning. - But I’ve taken your lodgings for a month, answer’d I, and I’ll not quit them a day before the time for all the kings of France in the world.  La Fleur whispered in my ear, That nobody could oppose the king of France.

Pardi! said my host, ces Messieurs Anglois sont des gens très extraordinaires; - and, having both said and sworn it, - he went out.


THE PASSPORT.  THE HOTEL AT PARIS.


I could not find in my heart to torture La Fleur’s with a serious look upon the subject of my embarrassment, which was the reason I had treated it so cavalierly: and to show him how light it lay upon my mind, I dropt the subject entirely; and whilst he waited upon me at supper, talk’d to him with more than usual gaiety about Paris, and of the Opéra Comique. - La Fleur had been there himself, and had followed me through the streets as far as the bookseller’s shop; but seeing me come out with the young fille de chambre, and that we walk’d down the Quai de Conti together, La Fleur deem’d it unnecessary to follow me a step further; - so making his own reflections upon it, he took a shorter cut, - and got to the hotel in time to be inform’d of the affair of the police against my arrival.

As soon as the honest creature had taken away, and gone down to sup himself, I then began to think a little seriously about my situation. -

- And here, I know, Eugenius, thou wilt smile at the remembrance of a short dialogue which passed betwixt us the moment I was going to set out: - I must tell it here.

Eugenius, knowing that I was as little subject to be overburden’d with money as thought, had drawn me aside to interrogate me how much I had taken care for.  Upon telling him the exact sum, Eugenius shook his head, and said it would not do; so pull’d out his purse in order to empty it into mine. - I’ve enough in conscience, Eugenius, said I. - Indeed, Yorick, you have not, replied Eugenius; I know France and Italy better than you. - But you don’t consider, Eugenius, said I, refusing his offer, that before I have been three days in Paris, I shall take care to say or do something or other for which I shall get clapp’d up into the Bastile, and that I shall live there a couple of months entirely at the king of France’s expense. - I beg pardon, said Eugenius drily: really I had forgot that resource.

Now the event I treated gaily came seriously to my door.

Is it folly, or nonchalance, or philosophy, or pertinacity - or what is it in me, that, after all, when La Fleur had gone down stairs, and I was quite alone, I could not bring down my mind to think of it otherwise than I had then spoken of it to Eugenius?

- And as for the Bastile; the terror is in the word. - Make the most of it you can, said I to myself, the Bastile is but another word for a tower; - and a tower is but another word for a house you can’t get out of. - Mercy on the gouty! for they are in it twice a year. - But with nine livres a day, and pen and ink, and paper, and patience, albeit a man can’t get out, he may do very well within, - at least for a mouth or six weeks; at the end of which, if he is a harmless fellow, his innocence appears, and he comes out a better and wiser man than he went in.

I had some occasion (I forget what) to step into the court-yard, as I settled this account; and remember I walk’d down stairs in no small triumph with the conceit of my reasoning. - Beshrew the sombre pencil! said I, vauntingly - for I envy not its powers, which paints the evils of life with so hard and deadly a colouring.  The mind sits terrified at the objects she has magnified herself, and blackened: reduce them to their proper size and hue, she overlooks them. - ’Tis true, said I, correcting the proposition, - the Bastile is not an evil to be despised; - but strip it of its towers - fill up the fosse, - unbarricade the doors - call it simply a confinement, and suppose ’tis some tyrant of a distemper - and not of a man, which holds you in it, - the evil vanishes, and you bear the other half without complaint.

I was interrupted in the heyday of this soliloquy, with a voice which I took to be of a child, which complained “it could not get out.” - I look’d up and down the passage, and seeing neither man, woman, nor child, I went out without farther attention.

In my return back through the passage, I heard the same words repeated twice over; and, looking up, I saw it was a starling hung in a little cage. - “I can’t get out, - I can’t get out,” said the starling.

I stood looking at the bird: and to every person who came through the passage it ran fluttering to the side towards which they approach’d it, with the same lamentation of its captivity.  “I can’t get out,” said the starling. - God help thee! said I, but I’ll let thee out, cost what it will; so I turned about the cage to get to the door: it was twisted and double twisted so fast with wire, there was no getting it open without pulling the cage to pieces. - I took both hands to it.

The bird flew to the place where I was attempting his deliverance, and thrusting his head through the trellis pressed his breast against it as if impatient. - I fear, poor creature! said I, I cannot set thee at liberty. - “No,” said the starling, -  “I can’t get out - I can’t get out,” said the starling.

I vow I never had my affections more tenderly awakened; nor do I remember an incident in my life, where the dissipated spirits, to which my reason had been a bubble, were so suddenly call’d home.  Mechanical as the notes were, yet so true in tune to nature were they chanted, that in one moment they overthrew all my systematic reasonings upon the Bastile; and I heavily walked upstairs, unsaying every word I had said in going down them.

Disguise thyself as thou wilt, still, Slavery! said I, - still thou art a bitter draught! and though thousands in all ages have been made to drink of thee, thou art no less bitter on that account. - ’Tis thou, thrice sweet and gracious goddess, addressing myself to Liberty, whom all in public or in private worship, whose taste is grateful, and ever will be so, till Nature herself shall change. - No tint of words can spot thy snowy mantle, or chymic power turn thy sceptre into iron: - with thee to smile upon him as he eats his crust, the swain is happier than his monarch, from whose court thou art exiled! - Gracious Heaven! cried I, kneeling down upon the last step but one in my ascent, grant me but health, thou great Bestower of it, and give me but this fair goddess as my companion, - and shower down thy mitres, if it seems good unto thy divine providence, upon those heads which are aching for them!


THE CAPTIVE.  PARIS.


The bird in his cage pursued me into my room; I sat down close to my table, and leaning my head upon my hand, I began to figure to myself the miseries of confinement.  I was in a right frame for it, and so I gave full scope to my imagination.

I was going to begin with the millions of my fellow-creatures born to no inheritance but slavery: but finding, however affecting the picture was, that I could not bring it near me, and that the multitude of sad groups in it did but distract me. -

- I took a single captive, and having first shut him up in his dungeon, I then look’d through the twilight of his grated door to take his picture.

I beheld his body half-wasted away with long expectation and confinement, and felt what kind of sickness of the heart it was which arises from hope deferr’d.  Upon looking nearer I saw him pale and feverish: in thirty years the western breeze had not once fann’d his blood; - he had seen no sun, no moon, in all that time - nor had the voice of friend or kinsman breathed through his lattice. - His children -

But here my heart began to bleed - and I was forced to go on with another part of the portrait.

He was sitting upon the ground upon a little straw, in the furthest corner of his dungeon, which was alternately his chair and bed: a little calendar of small sticks were laid at the head, notch’d all over with the dismal days and nights he had passed there; - he had one of these little sticks in his hand, and, with a rusty nail he was etching another day of misery to add to the heap.  As I darkened the little light he had, he lifted up a hopeless eye towards the door, then cast it down, - shook his head, and went on with his work of affliction.  I heard his chains upon his legs, as he turned his body to lay his little stick upon the bundle. - He gave a deep sigh. - I saw the iron enter into his soul! - I burst into tears. - I could not sustain the picture of confinement which my fancy had drawn. - I started up from my chair, and calling La Fleur: I bid him bespeak me a remise, and have it ready at the door of the hotel by nine in the morning.

I’ll go directly, said I, myself to Monsieur le Duc de Choiseul.

La Fleur would have put me to bed; but - not willing he should see anything upon my cheek which would cost the honest fellow a heart-ache, - I told him I would go to bed by myself, - and bid him go do the same.


THE STARLING.  ROAD TO VERSAILLES.


I got into my remise the hour I proposed: La Fleur got up behind, and I bid the coachman make the best of his way to Versailles.

As there was nothing in this road, or rather nothing which I look for in travelling, I cannot fill up the blank better than with a short history of this self-same bird, which became the subject of the last chapter.

Whilst the Honourable Mr. - was waiting for a wind at Dover, it had been caught upon the cliffs, before it could well fly, by an English lad who was his groom; who, not caring to destroy it, had taken it in his breast into the packet; - and, by course of feeding it, and taking it once under his protection, in a day or two grew fond of it, and got it safe along with him to Paris.

At Paris the lad had laid out a livre in a little cage for the starling, and as he had little to do better the five months his master staid there, he taught it, in his mother’s tongue, the four simple words - (and no more) - to which I own’d myself so much its debtor.

Upon his master’s going on for Italy, the lad had given it to the master of the hotel.  But his little song for liberty being in an unknown language at Paris, the bird had little or no store set by him: so La Fleur bought both him and his cage for me for a bottle of Burgundy.

In my return from Italy I brought him with me to the country in whose language he had learned his notes; and telling the story of him to Lord A-, Lord A- begg’d the bird of me; - in a week Lord A- gave him to Lord B-; Lord B- made a present of him to Lord C-; and Lord C-’s gentleman sold him to Lord D-’s for a shilling; Lord D- gave him to Lord E-; and so on - half round the alphabet.  From that rank he pass’d into the lower house, and pass’d the hands of as many commoners.  But as all these wanted to get in, and my bird wanted to get out, he had almost as little store set by him in London as in Paris.

It is impossible but many of my readers must have heard of him; and if any by mere chance have ever seen him, I beg leave to inform them, that that bird was my bird, or some vile copy set up to represent him.

I have nothing farther to add upon him, but that from that time to this I have borne this poor starling as the crest to my arms. - Thus:

[Picture which cannot be reproduced]

- And let the herald’s officers twist his neck about if they dare.


THE ADDRESS.  VERSAILLES.


I should not like to have my enemy take a view of my mind when I am going to ask protection of any man; for which reason I generally endeavour to protect myself; but this going to Monsieur le Duc de C- was an act of compulsion; had it been an act of choice, I should have done it, I suppose, like other people.

How many mean plans of dirty address, as I went along, did my servile heart form!  I deserved the Bastile for every one of them.

Then nothing would serve me when I got within sight of Versailles, but putting words and sentences together, and conceiving attitudes and tones to wreath myself into Monsieur le Duc de C-’s good graces. - This will do, said I. - Just as well, retorted I again, as a coat carried up to him by an adventurous tailor, without taking his measure.  Fool! continued I, - see Monsieur le Duc’s face first; - observe what character is written in it; - take notice in what posture he stands to hear you; - mark the turns and expressions of his body and limbs; - and for the tone, - the first sound which comes from his lips will give it you; and from all these together you’ll compound an address at once upon the spot, which cannot disgust the Duke; - the ingredients are his own, and most likely to go down.

Well! said I, I wish it well over. - Coward again! as if man to man was not equal throughout the whole surface of the globe; and if in the field - why not face to face in the cabinet too?  And trust me, Yorick, whenever it is not so, man is false to himself and betrays his own succours ten times where nature does it once.  Go to the Duc de C- with the Bastile in thy looks; - my life for it, thou wilt be sent back to Paris in half an hour with an escort.

I believe so, said I. - Then I’ll go to the Duke, by heaven! with all the gaiety and debonairness in the world. -

- And there you are wrong again, replied I. - A heart at ease, Yorick, flies into no extremes - ’tis ever on its centre. - Well! well! cried I, as the coachman turn’d in at the gates, I find I shall do very well: and by the time he had wheel’d round the court, and brought me up to the door, I found myself so much the better for my own lecture, that I neither ascended the steps like a victim to justice, who was to part with life upon the top most, - nor did I mount them with a skip and a couple of strides, as I do when I fly up, Eliza! to thee to meet it.

As I entered the door of the saloon I was met by a person, who possibly might be the maître d’hôtel, but had more the air of one of the under secretaries, who told me the Duc de C- was busy. - I am utterly ignorant, said I, of the forms of obtaining an audience, being an absolute stranger, and what is worse in the present conjuncture of affairs, being an Englishman too. - He replied, that did not increase the difficulty. - I made him a slight bow, and told him, I had something of importance to say to Monsieur le Duc.  The secretary look’d towards the stairs, as if he was about to leave me to carry up this account to some one. - But I must not mislead you, said I, - for what I have to say is of no manner of importance to Monsieur le Duc de C- - but of great importance to myself. - C’est une autre affaire, replied he. - Not at all, said I, to a man of gallantry. - But pray, good sir, continued I, when can a stranger hope to have access? - In not less than two hours, said he, looking at his watch.  The number of equipages in the court-yard seemed to justify the calculation, that I could have no nearer a prospect; - and as walking backwards and forwards in the saloon, without a soul to commune with, was for the time as bad as being in the Bastile itself, I instantly went back to my remise, and bid the coachman drive me to the Cordon Bleu, which was the nearest hotel.

I think there is a fatality in it; - I seldom go to the place I set out for.


LE PATISSIER.  VERSAILLES.


Before I had got half way down the street I changed my mind: as I am at Versailles, thought I, I might as well take a view of the town; so I pull’d the cord, and ordered the coachman to drive round some of the principal streets. - I suppose the town is not very large, said I. - The coachman begg’d pardon for setting me right, and told me it was very superb, and that numbers of the first dukes and marquises and counts had hotels. - The Count de B-, of whom the bookseller at the Quai de Conti had spoke so handsomely the night before, came instantly into my mind. - And why should I not go, thought I, to the Count de B-, who has so high an idea of English books and English men - and tell him my story? so I changed my mind a second time. - In truth it was the third; for I had intended that day for Madame de R-, in the Rue St. Pierre, and had devoutly sent her word by her fille de chambre that I would assuredly wait upon her; - but I am governed by circumstances; - I cannot govern them: so seeing a man standing with a basket on the other side of the street, as if he had something to sell, I bid La Fleur go up to him, and enquire for the Count’s hotel.

La Fleur returned a little pale; and told me it was a Chevalier de St. Louis selling pâtés. - It is impossible, La Fleur, said I. - La Fleur could no more account for the phenomenon than myself; but persisted in his story: he had seen the croix set in gold, with its red riband, he said, tied to his buttonhole - and had looked into the basket and seen the pâtés which the Chevalier was selling; so could not be mistaken in that.

Such a reverse in man’s life awakens a better principle than curiosity: I could not help looking for some time at him as I sat in the remise: - the more I look’d at him, his croix, and his basket, the stronger they wove themselves into my brain. - I got out of the remise, and went towards him.

He was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees, and with a sort of a bib that went half way up his breast; upon the top of this, but a little below the hem, hung his croix.  His basket of little pâtés was covered over with a white damask napkin; another of the same kind was spread at the bottom; and there was a look of propreté and neatness throughout, that one might have bought his pâtés of him, as much from appetite as sentiment.

He made an offer of them to neither; but stood still with them at the corner of an hotel, for those to buy who chose it without solicitation.

He was about forty-eight; - of a sedate look, something approaching to gravity.  I did not wonder. - I went up rather to the basket than him, and having lifted up the napkin, and taking one of his pâtés into my hand, - I begg’d he would explain the appearance which affected me.

He told me in a few words, that the best part of his life had passed in the service, in which, after spending a small patrimony, he had obtained a company and the croix with it; but that, at the conclusion of the last peace, his regiment being reformed, and the whole corps, with those of some other regiments, left without any provision, he found himself in a wide world without friends, without a livre, - and indeed, said he, without anything but this, - (pointing, as he said it, to his croix). - The poor Chevalier won my pity, and he finished the scene with winning my esteem too.

The king, he said, was the most generous of princes, but his generosity could neither relieve nor reward everyone, and it was only his misfortune to be amongst the number.  He had a little wife, he said, whom he loved, who did the pâtisserie; and added, he felt no dishonour in defending her and himself from want in this way - unless Providence had offer’d him a better.

It would be wicked to withhold a pleasure from the good, in passing over what happen’d to this poor Chevalier of St. Louis about nine months after.

It seems he usually took his stand near the iron gates which lead up to the palace, and as his croix had caught the eyes of numbers, numbers had made the same enquiry which I had done. - He had told them the same story, and always with so much modesty and good sense, that it had reach’d at last the king’s ears; - who, hearing the Chevalier had been a gallant officer, and respected by the whole regiment as a man of honour and integrity, - he broke up his little trade by a pension of fifteen hundred livres a year.

As I have told this to please the reader, I beg he will allow me to relate another, out of its order, to please myself: - the two stories reflect light upon each other, - and ’tis a pity they should be parted.


THE SWORD.  RENNES.


When states and empires have their periods of declension, and feel in their turns what distress and poverty is, - I stop not to tell the causes which gradually brought the house d’E-, in Brittany, into decay.  The Marquis d’E- had fought up against his condition with great firmness; wishing to preserve, and still show to the world, some little fragments of what his ancestors had been; - their indiscretions had put it out of his power.  There was enough left for the little exigencies of obscurity. - But he had two boys who looked up to him for light; - he thought they deserved it.  He had tried his sword - it could not open the way, - the mounting was too expensive, - and simple economy was not a match for it: - there was no resource but commerce.

In any other province in France, save Brittany, this was smiting the root for ever of the little tree his pride and affection wish’d to see re-blossom. - But in Brittany, there being a provision for this, he avail’d himself of it; and, taking an occasion when the states were assembled at Rennes, the Marquis, attended with his two boys, entered the court; and having pleaded the right of an ancient law of the duchy, which, though seldom claim’d, he said, was no less in force, he took his sword from his side: - Here, said he, take it; and be trusty guardians of it, till better times put me in condition to reclaim it.

The president accepted the Marquis’s sword: he staid a few minutes to see it deposited in the archives of his house - and departed.

The Marquis and his whole family embarked the next clay for Martinico, and in about nineteen or twenty years of successful application to business, with some unlook’d for bequests from distant branches of his house, return home to reclaim his nobility, and to support it.

It was an incident of good fortune which will never happen to any traveller but a Sentimental one, that I should be at Rennes at the very time of this solemn requisition: I call it solemn; - it was so to me.

The Marquis entered the court with his whole family: he supported his lady, - his eldest son supported his sister, and his youngest was at the other extreme of the line next his mother; - he put his handkerchief to his face twice. -

- There was a dead silence.  When the Marquis had approached within six paces of the tribunal, he gave the Marchioness to his youngest son, and advancing three steps before his family, - he reclaim’d his sword.  His sword was given him, and the moment he got it into his hand he drew it almost out of the scabbard: - ’twas the shining face of a friend he had once given up - he look’d attentively along it, beginning at the hilt, as if to see whether it was the same, - when, observing a little rust which it had contracted near the point, he brought it near his eye, and bending his head down over it, - I think - I saw a tear fall upon the place.  I could not be deceived by what followed.

“I shall find,” said he, “some other way to get it off.”

When the Marquis had said this, he returned his sword into its scabbard, made a bow to the guardians of it, - and, with his wife and daughter, and his two sons following him, walk’d out.

O, how I envied him his feelings!


THE PASSPORT.  VERSAILLES.


I found no difficulty in getting admittance to Monsieur le Count de B-.  The set of Shakespeares was laid upon the table, and he was tumbling them over.  I walk’d up close to the table, and giving first such a look at the books as to make him conceive I knew what they were, - I told him I had come without any one to present me, knowing I should meet with a friend in his apartment, who, I trusted, would do it for me: - it is my countryman, the great Shakespeare, said I, pointing to his works - et ayez la bouté, mon cher ami, apostrophizing his spirit, added I, de me faire cet honneur-là. -

The Count smiled at the singularity of the introduction; and seeing I look’d a little pale and sickly, insisted upon my taking an arm-chair; so I sat down; and to save him conjectures upon a visit so out of all rule, I told him simply of the incident in the bookseller’s shop, and how that had impelled me rather to go to him with the story of a little embarrassment I was under, than to any other man in France. - And what is your embarrassment? let me hear it, said the Count.  So I told him the story just as I have told it the reader.

- And the master of my hotel, said I, as I concluded it, will needs have it, Monsieur le Count, that I shall be sent to the Bastile; - but I have no apprehensions, continued I; - for, in falling into the hands of the most polish’d people in the world, and being conscious I was a true man, and not come to spy the nakedness of the land, I scarce thought I lay at their mercy. - It does not suit the gallantry of the French, Monsieur le Count, said I, to show it against invalids.

An animated blush came into the Count de B-’s cheeks as I spoke this. - Ne craignez rien - Don’t fear, said he. - Indeed, I don’t, replied I again. - Besides, continued I, a little sportingly, I have come laughing all the way from London to Paris, and I do not think Monsieur le Duc de Choiseul is such an enemy to mirth as to send me back crying for my pains.

- My application to you, Monsieur le Count de B- (making him a low bow), is to desire he will not.

The Count heard me with great good nature, or I had not said half as much, - and once or twice said, - C’est bien dit.  So I rested my cause there - and determined to say no more about it.

The Count led the discourse: we talk’d of indifferent things, - of books, and politics, and men; - and then of women. - God bless them all! said I, after much discourse about them - there is not a man upon earth who loves them so much as I do: after all the foibles I have seen, and all the satires I have read against them, still I love them; being firmly persuaded that a man, who has not a sort of affection for the whole sex, is incapable of ever loving a single one as he ought.

Eh bien!  Monsieur l’Anglois, said the Count, gaily; - you are not come to spy the nakedness of the land; - I believe you; - ni encore, I dare say, that of our women! - But permit me to conjecture, - if, par hazard, they fell into your way, that the prospect would not affect you.

I have something within me which cannot bear the shock of the least indecent insinuation: in the sportability of chit-chat I have often endeavoured to conquer it, and with infinite pain have hazarded a thousand things to a dozen of the sex together, - the least of which I could not venture to a single one to gain heaven.

Excuse me, Monsieur le Count, said I; - as for the nakedness of your land, if I saw it, I should cast my eyes over it with tears in them; - and for that of your women (blushing at the idea he had excited in me) I am so evangelical in this, and have such a fellow-feeling for whatever is weak about them, that I would cover it with a garment if I knew how to throw it on: - But I could wish, continued I, to spy the nakedness of their hearts, and through the different disguises of customs, climates, and religion, find out what is good in them to fashion my own by: - and therefore am I come.

It is for this reason, Monsieur le Count, continued I, that I have not seen the Palais Royal, - nor the Luxembourg, - nor the Façade of the Louvre, - nor have attempted to swell the catalogues we have of pictures, statues, and churches. - I conceive every fair being as a temple, and would rather enter in, and see the original drawings and loose sketches hung up in it, than the Transfiguration of Raphael itself.

The thirst of this, continued I, as impatient as that which inflames the breast of the connoisseur, has led me from my own home into France, - and from France will lead me through Italy; - ’tis a quiet journey of the heart in pursuit of Nature, and those affections which arise out of her, which make us love each other, - and the world, better than we do.

The Count said a great many civil things to me upon the occasion; and added very politely, how much he stood obliged to Shakespeare for making me known to him. - But a propos, said he; - Shakespeare is full of great things; - he forgot a small punctilio of announcing your name: - it puts you under a necessity of doing it yourself.


THE PASSPORT.  VERSAILLES.


There is not a more perplexing affair in life to me, than to set about telling any one who I am, - for there is scarce any body I cannot give a better account of than myself; and I have often wished I could do it in a single word, - and have an end of it.  It was the only time and occasion in my life I could accomplish this to any purpose; - for Shakespeare lying upon the table, and recollecting I was in his books, I took up Hamlet, and turning immediately to the grave-diggers’ scene in the fifth act, I laid my finger upon Yorick, and advancing the book to the Count, with my finger all the way over the name, - Me voici! said I.

Now, whether the idea of poor Yorick’s skull was put out of the Count’s mind by the reality of my own, or by what magic he could drop a period of seven or eight hundred years, makes nothing in this account; - ’tis certain the French conceive better than they combine; - I wonder at nothing in this world, and the less at this; inasmuch as one of the first of our own Church, for whose candour and paternal sentiments I have the highest veneration, fell into the same mistake in the very same case: - “He could not bear,” he said, “to look into the sermons wrote by the King of Denmark’s jester.”  Good, my Lord said I; but there are two Yoricks.  The Yorick your Lordship thinks of, has been dead and buried eight hundred years ago; he flourished in Horwendillus’s court; - the other Yorick is myself, who have flourished, my Lord, in no court. - He shook his head.  Good God! said I, you might as well confound Alexander the Great with Alexander the Coppersmith, my lord! - “’Twas all one,” he replied. -

- If Alexander, King of Macedon, could have translated your Lordship, said I, I’m sure your Lordship would not have said so.

The poor Count de B- fell but into the same error.

- Et, Monsieur, est-il Yorick? cried the Count. - Je le suis, said I. - Vous? - Moi, - moi qui ai l’honneur de vous parler, Monsieur le Comte. - Mon Dieu! said he, embracing me, - Vous êtes Yorick!

The Count instantly put the Shakespeare into his pocket, and left me alone in his room.


THE PASSPORT.  VERSAILLES.


I could not conceive why the Count de B- had gone so abruptly out of the room, any more than I could conceive why he had put the Shakespeare into his pocket. -

Mysteries which must explain themselves are not worth the loss of time which a conjecture about them takes up: ’twas better to read Shakespeare; so taking up “Much Ado About Nothing,” I transported myself instantly from the chair I sat in to Messina in Sicily, and got so busy with Don Pedro, and Benedict, and Beatrice, that I thought not of Versailles, the Count, or the passport.

Sweet pliability of man’s spirit, that can at once surrender itself to illusions, which cheat expectation and sorrow of their weary moments! - Long, - long since had ye number’d out my days, had I not trod so great a part of them upon this enchanted ground.  When my way is too rough for my feet, or too steep for my strength, I get off it, to some smooth velvet path, which Fancy has scattered over with rosebuds of delights; and having taken a few turns in it, come back strengthened and refresh’d. - When evils press sore upon me, and there is no retreat from them in this world, then I take a new course; - I leave it, - and as I have a clearer idea of the Elysian fields than I have of heaven, I force myself, like AEneas, into them. - I see him meet the pensive shade of his forsaken Dido, and wish to recognise it; - I see the injured spirit wave her head, and turn off silent from the author of her miseries and dishonours; - I lose the feelings for myself in hers, and in those affections which were wont to make me mourn for her when I was at school.

Surely this is not walking in a vain shadow - nor does man disquiet himself in vain by it: - he oftener does so in trusting the issue of his commotions to reason only. - I can safely say for myself, I was never able to conquer any one single bad sensation in my heart so decisively, as beating up as fast as I could for some kindly and gentle sensation to fight it upon its own ground

When I had got to the end of the third act the Count de B- entered, with my passport in his hand.  Monsieur le Duc de C-, said the Count, is as good a prophet, I dare say, as he is a statesman.  Un homme qui rit, said the Duke, ne sera jamais dangereux. - Had it been for any one but the king’s jester, added the Count, I could not have got it these two hours. - Pardonnez moi, Monsieur le Count, said I - I am not the king’s jester. - But you are Yorick? - Yes. - Et vous plaisantez? - I answered, Indeed I did jest, - but was not paid for it; - ’twas entirely at my own expense.

We have no jester at court, Monsieur le Count, said I; the last we had was in the licentious reign of Charles II.; - since which time our manners have been so gradually refining, that our court at present is so full of patriots, who wish for nothing but the honours and wealth of their country; - and our ladies are all so chaste, so spotless, so good, so devout, - there is nothing for a jester to make a jest of. -

Voila un persiflage! cried the Count.


THE PASSPORT.  VERSAILLES.


As the passport was directed to all lieutenant-governors, governors, and commandants of cities, generals of armies, justiciaries, and all officers of justice, to let Mr. Yorick the king’s jester, and his baggage, travel quietly along, I own the triumph of obtaining the passport was not a little tarnish’d by the figure I cut in it. - But there is nothing unmix’d in this world; and some of the gravest of our divines have carried it so far as to affirm, that enjoyment itself was attended even with a sigh, - and that the greatest they knew of terminated, in a general way, in little better than a convulsion.

I remember the grave and learned Bevoriskius, in his Commentary upon the Generations from Adam, very naturally breaks off in the middle of a note to give an account to the world of a couple of sparrows upon the out-edge of his window, which had incommoded him all the time he wrote, and at last had entirely taken him off from his genealogy.

- ’Tis strange! writes Bevoriskius; but the facts are certain, for I have had the curiosity to mark them down one by one with my pen; - but the cock sparrow, during the little time that I could have finished the other half of this note, has actually interrupted me with the reiteration of his caresses three-and-twenty times and a half.

How merciful, adds Bevoriskius, is heaven to his creatures!

Ill fated Yorick! that the gravest of thy brethren should be able to write that to the world, which stains thy face with crimson to copy, even in thy study.

But this is nothing to my travels. - So I twice, - twice beg pardon for it.


CHARACTER.  VERSAILLES.


And how do you find the French? said the Count de B-, after he had given me the passport.

The reader may suppose, that after so obliging a proof of courtesy, I could not be at a loss to say something handsome to the enquiry.

- Mais passe, pour cela. - Speak frankly, said he: do you find all the urbanity in the French which the world give us the honour of? - I had found every thing, I said, which confirmed it. - Vraiment, said the Count, les François sont polis. - To an excess, replied I.

The Count took notice of the word excès; and would have it I meant more than I said.  I defended myself a long time as well as I could against it. - He insisted I had a reserve, and that I would speak my opinion frankly.

I believe, Monsieur le Count, said I, that man has a certain compass, as well as an instrument; and that the social and other calls have occasion by turns for every key in him; so that if you begin a note too high or too low, there must be a want either in the upper or under part, to fill up the system of harmony. - The Count de B- did not understand music, so desired me to explain it some other way.  A polish’d nation, my dear Count, said I, makes every one its debtor: and besides, Urbanity itself, like the fair sex, has so many charms, it goes against the heart to say it can do ill; and yet, I believe, there is but a certain line of perfection, that man, take him altogether, is empower’d to arrive at: - if he gets beyond, he rather exchanges qualities than gets them.  I must not presume to say how far this has affected the French in the subject we are speaking of; - but, should it ever be the case of the English, in the progress of their refinements, to arrive at the same polish which distinguishes the French, if we did not lose the politesse du coeur, which inclines men more to humane actions than courteous ones, - we should at least lose that distinct variety and originality of character, which distinguishes them, not only from each other, but from all the world besides.

I had a few of King William’s shillings, as smooth as glass, in my pocket; and foreseeing they would be of use in the illustration of my hypothesis, I had got them into my hand when I had proceeded so far: -

See, Monsieur le Count, said I, rising up, and laying them before him upon the table, - by jingling and rubbing one against another for seventy years together in one body’s pocket or another’s, they are become so much alike, you can scarce distinguish one shilling from another.

The English, like ancient medals, kept more apart, and passing but few people’s hands, preserve the first sharpnesses which the fine hand of Nature has given them; - they are not so pleasant to feel, - but in return the legend is so visible, that at the first look you see whose image and superscription they bear. - But the French, Monsieur le Count, added I (wishing to soften what I had said), have so many excellences, they can the better spare this; - they are a loyal, a gallant, a generous, an ingenious, and good temper’d people as is under heaven; - if they have a fault - they are too serious.

Mon Dieu! cried the Count, rising out of his chair.

Mais vous plaisantez, said he, correcting his exclamation. - I laid my hand upon my breast, and with earnest gravity assured him it was my most settled opinion.

The Count said he was mortified he could not stay to hear my reasons, being engaged to go that moment to dine with the Duc de C-.

But if it is not too far to come to Versailles to eat your soup with me, I beg, before you leave France, I may have the pleasure of knowing you retract your opinion, - or, in what manner you support it. - But, if you do support it, Monsieur Anglois, said he, you must do it with all your powers, because you have the whole world against you. - I promised the Count I would do myself the honour of dining with him before I set out for Italy; - so took my leave.


THE TEMPTATION.  PARIS.


When I alighted at the hotel, the porter told me a young woman with a bandbox had been that moment enquiring for me. - I do not know, said the porter, whether she is gone away or not.  I took the key of my chamber of him, and went upstairs; and when I had got within ten steps of the top of the landing before my door, I met her coming easily down.

It was the fair fille de chambre I had walked along the Quai de Conti with; Madame de R- had sent her upon some commission to a marchande des modes within a step or two of the Hôtel de Modene; and as I had fail’d in waiting upon her, had bid her enquire if I had left Paris; and if so, whether I had not left a letter addressed to her.

As the fair fille de chambre was so near my door, she returned back, and went into the room with me for a moment or two whilst I wrote a card.

It was a fine still evening in the latter end of the month of May, - the crimson window curtains (which were of the same colour as those of the bed) were drawn close: - the sun was setting, and reflected through them so warm a tint into the fair fille de chambre’s face, - I thought she blush’d; - the idea of it made me blush myself: - we were quite alone; and that superinduced a second blush before the first could get off.

There is a sort of a pleasing half guilty blush, where the blood is more in fault than the man: - ’tis sent impetuous from the heart, and virtue flies after it, - not to call it back, but to make the sensation of it more delicious to the nerves: - ’tis associated. -

But I’ll not describe it; - I felt something at first within me which was not in strict unison with the lesson of virtue I had given her the night before. - I sought five minutes for a card; - I knew I had not one. - I took up a pen. - I laid it down again; - my hand trembled: - the devil was in me.

I know as well as any one he is an adversary, whom, if we resist, he will fly from us; - but I seldom resist him at all; from a terror, though I may conquer, I may still get a hurt in the combat; - so I give up the triumph for security; and, instead of thinking to make him fly, I generally fly myself.

The fair fille de chambre came close up to the bureau where I was looking for a card - took up first the pen I cast down, then offer’d to hold me the ink; she offer’d it so sweetly, I was going to accept it; - but I durst not; - I have nothing, my dear, said I, to write upon. - Write it, said she, simply, upon anything. -

I was just going to cry out, Then I will write it, fair girl! upon thy lips. -

If I do, said I, I shall perish; - so I took her by the hand, and led her to the door, and begg’d she would not forget the lesson I had given her. - She said, indeed she would not; - and, as she uttered it with some earnestness, she turn’d about, and gave me both her hands, closed together, into mine; - it was impossible not to compress them in that situation; - I wish’d to let them go; and all the time I held them, I kept arguing within myself against it, - and still I held them on. - In two minutes I found I had all the battle to fight over again; - and I felt my legs and every limb about me tremble at the idea.

The foot of the bed was within a yard and a half of the place where we were standing. - I had still hold of her hands - and how it happened I can give no account; but I neither ask’d her - nor drew her - nor did I think of the bed; - but so it did happen, we both sat down.

I’ll just show you, said the fair fille de chambre, the little purse I have been making to-day to hold your crown.  So she put her hand into her right pocket, which was next me, and felt for it some time - then into the left. - “She had lost it.” - I never bore expectation more quietly; - it was in her right pocket at last; - she pull’d it out; it was of green taffeta, lined with a little bit of white quilted satin, and just big enough to hold the crown: she put it into my hand; - it was pretty; and I held it ten minutes with the back of my hand resting upon her lap - looking sometimes at the purse, sometimes on one side of it.

A stitch or two had broke out in the gathers of my stock; the fair fille de chambre, without saying a word, took out her little housewife, threaded a small needle, and sew’d it up. - I foresaw it would hazard the glory of the day; and, as she pass’d her hand in silence across and across my neck in the manoeuvre, I felt the laurels shake which fancy had wreath’d about my head.

A strap had given way in her walk, and the buckle of her shoe was just falling off. - See, said the fille de chambre, holding up her foot. - I could not, for my soul but fasten the buckle in return, and putting in the strap, - and lifting up the other foot with it, when I had done, to see both were right, - in doing it too suddenly, it unavoidably threw the fair fille de chambre off her centre, - and then -


THE CONQUEST.


Yes, - and then -.  Ye whose clay-cold heads and luke-warm hearts can argue down or mask your passions, tell me, what trespass is it that man should have them? or how his spirit stands answerable to the Father of spirits but for his conduct under them?

If Nature has so wove her web of kindness, that some threads of love and desire are entangled with the piece, - must the whole web be rent in drawing them out? - Whip me such stoics, great Governor of Nature! said I to myself: - wherever thy providence shall place me for the trials of my virtue; - whatever is my danger, - whatever is my situation, - let me feel the movements which rise out of it, and which belong to me as a man, - and, if I govern them as a good one, I will trust the issues to thy justice; for thou hast made us, and not we ourselves.

As I finished my address, I raised the fair fille de chambre up by the hand, and led her out of the room: - she stood by me till I locked the door and put the key in my pocket, - and then, - the victory being quite decisive - and not till then, I press’d my lips to her cheek, and taking her by the hand again, led her safe to the gate of the hotel.


THE MYSTERY.  PARIS.


If a man knows the heart, he will know it was impossible to go back instantly to my chamber; - it was touching a cold key with a flat third to it upon the close of a piece of music, which had call’d forth my affections: - therefore, when I let go the hand of the fille de chambre, I remained at the gate of the hotel for some time, looking at every one who pass’d by, - and forming conjectures upon them, till my attention got fix’d upon a single object which confounded all kind of reasoning upon him.

It was a tall figure of a philosophic, serious, adust look, which passed and repass’d sedately along the street, making a turn of about sixty paces on each side of the gate of the hotel; - the man was about fifty-two - had a small cane under his arm - was dress’d in a dark drab-colour’d coat, waistcoat, and breeches, which seem’d to have seen some years service: - they were still clean, and there was a little air of frugal propreté throughout him.  By his pulling off his hat, and his attitude of accosting a good many in his way, I saw he was asking charity: so I got a sous or two out of my pocket ready to give him, as he took me in his turn. - He pass’d by me without asking anything - and yet did not go five steps further before he ask’d charity of a little woman. - I was much more likely to have given of the two. - He had scarce done with the woman, when he pull’d off his hat to another who was coming the same way. - An ancient gentleman came slowly - and, after him, a young smart one. - He let them both pass, and ask’d nothing.  I stood observing him half an hour, in which time he had made a dozen turns backwards and forwards, and found that he invariably pursued the same plan.

There were two things very singular in this, which set my brain to work, and to no purpose: - the first was, why the man should only tell his story to the sex; - and, secondly, - what kind of story it was, and what species of eloquence it could be, which soften’d the hearts of the women, which he knew ’twas to no purpose to practise upon the men.

There were two other circumstances, which entangled this mystery; - the one was, he told every woman what he had to say in her ear, and in a way which had much more the air of a secret than a petition; - the other was, it was always successful. - He never stopp’d a woman, but she pull’d out her purse, and immediately gave him something.

I could form no system to explain the phenomenon.

I had got a riddle to amuse me for the rest of the evening; so I walk’d upstairs to my chamber.


THE CASE OF CONSCIENCE.  PARIS.


I was immediately followed up by the master of the hotel, who came into my room to tell me I must provide lodgings elsewhere. - How so, friend? said I. - He answered, I had had a young woman lock’d up with me two hours that evening in my bedchamber, and ’twas against the rules of his house. - Very well, said I, we’ll all part friends then, - for the girl is no worse, - and I am no worse, - and you will be just as I found you. - It was enough, he said, to overthrow the credit of his hotel. - Voyez vous, Monsieur, said he, pointing to the foot of the bed we had been sitting upon. - I own it had something of the appearance of an evidence; but my pride not suffering me to enter into any detail of the case, I exhorted him to let his soul sleep in peace, as I resolved to let mine do that night, and that I would discharge what I owed him at breakfast.

I should not have minded, Monsieur, said he, if you had had twenty girls - ’Tis a score more, replied I, interrupting him, than I ever reckon’d upon - Provided, added he, it had been but in a morning. - And does the difference of the time of the day at Paris make a difference in the sin? - It made a difference, he said, in the scandal. - I like a good distinction in my heart; and cannot say I was intolerably out of temper with the man. - I own it is necessary, resumed the master of the hotel, that a stranger at Paris should have the opportunities presented to him of buying lace and silk stockings and ruffles, et tout cela; - and ’tis nothing if a woman comes with a band-box. - O, my conscience! said I, she had one but I never look’d into it. - Then Monsieur, said he, has bought nothing? - Not one earthly thing, replied I. - Because, said he, I could recommend one to you who would use you en conscience. - But I must see her this night, said I. - He made me a low bow, and walk’d down.

Now shall I triumph over this maître d’hôtel, cried I, - and what then?  Then I shall let him see I know he is a dirty fellow. - And what then?  What then? - I was too near myself to say it was for the sake of others. - I had no good answer left; - there was more of spleen than principle in my project, and I was sick of it before the execution.

In a few minutes the grisette came in with her box of lace. - I’ll buy nothing, however, said I, within myself.

The grisette would show me everything. - I was hard to please: she would not seem to see it; she opened her little magazine, and laid all her laces one after another before me; - unfolded and folded them up again one by one with the most patient sweetness. - I might buy, - or not; - she would let me have everything at my own price: - the poor creature seem’d anxious to get a penny; and laid herself out to win me, and not so much in a manner which seem’d artful, as in one I felt simple and caressing.

If there is not a fund of honest gullibility in man, so much the worse; - my heart relented, and I gave up my second resolution as quietly as the first. - Why should I chastise one for the trespass of another?  If thou art tributary to this tyrant of an host, thought I, looking up in her face, so much harder is thy bread.

If I had not had more than four louis d’ors in my purse, there was no such thing as rising up and showing her the door, till I had first laid three of them out in a pair of ruffles.

- The master of the hotel will share the profit with her; - no matter, - then I have only paid as many a poor soul has paid before me, for an act he could not do, or think of.


THE RIDDLE.  PARIS.


When La Fleur came up to wait upon me at supper, he told me how sorry the master of the hotel was for his affront to me in bidding me change my lodgings.

A man who values a good night’s rest will not lie down with enmity in his heart, if he can help it. - So I bid La Fleur tell the master of the hotel, that I was sorry on my side for the occasion I had given him; - and you may tell him, if you will, La Fleur, added I, that if the young woman should call again, I shall not see her.

This was a sacrifice not to him, but myself, having resolved, after so narrow an escape, to run no more risks, but to leave Paris, if it was possible, with all the virtue I enter’d it.

C’est déroger à noblesse, Monsieur, said La Fleur, making me a bow down to the ground as he said it. - Et encore, Monsieur, said he, may change his sentiments; - and if (par hazard) he should like to amuse himself, - I find no amusement in it, said I, interrupting him. -

Mon Dieu! said La Fleur, - and took away.

In an hour’s time he came to put me to bed, and was more than commonly officious: - something hung upon his lips to say to me, or ask me, which he could not get off: I could not conceive what it was, and indeed gave myself little trouble to find it out, as I had another riddle so much more interesting upon my mind, which was that of the man’s asking charity before the door of the hotel. - I would have given anything to have got to the bottom of it; and that, not out of curiosity, - ’tis so low a principle of enquiry, in general, I would not purchase the gratification of it with a two-sous piece; - but a secret, I thought, which so soon and so certainly soften’d the heart of every woman you came near, was a secret at least equal to the philosopher’s stone; had I both the Indies, I would have given up one to have been master of it.

I toss’d and turn’d it almost all night long in my brains to no manner of purpose; and when I awoke in the morning, I found my spirits as much troubled with my dreams, as ever the King of Babylon had been with his; and I will not hesitate to affirm, it would have puzzled all the wise men of Paris as much as those of Chaldea to have given its interpretation.


LE DIMANCHE.  PARIS.


It was Sunday; and when La Fleur came in, in the morning, with my coffee and roll and butter, he had got himself so gallantly array’d, I scarce knew him.

I had covenanted at Montreuil to give him a new hat with a silver button and loop, and four louis d’ors, pour s’adoniser, when we got to Paris; and the poor fellow, to do him justice, had done wonders with it.

He had bought a bright, clean, good scarlet coat, and a pair of breeches of the same. - They were not a crown worse, he said, for the wearing. - I wish’d him hang’d for telling me. - They look’d so fresh, that though I knew the thing could not be done, yet I would rather have imposed upon my fancy with thinking I had bought them new for the fellow, than that they had come out of the Rue de Friperie.

This is a nicety which makes not the heart sore at Paris.

He had purchased, moreover, a handsome blue satin waistcoat, fancifully enough embroidered: - this was indeed something the worse for the service it had done, but ’twas clean scour’d; - the gold had been touch’d up, and upon the whole was rather showy than otherwise; - and as the blue was not violent, it suited with the coat and breeches very well: he had squeez’d out of the money, moreover, a new bag and a solitaire; and had insisted with the fripier upon a gold pair of garters to his breeches knees. - He had purchased muslin ruffles, bien brodées, with four livres of his own money; - and a pair of white silk stockings for five more; - and to top all, nature had given him a handsome figure, without costing him a sous.

He entered the room thus set off, with his hair dressed in the first style, and with a handsome bouquet in his breast. - In a word, there was that look of festivity in everything about him, which at once put me in mind it was Sunday; - and, by combining both together, it instantly struck me, that the favour he wish’d to ask of me the night before, was to spend the day as every body in Paris spent it besides.  I had scarce made the conjecture, when La Fleur, with infinite humility, but with a look of trust, as if I should not refuse him, begg’d I would grant him the day, pour faire le galant vis-à-vis de sa maîtresse.

Now it was the very thing I intended to do myself vis-à-vis Madame de R-. - I had retained the remise on purpose for it, and it would not have mortified my vanity to have had a servant so well dress’d as La Fleur was, to have got up behind it: I never could have worse spared him.

But we must feel, not argue in these embarrassments. - The sons and daughters of Service part with liberty, but not with nature, in their contracts; they are flesh and blood, and have their little vanities and wishes in the midst of the house of bondage, as well as their task-masters; - no doubt, they have set their self-denials at a price, - and their expectations are so unreasonable, that I would often disappoint them, but that their condition puts it so much in my power to do it.

Behold, - Behold, I am thy servant - disarms me at once of the powers of a master. -

Thou shalt go, La Fleur! said I.

- And what mistress, La Fleur, said I, canst thou have picked up in so little a time at Paris?  La Fleur laid his hand upon his breast, and said ’twas a petite demoiselle, at Monsieur le Count de B-’s. - La Fleur had a heart made for society; and, to speak the truth of him, let as few occasions slip him as his master; - so that somehow or other, - but how, - heaven knows, - he had connected himself with the demoiselle upon the landing of the staircase, during the time I was taken up with my passport; and as there was time enough for me to win the Count to my interest, La Fleur had contrived to make it do to win the maid to his.  The family, it seems, was to be at Paris that day, and he had made a party with her, and two or three more of the Count’s household, upon the boulevards.

Happy people! that once a week at least are sure to lay down all your cares together, and dance and sing and sport away the weights of grievance, which bow down the spirit of other nations to the earth.


THE FRAGMENT.  PARIS.


La Fleur had left me something to amuse myself with for the day more than I had bargain’d for, or could have enter’d either into his head or mine.

He had brought the little print of butter upon a currant leaf: and as the morning was warm, and he had a good step to bring it, he had begg’d a sheet of waste paper to put betwixt the currant leaf and his hand. - As that was plate sufficient, I bade him lay it upon the table as it was; and as I resolved to stay within all day, I ordered him to call upon the traîteur, to bespeak my dinner, and leave me to breakfast by myself.

When I had finished the butter, I threw the currant-leaf out of the window, and was going to do the same by the waste paper; - but stopping to read a line first, and that drawing me on to a second and third, - I thought it better worth; so I shut the window, and drawing a chair up to it, I sat down to read it.

It was in the old French of Rabelais’s time, and for aught I know might have been wrote by him: - it was moreover in a Gothic letter, and that so faded and gone off by damps and length of time, it cost me infinite trouble to make anything of it. - I threw it down; and then wrote a letter to Eugenius; - then I took it up again, and embroiled my patience with it afresh; - and then to cure that, I wrote a letter to Eliza. - Still it kept hold of me; and the difficulty of understanding it increased but the desire.

I got my dinner; and after I had enlightened my mind with a bottle of Burgundy; I at it again, - and, after two or three hours poring upon it, with almost as deep attention as ever Gruter or Jacob Spon did upon a nonsensical inscription, I thought I made sense of it; but to make sure of it, the best way, I imagined, was to turn it into English, and see how it would look then; - so I went on leisurely, as a trifling man does, sometimes writing a sentence, - then taking a turn or two, - and then looking how the world went, out of the window; so that it was nine o’clock at night before I had done it. - I then began and read it as follows.


THE FRAGMENT.  PARIS.


- Now, as the notary’s wife disputed the point with the notary with too much heat, - I wish, said the notary, (throwing down the parchment) that there was another notary here only to set down and attest all this. -

- And what would you do then, Monsieur? said she, rising hastily up. - The notary’s wife was a little fume of a woman, and the notary thought it well to avoid a hurricane by a mild reply. - I would go, answered he, to bed. - You may go to the devil, answer’d the notary’s wife.

Now there happening to be but one bed in the house, the other two rooms being unfurnished, as is the custom at Paris, and the notary not caring to lie in the same bed with a woman who had but that moment sent him pell mell to the devil, went forth with his hat and cane and short cloak, the night being very windy, and walk’d out, ill at ease, towards the Pont Neuf.

Of all the bridges which ever were built, the whole world who have pass’d over the Pont Neuf must own, that it is the noblest, - the finest, - the grandest, - the lightest, - the longest, - the broadest, that ever conjoin’d land and land together upon the face of the terraqueous globe.

[By this it seems as if the author of the fragment had not been a Frenchman.]

The worst fault which divines and the doctors of the Sorbonne can allege against it is, that if there is but a capfull of wind in or about Paris, ’tis more blasphemously sacre Dieu’d there than in any other aperture of the whole city, - and with reason good and cogent, Messieurs; for it comes against you without crying garde d’eau, and with such unpremeditable puffs, that of the few who cross it with their hats on, not one in fifty but hazards two livres and a half, which is its full worth.

The poor notary, just as he was passing by the sentry, instinctively clapp’d his cane to the side of it, but in raising it up, the point of his cane catching hold of the loop of the sentinel’s hat, hoisted it over the spikes of the ballustrade clear into the Seine. -

- ’Tis an ill wind, said a boatman, who catched it, which blows nobody any good.

The sentry, being a Gascon, incontinently twirled up his whiskers, and levell’d his arquebuss.

Arquebusses in those days went off with matches; and an old woman’s paper lantern at the end of the bridge happening to be blown out, she had borrow’d the sentry’s match to light it: - it gave a moment’s time for the Gascon’s blood to run cool, and turn the accident better to his advantage. - ’Tis an ill wind, said he, catching off the notary’s castor, and legitimating the capture with the boatman’s adage.

The poor notary crossed the bridge, and passing along the Rue de Dauphine into the fauxbourgs of St. Germain, lamented himself as he walked along in this manner: -

Luckless man that I am! said the notary, to be the sport of hurricanes all my days: - to be born to have the storm of ill language levell’d against me and my profession wherever I go; to be forced into marriage by the thunder of the church to a tempest of a woman; - to be driven forth out of my house by domestic winds, and despoil’d of my castor by pontific ones! - to be here, bareheaded, in a windy night, at the mercy of the ebbs and flows of accidents! - Where am I to lay my head? - Miserable man! what wind in the two-and-thirty points of the whole compass can blow unto thee, as it does to the rest of thy fellow-creatures, good?

As the notary was passing on by a dark passage, complaining in this sort, a voice call’d out to a girl, to bid her run for the next notary. - Now the notary being the next, and availing himself of his situation, walk’d up the passage to the door, and passing through an old sort of a saloon, was usher’d into a large chamber, dismantled of everything but a long military pike, - a breastplate, - a rusty old sword, and bandoleer, hung up, equidistant, in four different places against the wall.

An old personage who had heretofore been a gentleman, and unless decay of fortune taints the blood along with it, was a gentleman at that time, lay supporting his head upon his hand in his bed; a little table with a taper burning was set close beside it, and close by the table was placed a chair: - the notary sat him down in it; and pulling out his inkhorn and a sheet or two of paper which he had in his pocket, he placed them before him; and dipping his pen in his ink, and leaning his breast over the table, he disposed everything to make the gentleman’s last will and testament

Alas!  Monsieur le Notaire, said the gentleman, raising himself up a little, I have nothing to bequeath, which will pay the expense of bequeathing, except the history of myself, which I could not die in peace, unless I left it as a legacy to the world: the profits arising out of it I bequeath to you for the pains of taking it from me. - It is a story so uncommon, it must be read by all mankind; - it will make the fortunes of your house. - The notary dipp’d his pen into his inkhorn. - Almighty Director of every event in my life! said the old gentleman, looking up earnestly, and raising his hands towards heaven, - Thou, whose hand has led me on through such a labyrinth of strange passages down into this scene of desolation, assist the decaying memory of an old, infirm, and broken-hearted man; - direct my tongue by the spirit of thy eternal truth, that this stranger may set down nought but what is written in that BOOK, from whose records, said he, clasping his hands together, I am to be condemn’d or acquitted! - the notary held up the point of his pen betwixt the taper and his eye. -

It is a story, Monsieur le Notaire, said the gentleman, which will rouse up every affection in nature; - it will kill the humane, and touch the heart of Cruelty herself with pity. -

- The notary was inflamed with a desire to begin, and put his pen a third time into his ink-horn - and the old gentleman, turning a little more towards the notary, began to dictate his story in these words: -

- And where is the rest of it, La Fleur? said I, as he just then enter’d the room.


THE FRAGMENT, AND THE BOUQUET.  PARIS.


When La Fleur came up close to the table, and was made to comprehend what I wanted, he told me there were only two other sheets of it, which he had wrapped round the stalks of a bouquet to keep it together, which he had presented to the demoiselle upon the boulevards. - Then prithee, La Fleur, said I, step back to her to the Count de B-’s hotel, and see if thou canst get it. - There is no doubt of it, said La Fleur; - and away he flew.

In a very little time the poor fellow came back quite out of breath, with deeper marks of disappointment in his looks than could arise from the simple irreparability of the fragment.  Juste Ciel! in less than two minutes that the poor fellow had taken his last tender farewell of her - his faithless mistress had given his gage d’amour to one of the Count’s footmen, - the footman to a young sempstress, - and the sempstress to a fiddler, with my fragment at the end of it. - Our misfortunes were involved together: - I gave a sigh, - and La Fleur echoed it back again to my ear.

- How perfidious! cried La Fleur. - How unlucky! said I.

- I should not have been mortified, Monsieur, quoth La Fleur, if she had lost it. - Nor I, La Fleur, said I, had I found it.

Whether I did or no will be seen hereafter.


THE ACT OF CHARITY.  PARIS.


The man who either disdains or fears to walk up a dark entry may be an excellent good man, and fit for a hundred things, but he will not do to make a good Sentimental Traveller. - I count little of the many things I see pass at broad noonday, in large and open streets. - Nature is shy, and hates to act before spectators; but in such an unobserved corner you sometimes see a single short scene of hers worth all the sentiments of a dozen French plays compounded together, - and yet they are absolutely fine; - and whenever I have a more brilliant affair upon my hands than common, as they suit a preacher just as well as a hero, I generally make my sermon out of ’em; - and for the text, - “Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia,” - is as good as any one in the Bible.

There is a long dark passage issuing out from the Opera Comique into a narrow street; ’tis trod by a few who humbly wait for a fiacre, or wish to get off quietly o’foot when the opera is done.  At the end of it, towards the theatre, ’tis lighted by a small candle, the light of which is almost lost before you get half-way down, but near the door - ’tis more for ornament than use: you see it as a fixed star of the least magnitude; it burns, - but does little good to the world, that we know of.

In returning along this passage, I discerned, as I approached within five or six paces of the door, two ladies standing arm-in-arm with their backs against the wall, waiting, as I imagined, for a fiacre; - as they were next the door, I thought they had a prior right; so edged myself up within a yard or little more of them, and quietly took my stand. - I was in black, and scarce seen.

The lady next me was a tall lean figure of a woman, of about thirty-six; the other of the same size and make, of about forty: there was no mark of wife or widow in any one part of either of them; - they seem’d to be two upright vestal sisters, unsapped by caresses, unbroke in upon by tender salutations. - I could have wish’d to have made them happy: - their happiness was destin’d that night, to come from another quarter.

A low voice, with a good turn of expression, and sweet cadence at the end of it, begg’d for a twelve-sous piece betwixt them, for the love of heaven.  I thought it singular that a beggar should fix the quota of an alms - and that the sum should be twelve times as much as what is usually given in the dark. - They both seemed astonished at it as much as myself. - Twelve sous! said one. - A twelve-sous piece! said the other, - and made no reply.

The poor man said, he knew not how to ask less of ladies of their rank; and bow’d down his head to the ground.

Poo! said they, - we have no money.

The beggar remained silent for a moment or two, and renew’d his supplication.

- Do not, my fair young ladies, said he, stop your good ears against me. - Upon my word, honest man! said the younger, we have no change. - Then God bless you, said the poor man, and multiply those joys which you can give to others without change! - I observed the elder sister put her hand into her pocket. - I’ll see, said she, if I have a sous.  A sous! give twelve, said the supplicant; Nature has been bountiful to you, be bountiful to a poor man.

- I would friend, with all my heart, said the younger, if I had it.

My fair charitable! said he, addressing himself to the elder, - what is it but your goodness and humanity which makes your bright eyes so sweet, that they outshine the morning even in this dark passage? and what was it which made the Marquis de Santerre and his brother say so much of you both as they just passed by?

The two ladies seemed much affected; and impulsively, at the same time they both put their hands into their pocket, and each took out a twelve-sous piece.

The contest betwixt them and the poor supplicant was no more; - it was continued betwixt themselves, which of the two should give the twelve-sous piece in charity; - and, to end the dispute, they both gave it together, and the man went away.


THE RIDDLE EXPLAINED.  PARIS.


I stepped hastily after him: it was the very man whose success in asking charity of the women before the door of the hotel had so puzzled me; - and I found at once his secret, or at least the basis of it: - ’twas flattery.

Delicious essence! how refreshing art thou to Nature! how strongly are all its powers and all its weaknesses on thy side! how sweetly dost thou mix with the blood, and help it through the most difficult and tortuous passages to the heart!

The poor man, as he was not straiten’d for time, had given it here in a larger dose: ’tis certain he had a way of bringing it into a less form, for the many sudden cases he had to do with in the streets: but how he contrived to correct, sweeten, concentre, and qualify it, - I vex not my spirit with the enquiry; - it is enough the beggar gained two twelve-sous pieces - and they can best tell the rest, who have gained much greater matters by it.


PARIS.


We get forwards in the world, not so much by doing services, as receiving them; you take a withering twig, and put it in the ground; and then you water it, because you have planted it.

Monsieur le Count de B-, merely because he had done me one kindness in the affair of my passport, would go on and do me another, the few days he was at Paris, in making me known to a few people of rank; and they were to present me to others, and so on.

I had got master of my secret just in time to turn these honours to some little account; otherwise, as is commonly the case, I should have dined or supp’d a single time or two round, and then, by translating French looks and attitudes into plain English, I should presently have seen, that I had hold of the couvert of some more entertaining guest; and in course should have resigned all my places one after another, merely upon the principle that I could not keep them. - As it was, things did not go much amiss.

I had the honour of being introduced to the old Marquis de B-: in days of yore he had signalized himself by some small feats of chivalry in the Cour d’Amour, and had dress’d himself out to the idea of tilts and tournaments ever since. - The Marquis de B- wish’d to have it thought the affair was somewhere else than in his brain.  “He could like to take a trip to England,” and asked much of the English ladies. - Stay where you are, I beseech you, Monsieur le Marquis, said I. - Les Messieurs Anglois can scarce get a kind look from them as it is. - The Marquis invited me to supper.

Monsieur P-, the farmer-general, was just as inquisitive about our taxes.  They were very considerable, he heard. - If we knew but how to collect them, said I, making him a low bow.

I could never have been invited to Mons. P-’s concerts upon any other terms.

I had been misrepresented to Madame de Q- as an esprit. - Madame de Q- was an esprit herself: she burnt with impatience to see me, and hear me talk.  I had not taken my seat, before I saw she did not care a sous whether I had any wit or no; - I was let in, to be convinced she had.  I call heaven to witness I never once opened the door of my lips.

Madame de V- vow’d to every creature she met - “She had never had a more improving conversation with a man in her life.”

There are three epochas in the empire of a French woman. - She is coquette, - then deist, - then dévote: the empire during these is never lost, - she only changes her subjects when thirty-five years and more have unpeopled her dominion of the slaves of love, she re-peoples it with slaves of infidelity, - and then with the slaves of the church.

Madame de V- was vibrating betwixt the first of those epochas: the colour of the rose was fading fast away; - she ought to have been a deist five years before the time I had the honour to pay my first visit.

She placed me upon the same sofa with her, for the sake of disputing the point of religion more closely. - In short Madame de V- told me she believed nothing. - I told Madame de V- it might be her principle, but I was sure it could not be her interest to level the outworks, without which I could not conceive how such a citadel as hers could be defended; - that there was not a more dangerous thing in the world than for a beauty to be a deist; - that it was a debt I owed my creed not to conceal it from her; - that I had not been five minutes sat upon the sofa beside her, but I had begun to form designs; - and what is it, but the sentiments of religion, and the persuasion they had excited in her breast, which could have check’d them as they rose up?

We are not adamant, said I, taking hold of her hand; - and there is need of all restraints, till age in her own time steals in and lays them on us. - But my dear lady, said I, kissing her hand, - ’tis too - too soon.

I declare I had the credit all over Paris of unperverting Madame de V-. - She affirmed to Monsieur D- and the Abbé M-, that in one half hour I had said more for revealed religion, than all their Encyclopaedia had said against it. - I was listed directly into Madame de V-’s coterie; - and she put off the epocha of deism for two years.

I remember it was in this coterie, in the middle of a discourse, in which I was showing the necessity of a first cause, when the young Count de Faineant took me by the hand to the farthest corner of the room, to tell me my solitaire was pinn’d too straight about my neck. - It should be plus badinant, said the Count, looking down upon his own; - but a word, Monsieur Yorick, to the wise -

And from the wise, Monsieur le Count, replied I, making him a bow, - is enough.

The Count de Faineant embraced me with more ardour than ever I was embraced by mortal man.

For three weeks together I was of every man’s opinion I met. - Pardi! ce Monsieur Yorick a autant d’esprit que nous autres. - Il raisonne bien, said another. - C’est un bon enfant, said a third. - And at this price I could have eaten and drank and been merry all the days of my life at Paris; but ’twas a dishonest reckoning; - I grew ashamed of it. - It was the gain of a slave; - every sentiment of honour revolted against it; - the higher I got, the more was I forced upon my beggarly system; - the better the coterie, - the more children of Art; - I languish’d for those of Nature: and one night, after a most vile prostitution of myself to half a dozen different people, I grew sick, - went to bed; - order’d La Fleur to get me horses in the morning to set out for Italy.


MARIA.  MOULINES.


I never felt what the distress of plenty was in any one shape till now, - to travel it through the Bourbonnois, the sweetest part of France, - in the heyday of the vintage, when Nature is pouring her abundance into every one’s lap, and every eye is lifted up, - a journey, through each step of which Music beats time to Labour, and all her children are rejoicing as they carry in their clusters: to pass through this with my affections flying out, and kindling at every group before me, - and every one of them was pregnant with adventures. -

Just heaven! - it would fill up twenty volumes; - and alas! I have but a few small pages left of this to crowd it into, - and half of these must be taken up with the poor Maria my friend, Mr. Shandy, met with near Moulines.

The story he had told of that disordered maid affected me not a little in the reading; but when I got within the neighbourhood where she lived, it returned so strong into the mind, that I could not resist an impulse which prompted me to go half a league out of the road, to the village where her parents dwelt, to enquire after her.

’Tis going, I own, like the Knight of the Woeful Countenance in quest of melancholy adventures.  But I know not how it is, but I am never so perfectly conscious of the existence of a soul within me, as when I am entangled in them.

The old mother came to the door; her looks told me the story before she open’d her mouth. - She had lost her husband; he had died, she said, of anguish, for the loss of Maria’s senses, about a month before. - She had feared at first, she added, that it would have plunder’d her poor girl of what little understanding was left; - but, on the contrary, it had brought her more to herself: - still, she could not rest. - Her poor daughter, she said, crying, was wandering somewhere about the road.

Why does my pulse beat languid as I write this? and what made La Fleur, whose heart seem’d only to be tuned to joy, to pass the back of his hand twice across his eyes, as the woman stood and told it?  I beckoned to the postilion to turn back into the road.

When we had got within half a league of Moulines, at a little opening in the road leading to a thicket, I discovered poor Maria sitting under a poplar.  She was sitting with her elbow in her lap, and her head leaning on one side within her hand: - a small brook ran at the foot of the tree.

I bid the postilion go on with the chaise to Moulines - and La Fleur to bespeak my supper; - and that I would walk after him.

She was dress’d in white, and much as my friend described her, except that her hair hung loose, which before was twisted within a silk net. - She had superadded likewise to her jacket, a pale green riband, which fell across her shoulder to the waist; at the end of which hung her pipe. - Her goat had been as faithless as her lover; and she had got a little dog in lieu of him, which she had kept tied by a string to her girdle: as I looked at her dog, she drew him towards her with the string. - “Thou shalt not leave me, Sylvio,” said she.  I look’d in Maria’s eyes and saw she was thinking more of her father than of her lover, or her little goat; for, as she utter’d them, the tears trickled down her cheeks.

I sat down close by her; and Maria let me wipe them away as they fell, with my handkerchief. - I then steep’d it in my own, - and then in hers, - and then in mine, - and then I wip’d hers again; - and as I did it, I felt such undescribable emotions within me, as I am sure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion.

I am positive I have a soul; nor can all the books with which materialists have pester’d the world ever convince me to the contrary.


MARIA.


When Maria had come a little to herself, I ask’d her if she remembered a pale thin person of a man, who had sat down betwixt her and her goat about two years before?  She said she was unsettled much at that time, but remembered it upon two accounts: - that ill as she was, she saw the person pitied her; and next, that her goat had stolen his handkerchief, and she had beat him for the theft; - she had wash’d it, she said, in the brook, and kept it ever since in her pocket to restore it to him in case she should ever see him again, which, she added, he had half promised her.  As she told me this, she took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let me see it; she had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves, tied round with a tendril; - on opening it, I saw an S. marked in one of the corners.

She had since that, she told me, stray’d as far as Rome, and walk’d round St. Peter’s once, - and return’d back; - that she found her way alone across the Apennines; - had travell’d over all Lombardy, without money, - and through the flinty roads of Savoy without shoes: - how she had borne it, and how she had got supported, she could not tell; - but God tempers the wind, said Maria, to the shorn lamb.

Shorn indeed! and to the quick, said I: and wast thou in my own land, where I have a cottage, I would take thee to it, and shelter thee: thou shouldst eat of my own bread and drink of my own cup; - I would be kind to thy Sylvio; - in all thy weaknesses and wanderings I would seek after thee and bring thee back; - when the sun went down I would say my prayers: and when I had done thou shouldst play thy evening song upon thy pipe, nor would the incense of my sacrifice be worse accepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart!

Nature melted within me, as I utter’d this; and Maria observing, as I took out my handkerchief, that it was steep’d too much already to be of use, would needs go wash it in the stream. - And where will you dry it, Maria? said I. - I’ll dry it in my bosom, said she: - ’twill do me good.

And is your heart still so warm, Maria? said I.

I touch’d upon the string on which hung all her sorrows: - she look’d with wistful disorder for some time in my face; and then, without saying any thing, took her pipe and play’d her service to the Virgin. - The string I had touched ceased to vibrate; - in a moment or two Maria returned to herself, - let her pipe fall, - and rose up.

And where are you going, Maria? said I. - She said, to Moulines. - Let us go, said I, together. - Maria put her arm within mine, and lengthening the string, to let the dog follow, - in that order we enter’d Moulines.


MARIA.  MOULINES.


Though I hate salutations and greetings in the market-place, yet, when we got into the middle of this, I stopp’d to take my last look and last farewell of Maria.

Maria, though not tall, was nevertheless of the first order of fine forms: - affliction had touched her looks with something that was scarce earthly; - still she was feminine; - and so much was there about her of all that the heart wishes, or the eye looks for in woman, that could the traces be ever worn out of her brain, and those of Eliza out of mine, she should not only eat of my bread and drink of my own cup, but Maria should lie in my bosom, and be unto me as a daughter.

Adieu, poor luckless maiden! - Imbibe the oil and wine which the compassion of a stranger, as he journeyeth on his way, now pours into thy wounds; - the Being, who has twice bruised thee, can only bind them up for ever.


THE BOURBONNNOIS.


There was nothing from which I had painted out for my self so joyous a riot of the affections, as in this journey in the vintage, through this part of France; but pressing through this gate, of sorrow to it, my sufferings have totally unfitted me.  In every scene of festivity, I saw Maria in the background of the piece, sitting pensive under her poplar; and I had got almost to Lyons before I was able to cast a shade across her.

- Dear Sensibility! source inexhausted of all that’s precious in our joys, or costly in our sorrows! thou chainest thy martyr down upon his bed of straw - and ’tis thou who lift’st him up to Heaven! - Eternal Fountain of our feelings! - ’tis here I trace thee - and this is thy “divinity which stirs within me;” - not that, in some sad and sickening moments, “my soul shrinks back upon herself, and startles at destruction;” - mere pomp of words! - but that I feel some generous joys and generous cares beyond myself; - all comes from thee, great - great SENSORIUM of the world! which vibrates, if a hair of our heads but falls upon the ground, in the remotest desert of thy creation. - Touch’d with thee, Eugenius draws my curtain when I languish - hears my tale of symptoms, and blames the weather for the disorder of his nerves.  Thou giv’st a portion of it sometimes to the roughest peasant who traverses the bleakest mountains; - he finds the lacerated lamb of another’s flock. - This moment I behold him leaning with his head against his crook, with piteous inclination looking down upon it! - Oh! had I come one moment sooner! it bleeds to death! - his gentle heart bleeds with it. -

Peace to thee, generous swain! - I see thou walkest off with anguish, - but thy joys shall balance it; - for, happy is thy cottage, - and happy is the sharer of it, - and happy are the lambs which sport about you!


THE SUPPER.


A shoe coming loose from the fore foot of the thill-horse, at the beginning of the ascent of mount Taurira, the postilion dismounted, twisted the shoe off, and put it in his pocket; as the ascent was of five or six miles, and that horse our main dependence, I made a point of having the shoe fastened on again, as well as we could; but the postilion had thrown away the nails, and the hammer in the chaise box being of no great use without them, I submitted to go on.

He had not mounted half a mile higher, when, coming to a flinty piece of road, the poor devil lost a second shoe, and from off his other fore foot.  I then got out of the chaise in good earnest; and seeing a house about a quarter of a mile to the left hand, with a great deal to do I prevailed upon the postilion to turn up to it.  The look of the house, and of every thing about it, as we drew nearer, soon reconciled me to the disaster. - It was a little farm-house, surrounded with about twenty acres of vineyard, about as much corn; - and close to the house, on one side, was a potagerie of an acre and a half, full of everything which could make plenty in a French peasant’s house; - and, on the other side, was a little wood, which furnished wherewithal to dress it.  It was about eight in the evening when I got to the house - so I left the postilion to manage his point as he could; - and, for mine, I walked directly into the house.

The family consisted of an old grey-headed man and his wife, with five or six sons and sons-in-law, and their several wives, and a joyous genealogy out of them.

They were all sitting down together to their lentil-soup; a large wheaten loaf was in the middle of the table; and a flagon of wine at each end of it promised joy through the stages of the repast: - ’twas a feast of love.

The old man rose up to meet me, and with a respectful cordiality would have me sit down at the table; my heart was set down the moment I enter’d the room; so I sat down at once like a son of the family; and to invest myself in the character as speedily as I could, I instantly borrowed the old man’s knife, and taking up the loaf, cut myself a hearty luncheon; and, as I did it, I saw a testimony in every eye, not only of an honest welcome, but of a welcome mix’d with thanks that I had not seem’d to doubt it.

Was it this? or tell me, Nature, what else it was that made this morsel so sweet, - and to what magic I owe it, that the draught I took of their flagon was so delicious with it, that they remain upon my palate to this hour?

If the supper was to my taste, - the grace which followed it was much more so.


THE GRACE.


When supper was over, the old man gave a knock upon the table with the haft of his knife, to bid them prepare for the dance: the moment the signal was given, the women and girls ran altogether into a back apartment to tie up their hair, - and the young men to the door to wash their faces, and change their sabots; and in three minutes every soul was ready upon a little esplanade before the house to begin. - The old man and his wife came out last, and placing me betwixt them, sat down upon a sofa of turf by the door.

The old man had some fifty years ago been no mean performer upon the vielle, - and at the age he was then of, touch’d it well enough for the purpose.  His wife sung now and then a little to the tune, - then intermitted, - and join’d her old man again, as their children and grand-children danced before them.

It was not till the middle of the second dance, when, from some pauses in the movements, wherein they all seemed to look up, I fancied I could distinguish an elevation of spirit different from that which is the cause or the effect of simple jollity.  In a word, I thought I beheld Religion mixing in the dance: - but, as I had never seen her so engaged, I should have look’d upon it now as one of the illusions of an imagination which is eternally misleading me, had not the old man, as soon as the dance ended, said, that this was their constant way; and that all his life long he had made it a rule, after supper was over, to call out his family to dance and rejoice; believing, he said, that a cheerful and contented mind was the best sort of thanks to heaven that an illiterate peasant could pay, -

Or a learned prelate either, said I.


THE CASE OF DELICACY.


When you have gained the top of Mount Taurira, you run presently down to Lyons: - adieu, then, to all rapid movements!  ’Tis a journey of caution; and it fares better with sentiments, not to be in a hurry with them; so I contracted with a voiturin to take his time with a couple of mules, and convoy me in my own chaise safe to Turin, through Savoy.

Poor, patient, quiet, honest people! fear not: your poverty, the treasury of your simple virtues, will not be envied you by the world, nor will your valleys be invaded by it. - Nature! in the midst of thy disorders, thou art still friendly to the scantiness thou hast created: with all thy great works about thee, little hast thou left to give, either to the scythe or to the sickle; - but to that little thou grantest safety and protection; and sweet are the dwellings which stand so shelter’d.

Let the way-worn traveller vent his complaints upon the sudden turns and dangers of your roads, - your rocks, - your precipices; - the difficulties of getting up, - the horrors of getting down, - mountains impracticable, - and cataracts, which roll down great stones from their summits, and block his road up. - The peasants had been all day at work in removing a fragment of this kind between St. Michael and Madane; and, by the time my voiturin got to the place, it wanted full two hours of completing before a passage could any how be gain’d: there was nothing but to wait with patience; - ’twas a wet and tempestuous night; so that by the delay, and that together, the voiturin found himself obliged to put up five miles short of his stage at a little decent kind of an inn by the roadside.

I forthwith took possession of my bedchamber - got a good fire - order’d supper; and was thanking heaven it was no worse, when a voiture arrived with a lady in it and her servant maid.

As there was no other bed-chamber in the house, the hostess, - without much nicety, led them into mine, telling them, as she usher’d them in, that there was nobody in it but an English gentleman; - that there were two good beds in it, and a closet within the room which held another.  The accent in which she spoke of this third bed, did not say much for it; - however, she said there were three beds and but three people, and she durst say, the gentleman would do anything to accommodate matters. - I left not the lady a moment to make a conjecture about it - so instantly made a declaration that I would do anything in my power.

As this did not amount to an absolute surrender of my bed-chamber, I still felt myself so much the proprietor, as to have a right to do the honours of it; - so I desired the lady to sit down, - pressed her into the warmest seat, - called for more wood, - desired the hostess to enlarge the plan of the supper, and to favour us with the very best wine.

The lady had scarce warm’d herself five minutes at the fire, before she began to turn her head back, and give a look at the beds; and the oftener she cast her eyes that way, the more they return’d perplexd; - I felt for her - and for myself: for in a few minutes, what by her looks, and the case itself, I found myself as much embarrassed as it was possible the lady could be herself.

That the beds we were to lie in were in one and the same room, was enough simply by itself to have excited all this; - but the position of them, for they stood parallel, and so very close to each other as only to allow space for a small wicker chair betwixt them, rendered the affair still more oppressive to us; - they were fixed up moreover near the fire; and the projection of the chimney on one side, and a large beam which cross’d the room on the other, formed a kind of recess for them that was no way favourable to the nicety of our sensations: - if anything could have added to it, it was that the two beds were both of them so very small, as to cut us off from every idea of the lady and the maid lying together; which in either of them, could it have been feasible, my lying beside them, though a thing not to be wish’d, yet there was nothing in it so terrible which the imagination might not have pass’d over without torment.

As for the little room within, it offer’d little or no consolation to us: ’twas a damp, cold closet, with a half dismantled window-shutter, and with a window which had neither glass nor oil paper in it to keep out the tempest of the night.  I did not endeavour to stifle my cough when the lady gave a peep into it; so it reduced the case in course to this alternative - That the lady should sacrifice her health to her feelings, and take up with the closet herself, and abandon the bed next mine to her maid, - or that the girl should take the closet, &c., &c.

The lady was a Piedmontese of about thirty, with a glow of health in her cheeks.  The maid was a Lyonoise of twenty, and as brisk and lively a French girl as ever moved. - There were difficulties every way, - and the obstacle of the stone in the road, which brought us into the distress, great as it appeared whilst the peasants were removing it, was but a pebble to what lay in our ways now. - I have only to add, that it did not lessen the weight which hung upon our spirits, that we were both too delicate to communicate what we felt to each other upon the occasion.

We sat down to supper; and had we not had more generous wine to it than a little inn in Savoy could have furnish’d, our tongues had been tied up, till necessity herself had set them at liberty; - but the lady having a few bottles of Burgundy in her voiture, sent down her fille de chambre for a couple of them; so that by the time supper was over, and we were left alone, we felt ourselves inspired with a strength of mind sufficient to talk, at least, without reserve upon our situation.  We turn’d it every way, and debated and considered it in all kinds of lights in the course of a two hours’ negotiation; at the end of which the articles were settled finally betwixt us, and stipulated for in form and manner of a treaty of peace, - and I believe with as much religion and good faith on both sides as in any treaty which has yet had the honour of being handed down to posterity.

They were as follow: -

First, as the right of the bed-chamber is in Monsieur, - and he thinking the bed next to the fire to be the warmest, he insists upon the concession on the lady’s side of taking up with it.

Granted, on the part of Madame; with a proviso, That as the curtains of that bed are of a flimsy transparent cotton, and appear likewise too scanty to draw close, that the fille de chambre shall fasten up the opening, either by corking pins, or needle and thread, in such manner as shall be deem’d a sufficient barrier on the side of Monsieur.

2dly.  It is required on the part of Madame, that Monsieur shall lie the whole night through in his robe de chambre.

Rejected: inasmuch as Monsieur is not worth a robe de chambre; he having nothing in his portmanteau but six shirts and a black silk pair of breeches.

The mentioning the silk pair of breeches made an entire change of the article, - for the breeches were accepted as an equivalent for the robe de chambre; and so it was stipulated and agreed upon, that I should lie in my black silk breeches all night.

3dly.  It was insisted upon and stipulated for by the lady, that after Monsieur was got to bed, and the candle and fire extinguished, that Monsieur should not speak one single word the whole night.

Granted; provided Monsieur’s saying his prayers might not be deemed an infraction of the treaty.

There was but one point forgot in this treaty, and that was the manner in which the lady and myself should be obliged to undress and get to bed; - there was but one way of doing it, and that I leave to the reader to devise; protesting as I do it, that if it is not the most delicate in nature, ’tis the fault of his own imagination, - against which this is not my first complaint.

Now, when we were got to bed, whether it was the novelty of the situation, or what it was, I know not; but so it was, I could not shut my eyes; I tried this side, and that, and turn’d and turn’d again, till a full hour after midnight; when Nature and patience both wearing out, - O, my God! said I.

- You have broke the treaty, Monsieur, said the lady, who had no more slept than myself. - I begg’d a thousand pardons - but insisted it was no more than an ejaculation.  She maintained ’twas an entire infraction of the treaty - I maintained it was provided for in the clause of the third article.

The lady would by no means give up her point, though she weaken’d her barrier by it; for in the warmth of the dispute, I could hear two or three corking pins fall out of the curtain to the ground.

Upon my word and honour, Madame, said I, - stretching my arm out of bed by way of asseveration. -

(I was going to have added, that I would not have trespassed against the remotest idea of decorum for the world); -

But the fille de chambre hearing there were words between us, and fearing that hostilities would ensue in course, had crept silently out of her closet, and it being totally dark, had stolen so close to our beds, that she had got herself into the narrow passage which separated them, and had advanced so far up as to be in a line betwixt her mistress and me: -

So that when I stretch’d out my hand I caught hold of the fille de chambre’s -",[],0,Laurence Sterne,Go West,1990,"[95, 85, 78, 66, 52, 45, 34, 27, 23, 17, 10, 8, 12, 12, 16, 19, 24, 31, 38, 44, 53, 62, 78, 96]",24,"The King Of Wishful Thinking - Live - from ""Pretty Woman""",https://open.spotify.com/track/6Ima69MmEL33MaVPmoYOkn,6Ima69MmEL33MaVPmoYOkn,spotify:track:6Ima69MmEL33MaVPmoYOkn,TV+Film+Soundtracks+Trailers Vol. 1 (Atomic Blonde to The Wedding Singer),1iDVj7Cus83L2k6iemBb14,spotify:album:1iDVj7Cus83L2k6iemBb14,Go West,7bKupnlF7XOfR1En3K8oAL,spotify:artist:7bKupnlF7XOfR1En3K8oAL,290.693,17.0,1.0,2017-11-17,0.672,0.782,0.0,-8.007,1.0,0.0457,0.326,2.11e-06,0.922,0.5429999999999999,109.0,"['dance rock', 'mellow gold', 'new romantic', 'new wave', 'new wave pop', 'soft rock', 'synthpop']",[],,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0

And I know I was wrong
I know we belong together

Look, this is kind of hard
For me to say to you
But I want you back, please
Just give me a second chance

I'm tired of living alone
The single life is not for me
Like a fool, I asked you for my freedom
I didn't think you'd leave so easily

Saw you just the other day
You were walking hand in hand
With someone new

It took me by surprise
And then, I realized
How much I needed you

A second chance for us
The second time could be better, baby
A second chance for love
This time around
We could make it, baby

Turn back the hands of time
To the days when you were mine

I never thought that I would
Swallow my pride

Now you're here
So please stay the night
I promise I will make it up to you

Don't ever go away
This love we've got to save
Cause no one else will do, no one

[Verse 1]
Looking through my old drawer
Came across the letter you wrote
Said you needed time away
That was so long ago

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind, I've hated
Not able to let go

[Chorus]
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
How I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me

[Verse 2]
Lord knows that I have tried
To live my life as one
Friends tell me to hold on
Tough times don't last for long

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My abandoned heart
Just doesn't understand
My undying love for you
Won't let me wait

[Chorus]
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
Come back
I want you to
Come back to me
Come back

[Spoken Interlude]
Please come back to me
I miss you so much
Wherever you are
I love you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind, I've hated
Not able to let go
Not able to let go
No, I won't let you go, no

Remember when we said, ""Girl, please don't go""

Taught you 'bout hangin' tough
As long as you've got the right stuff
Didn't we, girl? Ooh ooh
Didn't we, girl? Aah, aah

Every time we hear the curtain call
See the girls with the curls in their hair
The buttons and the pins and the loud fanfares

Remember when we traveled 'round the world
We met a lot of people and girls
Fan mail from everywhere
Showed us how you care

Didn't it, girls? Aah, aah

Ain't got nobody, baby...baby

[Verse 1]
Check this out baby, tenemos tremendo lío
Last night you didn't go a la casa de tu tío
(Huh?)
Resulta ser, hey, you were at a party
Higher than the sky, emborrachada de Bacardí
(No, I wasn't)
I bet you didn't know que conocí al cantinero
(What?)
He told me you were drinking and wasting my dinero
Talking about come and enjoy what a woman gives an hombre
(But first of all, see, I have to know your nombre)
Now I really wanna ask ya, que si es verdad
(Would I lie?)
And please, por favor, tell me la verdad
Because I really need to know, yeah necesito entender
If you're gonna be a player, or be my mujer
‘Cause right now you're just a liar, a straight mentirosa
(Who, me?)
Today ya tell me something, y mañana es otra cosa

[Hook: Band]
Ain't got nobody, baby...baby

[Verse 2]
I remember the day que tú me decías
Time and time again que tú me querías
(I do!)
And at the time, hey, yo te creía
Porque no sabía that you were a relambía
Yo y Fulanito y Menganito, Joseito y Fernandito
Larry and Joey y then his brother Chico
(Uh-uh)
Mucho que frentera, that's a straight skeezer
Si quieres un pedacito, go her way ‘cause she's a pleaser
But I tell ya straight up porque, brother, me di de cuenta
That on Main Street her cuerpo estaba a la venta
Now get some man que quiera get some cualquiera
Hey, yo, she don't care man, she's a tremenda fiera
Yeah you're hot to trot and out to get what I got
Pero ya que te conozco, what I gots? I guess not
(¿Porque?)
‘Cause you’re just a mentirosa con tu lengua venenosa
Today you tell me something, y mañana es otra cosa

[Dialogue]
Girl, I can't believe it
You know, my mother's talking about me
M- my friends are talking about me…not me, about you!
(About me?)
You're nothing but a skeezer
(A skeezer? Don't be calling me no skeezer!)
Tú tienes mucha frentera, mami. Sí, uh-huh, la verdad
(Uh-huh, eso es lo que tu te crees)
I bet you go to church and you're scared to confess
(No, I do confess baby, I do confess)
Uh-huh, do you tell the truth, though?
(Yeah I do)
Yeah, right
(Do you?)
Yeah! You're nothing but a skeezer. You know what?
I got some other stories to say about you
It goes like this

[Verse 3]
Un día estaba en tu casa y ring there goes the phone
Recogiste y dijiste
(Call me back. I'm not alone!)
El quería tu dirección, yeah just your address
Y antes que colgaste I heard you say
(I'll wear a dress)
""¡Ay, alabao, que descarada!"" is what ran through my mind
So I say, “Let’s go out tonight."" She said
(We go out all time)
¡Alabao, man!
Ella no sabía that, yo, I knew her plan
De que iba a salir with that other man
So I told the girl in Spanish, I said ""Hey, ya me voy.""
(Pero ¿por qué?)
‘Cause you ain't treating me like I'm some sucker toy
‘Cause who needs you anyways
(I need you!)
Con tu lengua venenosa?
(No te vayas, Mellow! No te vayas! Yo te necesito!)
Today you tell me something, y mañana es otra cosa
(Tsk! But?!)

164,164,Hold On,"[Intro: Terry Ellis]
When I had you
I treated you bad
Wrong my dear
But since, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's loving you

[Verse 1: Cindy Herron]
Ooh, my first mistake was
I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon, and night
If I would've known then
The things that I know now
I might not have lost the time I complain about

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of despair

[Chorus]
Hold on to your love
You got to hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
Oh, you got to hold on
Hold on to your love, ooh

[Verse 2: Cindy]
The art of playing games now
Is not the hearts you break
It's 'bout good love you make
When his heart's on fire
Give him love every day
Remember he needs space
Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of despair

[Chorus]
Hold on to your love
You got to hold on, hey
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on to your love, yeah, hey
Hold on to your love
Oh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
Baby, hold on

[Verse 3: Cindy]
Trust and honesty too
Must be the golden rule
You'll feel the strength of passion in your soul
Burn so deeply within
Oh, the magic that you share
So sacrifice and show how much you care

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of despair

[Chorus]
Hold on to your love
You got to hold on
Hold on to your love
Don´t let go
Keep the ties
Hold on to your love
Hang on tight, and don't let go
Hold on to your love, ooh
Don't let go
Hold on to your love
Hold on to your love, ooh

[Outro: Cindy + (En Vogue)]

165,165,Violence Of Summer (Love's Taking Over),"[Verse 1]
Pick it up
This'll get you out of your head
China's hanging out by the railings
Of the motorshed
She goes with a real hit biker
He's a metalhead
She looks me up and down
Talking dirty eyes
Sweet saying boy baby
I could lick ya any time
Keep it up
That's right...here we go again
Bit later I'm going to run
Into her round the back
While other guys break heads
In the Sugar Shack
Don't give me drink I don't want to
Get too stoned
Then we're going to see who's going to
Take who home

[Chorus]
The violence of summer
A love's taking over
It starts with desire
Ends up under cover

[Verse 2]
Those lips will make me rise
You may look down but don't think twice
Slow death is on the way
So what man I still want to play
One, two
This'll get you out of your mind
This'll get you up...let's go
Maybe take a ride going south
Where her mother writes
Before bad news catches up
We still got a little time
We'll leave it all so far away
One thing is sure we shouldn't stay
I take it all little Chine going to
Get the runaround a run... a runaround

[Chorus]

170,170,Tell Me Something,"Ala Al-Din Abu Al-Shamat.[FN#24]

""What is that?"" asked he, and she said, It hath reached me that there lived, in times of yore and years and ages long gone before, a merchant of Cairo[FN#25] named Shams al-Din, who was of the best and truest spoken of the traders of the city; and he had eunuchs and servants and negro-slaves and handmaids and Mame lukes and great store of money. Moreover, he was Consul[FN#26] of the Merchants of Cairo and owned a wife, whom he loved and who loved him; except that he had lived with her forty years, yet had not been blessed with a son or even a daughter. One day, as he sat in his shop, he noted that the merchants, each and every, had a son or two sons or more sitting in their shops like their sires. Now the day being Friday, he entered the Hammam-bath and made the total-ablution: after which he came out and took the barber's glass and looked in it, saying, ""I testify that there is no god but the God and I testify that Mohammed is the Messenger of God!"" Then he considered his beard and, seeing that the white hairs in it covered the black, bethought himself that hoariness is the harbinger of death. Now his wife knew the time of his coming home and had washed and made herself ready for him, so when he came in to her, she said, ""Good evening,"" but he replied ""I see no good."" Then she called to the handmaid, ""Spread the supper-tray;"" and when this was done quoth she to her husband ""Sup, O my lord."" Quoth he, ""I will eat nothing,"" and pushing the tray away with his foot, turned his back upon her. She asked, ""Why dost thou thus? and what hath vexed thee?""; and he answered, ""Thou art the cause of my vexation.""—And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say,

When it was the Two Hundred and Fiftieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shams al-Din said to his wife, ""Thou art the cause of my vexation."" She asked, ""Wherefore?"" and he answered, ""When I opened my shop this morning, I saw that each and every of the merchants had with him a son or two sons or more, sitting in their shops like their fathers; and I said to myself:—He who took thy sire will not spare thee. Now the night I first visited thee,[FN#27] thou madest me swear that I would never take a second wife over thee nor a concubine, Abyssinian or Greek or handmaid of other race; nor would lie a single night away from thee: and behold, thou art barren, and having thee is like boring into the rock."" Rejoined she, ""Allah is my witness that the fault lies with thee, for that thy seed is thin."" He asked, ""And what showeth the man whose semen is thin?"" And she answered, ""He cannot get women with child, nor beget children."" Quoth he, ""What thickeneth the seed? tell me and I will buy it: haply, it will thicken mine."" Quoth she, ""Enquire for it of the druggists."" So he slept with her that night and arose on the morrow, repenting of having spoken angrily to her; and she also regretted her cross words. Then he went to the market and, finding a druggist, saluted him; and when his salutation was returned said to him, ""Say, hast thou with thee a seed-thickener?"" He replied, ""I had it, but am out of it: enquire thou of my neighbour."" Then Shams al-Din made the round till he had asked every one, but they all laughed at him, and presently he returned to his shop and sat down, sore troubled. Now there was in the bazar a man who was Deputy Syndic of the brokers and was given to the use of opium and electuary and green hashish.[FN#28] He was called Shaykh Mohammed Samsam and being poor he used to wish Shams al-Din good morrow every day. So he came to him according to his custom and saluted him. The merchant returned his salute, but in ill-temper, and the other, seeing him vexed, said, ""O my lord, what hath crossed thee?"" Thereupon Shams al-Din told him all that occurred between himself and his wife, adding, ""These forty years have I been married to her yet hath she borne me neither son nor daughter; and they say:—The cause of thy failure to get her with child is the thinness of thy seed; so I have been seeking a some thing wherewith to thicken my semen but found it not."" Quoth Shaykh Mohammed, ""O my lord, I have a seed-thickener, but what wilt thou say to him who causeth thy wife to conceive by thee after these forty years have passed?"" Answered the merchant, ""If thou do this, I will work thy weal—and reward thee."" ""Then give me a dinar,"" rejoined the broker, and Shams al-Din said, ""Take these two dinars."" He took them and said, ""Give me also yonder big bowl of porcelain."" So he gave it to him and the broker betook himself to a hashish-seller, of whom he bought two ounces of concentrated Roumi opium and equal-parts of Chinese cubebs, cinnamon, cloves, cardamoms, ginger, white pepper and mountain skink[FN#29]; and, pounding them all together, boiled them in sweet olive-oil; after which he added three ounces of male frankincense in fragments and a cupful of coriander-seed; and, macerating the whole, made it into an electuary with Roumi bee honey. Then he put the confection in the bowl and carried it to the merchant, to whom he delivered it, saying, ""Here is the seed-thickener, and the manner of using it is this. Take of my electuary with a spoon after supping, and wash it down with a sherbet made of rose conserve; but first sup off mutton and house pigeon plentifully seasoned and hotly spiced."" So the merchant bought all this and sent the meat and pigeons to his wife, saying, ""Dress them deftly and lay up the seed-thickener until I want it and call for it."" She did his bidding and, when she served up the meats, he ate the evening meal, after which he called for the bowl and ate of the electuary. It pleased him well, so he ate the rest and knew his wife. That very night she conceived by him and, after three months, her courses ceased, no blood came from her and she knew that she was with child. When the days of her pregnancy were accomplished, the pangs of labour took her and they raised loud lullilooings and cries of joy. The midwife delivered her with difficulty, by pronouncing over the boy at his birth the names of Mohammed and Ali, and said, ""Allah is Most Great!""; and she called in his ear the call to prayer. Then she wrapped him up and passed him to his mother, who took him and gave him the breast; and he sucked and was full and slept. The midwife abode with them three days, till they had made the mothering-cakes of sugared bread and sweetmeats; and they distributed them on the seventh day. Then they sprinkled salt against the evil eye and the merchant, going in to his wife, gave her joy of her safe delivery, and said, ""Where is Allah's deposit?"" So they brought him a babe of surpassing beauty, the handiwork of the Orderer who is ever present and, though he was but seven days old, those who saw him would have deemed him a yearling child. So the merchant looked on his face and, seeing it like a shining full moon, with moles on either cheek, said he to his wife, ""What hast thou named him?"" Answered she, ""If it were a girl I had named her; but this is a boy, so none shall name him but thou."" Now the people of that time used to name their children by omens; and, whilst the merchant and his wife were taking counsel of the name, behold, one said to his friend, ""Ho my lord, Ala al-Din!"" So the merchant said, ""We will call him Ala al-Din Abú al-Shámát.""[FN#30] Then he committed the child to the nurse, and he drank milk two years, after which they weaned him and he grew up and throve and walked upon the floor. When he came to seven years old, they put him in a chamber under a trap-door, for fear of the evil eye, and his father said, ""He shall not come out, till his beard grow."" So he gave him in charge to a handmaid and a blackamoor; the girl dressed him his meals and the slave carried them to him. Then his father circumcised him and made him a great feast; after which he brought him a doctor of the law, who taught him to write and read and repeat the Koran, and other arts and sciences, till he became a good scholar and an accomplished. One day it so came to pass that the slave, after bringing him the tray of food went away and left the trap door open: so Ala al-Din came forth from the vault and went in to his mother, with whom was a company of women of rank. As they sat talking, behold, in came upon them the youth as he were a white slave drunken[FN#31] for the excess of his beauty; and when they saw him, they veiled their faces and said to his mother, ""Allah requite thee, O such an one! How canst thou let this strange Mameluke in upon us? Knowest thou not that modesty is a point of the Faith?"" She replied, ""Pronounce Allah's name[FN#32] and cry Bismillah! this is my son, the fruit of my vitals and the heir of Consul Shams al-Din, the child of the nurse and the collar and the crust and the crumb.""[FN#33] Quoth they, ""Never in our days knew we that thou hadst a son""; and quoth she, ""Verily his father feared for him the evil eye and reared him in an under-ground chamber;""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ala al-Din's mother said to her lady-friends, ""Verily his father feared for him the evil eye and reared him in an underground chamber; and haply the slave forgot to shut the door and he fared forth; but we did not mean that he should come out, before his beard was grown."" The women gave her joy of him, and the youth went out from them into the court yard where he seated himself in the open sitting room; and behold, in came the slaves with his father's she mule, and he said to them, ""Whence cometh this mule?"" Quoth they, ""We escorted thy father when riding her to the shop, and we have brought her back."" He asked, ""What may be my father's trade?""; and they answered, ""Thy father is Consul of the merchants in the land of Egypt and Sultan of the Sons of the Arabs."" Then he went in to his mother and said to her, ""O my mother, what is my father's trade?"" Said she, ""O my son, thy sire is a merchant and Consul of the merchants in the land of Egypt and Sultan of the Sons of the Arabs. His slaves consult him not in selling aught whose price is less than one thousand gold pieces, but merchandise worth him an hundred and less they sell at their own discretion; nor cloth any merchandise whatever, little or much, leave the country without passing through his hands and he disposeth of it as he pleaseth; nor is a bale packed and sent abroad amongst folk but what is under his disposal. And ""Almighty Allah, O my son, hath given thy father monies past compt."" He rejoined, ""O my mother, praised be Allah, that I am son of the Sultan of the Sons of the Arabs and that my father is Consul of the merchants! But why, O my mother, do ye put me in the underground chamber and leave me prisoner there?"" Quoth she, ""O my son, we imprisoned thee not save for fear of folks' eyes: 'the evil eye is a truth,'[FN#34] and most of those in their long homes are its victims."" Quoth he, ""O my mother, and where is a refuge-place against Fate? Verily care never made Destiny forbear; nor is there flight from what is written for every wight. He who took my grandfather will not spare myself nor my father; for, though he live to day he shall not live tomorrow. And when my father dieth and I come forth and say, 'I am Ala al-Din, son of Shams al-Din the merchant', none of the people will believe me, but men of years and standing will say, 'In our lives never saw we a son or a daughter of Shams al-Din.' Then the public Treasury will come down and take my father's estate, and Allah have mercy on him who said, 'The noble dieth and his wealth passeth away, and the meanest of men take his women.' Therefore, O my mother, speak thou to my father, that he carry me with him to the bazar and open for me a shop; so may I sit there with my merchandise, and teach me to buy and sell and take and give."" Answered his mother, ""O my son, as soon as thy sire returneth I will tell him this."" So when the merchant came home, he found his son Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat sitting with his mother and said to her, ""Why hast thou brought him forth of the underground chamber?"" She replied, ""O son of my uncle, it was not I that brought him out; but the servants forgot to shut the door and left it open; so, as I sat with a company of women of rank, behold, he came forth and walked in to me."" Then she went on to repeat to him his son's words; so he said, ""O my son, to-morrow, Inshallah! I will take thee with me to the bazar; but, my boy, sitting in markets and shops demandeth good manners and courteous carriage in all conditions."" Ala al-Din passed the night rejoicing in his father's promise and, when the morrow came, the merchant carried him to the Hammam and clad him in a suit worth a mint of money. As soon as they had broken their fast and drunk their sherbets, Shams al-Din mounted his she mule and putting his son upon another, rode to the market, followed by his boy. But when the market folk saw their Consul making towards them, foregoing a youth as he were a slice of the full moon on the fourteenth night, they said, one to other, ""See thou yonder boy behind the Consul of the merchants; verily, we thought well of him, but he is, like the leek, gray of head and green at heart.""[FN#35] And Shaykh Mohammed Samsam, Deputy Syndic of the market, the man before mentioned, said to the dealers, ""O merchants, we will not keep the like of him for our Shaykh; no, never!"" Now it was the custom anent the Consul when he came from his house of a morning and sat down in his shop, for the Deputy Syndic of the market to go and recite to him and to all the merchants assembled around him the Fátihah or opening chapter of the Koran,[FN#36] after which they accosted him one by one and wished him good morrow and went away, each to his business place. But when Shams al-Din seated himself in his shop that day as usual, the traders came not to him as accustomed; so he called the Deputy and said to him, ""Why come not the merchants together as usual?"" Answered Mohammed Samsam, ""I know not how to tell thee these troubles, for they have agreed to depose thee from the Shaykh ship of the market and to recite the Fatihah to thee no more."" Asked Shams al-Din, ""What may be their reason?""; and asked the Deputy, ""What boy is this that sitteth by thy side and thou a man of years and chief of the merchants? Is this lad a Mameluke or akin to thy wife? Verily, I think thou lovest him and inclines lewdly to the boy."" Thereupon the Consul cried out at him, saying, ""Silence, Allah curse thee, genus and species! This is my son."" Rejoined the Deputy, ""Never in our born days have we seen thee with a son,"" and Shams al-Din answered, ""When thou gavest me the seed-thickener, my wife conceived and bare this youth; but I reared him in a souterrain for fear of the evil eye, nor was it my purpose that he should come forth, till he could take his beard in his hand.[FN#37] However, his mother would not agree to this, and he on his part begged I would stock him a shop and teach him to sell and buy."" So the Deputy Syndic returned to the other traders and acquainted them with the truth of the case, whereupon they all arose to accompany him; and, going in a body to Shams al-Din's shop, stood before him and recited the ""Opener"" of the Koran; after which they gave him joy of his son and said to him, ""The Lord prosper root and branch! But even the poorest of us, when son or daughter is born to him, needs must cook a pan-full of custard[FN#38] and bid his friends and kith and kin; yet hast thou not done this."" Quoth he, ""This I owe you; be our meeting in the garden.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-second Night,

Her sister Dunyazad said to her, ""Pray continue thy story for us, as thou be awake and not inclined to sleep."" Quoth she:—With pleasure and goodwill: it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Consul of the merchants promised them a banquet and said ""Be our meeting in the garden."" So when morning dawned he despatched the carpet layer to the saloon of the garden-pavilion and bade him furnish the two. Moreover, he sent thither all that was needful for cooking, such as sheep and clarified butter and so forth, according to the requirements of the case; and spread two tables, one in the pavilion and another in the saloon. Then Shams al-Din and his boy girded themselves, and he said to Ala al-Din ""O my son, whenas a greybeard entereth, I will meet him and seat him at the table in the pavilion; and do thou, in like manner, receive the beardless youths and seat them at the table in the saloon."" He asked, ""O my father, why dost thou spread two tables, one for men and another for youths?""; and he answered, ""O my son, the beardless is ashamed to eat with the bearded."" And his son thought this his answer full and sufficient. So when the merchants arrived, Shams al-Din received the men and seated them in the pavilion, whilst Ala al-Din received the youths and seated them in the saloon. Then the food was set on and the guests ate and drank and made merry and sat over their wine, whilst the attendants perfumed them with the smoke of scented woods, and the elders fell to conversing of matters of science and traditions of the Prophet. Now there was amongst them a merchant called Mahmúd of Balkh, a professing Moslem but at heart a Magian, a man of lewd and mischievous life who loved boys. And when he saw Ala al-Din from whose father he used to buy stuffs and merchandise, one sight of his face sent him a thousand sighs and Satan dangled the jewel before his eyes, so that he was taken with love-longing and desire and affection and his heart was filled with mad passion for him. Presently he arose and made for the youths, who stood up to receive him; and at this moment Ala Al-Din being taken with an urgent call of Nature, withdrew to make water; whereupon Mahmud turned to the other youths and said to them, ""If ye will incline Ala al-Din's mind to journeying with me, I will give each of you a dress worth a power of money."" Then he returned from them to the men's party; and, as the youths were sitting, Ala al-Din suddenly came back, when all rose to receive him and seated him in the place of highest honour. Presently, one of them said to his neighbour, ""O my lord Hasan, tell me whence came to thee the capital—whereon thou trades""."" He replied, ""When I grew up and came to man's estate, I said to my sire, 'O my father, give me merchandise.' Quoth he, 'O my son, I have none by me; but go thou to some merchant and take of him money and traffic with it; and so learn to buy and sell, give and take.' So I went to one of the traders and borrowed of him a thousand dinars, wherewith I bought stuffs and carrying them to Damascus, sold them there at a profit of two for one. Then I bought Syrian stuffs and carrying them to Aleppo, made a similar gain of them; after which I bought stuffs of Aleppo and repaired with them to Baghdad, where I sold them with like result, two for one; nor did I cease trading upon my capital till I was worth nigh ten thousand ducats."" Then each of the others told his friend some such tale, till it came to Ala al-Din's turn to speak, when they said to him, ""And thou, O my lord Ala al-Din?"" Quoth he, ""I was brought up in a chamber underground and came forth from it only this week; and I do but go to the shop and return home from the shop."" They remarked, ""Thou art used to wone at home and wottest not the joys of travel, for travel is for men only."" He replied, ""I reck not of voyaging and wayfaring cloth not tempt me."" Whereupon quoth one to the other, ""This one is like the fish: when he leaveth the water he dieth."" Then they said to him, ""O Ala al Din, the glory of the sons of the merchants is not but in travel for the sake of gain."" Their talk angered him; so he left them weeping-eyed and heavy-hearted and mounting his mule returned home. Now his mother saw him in tears and in bad temper and asked him, ""What hath made thee weep, O my son?""; and he answered, ""Of a truth, all the sons of the merchants put me to shame and said, 'Naught is more glorious for a merchant's son than travel for gain and to get him gold.'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ala al-Din said to his mother, ""Of a truth all the sons of the merchants put me to shame and said, 'Naught is more honourable for a merchant's son than travel for gain.'"" ""O my son, hast thou a mind to travel?"" ""Even so!"" ""And whither wilt thou go?"" ""To the city of Baghdad; for there folk make double the cost price on their goods."" ""O my son, thy father is a very rich man and, if he provide thee not with merchandise, I will supply it out of my own monies."" ""The best favour is that which is soonest bestowed; if this kindness is to be, now is the time."" So she called the slaves and sent them for cloth packers, then, opening a store house, brought out ten loads of stuffs, which they made up into bales for him. Such was his case; but as regards his father, Shams al-Din, he looked about and failed to find Ala al-Din in the garden and enquiring after him, was told that he had mounted mule and gone home; so he too mounted and followed him. Now when he entered the house, he saw the bales ready bound and asked what they were; whereupon his wife told him what had chanced between Ala al-Din and the sons of the merchants; and he cried, ""O my son, Allah's malison on travel and stranger-hood! Verily Allah's Apostle (whom the Lord bless and preserve!) hath said, 'It is of a man's happy fortune that he eat his daily bread in his own land', and it was said of the ancients, 'Leave travel, though but for a mile.'"" Then quoth he to his son, ""Say, art thou indeed resolved to travel and wilt thou not turn back from it?"" Quoth the other, ""There is no help for it but that I journey to Baghdad with merchandise, else will I doff clothes and don dervish gear and fare a-wandering over the world."" Shams al-Din rejoined, ""I am no penniless pauper but have great plenty of wealth;"" then he showed him all he owned of monies and stuffs and stock-in-trade and observed, ""With me are stuffs and merchandise befitting every country in the world."" Then he showed him among the rest, forty bales ready bound, with the price, a thousand dinars, written on each, and said, ""O my son take these forty loads, together with the ten which thy mother gave thee, and set out under the safeguard of Almighty Allah. But, O my child, I fear for thee a certain wood in thy way, called the Lion's Copse,[FN#39] and a valley highs the Vale of Dogs, for there lives are lost without mercy."" He said, ""How so, O my father?""; and he replied, ""Because of a Badawi bandit named Ajlan."" Quoth Ala al-Din, ""Such is Allah's luck; if any share of it be mine, no harm shall hap to me."" Then they rode to the cattle bazar, where behold, a cameleer[FN#40] alighted from his she mule and kissing the Consul's hand, said to him, ""O my lord, it is long, by Allah, since thou hast employed us in the way of business."" He replied, ""Every time hath its fortune and its men,[FN#41] and Allah have truth on him who said,

'And the old man crept o'er the worldly ways * So bowed, his
       &nbsp     beard o'er his knees down flow'th:
Quoth I, 'What gars thee so doubled go?' * Quoth he (as to me his
       &nbsp     hands he show'th)
'My youth is lost, in the dust it lieth; * And see, I bend me to
       &nbsp     find my youth.'""[FN#42]

Now when he had ended his verses, he said, ""O chief of the caravan, it is not I who am minded to travel, but this my son."" Quoth the cameleer, ""Allah save him for thee."" Then the Consul made a contract between Ala al-Din and the man, appointing that the youth should be to him as a son, and gave him into his charge, saying, ""Take these hundred gold pieces for thy people."" More-over he bought his son threescore mules and a lamp and a tomb-covering for the Sayyid Abd al-Kadir of Gílán[FN#43] and said to him, ""O my son, while I am absent, this is thy sire in my stead: whatsoever he biddeth thee, do thou obey him."" So saying, he returned home with the mules and servants and that night they made a Khitmah or perfection of the Koran and held a festival—in honour of the Shaykh Abd al-Kadir al-Jiláni. And when the morrow dawned, the Consul gave his son ten thousand dinars, saying, ""O my son, when thou comest to Baghdad, if thou find stuffs easy of sale, sell them; but if they be dull, spend of these dinars."" Then they loaded the mules and, taking leave of one another, all the wayfarers setting out on their journey, marched forth from the city. Now Mahmud of Balkh had made ready his own venture for Baghdad and had moved his bales and set up his tents without the walls, saying to himself, ""Thou shalt not enjoy this youth but in the desert, where there is neither spy nor marplot to trouble thee."" It chanced that he had in hand a thousand dinars which he owed to the youth's father, the balance of a business-transaction between them; so he went and bade farewell to the Consul, who charged him, ""Give the thousand dinars to my son Ala al-Din;"" and commended the lad to his care, saying, ""He is as it were thy son."" Accordingly, Ala al-Din joined company with Mahmud of Balkh.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.


When it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ala al-Din joined company with Mahmud of Balkh who, before beginning the march, charged the youth's cook to dress nothing for him, but himself provided him and his company with meat and drink. Now he had four houses, one in Cairo, another in Damascus, a third in Aleppo and a fourth in Baghdad. So they set out and ceased not journeying over waste and wold till they drew near Damascus when Mahmud sent his slave to Ala al-Din, whom he found sitting and reading. He went up to him and kissed his hands, and Ala al-Din having asked him what he wanted, he answered, ""My master saluteth thee and craveth thy company to a banquet at his place."" Quoth the youth, ""Not till I consult my father Kamal al-Din, the captain of the caravan."" So he asked advice of the Makaddam,[FN#44] who said, ""Do not go."" Then they left Damascus and journeyed on till they came to Aleppo, where Mahmud made a second entertainment and sent to invite Ala al-Din; but he consulted the Chief Cameleer who again forbade him. Then they marched from Aleppo and fared on, till there remained between them and Baghdad only a single stage. Here Mahmud prepared a third feast and sent to bid Ala al-Din to it: Kamal-al-Din once more forbade his accepting it, but he said, ""I must needs go."" So he rose and, slinging a sword over his shoulder, under his clothes, repaired to the tent of Mahmud of Balkh, who came to meet him and saluted him. Then he set before him a sumptuous repast and they ate and drank and washed hands. At last Mahmud bent towards Ala al-Din to snatch a kiss from him, but the youth received the kiss on the palm of his hand and said to him, ""What wouldest thou be at?"" Quoth Mahmud, ""In very sooth I brought thee hither that I might take my pleasure with thee in this jousting ground, and we will comment upon the words of him who saith,

'Say, canst not come to us one momentling, * Like milk of ewekin
       &nbsp  or aught glistening
And eat what liketh thee of dainty cake, * And take thy due of
       &nbsp    fee in silverling,
And bear whatso thou wilt, without mislike, * Of spanling,
       &nbsp     fistling or a span long thing?'""

Then Mahmud of Balkh would have laid hands on Ala al-Din to ravish him; but he rose and baring his brand, said to him, ""Shame on thy gray hairs! Hast thou no fear of Allah, and He of exceeding awe?[FN#45] May He have mercy on him who saith,

'Preserve thy hoary hairs from soil and stain, * For whitest colours are the easiest stained!'""

And when he ended his verses he said to Mahmud of Balkh, ""Verily this merchandise[FN#46] is a trust from Allah and may not be sold. If I sold this property to other than thee for gold, I would sell it to thee for silver; but by Allah, O filthy villain, I will never again company with thee; no, never!"" Then he returned to Kamal-Al-Din the guide and said to him, ""Yonder man is a lewd fellow, and I will no longer consort with him nor suffer his company by the way."" He replied, ""O my son, did I not say to thee, 'Go not near him'? But if we part company with him, I fear destruction for ourselves; so let us still make one caravan."" But Ala al-Din cried, ""It may not be that I ever again travel with him."" So he loaded his beasts and journeyed onwards, he and his company, till they came to a valley, where Ala al-Din would have halted, but the Cameleer said to him, ""Do not halt here; rather let us fare forwards and press our pace, so haply we make Baghdad before the gates are closed, for they open and shut them with the sun, in fear lest the Rejectors[FN#47] should take the city and throw the books of religious learning into the Tigris."" But Ala al Din replied to him, ""O my father, I came not forth from home with this merchandise, or travelled hither for the sake of traffic, but to divert myself with the sight of foreign lands and folks;"" and he rejoined, ""O my son, we fear for thee and for thy goods from the wild Arabs."" Whereupon the youth answered ""Harkye, fellow, art thou master or man? I will not enter Baghdad till the morning, that the sons of the city may see my merchandise and know me."" ""Do as thou wilt,"" said the other ""I have given thee the wisest advice, but thou art the best judge of thine own case."" Then Ala al-Din bade them unload the mule; and pitch the tent; so they did his bidding and abode there till the middle of the night, when he went out to obey a call of nature and suddenly saw something gleaming afar off. So he said to Kamal-al-Din, ""O captain, what is yonder glittering?"" The Cameleer sat up and, considering it straitly, knew it for the glint of spear heads and the steel of Badawi weapons and swords. And lo and behold! this was a troop of wild Arabs under a chief called Ajlán Abú Náib, Shaykh of the Arabs, and when they neared the camp and saw the bales and baggage, they said one to another, ""O night of loot!"" Now when Kamal-al-Din heard these their words he cried, ""Avaunt, O vilest of Arabs!"" But Abu Naib so smote him with his throw spear in the breast, that the point came out gleaming from his back, and he fell down dead at the tent door. Then cried the water carrier,[FN#48] ""Avaunt, O foulest of Arabs!"" and one of them smote him with a sword upon the shoulder, that it issued shining from the tendons of the throat, and he also fell down dead. (And all this while Ala Al-Din stood looking on.) Then the Badawin surrounded and charged the caravan from every side and slew all Ala al-Din's company without sparing a man: after which they loaded the mules with the spoil and made off. Quoth Ala al-Din to himself, ""Nothing will slay thee save thy mule and thy dress!""; so he arose and put off his gown and threw it over the back of a mule, remaining in his shirt and bag trousers only; after which he looked towards the tent door and, seeing there a pool of gore flowing from the slaughtered, wallowed in it with his remaining clothes till he was as a slain man drowned in his own blood. Thus it fared with him; but as regards the Shaykh of the wild Arabs, Ajlan, he said to his banditti, ""O Arabs, was this caravan bound from Egypt for Baghdad or from Baghdad for Egypt?""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Badawi asked his banditti, ""O Arabs, was this caravan bound from Egypt for Baghdad or from Baghdad for Egypt?""; they answered, ""'Twas bound from Egypt for Baghdad;"" and he said, ""Return ye to the slain, for methinks the owner of this caravan is not dead."" So they turned back to the slain and fell to prodding and slashing them with lance and sword till they came to Ala al-Din, who had thrown himself down among the corpses. And when they came to him, quoth they, ""Thou dost but feign thyself dead, but we will make an end of thee,"" and one of the Badawin levelled his javelin and would have plunged it into his breast when he cried out, ""Save me, O my lord Abd al-Kadir, O Saint of Gilan!"" and behold, he saw a hand turn the lance away from his breast to that of Kamal-al-Din the cameleer, so that it pierced him and spared himself.[FN#49] Then the Arabs made off; and, when Ala al-Din saw that the birds were flown with their god send, he sat up and finding no one, rose and set off running; but, behold! Abu Náib the Badawi looked back and said to his troop, ""I see somewhat moving afar off, O Arabs!"" So one of the bandits turned back and, spying Ala al-Din running, called out to him, saying, ""Flight shall not forward thee and we after thee;"" and he smote his mare with his heel and she hastened after him. Then Ala al-Din seeing before him a watering tank and a cistern beside it, climbed up into a niche in the cistern and, stretching himself at full length, feigned to be asleep and said, ""O gracious Protector, cover me with the veil of Thy protection which may not be torn away!"" And lo! the Badawi came up to the cistern and, standing in his stirrup irons put out his hand to lay hold of Ala al-Din; but he said, ""O my lady Nafísah[FN#50]! Now is thy time!"" And behold, a scorpion stung the Badawi in the palm and he cried out, saying, ""Help, O Arabs! I am stung;"" and he alighted from his mare's back. So his comrades came up to him and mounted him again, asking, ""What hath befallen thee?"" whereto he answered, ""A young scorpion[FN#51] stung me."" So they departed, with the caravan. Such was their case; but as regards Ala al-Din, he tarried in the niche, and Mahmud of Balkh bade load his beasts and fared forwards till he came to the Lion's Copse where he found Ala al-Din's attendants all lying slain. At this he rejoiced and went on till he reached the cistern and the reservoir. Now his mule was athirst and turned aside to drink, but she saw Ala al-Din's shadow in the water and shied and started; whereupon Mahmud raised his eyes and, seeing Ala al-Din lying in the niche, stripped to his shirt and bag trousers, said to him, ""What man this deed to thee hath dight and left thee in this evil plight?"" Answered Ala alDin, ""The Arabs,"" and Mahmud said, ""O my son, the mules and the baggage were thy ransom; so do thou comfort thyself with his saying who said,

'If thereby man can save his head from death, * His good is worth him but a slice of nail!'

But now, O my son, come down and fear no hurt."" Thereupon he descended from the cistern-niche and Mahmud mounted him on a mule, and they fared on till they reached Baghdad, where he brought him to his own house and carried him to the bath, saying to him, ""The goods and money were the ransom of thy life, O my son; but, if thou wilt hearken to me, I will give thee the worth of that thou hast lost, twice told."" When he came out of the bath, Mahmud carried him into a saloon decorated with gold with four raised floors, and bade them bring a tray with all manner of meats. So they ate and drank and Mahmud bent towards Ala al-Din to snatch a kiss from him; but he received it upon the palm of his hand and said, ""What, dost thou persist in thy evil designs upon me? Did I not tell thee that, were I wont to sell this merchandise to other than thee for gold, I would sell it thee for silver?"" Quoth Mahmud, ""I will give thee neither merchandise nor mule nor clothes save at this price; for I am gone mad for love of thee, and bless him who said,

'Told us, ascribing to his Shaykhs, our Shaykh * Abú Bilál, these
       &nbsp     words they wont to utter:[FN#52]
Unhealed the lover wones of love desire, * By kiss and clip, his
       &nbsp     only cure's to futter!'""

Ala al-Din replied, ""Of a truth this may never be, take back thy dress and thy mule and open the door that I may go out."" So he opened the door, and Ala al-Din fared forth and walked on, with the dogs barking at his heels, and he went forwards through the dark when behold, he saw the door of a mosque standing open and, entering the vestibule, there took shelter and concealment; and suddenly a light approached him and on examining it he saw that it came from a pair of lanthorns borne by two slaves before two merchants. Now one was an old man of comely face and the other a youth; and he heard the younger say to the elder, ""O my uncle,, I conjure thee by Allah, give me back my cousin!"" The old man replied, ""Did I not forbid thee, many a time, when the oath of divorce was always in thy mouth, as it were Holy Writ?"" Then he turned to his right and, seeing Ala al-Din as he were a slice of the full moon, said to him, ""Peace be with thee! who art thou, O my son?"" Quoth he, returning the salutation of peace, ""I am Ala al-Din, son of Shams al-Din, Consul of the merchants for Egypt. I besought my father for merchandise; so he packed me fifty loads of stuffs and goods.""—And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ala al-Din continued, ""So he packed me fifty loads of goods and gave me ten thousand dinars, wherewith I set out for Baghdad; but when I reached the Lion's Copse, the wild Arabs came out against me and took all my goods and monies. So I entered the city knowing not where to pass the night and, seeing this place, I took shelter here."" Quoth the old man, ""O my son, what sayest thou to my giving thee a thousand dinars and a suit of clothes and a mule worth other two thousand?"" Ala al-Din asked, ""To what end wilt thou give me these things, O my uncle?"" and the other answered, 'This young man who accompanieth me is the son of my brother and an only son; and I have a daughter called Zubaydah[FN#53] the lutist, an only child who is a model of beauty and loveliness, so I married her to him. Now he loveth her, but she loatheth him; and when he chanced to take an oath of triple divorcement and broke it, forthright she left him. Whereupon he egged on all the folk to intercede with me to restore her to him; but I told him that this could not lawfully be save by an intermediate marriage, and we have agreed to make some stranger the intermediary[FN#54] in order that none may taunt and shame him with this affair. So, as thou art a stranger, come with us and we will marry thee to her; thou shalt lie with her to-night and on the morrow divorce her and we will give thee what I said."" Quoth Ala al-Din to himself, ""By Allah, to bide the night with a bride on a bed in a house is far better than sleeping in the streets and vestibules!"" So he went with them to the Kazi whose heart, as soon as he saw Ala al-Din, was moved to love him, and who said to the old man, ""What is your will?"" He replied, ""We wish to make this young man an intermediary husband for my daughter; but we will write a bond against him binding him to pay down by way of marriage-settlement ten thousand gold pieces. Now if after passing the night with her he divorce her in the morning, we will give him a mule and dress each worth a thousand dinars, and a third thousand of ready money; but if he divorce her not, he shall pay down the ten thousand dinars according to contract."" So they agreed to the agreement and the father of the bride-to-be received his bond for the marriage-settlement. Then he took Ala al-Din and, clothing him anew, carried him to his daughter's house and there he left him standing at the door, whilst he himself went in to the young lady and said, ""Take the bond of thy marriage-settlement, for I have wedded thee to a handsome youth by name Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat: so do thou use him with the best of usage."" Then he put the bond into her hands and left her and went to his own lodging. Now the lady's cousin had an old duenna who used to visit Zubaydah, and he had done many a kindness to this woman, so he said to her, ""O my mother, if my cousin Zubaydah see this handsome young man, she will never after accept my offer; so I would fain have thee contrive some trick to keep her and him apart."" She answered, ""By the life of thy youth,[FN#55] I will not suffer him to approach her!"" Then she went to Ala al-Din and said to him, ""O my son, I have a word of advice to give thee, for the love of Almighty Allah and do thou accept my counsel, as I fear for thee from this young woman: better thou let her lie alone and feel not her person nor draw thee near to her."" He asked, ""Why so?""; and she answered, ""Because her body is full of leprosy and I dread lest she infect thy fair and seemly youth."" Quoth he, ""I have no need of her."" Thereupon she went to the lady and said the like to her of Ala al-Din, and she replied, ""I have no need of him, but will let him lie alone, and on the morrow he shall gang his gait."" Then she called a slave-girl and said to her, ""Take the tray of food and set it before him that he may sup."" So the handmaid carried him the tray of food and set it before him and he ate his fill: after which he sat down and raised his charming voice and fell to reciting the chapter called Y. S.[FN#56] The lady listened to him and found his voice as melodious as the psalms of David sung by David himself,[FN#57] which when she heard, she exclaimed, ""Allah disappoint the old hag who told me that he was affected with leprosy! Surely this is not the voice of one who hath such a disease; and all was a lie against him.""[FN#58] Then she took a lute of India-land workmanship and, tuning the strings, sang to it in a voice so sweet its music would stay the birds in the heart of heaven; and began these two couplets,

""I love a fawn with gentle white black eyes, * Whose walk the
       &nbsp    willow-wand with envy kills:
Forbidding me he bids for rival-mine, * 'Tis Allah's grace who
       &nbsp    grants to whom He wills!""

And when he heard her chant these lines he ended his recitation of the chapter, and began also to sing and repeated the following couplet,

""My Salám to the Fawn in the garments concealed, * And to roses in gardens of cheek revealed.""

The lady rose up when she heard this, her inclination for him redoubled and she lifted the curtain; and Ala al-Din, seeing her, recited these two couplets,

""She shineth forth, a moon, and bends, a willow wand, * And
       &nbsp     breathes out ambergris, and gazes, a gazelle.
Meseems as if grief loved my heart and when from her *
       &nbsp     Estrangement I abide possession to it fell.""[FN#59]

Thereupon she came forward, swinging her haunches and gracefully swaying a shape the handiwork of Him whose boons are hidden; and each of them stole one glance of the eyes that cost them a thousand sighs. And when the shafts of the two regards which met rankled in his heart, he repeated these two couplets,

""She 'spied the moon of Heaven, reminding me * Of nights when met
       &nbsp     we in the meadows li'en:
True, both saw moons, but sooth to say, it was * Her very eyes I
       &nbsp     saw, and she my eyne.""

And when she drew near him, and there remained but two paces between them, he recited these two couplets,

""She spread three tresses of unplaited hair * One night, and
       &nbsp     showed me nights not one but four;
And faced the moon of Heaven with her brow, * And showed me two-
       &nbsp    fold moons in single hour.""

And as she was hard by him he said to her, ""Keep away from me, lest thou infect me."" Whereupon she uncovered her wrist[FN#60] to him, and he saw that it was cleft, as it were in two halves, by its veins and sinews and its whiteness was as the whiteness of virgin silver. Then said she, ""Keep away from me, thou! for thou art stricken with leprosy, and maybe thou wilt infect me."" He asked, ""Who told thee I was a leper?"" and she answered, ""The old woman so told me."" Quoth he, ""'Twas she told me also that thou wast afflicted with white scurvy;"" and so saying, he bared his forearms and showed her that his skin was also like virgin silver. Thereupon she pressed him to her bosom and he pressed her to his bosom and the twain embraced with closest embrace, then she took him and, lying down on her back, let down her petticoat trousers, and in an instant that which his father had left him rose up in rebellion against him and he said, ""Go it, O Shayth Zachary[FN#61] of shaggery, O father of veins!""; and putting both hands to her flanks, he set the sugar-stick[FN#62] to the mouth of the cleft and thrust on till he came to the wicket called ""Pecten."" His passage was by the Gate of Victories[FN#63] and therefrom he entered the Monday market, and those of Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday,[FN#64] and, finding the carpet after the measure of the dais floor,[FN#65] he plied the box within its cover till he came to the end of it. And when morning dawned he cried to her, ""Alas for delight which is not fulfilled! The raven[FN#66] taketh it and flieth away!"" She asked, ""What meaneth this saying?""; and he answered, ""O my lady, I have but this hour to abide with thee."" Quoth she ""Who saith so?"" and quoth he, ""Thy father made me give him a written bond to pay ten thousand dinars to thy wedding-settlement; and, except I pay it this very day, they will imprison me for debt in the Kazi's house; and now my hand lacketh one-half dirham of the sum."" She asked, ""O my lord, is the marriage-bond in thy hand or in theirs?""; and he answered, ""O my lady, in mine, but I have nothing."" She rejoined, ""The matter is easy; fear thou nothing. Take these hundred dinars: an I had more, I would give thee what thou lackest; but of a truth my father, of his love for my cousin, hath transported all his goods, even to my jewellery from my lodging to his. But when they send thee a serjeant of the Ecclesiastical Court,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the young lady rejoined to Ala al-Din, ""And when they send thee at an early hour a serjeant of the Ecclesiastical-Court, and the Kazi and my father bid thee divorce me, do thou reply, By what law is it lawful and right that I should marry at nightfall and divorce in the morning? Then kiss the Kazi's hand and give him a present, and in like manner kiss the Assessors' hands and give each of them ten gold pieces. So they will all speak with thee, and if they ask thee, 'Why dost thou not divorce her and take the thousand dinars and the mule and suit of clothes, according to contract duly contracted?' do thou answer, 'Every hair of her head is worth a thousand ducats to me and I will never put her away, neither will I take a suit of clothes nor aught else.' And if the Kazi say to thee, 'Then pay down the marriage-settlement,' do thou reply, 'I am short of cash at this present;' whereupon he and the Assessors will deal in friendly fashion with thee and allow thee time to pay."" Now whilst they were talking, behold, the Kazi's officer knocked at the door; so Ala al-Din went down and the man said to him, ""Come, speak the Efendi,[FN#67] for thy fatherinlaw summoneth thee."" So Ala al-Din gave him five dinars and said to him, ""O Summoner, by what law am I bound to marry at nightfall and divorce next morning?"" The serjeant answered, ""By no law of ours at all, at all; and if thou be ignorant of the religious law, I will act as thine advocate."" Then they went to the divorce court and the Kazi said to Ala al-Din, ""Why dost thou not put away the woman and take what falleth to thee by the contract?"" Hearing this he went up to the Kazi; and, kissing his hand, put fifty dinars in it and said, ""O our lord the Kazi, by what law is it lawful and right that I should marry at nightfall and divorce in the morning in my own despite?"" The Kazi, answered, ""Divorce as a compulsion and by force is sanctioned by no school of the Moslems."" Then said the young lady's father, ""If thou wilt not divorce, pay me the ten thousand dinars, her marriage-settlement."" Quoth Ala al-Din, ""Give me a delay of three days;"" but the Kazi, said, ""Three days is not time enough; he shall give thee ten."" So they agreed to this and bound him after ten days either to pay the dowry or to divorce her. And after consenting he left them and taking meat and rice and clarified butter[FN#68] and what else of food he needed, returned to the house and told the young woman all that had passed; whereupon she said, ""'Twixt night and day, wonders may display; and Allah bless him for his say:—

'Be mild when rage shall come to afflict thy soul; * Be patient
       &nbsp     when calamity breeds ire;
Lookye, the Nights are big with child by Time, * Whose pregnancy
       &nbsp     bears wondrous things and dire.'""

Then she rose and made ready food and brought the tray, and they two ate and drank and were merry and mirthful. Presently Ala al-Din besought her to let him hear a little music; so she took the lute and played a melody that had made the hardest stone dance for glee, and the strings cried out in present ecstacy, ""O Loving One!'';[FN#69] after which she passed from the adagio into the presto and a livelier measure. As they thus spent their leisure in joy and jollity and mirth and merriment, behold, there came a knocking at the door and she said to him; ""Go see who is at the door."" So he went down and opened it and finding four Dervishes standing without, said to them, ""What want ye?"" They replied, ""O my lord, we are foreign and wandering religious mendicants, the viands of whose souls are music and dainty verse, and we would fain take our pleasure with thee this night till morning cloth appear, when we will wend our way, and with Almighty Allah be thy reward; for we adore music and there is not one of us but knoweth by heart store of odes and songs and ritornellos.""[FN#70] He answered, ""There is one I must consult;"" and he returned and told Zubaydah who said, ""Open the door to them."" So he brought them up and made them sit down and welcomed them; then he fetched them food, but they would not eat and said, ""O our lord, our meat is to repeat Allah's name in our hearts and to hear music with our ears: and bless him who saith,

'Our aim is only converse to enjoy, * And eating joyeth only cattle-kind.'[FN#71]

And just now we heard pleasant music in thy house, but when we entered, it ceased; and fain would we know whether the player was a slave-girl, white or black, or a maiden of good family."" He answered, ""It was this my wife,"" and told them all that had befallen him, adding, ""Verily my father-in-law hath bound me to pay a marriage-settlement of ten thousand dinars for her, and they have given me ten days' time."" Said one of the Dervishes, ""Have no care and think of naught but good; for I am Shaykh of the Convent and have forty Dervishes under my orders. I will presently collect from them the ten thousand dinars and thou shalt pay thy father-in-law the wedding settlement. But now bid thy wife make us music that we may be gladdened and pleasured; for to some folk music is meat, to others medicine and to others refreshing as a fan."" Now these four Dervishes were none other than the Caliph Harun al-Rashid, his Wazir Ja'afar the Barmecide, Abu al-Nowás al-Hasan son of Háni[FN#72] and Masrur the sworder; and the reason of their coming to the house was that the Caliph, being heavy at heart, had summoned his Minister and said, ""O Wazir! it is our will to go down to the city and pace its streets, for my breast is sore straitened."" So they all four donned dervish dress and went down and walked about, till they came to that house where, hearing music, they were minded to know the cause. They spent the night in joyance and harmony and telling tale after tale until morning dawned, when the Caliph laid an hundred gold pieces under the prayer-carpet and all taking leave of Ala al-Din, went their way. Now when Zubaydah lifted the carpet she found beneath it the hundred dinars and she said to her husband, ""Take these hundred dinars which I have found under the prayer-carpet; assuredly the Dervishes when about to leave us laid them there, without our knowledge."" So Ala al-Din took the money and, repairing to the market, bought therewith meat and rice and clarified butter and all they required. And when it was night, he lit the wax-candles and said to his wife, ""The mendicants, it is true, have not brought the ten thousand dinars which they promised me; but indeed they are poor men."" As they were talking, behold, the Dervishes knocked at the door and she said, ""Go down and open to them."" So he did her bidding and bringing them up, said to them, ""Have you brought me the ten thousand dinars you promised me?"" They answered, ""We have not been able to collect aught thereof as yet; but fear nothing: Inshallah, tomorrow we will compound for thee some alchemical-cookery. But now bid thy wife play us her very best pieces and gladden our hearts for we love music."" So she took her lute and made them such melody that had caused the hardest rocks to dance with glee; and they passed the night in mirth and merriment, converse and good cheer, till morn appeared with its sheen and shone, when the Caliph laid an hundred gold pieces under the prayer-carpet and all, after taking leave of Ala al-Din, went their way. And they ceased not to visit him thus every night for nine nights; and each morning the Caliph put an hundred dinars under the prayer carpet, till the tenth night, when they came not. Now the reason of their failure to come was that the Caliph had sent to a great merchant, saying to him, ""Bring me fifty loads of stuffs, such as come from Cairo,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Fifty-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Prince of True Believers said to that merchant, ""Bring me fifty loads of stuffs such as come from Cairo, and let each one be worth a thousand dinars, and write on each bale its price; and bring me also a male Abyssinian slave."" The merchant did the bidding of the Caliph who committed to the slave a basin and ewer of gold and other presents, together with the fifty loads; and wrote a letter to Ala al-Din as from his father Shams al-Din and said to him, ""Take these bales and what else is with them, and go to such and such a quarter wherein dwelleth the Provost of the merchants and say, 'Where be Ala al-Din Abu al Shamat?' till folk direct thee to his quarter and his house."" So the slave took the letter and the goods and what else and fared forth on his errand. Such was his case; but as regards Zubaydah's cousin and first husband, he went to her father and said to him, ""Come let us go to Ala al-Din and make him divorce the daughter of my uncle."" So they set out both together and, when they came to the street in which the house stood, they found fifty he mules laden with bales of stuffs, and a blackamoor riding on a she mule. So they said to him, ""Whose loads are these?"" He replied, ""They belong to my lord Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat; for his father equipped him with merchandise and sent him on a journey to Baghdad-city; but the wild Arabs came forth against him and took his money and goods and all he had. So when the ill news reached his father, he despatched me to him with these loads, in lieu of those he had lost; besides a mule laden with fifty thousand dinars, a parcel of clothes worth a power of money, a robe of sables[FN#73] and a basin and ewer of gold."" Whereupon the lady's father said, ""He whom thou seekest is my son-in-law and I will show thee his house."" Meanwhile Ala al-Din was sitting at home in huge concern, when lo! one knocked at the door and he said, ""O Zubaydah, Allah is all-knowing! but I fear thy father hath sent me an officer from the Kazi or the Chief of Police."" Quoth she, ""Go down and see what it is."" So he went down; and, opening the door, found his father-in-law, the Provost of the merchants with an Abyssinian slave, dusky complexioned and pleasant of favour, riding on a mule. When the slave saw him he dismounted and kissed his hands, and Ala al-Din said, ""What dost thou want?"" He replied, ""I am the slave of my lord Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, son of Shams al-Din, Consul of the merchants for the land of Egypt, who hath sent me to him with this charge."" Then he gave him the letter and Ala al-Din opening it found written what followeth:[FN#74]

""Ho thou my letter! when my friend shall see thee, * Kiss thou
       &nbsp     the ground and buss his sandal-shoon:
Look thou hie softly and thou hasten not, * My life and rest are
       &nbsp     in those hands so boon.


""After hearty salutations and congratulations and high estimation from Shams al-Din to his son, Abu al-Shamat. Know, O my son, that news hath reached me of the slaughter of thy men and the plunder of thy monies and goods; so I send thee herewith fifty loads of Egyptian stuffs, together with a suit of clothes and a robe of sables and a basin and ewer of gold. Fear thou no evil, and the goods thou hast lost were the ransom of thy life; so regret them not and may no further grief befall thee. Thy mother and the people of the house are doing well in health and happiness and all greet thee with abundant greetings. Moreover, O my son, it hath reached me that they have married thee, by way of intermediary, to the lady Zubaydah the lutist and they have imposed on thee a marriage-settlement of ten thousand dinars; wherefore I send thee also fifty thousand dinars by the slave Salím.""[FN#75] Now when Ala al-Din had made an end of reading the letter, he took possession of the loads and, turning to the Provost, said to him, ""O my father-in-law, take the ten thousand dinars, the marriage-settlement of thy daughter Zubaydah, and take also the loads of goods and dispose of them, and thine be the profit; only return me the cost price."" He answered, ""Nay, by Allah, I will take nothing; and, as for thy wife's settlement, do thou settle the matter with her."" Then, after the goods had been brought in, they went to Zuhaydah and she said to her sire, ""O my father, whose loads be these?"" He said, ""These belong to thy husband, Ala al-Din: his father hath sent them to him instead of those whereof the wild Arabs spoiled him. Moreover, he hath sent him fifty thousand dinars with a parcel of clothes, a robe of sables, a she mule for riding and a basin and ewer of gold. As for the marriage-settlement that is for thy recking."" Thereupon Ala al-Din rose and, opening the money box, gave her her settlement and the lady's cousin said, ""O my uncle, let him divorce to me my wife;"" but the old man replied, ""This may never be now; for the marriage tie is in his hand."" Thereupon the young man went out, sore afflicted and sadly vexed and, returning home, fell sick, for his heart had received its death blow; so he presently died. But as for Ala al-Din, after receiving his goods he went to the bazar and buying what meats and drinks he needed, made a banquet as usual—against the night, saying to Zubaydah, ""See these lying Dervishes; they promised us and broke their promises."" Quoth she, ""Thou art the son of a Consul of the merchants, yet was thy hand short of half a dirham; how then should it be with poor Dervishes?"" Quoth he, ""Almighty Allah hath enabled us to do without them; but if they come to us never again will I open the door to them."" She asked, ""Why so, whenas their coming footsteps brought us good luck; and, moreover, they put an hundred dinars under the prayer carpet for us every night? Perforce must thou open the door to them an they come."" So when day departed with its light and in gloom came night, they lighted the wax candles and he said to her, ""Rise, Zubaydah, make us music;"" and behold, at this moment some one knocked at the door, and she said, ""Go and look who is at the door."" So he went down and opened it and seeing the Dervishes, said, ""Oh, fair welcome to the liars! Come up."" Accordingly they went up with him and he seated them and brought them the tray of food; and they ate and drank and became merry and mirthful, and presently said to him, ""O my lord, our hearts have been troubled for thee: what hath passed between thee and thy father-in-law?"" He answered, ""Allah compensated us beyond and above our desire."" Rejoined they, ""By Allah, we were in fear for thee"".—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and and Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Dervishes thus addressed Ala al-Din, ""By Allah, we were in fear for thee and naught kept us from thee but our lack of cash and coin."" Quoth he, ""Speedy relief hath come to me from my Lord; for my father hath sent me fifty thousand dinars and fifty loads of stuffs, each load worth a thousand dinars; besides a riding-mule, a robe of sables, an Abyssinian slave and a basin and ewer of gold. Moreover, I have made my peace with my father-in-law and my wife hath become my lawful wife by my paying her settlement; so laud to Allah for that!"" Presently the Caliph rose to do a necessity; whereupon Ja'afar bent him towards Ala al-Din and said, ""Look to thy manners, for thou art in the presence of the Commander of the Faithful "" Asked he, ""How have I failed in good breeding before the Commander of the Faithful, and which of you is he?"" Quoth Ja'afar, ""He who went out but now to make water is the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, and I am the Wazir Ja'afar; and this is Masrur the executioner and this other is Abu Nowas Hasan bin Hani.. And now, O Ala al-Din, use thy reason and bethink thee how many days' journey it is between Cairo and Baghdad."" He replied, ""Five and forty days' journey;"" and Ja'afar rejoined, ""Thy baggage was stolen only ten days ago; so how could the news have reached thy father, and how could he pack thee up other goods and send them to thee five-and-forty days' journey in ten days' time?"" Quoth Ala al-Din, ""O my lord and whence then came they?"" ""From the Commander of the Faithful,"" replied Ja'afar, ""of his great affection for thee."" As they were speaking, lo! the Caliph entered and Ala al-Din rising, kissed the ground before him and said, ""Allah keep thee, O Prince of the Faithful, and give thee long life; and may the lieges never lack thy bounty and beneficence!"" Replied the Caliph, ""O Ala al-Din, let Zubaydah play us an air, by way of house-warming[FN#76] for thy deliverance."" Thereupon she played him on the lute so rare a melody that the very stones shook for glee, and the strings cried out for present ecstasy, ""O Loving One!"" They spent the night after the merriest fashion, and in the morning the Caliph said to Ala al-Din, ""Come to the Divan to-morrow."" He answered, ""Hearkening and obedience, O Commander of the Faithful; so Allah will and thou be well and in good case!"" On the morrow he took ten trays and, putting on each a costly present, went up with them to the palace; and the Caliph was sitting on the throne when, behold, Ala al-Din appeared at the door of the Divan, repeating these two couplets,

""Honour and Glory wait on thee each morn! * Thine enviers' noses
       &nbsp     in the dust be set!
Ne'er cease thy days to be as white as snow; * Thy foeman's days
       &nbsp     to be as black as jet!""

""Welcome, O Ala Al-Din!"" said the Caliph, and he replied, ""O Commander of the Faithful, the Prophet (whom Allah bless and assain!)[FN#77] was wont to accept presents; and these ten trays, with what is on them, are my offering to thee."" The Caliph accepted his gift and, ordering him a robe of honour, made him Provost of the merchants and gave him a seat in the Divan. And as he was sitting behold, his father-in-law came in and, seeing Ala al-Din seated in his place and clad in a robe of honour, said to the Caliph, ""O King of the age, why is this man sitting in my place and wearing this robe of honour?"" Quoth the Caliph, ""I have made him Provost of the merchants, for offices are by investiture and not in perpetuity, and thou art deposed."" Answered the merchant, ""Thou hast done well, O Commander of the Faithful, for he is ours and one of us. Allah make the best of us the managers of our affairs! How many a little one hath become great!"" Then the Caliph wrote Ala al-Din a Firman[FN#78] of investiture and gave it to the Governor who gave it to the crier,[FN#79] and the crier made proclamation in the Divan saying, ""None is Provost of the merchants but Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, and his word is to be heard, and he must be obeyed with due respect paid, and he meriteth homage and honour and high degree!"" Moreover, when the Divan broke up, the Governor went down with the crier before Ala Al-Din!"" and the crier repeated the proclamation and they carried Ala al-Din through the thoroughfares of Baghdad, making proclamation of his dignity. Next day, Ala al-Din opened a shop for his slave Salim and set him therein, to buy and sell, whilst he himself rode to the palace and took his place in the Caliph's Divan.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Sixtieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ala al-Din rode to the palace and took his place in the Caliph's Divan. Now it came to pass one day, when he sat in his stead as was his wont, behold, one said to the Caliph, ""O Commander of the Faithful, may thy head survive such an one the cup-companion!; for he is gone to the mercy of Almighty Allah, but be thy life prolonged!""[FN#80] Quoth the Caliph, ""Where is Ala al-Din Abu al-al-Shamat?"" So he went up to the Commander of the Faithful, who at once clad him in a splendid dress of honour and made him his boon-companion; appointing him a monthly pay and allowance of a thousand dinars. He continued to keep him company till, one day, as he sat in the Divan, according to his custom attending upon the Caliph, lo and behold! an Emir came up with sword and shield in hand and said, ""O Commander of the Faithful, may thy head long outlive the Head of the Sixty, for he is dead this day;"" whereupon the Caliph ordered Ala al-Din a dress of honour and made him Chief of the Sixty, in place of the other who had neither wife nor son nor daughter. So Ala al-Din laid hands on his estate and the Caliph said to him, ""Bury him in the earth and take all he hath left of wealth and slaves and handmaids.""[FN#81] Then he shook the handkerchief[FN#82] and dismissed the Divan, whereupon Ala al-Din went forth, attended by Ahmad al-Danaf, captain of the right, and Hasan Shúmán, captain of the left, riding at his either stirrup, each with his forty men.[FN#83] Presently, he turned to Hasan Shuman and his men and said to them, ""Plead ye for me with the Captain Ahmad al-Danaf that he please to accept me as his son by covenant before Allah."" And Ahmad assented, saying, ""I and my forty men will go before thee to the Divan every morning."" Now after this Ala al-Din continued in the Caliph's service many days; till one day it chanced that he left the Divan and returning home, dismissed Ahmad al-Danaf and his men and sat down with his wife Zubaydab, the lute-player, who lighted the wax candles and went out of the room upon an occasion. Suddenly he heard a loud shriek; so he rose up and running in haste to see what was the matter, found that it was his wife who had cried out. She was lying at full length on the ground and, when he put his hand to her breast, he found her dead. Now her father's house faced that of Ala al-Din, and he, hearing the shriek, came in and said, ""What is the matter, O my lord Ala al-Din?"" He replied, ""O my father, may thy head outlive thy daughter Zubaydah! But, O my father, honour to the dead is burying them."" So when the morning dawned, they buried her in the earth and her husband and father condoled with and mutually consoled each other. Thus far concerning her; but as regards Ala al-Din he donned mourning dress and declined the Divan, abiding tearful-eyed and heavy-hearted at home. After a while, the Caliph said to Ja'afar, ""O Watir, what is the cause of Ala al-Din's absence from the Divan?"" The Minister answered, ""O Commander of the Faithful, he is in mourning for his wife Zubaydah; and is occupied in receiving those who come to console him;"" and the Caliph said, ""It behoveth us to pay him a visit of condolence."" ""I hear and I obey,"" replied Ja'afar. So they took horse, the Caliph and the Minister and a few attendants, and rode to Ala al-Din's house and, as he was sitting at home, behold, the party came in upon him; whereupon he rose to receive them and kissed the ground before the Caliph, who said to him, ""Allah make good thy loss to thee!"" Answered Ala Al-Din, ""May Allah preserve thee to us, O Commander of the Faithful!"" Then said the Caliph, ""O Ala al-Din, why hast thou absented thyself from the Divan?"" And he replied, ""Because of my mourning for my wife, Zubaydah, O Commander of the Faithful."" The Caliph rejoined, ""Put away grief from thee: verily she is dead and gone to the mercy of Almighty Allah and mourning will avail thee nothing; no, nothing."" But Ala al-Din said ""O Commander of the Faithful, I shall never leave mourning for her till I die and they bury me by her side."" Quoth the Caliph, ""In Allah is compensation for every decease, and neither device nor riches can deliver from death; and divinely gifted was he who said,

'All sons of woman, albe long preserved, * Are borne upon the
       &nbsp     bulging bier some day.[FN#84]
How then shall 'joy man joy or taste delight, * Upon whose cheeks
       &nbsp     shall rest the dust and clay?'""

When the Caliph had made an end of condoling with him, he charged him not to absent himself from the Divan and returned to his palace. And Ala Al-Din, after a last sorrowful night, mounted early in the morning and, riding to the court, kissed the ground before the Commander of the Faithful who made a movement if rising from the throne[FN#85] to greet and welcome him; and bade him take his appointed place in the Divan, saying, ""O Ala al-Din, thou art my guest to-night."" So presently he carried him into his serraglio and calling a slave-girl named Kút al-Kulúb, said to her, ""Ala al-Din had a wife called Zubaydah, who used to sing to him and solace him of cark and care; but she is gone to the mercy of Almighty Allah, and now I would have thee play him an air upon the lute,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph said to the damsel Kut al-Kulub, ""I would have thee play him upon the lute an air, of fashion sweet and rare, that he may be solaced of his cark and care."" So she rose and made sweet music; and the Caliph said to Ala al-Din, ""What sayst thou of this damsel's voice?"" He replied, ""Verily, O Commander of the Faithful, Zubaydah's voice was the finer; but she is skilled in touching the lute cunningly and her playing would make a rock dance with glee."" The Caliph asked, ""Doth she please thee?'' and he answered, ""She doth, O Commander of the Faithful;"" whereupon the King said, ""By the life of my head and the tombs of my forefathers, she is a gift from me to thee, she and her waiting- women!"" Ala al-Din fancied that the Caliph was jesting with him; but, on the morrow, the King went in to Kut al-Kulub and said to her, ""I have given thee to Ala Al-Din, whereat she rejoiced, for she had seen and loved him. Then the Caliph returned from his serraglio palace to the Divan; and, calling porters, said to them, ""Set all the goods of Kut al-Kulub and her waiting-women in a litter, and carry them to Ala al-Din's home."" So they conducted her to the house and showed her into the pavilion, whilst the Caliph sat in the hall of audience till the dose of day, when the Divan broke up and he retired to his harem. Such was his case; but as regards Kut al-Kulub, when she had taken up her lodging in Ala al-Din's mansion, she and her women, forty in all, besides the eunuchry, she called two of these caponised slaves and said to them, ""Sit ye on stools, one on the right and another on the left hand of the door; and, when Ala al-Din cometh home, both of you kiss his hands and say to him, ""Our mistress Kut al-Kulub requesteth thy presence in the pavilion, for the Caliph hath given her to thee, her and her women."" They answered, ""We hear and obey;"" and did as she bade them. So, when Ala al-Din returned, he found two of the Caliph's eunuchs sitting at the door and was amazed at the matter and said to himself, ""Surely, this is not my own house; or else what can have happened?"" Now when the eunuchs saw him, they rose to him and, kissing his hands, said to him, ""We are of the Caliph's household and slaves to Kut al-Kulub, who saluteth thee, giving thee to know that the Caliph hath bestowed her on thee, her and her women, and requesteth thy presence."" Quoth Ala al-Din, ""Say ye to her, 'Thou art welcome; but so long as thou shalt abide with me, I will not enter the pavilion wherein thou art, for what was the master's should not become the man's;' and furthermore ask her, 'What was the sum of thy day's expenditure in the Caliph's palace?'"" So they went in and did his errand to her, and she answered, ""An hundred dinars a day;"" whereupon quoth he to himself, ""There was no need for the Caliph to give me Kut al-Kulub, that I should be put to such expense for her; but there is no help for it."" So she abode with him awhile and he assigned her daily an hundred dinars for her maintenance; till, one day, he absented himself from the Divan and the Caliph said to Ja'afar, ""O Watir, I gave not Kut al-Kulub unto Ala al-Din but that she might console him for his wife; why, then, doth he still hold aloof from us?"" Answered Ja'afar, ""O Commander of the Faithful, he spake sooth who said, 'Whoso findeth his fere, forgetteth his friends.'"" Rejoined the Caliph, ""Haply he hath not absented himself without excuse, but we will pay him a visit."" Now some days before this, Ala al-Din had said to Ja'afar, ""I complained to the Caliph of my grief and mourning for the loss of my wife Zubaydah and he gave me Kut al-Kulub;"" and the Minister replied, ""Except he loved thee, he had not given her to thee. Say hast thou gone in unto her, O Ala al-Din?"" He rejoined, ""No, by Allah! I know not her length from her breadth."" He asked ""And why?"" and he answered, ""O Wazir, what befitteth the lord befitteth not the liege."" Then the Caliph and Ja'afar disguised themselves and went privily to visit Ala al-Din; but he knew them and rising to them kissed the hands of the Caliph, who looked at him and saw signs of sorrow in his face. So he said to him, ""O Al-Din, whence cometh this sorrow wherein I see thee? Hast thou not gone in unto Kut al-Kulub?"" He replied, ""O Commander of the Faithful, what befitteth the lord befitteth not the thrall. No, as yet I have not gone in to visit her nor do I know her length from her breadth; so pray quit me of her."" Quoth the Caliph, ""I would fain see her and question her of her case;"" and quoth Ala al-Din, ""I hear and I obey, O Commander of the Faithful."" So the Caliph went in,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph went in to Kut al-Kulub, who rose to him on sighting him and kissed the ground between his hands; when he said to her, ""Hath Ala al-Din gone in unto thee?"" and she answered, ""No, O Commander of the Faithful, I sent to bid him come, but he would not."" So the Caliph bade carry her back to the Harim and saying to Ala Al-Din, ""Do not absent thyself from us,"" returned to his palace. Accordingly, next morning, Ala Al-Din, mounted and rode to the Divan, where he took his seat as Chief of the Sixty. Presently the Caliph ordered his treasurer to give the Wazir Ja'afar ten thousand dinars and said when his order was obeyed, ""I charge thee to go down to the bazar where handmaidens are sold and buy Ala Al-Din, a slave-girl with this sum."" So in obedience to the King, Ja'afar took Ala al-Din and went down with him to the bazar. Now as chance would have it, that very day, the Emir Khálid, whom the Caliph had made Governor of Baghdad, went down to the market to buy a slave-girl for his son and the cause of his going was that his wife, Khátún by name, had borne him a son called Habzalam Bazázah,[FN#86] and the same was foul of favour and had reached the age of twenty, without learning to mount horse; albeit his father was brave and bold, a doughty rider ready to plunge into the Sea of Darkness.[FN#87] And it happened that on a certain night he had a dream which caused nocturnal-pollution whereof he told his mother, who rejoiced and said to his father, ""I want to find him a wife, as he is now ripe for wedlock."" Quoth Khálid, ""The fellow is so foul of favour and withal-so rank of odour, so sordid and beastly that no woman would take him as a gift."" And she answered, ""We will buy him a slave-girl."" So it befell, for the accomplishing of what Allah Almighty had decreed, that on the same day, Ja'afar and Ala al-Din, the Governor Khálid and his son went down to the market and behold, they saw in the hands of a broker a beautiful girl, lovely faced and of perfect shape, and the Wazir said to him, ""O broker, ask her owner if he will take a thousand dinars for her."" And as the broker passed by the Governor with the slave, Hahzalam Bazazah cast at her one glance of the eyes which entailed for himself one thousand sighs; and he fell in love with her and passion got hold of him and he said, ""O my father, buy me yonder slave-girl."" So the Emir called the broker, who brought the girl to him, and asked her her name. She replied, ""My name is Jessamine;"" and he said to Hahzalam Bazazah, ""O my son, as she please thee, do thou bid higher for her."" Then he asked the broker, ""What hath been bidden for her?"" and he replied, ""A thousand dinars."" Said the Governor's son, ""She is mine for a thousand pieces of gold and one more;"" and the broker passed on to Ala al-Din who bid two thousand dinars for her; and as often as the Emir's son bid another dinar, Ala al-Din bid a thousand. The ugly youth was vexed at this and said, ""O broker! who is it that outbiddeth me for the slave-girl?"" Answered the broker, ""It is the Wazir Ja'afar who is minded to buy her for Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat."" And Ala al-Din continued till he brought her price up to ten thousand dinars, and her owner was satisfied to sell her for that sum. Then he took the girl and said to her, ""I give thee thy freedom for the love of Almighty Allah;"" and forthwith wrote his contract of marriage with her and carried her to his house. Now when the broker returned, after having received his brokerage, the Emir's son summoned him and said to him, ""Where is the girl?"" Quoth he, ""She was bought for ten thousand dinars by Ala al-Din, who hath set her free and married her."" At this the young man was greatly vexed and cast down and, sighing many a sigh, returned home, sick for love of the damsel; and he threw himself on his bed and refused food, for love and longing were sore upon him. Now when his mother saw him in this plight, she said to him, ""Heaven assain thee, O my son! What aileth thee?"" And he answered, ""Buy me Jessamine, O my mother."" Quoth she, ""When the flower-seller passeth I will buy thee a basketful of jessamine."" Quoth he, ""It is not the jessamine one smells, but a slave-girl named Jessamine, whom my father would not buy for me."" So she said to her husband, ""Why and wherefore didest thou not buy him the girl?"" and he replied, ""What is fit for the lord is not fit for the liege and I have no power to take her: no less a man bought her than Ala Al-Din, Chief of the Sixty."" Then the youth's weakness redoubled upon him, till he gave up sleeping and eating, and his mother bound her head with the fillets of mourning. And while in her sadness she sat at home, lamenting over her son, behold, came in to her an old woman, known as the mother of Ahmad Kamákim[FN#88] the arch-thief, a knave who would bore through a middle wall and scale the tallest of the tall and steal the very kohl off the eye-ball.[FN#89] From his earliest years he had been given to these malpractices, till they made him Captain of the Watch, when he stole a sum of money; and the Chief of Police, coming upon him in the act, carried him to the Caliph, who bade put him to death on the common execution-ground.[FN#90] But he implored protection of the Wazir whose intercession the Caliph never rejected, so he pleaded for him with the Commander of the Faithful who said, ""How canst thou intercede for this pest of the human race?"" Ja'afar answered, ""O Commander of the Faithful, do thou imprison him; whoso built the first jail was a sage, seeing that a jail is the grave of the living and a joy for the foe."" So the Caliph bade lay him in bilboes and write thereon, ""Appointed to remain here until death and not to be loosed but on the corpse washer's bench;"" and they cast him fettered into limbo. Now his mother was a frequent visitor to the house of the Emir Khálid, who was Governor and Chief of Police; and she used to go in to her son in jail and say to him, ""Did I not warn thee to turn from thy wicked ways?''[FN#91] And he would always answer her, ""Allah decreed this to me; but, O my mother, when thou visitest the Emir's wife make her intercede for me with her husband."" So when the old woman came into the Lady Khatun, she found her bound with the fillets of mourning and said to her, ""Wherefore dost thou mourn?"" She replied, ""For my son Habzalam Bazazah;"" and the old woman exclaimed, ""Heaven assain thy son!; what hath befallen him?"" So the mother told her the whole story, and she said, ""What thou say of him who should achieve such a feat as would save thy son?"" Asked the lady, ""And what feat wilt thou do?"" Quoth the old woman, ""I have a son called Ahmad Kamakim, the arch-thief, who lieth chained in jail and on his bilboes is written, 'Appointed to remain till death'; so do thou don thy richest clothes and trick thee out with thy finest jewels and present thyself to thy husband with an open face and smiling mien; and when he seeketh of thee what men seek of women, put him off and baulk him of his will and say, 'By Allah, 'tis a strange thing! When a man desireth aught of his wife he dunneth her till she doeth it; but if a wife desire aught of her husband, he will not grant it to her.' Then he will say, 'What dost thou want?'; and do thou answer, 'First swear to grant my request.' If he swear to thee by his head or by Allah, say to him, 'Swear to me the oath of divorce', and do not yield to him, except he do this. And whenas he hath sworn to thee the oath of divorce, say to him, 'Thou keepest in prison a man called Ahmad Kamakim, and he hath a poor old mother, who hath set upon me and who urgeth me in the matter and who saith, 'Let thy husband intercede for him with the Caliph, that my son may repent and thou gain heavenly guerdon.'"" And the Lady Khatun replied, ""I hear and obey."" So when her husband came into her—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Governor came in to his wife, who spoke to him as she had been taught and made him swear the divorce-oath before she would yield to his wishes. He lay with her that night and, when morning dawned, after he had made the Ghusl-ablution and prayed the dawn- prayer, he repaired to the prison and said, ""O Ahmad Kamakim, O thou arch-thief, dost thou repent of thy works?""; whereto he replied, ""I do indeed repent and turn to Allah and say with heart and tongue, 'I ask pardon of Allah.'"" So the Governor took him out of jail and carried him to the Court (he being still in bilboes) and, approaching the Caliph, kissed ground before him. Quoth the King, ""O Emir Khálid, what seekest thou?""; whereupon he brought forward Ahmad Kamakim, shuffling and tripping in his fetters, and the Caliph said to him, ""What! art thou yet alive, O Kamakim?"" He replied, ""O Commander of the Faithful, the miserable are long-lived."" Quoth the Caliph to the Emir, ""Why hast thou brought him hither?""; and quoth he, ""O Commander of the Faithful, he hath a poor old mother cut off from the world who hath none but this son and she hath had recourse to thy slave, imploring him to intercede with thee to strike off his chains, for he repenteth of his evil courses; and to make him Captain of the Watch as before."" The Caliph asked Ahmad Kamakim, ""Doss thou repent of thy sins?"" ""I do indeed repent me to Allah, O Commander of the Faithful,"" answered he; whereupon the Caliph called for the blacksmith and made him strike off his irons on the corpse- washer's bench.[FN#92] Moreover, he restored him to his former office and charged him to walk in the ways of godliness and righteousness. So he kissed the Caliph's hands and, being invested with the uniform of Captain of the Watch, he went forth, whilst they made proclamation of his appointment. Now for a long time he abode in the exercise of his office, till one day his mother went in to the Governor's wife, who said to her, ""Praised be Allah who hath delivered thy son from prison and restored him to health and safety! But why dost thou not bid him contrive some trick to get the girl Jessamine for my son Hahzalam Bazazah?"" ""That will I,"" answered she and, going out from her, repaired to her son. She found him drunk with wine and said to him, ""O my son, no one caused thy release from jail but the wife of the Governor, and she would have thee find some means to slay Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat and get his slave-girl Jessamine for her son Habzalam Bazazah."" He answered, ""That will be the easiest of things; and I must needs set about it this very night."" Now this was the first night of the new month, and it was the custom of the Caliph to spend that night with the Lady Zubaydah, for the setting free of a slave-girl or a Mameluke or something of the sort. Moreover, on such occasions he used to doff his royal-habit, together with his rosary and dagger-sword and royal-signet, and set them all upon a chair in the sitting- saloon: and he had also a golden lanthorn, adorned with three jewels strung on a wire of gold, by which he set great store; and he would commit all these things to the charge of the eunuchry, whilst he went into the Lady Zubaydah's apartment. So arch-thief Ahmad Kamakin waited till midnight, when Canopus shone bright, and all creatures to sleep were dight whilst the Creator veiled them with the veil of night. Then he took his drawn sword in his right and his grappling hook in his left and, repairing to the Caliph's sitting-saloon planted his scaling ladder and cast his grapnel on to the side of the terrace-roof; then, raising the trap-door, let himself down into the saloon, where he found the eunuchs asleep. He drugged them with hemp-fumes;[FN#93] and, taking the Caliph's dress; dagger, rosary, kerchief, signet-ring and the lanthorn whereupon were the pearls, returned whence he came and betook himself to the house of Ala al-Din, who had that night celebrated his wedding festivities with Jessamine and had gone in unto her and gotten her with child. So arch-thief Ahmad Kamakim climbed over into his saloon and, raising one of the marble slabs from the sunken part of the floor,[FN#94] dug a hole under it and laid the stolen things therein, all save the lanthorn, which he kept for himself. Then he plastered down the marble slab as it before was, and returning whence he came, went back to his own house, saying, ""I will now tackle my drink and set this lanthorn before me and quaff the cup to its light.""[FN#95] Now as soon as it was dawn of day, the Caliph went out into the sitting-chamber; and, seeing the eunuchs drugged with hemp, aroused them. Then he put his hand to the chair and found neither dress nor signet nor rosary nor dagger-sword nor kerchief nor lanthorn; whereat he was exceeding wroth and donning the dress of anger, which was a scarlet suit,[FN#96] sat down in the Divan. So the Wazir Ja'afar came forward and kissing the ground before him, said, ""Allah avert all evil from the Commander of the Faithful!"" Answered the Caliph, ""O Wazir, the evil is passing great!"" Ja'afar asked, ""What has happened?"" so he told him what had occurred; and, behold, the Chief of Police appeared with Ahmad Kamakim the robber at his stirrup, when he found the Commander of the Faithful sore enraged. As soon as the Caliph saw him, he said to him, ""O Emir Khálid, how goes Baghdad?"" And he answered, ""Safe and secure."" Cried he ""Thou liest!"" ""How so, O Prince of True Believers?"" asked the Emir. So he told him the case and added, ""I charge thee to bring me back all the stolen things."" Replied the Emir, ""O Commander of the Faithful, the vinegar worm is of and in the vinegar, and no stranger can get at this place.""[FN#97] But the Caliph said, ""Except thou bring me these things, I will put thee to death."" Quoth he, ""Ere thou slay me, slay Ahmad Kamakim, for none should know the robber and the traitor but the Captain of the Watch."" Then came forward Ahmad Kamakim and said to the Caliph, ""Accept my intercession for the Chief of Police, and I will be responsible to thee for the thief and will track his trail till I find him; but give me two Kazis and two Assessors for he who did this thing feareth thee not, nor cloth he fear the Governor nor any other."" Answered the Caliph, ""Thou shalt have what thou wantest; but let search be made first in my palace and then in those of the Wazir and the Chief of the Sixty."" Rejoined Ahmad Kamakim, ""Thou sayest well, O Commander of the Faith ful; belike the man that did this ill deed be one who hath been reared in the King's household or in that of one of his officers."" Cried the Caliph, ""As my head liveth, whosoever shall have done the deed I will assuredly put him to death, be it mine own son!"" Then Ahmad Kamakim received a written warrant to enter and perforce search the houses;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ahmad Kamakim got what he wanted, and received a written warrant to enter and perforce search the houses; so he fared forth, taking in his hand a rod[FN#98] made of bronze and copper, iron and steel, of each three equal-parts. He first searched the palace of the Caliph, then that of the Wazir Ja'afar; after which he went the round of the houses of the Chamberlains and the Viceroys till he came to that of Ala al-Din. Now when the Chief of the Sixty heard the clamour before his house, he left his wife Jessamine and went down and, opening the door, found the Master of Police without in the midst of a tumultuous crowd. So he said, ""What is the matter, O Emir Khálid?"" Thereupon the Chief told him the case and Ala al-Din said, ""Enter my house and search it."" The Governor replied, ""Pardon, O my lord; thou art a man in whom trust is reposed and Allah forfend that the trusty turn traitor!"" Quoth Ala al-Din, ""There is no help for it but that my house be searched."" So the Chief of Police entered, attended by the Kazi and his Assessors; whereupon Ahmad Kamakim went straight to the depressed floor of the saloon and came to the slab, under which he had buried the stolen goods and let the rod fall upon it with such violence that the marble broke in sunder and behold something glittered underneath. Then said he, ""Bismillah; in the name of Allah! Mashallah; whatso Allah willeth! By the blessing of our coming a hoard hath been hit upon, wait while we go down into this hiding-place and see what is therein."" So the Kazi and Assessors looked into the hole and finding there the stolen goods, drew up a statement[FN#99] of how they had discovered them in Ala al-Din's house, to which they set their seals. Then, they bade seize upon Ala al-Din and took his turban from his head, and officially registered all his monies and effects which were in the mansion. Meanwhile, arch-thief Ahmad Kamakim laid hands on Jessamine, who was with child by Ala al-Din, and committed her to his mother, saying, ""Deliver her to Khatun, the Governor's lady:"" so the old woman took her and carried her to the wife of the Master of Police. Now as soon as Habzalam Bazazah saw her, health and heart returned to him and he arose without stay or delay and joyed with exceeding joy and would have drawn near her; but she plucks a dagger from her girdle and said, ""Keep off from me, or I will kill thee and kill myself after."" Exclaimed his mother, ""O strumpet, let my son have his will of thee!"" But Jessamine answered ""O bitch, by what law is it lawful for a woman to marry two men; and how shall the dog be admitted to the place of the lion?"" With this, the ugly youth's love-longing redoubled and he sickened for yearning and unfulfilled desire; and refusing food returned to his pillow. Then said his mother to her, ""O harlot, how canst thou make me thus to sorrow for my son? Needs must I punish thee with torture, and as for Ala al-Din, he will assuredly be hanged."" ""And I will die for love of him,"" answered Jessamine. Then the Governor's wife arose and stripped her of her jewels and silken raiment and, clothing her in petticoat-trousers of sack-cloth and a shift of hair-cloth, sent her down into the kitchen and made her a scullery-wench, saying, ""The reward for thy constancy shall be to break up fire-wood and peel onions and set fire under the cooking-pots."" Quoth she, ""I am willing to suffer all manner of hardships and servitude, but I will not suffer the sight of thy son."" However, Allah inclined the hearts of the slave-girls to her and they used to do her service in the kitchen. Such was the case with Jessamine; but as regards Ala al-Din they carried him, together with the stolen goods, to the Divan where the Caliph still sat upon his throne. And behold, the King looked upon his effects and said, ""Where did ye find them?"" They replied, ""In the very middle of the house belonging to Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat;"" whereat the Caliph was filled with wrath and took the things, but found not the lanthorn among them and said, ""O Ala al-Din, where is the lanthorn?"" He answered ""I stole it not, I know naught of it; I never saw it; I can give no information about it!"" Said the Caliph, ""O traitor, how cometh it that I brought thee near unto me and thou hast cast me out afar, and I trusted in thee and thou betrayest me?"" And he commanded to hang him. So the Chief of Police took him and went down with him into the city, whilst the crier preceded them proclaiming aloud and saying, ""This is the reward and the least of the reward he shall receive who doth treason against the Caliphs of True Belief!"" And the folk flocked to the place where the gallows stood. Thus far concerning him; but as regards Ahmad al-Danaf, Ala al-Din's adopted father, he was sitting making merry with his followers in a garden, and carousing and pleasuring when lo! in came one of the water-carriers of the Divan and, kissing the hand of Ahmad al-Danaf, said to him, ""O Captain Ahmad, O Danaf! thou sittest at thine ease with water flowing at thy feet,[FN#100] and thou knowest not what hath happened."" Asked Ahmad, ""What is it?"" and the other answered, ""They have gone down to the gallows with thy son Ala al-Din, adopted by a covenant before Allah!"" Quoth Ahmad, ""What is the remedy here, O Hasan Shuuman, and what sayst thou of this?"" He replied, ""Assuredly Ala al-Din is innocent and this blame hath come to him from some one enemy.""[FN#101] Quoth Ahmad, ""What counsellest thou?"" and Hasan said, ""We must rescue him, Inshallah!"" Then he went to the jail and said to the gaolor, ""Give us some one who deserveth death."" So he gave him one that was likest of men to Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat; and they covered his head and carried him to the place of execution between Ahmad al-Danaf and Ali al-Zaybak of Cairo.[FN#102] Now they had brought Ala al-Din to the gibbet, to hang him, but Ahmad al-Danaf came forward and set his foot on that of the hangman, who said, ""Give me room to do my duty."" He replied, ""O accursed, take this man and hang him in Ala al-Din's stead; for he is innocent and we will ransom him with this fellow, even as Abraham ransomed Ishmael with the ram.""[FN#103] So the hangman seized the man and hanged him in lieu of Ala al-Din; whereupon Ahmad and Ali took Ala al-Din and carried him to Ahmad's quarters and, when there, Ala al-Din turned to him and said, ""O my sire and chief, Allah requite thee with the best of good!"" Quoth he, ""O Ala al-Din""— And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Calamity Ahmad cried, ""O Ala al-Din, what is this deed thou hast done? The mercy of Allah be on him who said, 'Whoso trusteth thee betray him not, e'en if thou be a traitor.' Now the Caliph set thee in high place about him and styled thee 'Trusty' and 'Faithful'; how then couldst thou deal thus with him and steal his goods?"" ""By the Most Great Name, O my father and chief,"" replied Ala al-Din, ""I had no hand in this, nor did I such deed, nor know I who did it."" Quoth Ahmad, ""Of a surety none did this but a manifest enemy and whoso doth aught shall be requited for his deed; but, O Ala al-Din, thou canst sojourn no longer in Baghdad, for Kings, O my son, may not pass from one thing to another, and when they go in quest of a man, ah! longsome is his travail."" ""Whither shall I go, O my chief?"" asked Ala al-Din; and he answered, ""O my son, I will bring thee to Alexandria, for it is a blessed place; its threshold is green and its sojourn is agreeable."" And Ala al-Din rejoined, ""I hear and I obey, O my chief."" So Ahmad said to Hasan Shuuman, ""Be mindful and, when the Caliph asketh for me, say, 'He is gone touring about the provinces'."" Then, taking Ala al-Din, he went forth of Baghdad and stayed not going till they came to the outlying vineyards and gardens, where they met two Jews of the Caliph's tax-gatherers, riding on mules. Quoth Ahmad Al-Danaf to these, ""Give me the black-mail.""[FN#104] and quoth they, ""Why should we pay thee black mail?"" whereto he replied, ""Because I am the watchman of this valley."" So they gave him each an hundred gold pieces, after which he slew them and took their mules, one of which he mounted, whilst Ala al-Din bestrode the other. Then they rode on till they came to the city of Ayás[FN#105] and put up their beasts for the night at the Khan. And when morning dawned, Ala al-Din sold his own mule and committed that of Ahmad to the charge of the door-keeper of the caravanserai, after which they took ship from Ayas port and sailed to Alexandria. Here they landed and walked up to the bazar and behold, there was a broker crying a shop and a chamber behind it for nine hundred and fifty dinars. Upon this Ala al-Din bid a thousand which the broker accepted, for the premises belonged to the Treasury; and the seller handed over to him the keys and the buyer opened the shop and found the inner parlour furnished with carpets and cushions. Moreover, he found there a store-room full of sails and masts, cordage and seamen's chests, bags of beads and cowrie[FN#106]- shells, stirrups, battle-axes, maces, knives, scissors and such matters, for the last owner of the shop had been a dealer in second-hand goods.[FN#107]ook his seat in the shop and Ahmad al-Danaf said to him, ""O my son, the shop and the room and that which is therein are become thine; so tarry thou here and buy and sell; and repine not at thy lot for Almighty Allah blesseth trade."" After this he abode with him three days and on the fourth he took leave of him, saying, ""Abide here till I go back and bring thee the Caliph's pardon and learn who hath played thee this trick."" Then he shipped for Ayas, where he took the mule from the inn and, returning to Baghdad met Pestilence Hasan and his followers, to whom said he, ""Hath the Caliph asked after me?""; and he replied, ""No, nor hast thou come to his thought."" So he resumed his service about the Caliph's person and set himself to sniff about for news of Ala al-Din's case, till one day he heard the Caliph say to the Watir, ""See, O Ja'afar, how Ala al-Din dealt with me!"" Replied the Minister, ""O Commander of the Faithful, thou hast requited him with hanging and hath he not met with his reward?"" Quoth he, ""O Wazir, I have a mind to go down and see him hanging;"" and the Wazir answered, ""Do what thou wilt, O Commander of the Faithful."" So the Caliph, accompanied by Ja'afar, went down to the place of execution and, raising his eyes, saw the hanged man to be other than Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, surnamed the Trusty, and said, ""O Wazir, this is not Ala al-Din!"" ""How knowest thou that it is not he?"" asked the Minister, and the Caliph answered, ""Ala al-Din was short and this one is tall "" Quoth Ja'afar, ""Hanging stretcheth."" Quoth the Caliph, ""Ala al-Din was fair and this one's face is black."" Said Ja'afar ""Knowest thou not, O Commander of the Faithful, that death is followed by blackness?"" Then the Caliph bade take down the body from the gallows tree and they found the names of the two Shaykhs, Abu Bakr and Omar, written on its heels[FN#108] whereupon cried the Caliph, ""O Wazir, Ala al Din was a Sunnite, and this fellow is a Rejecter, a Shi'ah."" He answered, ""Glory be to Allah who knoweth the hidden things, while we know not whether this was Ala al-Din or other than he."" Then the Caliph bade bury the body and they buried it; and Ala al-Din was forgotten as though he never had been. Such was his case; but as regards Habzalam Bazazah, the Emir Khálid's son, he ceased not to languish for love and longing till he died and they joined him to the dust. And as for the young wife Jessamine, she accomplished the months of her pregnancy and, being taken with labour-pains, gave birth to a boy-child like unto the moon. And when her fellow slave-girls said to her, ""What wilt thou name him?"" she answered, ""Were his father well he had named him; but now I will name him Aslán.""[FN#109] She gave him suck for two successive years, then weaned him, and he crawled and walked. Now it so came to pass that one day, whilst his mother was busied with the service of the kitchen, the boy went out and, seeing the stairs, mounted to the guest-chamber.[FN#110] And the Emir Khálid who was sitting there took him upon his lap and glorified his Lord for that which he had created and fashioned then closely eyeing his face, the Governor saw that he was the likest of all creatures to Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat. Presently, his mother Jessamine sought for him and finding him not, mounted to the guest-chamber, where she saw the Emir seated, with the child playing in his lap, for Allah had inclined his heart to the boy. And when the child espied his mother, he would have thrown himself upon her; but the Emir held him tight to his bosom and said to Jessamine, ""Come hither, O damsel."" So she came to him, when he said to her, ""Whose son is this?""; and she replied, ""He is my son and the fruit of my vitals."" ""And who is his father?"" asked the Emir; and she answered, ""His father was Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, but now he is become thy son."" Quoth Khálid, ""In very sooth Ala al-Din was a traitor."" Quoth she, ""Allah deliver him from treason! the Heavens forfend and forbid that the 'Trusty' should be a traitor!"" Then said he, ""When this boy shall grow up and reach man's estate and say to thee, 'Who is my father?' say to him, 'Thou art the son of the Emir Khálid, Governor and Chief of Police.'"" And she answered, ""I hear and I obey."" Then he circumcised the boy and reared him with the goodliest rearing, and engaged for him a professor of law and religious science, and an expert penman who taught him to read and write; so he read the Koran twice and learnt it by heart and he grew up, saying to the Emir, ""O my father!"" Moreover, the Governor used to go down with him to the tilting-ground and assemble horsemen and teach the lad the fashion of fight and fray, and the place to plant lance-thrust and sabre-stroke; so that by the time he was fourteen years old, he became a valiant wight and accomplished knight and gained the rank of Emir. Now it chanced one day that Aslan fell in with Ahmad Kamakim, the arch-thief, and accompanied him as cup- companion to the tavern[FN#111] and behold, Ahmad took out the jewelled lanthorn he had stolen from the Caliph and, setting it before him, pledged the wine cup to its light, till he became drunken. So Aslan said to him, ""O Captain, give me this lanthorn;"" but he replied, ""I cannot give it to thee."" Asked Aslan, ""Why not?""; and Ahmad answered, ""Because lives have been lost for it."" ""Whose life?"" enquired Aslan; and Ahmad rejoined, ""There came hither a man who was made Chief of the Sixty; he was named Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat and he lost his life through this lanthorn."" Quoth Aslan, ""And what was that story, and what brought about his death?"" Quoth Ahmad Kamakim, ""Thou hadst an elder brother by name Hahzalam Bazazah, and when he reached the age of sixteen and was ripe for marriage, thy father would have bought him a slave-girl named Jessamine."" And he went on to tell him the whole story from first to last of Habzalam Bazazah's illness and what befell Ala al-Din in his innocence. When Aslan heard this, he said in thought, ""Haply this slave-girl was my mother Jessamine, and my father was none other than Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat."" So the boy went out from him sorrowful, and met Calamity Ahmad, who at sight of him exclaimed, ""Glory be to Him unto whom none is like!"" Asked Hasan the Pestilence, ""Whereat dost thou marvel, O my chief?"" and Ahmad the Calamity replied, ""At the make of yonder boy Aslan, for he is the likest of human creatures to Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat."" Then he called the lad and said to him, ""O Aslan what is thy mother's name?""; to which he replied, ""She is called the damsel Jessamine;"" and the other said, ""Harkye, Aslan, be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; for thy father was none other than Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat: but, O my son, go thou in to thy mother and question her of thy father."" He said, ""Hearkening and obedience,"" and, going in to his mother put the question; whereupon quoth she, ""Thy sire is the Emir Khálid!"" ""Not so,"" rejoined he, ""my father was none other than Ala al-Din Abu al Shamat."" At this the mother wept and said, ""Who acquainted thee with this, O my son?"" And he answered ""Ahmad al-Danaf, Captain of the Guard."" So she told him the whole story, saying, ""O my son, the True hath prevailed and the False hath failed:[FN#112] know that Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat was indeed thy sire, but it was none save the Emir Khálid who reared thee and adopted thee as his son. And now, O my child, when thou seest Ahmad al-Danaf the captain, do thou say to him, 'I conjure thee, by Allah, O my chief, take my blood-revenge on the murderer of my father Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat!'"" So he went out from his mother,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Aslan went out from his mother and, betaking himself to Calamity Ahmad, kissed his hand. Quoth the captain, ""What aileth thee, O Aslan?"" and quoth he, ""I know now for certain that my father was Ali al-Din Abu al-Shamat and I would have thee take my blood-revenge on his murderer."" He asked, ""And who was thy father's murderer?"" whereto Aslan answered, ""Ahmad Kamakim the arch-thief."" ""Who told thee this?"" enquired he, and Aslan rejoined, ""I saw in his hand the jewelled lanthorn which was lost with the rest of the Caliph's gear, and I said to him, 'Give me this lanthorn!' but he refused, saying, 'Lives have been lost on account of this'; and told me it was he who had broken into the palace and stolen the articles and deposited them in my father's house."" Then said Ahmad al-Danaf, ""When thou seest the Emir Khálid don his harness of war, say to him, 'Equip me like thyself and take me with thee.' Then do thou go forth and perform some feat of prowess before the Commander of the Faithful, and he will say to thee, 'Ask a boon of me, O Aslan!' And do thou make answer, 'I ask of thee this boon, that thou take my blood-revenge on my father's murderer.' If he say, 'Thy father is yet alive and is the Emir Khálid, the Chief of the Police'; answer thou, 'My father was Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, and the Emir Khálid hath a claim upon me only as the foster-father who adopted me.' Then tell him all that passed between thee and Ahmad Kamakim and say, 'O Prince of True Believers, order him to be searched and I will bring the lanthorn forth from his bosom.'"" Thereupon said Aslan to him, ""I hear and obey;"" and, returning to the Emir Khálid, found him making ready to repair to the Caliph's court and said to him, ""I would fain have thee arm and harness me like thyself and take me with thee to the Divan."" So he equipped him and carried him thither. Then the Caliph sallied forth of Baghdad with his troops and they pitched tents and pavilions without the city; whereupon the host divided into two parties and forming ranks fell to playing Polo, one striking the ball with the mall, and another striking it back to him. Now there was among the troops a spy, who had been hired to slay the Caliph; so he took the ball and smiting it with the bat drove it straight at the Caliph's face, when behold, Aslan fended it off and catching it drove it back at him who smote it, so that it struck him between the shoulders and he fell to the ground. The Caliph exclaimed, ""Allah bless thee, O Aslan!"" and they all dismounted and sat on chairs. Then the Caliph bade them bring the smiter of the ball before him and said, ""Who tempted thee to do this thing and art thou friend or foe?"" Quoth he, ""I am thy foe and it was my purpose to kill thee."" Asked the Caliph ""And wherefore? Art not a Moslem?"" Replied the spy; ""No' I am a Rejecter.''[FN#113] So the Caliph bade them put him to death and said to Aslan, ""Ask a boon of me."" Quoth he, ""I ask of thee this boon, that thou take my blood-revenge on my father's murderer."" He said, ""Thy father is alive and there he stands on his two feet."" ""And who is he?"" asked Aslan, and the Caliph answered, ""He is the Emir Khálid, Chief of Police."" Rejoined Aslan, ""O Commander of the Faithful, he is no father of mine, save by right of fosterage; my father was none other than Ala al-Din Abu al Shamat."" ""Then thy father was a traitor,"" cried the Caliph. ""Allah forbid, O Commander of the Faithful,"" rejoined Aslan, ""that the 'Trusty' should be a traitor! But how did he betray thee?"" Quoth the Caliph, ""He stole my habit and what was therewith."" Aslan retorted, ""O Commander of the Faithful, Allah forfend that my father should be a traitor! But, O my lord, when thy habit was lost and found didst thou likewise recover the lanthorn which was stolen from thee?"" Answered the Caliph, ""We never got it back,"" and Aslan said, ""I saw it in the hands of Ahmad Kamakim and begged it of him; but he refused to give it me, saying, 'Lives have been lost on account of this.' Then he told me of the sickness of Habzalam Bazazah, son of the Emir Khálid, by reason of his passion for the damsel Jessamine, and how he himself was released from bonds and that it was he who stole the habit and the lamp: so do thou, O Commander of the Faithful, take my blood-revenge for my father on him who murdered him."" At once the Caliph cried, ""Seize ye Ahmad Kamakim!"" and they seized him, whereupon he asked, ""Where be the Captain, Ahmad al-Danaf?"" And when he was summoned the Caliph bade him search Kamakim; so he put his hand into the thief's bosom and pulled out the lanthorn. Said the Caliph, ""Come hither, thou traitor: whence hadst thou this lanthorn?"" and Kamakim replied, ""I bought it, O Commander of the Faithful!"" The Caliph rejoined, ""Where didst thou buy it?"" Then they beat him till he owned that he had stolen the lanthorn, the habit and the rest, and the Caliph said ""What moved thee to do this thing O traitor, and ruin Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, the Trusty and Faithful?"" Then he bade them lay hands on him and on the Chief of Police, but the Chief said, ""O Commander of the Faithful, indeed I am unjustly treated thou badest me hang him, and I had no knowledge of this trick, for the plot was contrived between the old woman and Ahmad Kamakim and my wife. I crave thine intercession,[FN#114] O Aslan."" So Aslan interceded for him with the Caliph, who said, ""What hath Allah done with this youngster's mother?"" Answered Khálid, ""She is with me,"" and the Caliph continued, ""I command that thou order thy wife to dress her in her own clothes and ornaments and restore her to her former degree, a lady of rank; and do thou remove the seals from Ala al-Din's house and give his son possession of his estate."" ""I hear and obey,"" answered Khálid; and, going forth, gave the order to his wife who clad Jessamine in her own apparel; whilst he himself removed the seals from Ala al-Din's house and gave Aslan the keys. Then said the Caliph, ""Ask a boon of me, O Aslan;"" and he replied, ""I beg of thee the boon to unite me with my father."" Whereat the Caliph wept and said, ""Most like thy sire was he that was hanged and is dead; but by the life of my forefathers, whoso bringeth me the glad news that he is yet in the bondage of this life, I will give him all he seeketh!"" Then came forward Ahmad al-Danaf and, kissing the ground between his hands, said, ""Grant me indemnity, O Commander of the Faithful!"" ""Thou hast it,"" answered the Caliph; and Calamity Ahmad said, ""I give thee the good news that Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, the Trusty, the Faithful, is alive and well."" Quoth the Caliph ""What is this thou sayest?"" Quoth Al-Danaf, ""As thy head liveth I say sooth; for I ransomed him with another, of those who deserved death; and carried him to Alexandria, where I opened for him a shop and set him up as a dealer in second hand goods."" Then said the Prince of True Believers,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph ordered Calamity Ahmad, saying, ""I charge thee fetch him to me;"" and the other replied, ""To hear is to obey;"" whereupon the Caliph bade them give him ten thousand gold pieces and he fared forth for Alexandria. On this wise it happed with Aslan; but as regards his father, Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, he sold in course of time all that was in his shop excepting a few things and amongst them a long bag of leather. And happening to shake the bag there fell out a jewel which filled the palm of the hand, hanging to a chain of gold and having many facets but especially five, whereon were names and talismanic characters, as they were ant-tracks. So he rubbed each face; but none answered him[FN#115] and he said to himself, ""Doubtless it is a piece of variegated onyx;"" and then hung it up in the shop. And behold, a Consul[FN#116] passed along the street; and, raising his eyes, saw the jewel hanging up; so he seated himself over against the shop and said to Ala al-Din, ""O my lord, is the jewel for sale?"" He answered, ""All I have is for sale."" Thereupon the Frank said, ""Wilt thou sell me that same for eighty thousand dinars?"" ""Allah open!"" replied Ala al-Din. The Frank asked, ""Wilt thou sell it for an hundred thousand dinars?"", and he answered, ""I sell it to thee for a hundred thousand dinars; pay me down the monies."" Quoth the Consul, ""I cannot carry about such sum as its price, for there be robbers and sharpers in Alexandria; but come with me to my ship and I will pay thee the price and give thee to boot a bale of Angora wool, a bale of satin, a bale of velvet and a bale of broadcloth."" So Ala al-Din rose and locked up his shop, after giving the jewel to the Frank, and committed the keys to his neighbour, saying, ""Keep these keys in trust for me, whilst I go with this Consul to his ship and return with the price of my jewel. If I be long absent and there come to thee Ahmad al-Danaf, the Captain who stablished me in this shop, give him the keys and tell him where I am."" Then he went with the Consul to his ship and no sooner had he boarded it than the Prank set him a stool and, making him sit down, said to his men, ""Bring the money."" So they brought it and he paid him the price of the jewel and gave him the four bales he had promised him and one over; after which he said to him, ""O my lord, honour me by accepting a bite or a sup."" And Ala al-Din answered, ""If thou have any water, give me to drink."" So the Frank called for sherbets and they brought drink drugged with Bhang, of which no sooner had Ala al-Din drunk, than he fell over on his back; whereupon they stowed away the chairs and shipped the shoving-poles and made sail. Now the wind blew fair for them till it drove them into blue water, and when they were beyond sight of land the Kaptán[FN#117] bade bring Ala al-Din up out of the hold and made him smell the counter-drug of Bhang; whereupon he opened his eyes and said, ""Where am I?"" He replied, ""Thou art bound and in my power and if thou hadst said, Allah open! to an hundred thousand dinars for the jewel, I would have bidden thee more."" ""What art thou?"" asked Ala al-Din, and the other answered, ""I am a sea-captain and mean to carry thee to my sweetheart."" Now as they were talking, behold, a strip hove in sight carrying forty Moslem merchants; so the Frank captain attacked the vessel and made fast to it with grappling-irons; then he boarded it with his men and took it and plundered it; after which he sailed on with his prize, till he reached the city of Genoa. There the Kaptan, who was carrying off Ala al-Din, landed and repaired to a palace whose pastern gave upon the sea, and behold, there came down to him a damsel in a chin-veil who said, ""Hast thou brought the jewel and the owner?"" ""I have brought them both,"" answered he; and she said, ""Then give me the jewel."" So he gave it to her; and, returning to the port, fired his cannon to announce his safe return; whereupon the King of the city, being notified of that Kaptan's arrival, came down to receive him and asked him, ""How hath been this voyage?"" He answered, ""A right prosperous one, and while voyaging I have made prize of a ship with one-and-forty Moslem merchants."" Said the King, ""Land them at the port:"" so he landed the merchants in irons and Ala al-Din among the rest; and the King and the Kaptan mounted and made the captives walk before them till they reached the audience-chamber, when the Franks seated themselves and caused the prisoners to pass in parade order, one by one before the King who said to the first, ""O Moslem, whence comest thou?"" He answered, ""From Alexandria;"" whereupon the King said, ""O headsman, put him to death."" So the sworder smote him with the sword and cut off his head: and thus it fared with the second and the third, till forty were dead and there remained but Ala al-Din, who drank the cup of his comrades' sighs and agony and said to himself, ""Allah have mercy on thee, O Ala al-Din Thou art a dead man."" Then said the King to him, ""And thou, what countryman art thou?"" He answered, ""I am of Alexandria,"" and the King said, ""O headsman, strike off his head."" So the sworder raised arm and sword, and was about to strike when behold, an old woman of venerable aspect presented herself before the King, who rose to do her honour, and said to him, ""O King, did I not bid thee remember, when the Captain came back with captives, to keep one or two for the convent, to serve in the church?"" The King replied, ""O my mother, would thou hadst come a while earlier! But take this one that is left."" So she turned to Ala al-Din and said to him, ""Say, wilt thou serve in the church, or shall I let the King slay thee?"" Quoth he, ""I will serve in the church."" So she took him and carried him forth of the court and went to the church, where he said to her, ""What service must I do?"" She replied, ""Thou must rise with the dawn and take five mules and go with them to the forest and there cut dry fire-wood and saw it short and bring it to the convent-kitchen. Then must thou take up the carpets and sweep and wipe the stone and marble pavements and lay the carpets down again, as they were; after which thou must take two bushels and a half of wheat and bolt it and grind it and knead it and make it into cracknels[FN#118] for the convent; and thou must take also a bushel of lentils[FN#119] and sift and crush and cook them. Then must thou fetch water in barrels and fill the four fountains; after which thou must take three hundred and threescore and six wooden bowls and crumble the cracknels therein and pour of the lentil-pottage over each and carry every monk and patriarch his bowl."" Said Ala al-Din,[FN#120] ""Take me back to the King and let him kill me, it were easier to me than this service."" Replied the old woman, ""If thou do truly and rightly the service that is due from thee thou shalt escape death; but, if thou do it not, I will let the King kill thee."" And with these words Ala al-Din was left sitting heavy at heart. Now there were in the church ten blind cripples, and one of them said to him, ""Bring me a pot."" So he brought it him and he cacked and eased himself therein and said, ""Throw away the ordure."" He did so, and the blind man said, ""The Messiah's blessing be upon thee, O servant of the church!"" Presently behold, the old woman came in and said to him, ""Why hast thou not done thy service in the church?"" Answered he, ""How many hands have I, that I should suffice for all this work?"" She rejoined, 'Thou fool, I brought thee not hither except to work;"" and she added, ""Take, O my son, this rod (which was of copper capped with a cross) and go forth into the highway and, when thou meetest the governor of the city, say to him, 'I summon thee to the service of the church, in the name of our Lord the Messiah.' And he will not disobey thee. Then make him take the wheat, sift, grind, bolt, knead, and bake it into cracknels; and if any gainsay thee, beat him and fear none."" ""To hear is to obey,"" answered he and did as she said, and never ceased pressing great and small into his service; nor did he leave to do thus for the space of seventeen years. Now one day as he sat in church, lo! the old woman came to him and said, ""Go forth of the convent."" He asked, ""Whither shall I go?"" and she answered, ""Thou canst pass the night in a tavern or with one of thy comrades."" Quoth he, ""Why dost thou send me forth of the church?"" and quote she, ""The Princess Husn Maryam, daughter of Yohanná,[FN#121] King of this city, purposeth to visit the church and it befitteth not that any abide in her way."" So he made a show of obeying her orders and rose up and pretended that he was leaving the church; but he said in his mind, ""I wonder whether the Princess is like our women or fairer than they! At any rate I will not go till I have had a look at her."" So he hid himself in a closet with a window looking into the church and, as he watched, behold, in came the King's daughter. He cast at her one glance of eyes that cost him a thousand sighs, for he found her like the full moon when it cometh swimming out of the clouds; and he saw with her a young lady,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Ala al-Din looked at the King's daughter, he saw with her a young lady to whom he heard her say, ""Thy company hath cheered me, O Zubaydah."" So he looked straitly at the damsel and found her to be none other than his dead wife, Zubaydah the Lutist. Then the Princess said to Zubaydah, ""Come, play us an air on the lute."" But she answered, ""I will make no music for thee, till thou grant my wish and keep thy word to me."" Asked the Princess, ""And what did I promise thee?""; and Zubaydah answered, ""That thou wouldst reunite me with my husband Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, the Trusty, the Faithful."" Rejoined the Princess, ""O Zubaydah, be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; play us a piece as a thank-offering and an ear-feast for reunion with thy husband Ala al-Din."" ""Where is he?"" asked Zubaydah, and Maryam answered, ""He is in yonder closet listening to our words."" So Zubaydah played on the lute a melody which had made a rock dance for glee; and when Ala al-Din heard it, his bowels yearned towards her and he came forth from the closet and, throwing himself upon his wife Zubaydah, strained her to his bosom. She also knew him and the twain embraced and fell to the ground in a swoon. Then came forward the Princess Husn Maryam and sprinkled rose water on them, till they revived when she said to them, ""Allah hath reunited you."" Replied Ala al-Din, ""By thy kind of offices, O lady."" Then, turning to his wife, he said to her, ""O Zubaydah, thou didst surely die and we tombed thee in the tomb: how then returnedst thou to life and camest thou to this place?"" She answered, ""O my lord, I did not die; but an Aun[FN#122] of the Jinn snatched me up and dew with me hither. She whom thou buriedst was a Jinniyah, who shaped herself to my shape and feigned herself dead; but when you entombed her she broke open the tomb and came forth from it and returned to the service of this her mistress, the Princess Husn Maryam. As for me I was possessed[FN#123] and, when I opened my eyes, I found myself with this Princess thou seest; so I said to her, 'Why hast thou brought me hither?' Replied she, 'I am predestined to marry thy husband, Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat: wilt thou then, O Zubaydah, accept me to co-consort, a night for me and a night for thee?' Rejoined I, 'To hear is to obey, O my lady, but where is my husband?' Quoth she, 'Upon his forehead is written what Allah hath decreed to him; as soon as the writing which is there writ is fulfilled to him, there is no help for it but he come hither, and we will beguile the time of our separation from him with songs and playing upon instruments of music, till it please Allah to unite us with him.' So I abode all these days with her till Allah brought us together in this church."" Then Husn Maryam turned to him and said, ""O my lord, Ala al-Din, wilt thou be to me baron and I be to thee femme?"" Quoth he, ""O my lady, I am a Moslem and thou art a Nazarene; so how can I intermarry with thee?"" Quoth she, ""Allah forbid that I should be an infidel! Nay, I am a Moslemah; for these eighteen years I have held fast the Faith of Al-Islam and I am pure of any creed other than that of the Islamite."" Then said he, ""O my lady, I desire a return to my native land;"" and she replied, ""Know that I see written on thy forehead things which thou must needs accomplish, and then thou shalt win to thy will. Moreover, be fief and fain, O Ala al-Din, that there hath been born to thee a son named Aslan; who now being arrived at age of discretion, sitteth in thy place with the Caliph. Know also that Truth hath prevailed and that Falsehood naught availed; and that the Lord hath withdrawn the curtain of secrecy from him who stole the Caliph's goods, that is, Ahmad Kamakim the arch-thief and traitor; and he now lieth bound and in jail. And know further 'twas I who sent thee the jewel and had it put in the bag where thou foundest it, and 'twas I who sent the captain that brought thee and the jewel; for thou must know that the man is enamoured of me and seeketh my favours and would possess me; but I refused to yield to his wishes or let him have his will of me; and I said him, 'Thou shalt never have me till thou bring me the jewel and its owner.' So I gave him an hundred purses and despatched him to thee, in the habit of a merchant, whereas he is a captain and a war-man; and when they led thee to thy death after slaying the forty captives, I also sent thee this old woman to save thee from slaughter."" Said he, ""Allah requite thee for us with all good! Indeed thou hast done well."" Then Husn Maryam renewed at his hands her profession of Al-Islam; and, when he was assured of the truth of her speech, he said to her, O my lady, tell me what are the virtues of this jewel and whence cometh it?"" She answered, ""This jewel came from an enchanted hoard, and it hath five virtues which will profit us in time of need. Now my lady grandmother, the mother of my father, was an enchantress and skilled in solving secrets and finding hidden treasures from one of which came the jewel into her hands. And as I grew up and reached the age of fourteen, I read the Evangel and other books and I found the name of Mohammed (whom Allah bless and preserve!) in the four books, namely the Evangel, the Pentateuch, the Psalms and the Koran;[FN#124] so I believed in Mohammed and became a Moslemah, being certain and assured that none is worship worth save Allah Almighty, and that to the Lord of all mankind no faith is acceptable save that of Al-Islam. Now when my lady-grandmother fell sick, she gave me this jewel and taught me its five virtues. Moreover, before she died, my father said to her, 'Take thy tablets of geomancy and throw a figure, and tell us the issue of my affair and what will befal-me.' And she foretold him that the far off one[FN#125] should die, slain by the hand of a captive from Alexandria. So he swore to kill every prisoner from that place and told the Kaptan of this, saying, 'There is no help for it but thou fall on the ships of the Moslems and seize them and whomsoever thou findest of Alexandria, kill him or bring him to me.' The Captain did his bidding until he had slain as many in number as the hairs of his head. Then my grandmother died and I took a geomantic tablet, being minded and determined to know the future, and I said to myself, 'Let me see who will wed me!' Whereupon I threw a figure and found that none should be my husband save one called Ala al-Din Abu al-Shamat, the Trusty, the Faithful. At this I marvelled and waited till the times were accomplished and I foregathered with thee."" So Ala al-Din took her to wife and said to her, ""I desire to return to my own country."" Quoth she, ""If it be so, rise up and come with me."" Then she took him and, hiding him in a closet of her palace, went in to her father, who said to her, ""O my daughter, my heart is exceeding heavy this day; sit down and let us make merry with wine, I and thou."" So she sat down with him and he called for a table of wine; and she plied him till he lost his wits, when she drugged a cup with Bhang and he drank it off and fell upon his back. Then she brought Ala al-Din out of the closet and said to him, ""Come; verily thine enemy lieth prostrate, for I made him drunk and drugged him; so do thou with him as thou wilt."" Accordingly Ala al-Din went to the King and, finding him lying drugged and helpless, pinioned him fast and manacled and fettered him with chains. Then he gave him the counter-drug and he came to himself,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ala al-Din gave the antidote of Bhang to King Yohanna, father of Husn Maryam, and he came to himself and found Ala al-Din and his daughter sitting on his breast. So he said to her, ""O my daughter, dost thou deal thus with me?"" She answered ""If I be indeed thy daughter, become a Moslem, even as I became a Moslemah, for the truth was shown to me and I attested it; and the false, and I deserted it. I have submitted myself unto Allah, The Lord of the Three Worlds, and am pure of all faiths contrary to that of Al-Islam in this world and in the next world. Wherefore, if thou wilt become a Moslem, well and good; if not, thy death were better than thy life."" Ala al-Din also exhorted him to embrace the True Faith; but he refused and was contumacious; so Ala al-Din drew a dagger and cut his throat from ear to ear.[FN#126] Then he wrote a scroll, setting forth what had happened and laid it on the brow of the dead, after which they took what was light of load and weighty of worth and turned from the palace and returned to the church. Here the Princess drew forth the jewel and, placing her hand upon the facet where was figured a couch, rubbed it; and behold, a couch appeared before her and she mounted upon it with Ala al-Din and his wife Zubaydah, the lutist, saying, ""I conjure thee by the virtue of the names and talismans and characts engraver on this jewel, rise up with us, O Couch!"" And it rose with them into the air and flew, till it came to a Wady wholly bare of growth, when the Princess turned earthwards the facet on which the couch was figured, and it sank with them to the ground. Then she turned up the face where on was fashioned a pavilion and tapping it said, ""Let a pavilion be pitched in this valley;"" and there appeared a pavilion, wherein they seated themselves. Now this Wady was a desert waste, without grass or water; so she turned a third face of the jewel towards the sky, and said, ""By the virtue of the names of Allah, let trees upgrow here and a river flow beside them!"" And forthwith trees sprang up and by their side ran a river plashing and dashing. They made the ablution and prayed and drank of the stream; after which the Princess turned up the three other facets till she came to the fourth, whereon was portrayed a table of good, and said, ""By the virtue of the names of Allah, let the table be spread!"" And behold, there appeared before them a table, spread with all manner of rich meats, and they ate and drank and made merry and were full of joy. Such was their case; but as regards Husn Maryam's father, his son went in to waken him and found him slain; and, seeing Ala al-Din's scroll, took it and read it, and readily understood it. Then he sought his sister and finding her not, betook himself to the old woman in the church, of whom he enquired for her, but she said, ""Since yesterday I have not seen her."" So he returned to the troops and cried out, saying, ""To horse, ye horsemen!"" Then he told them what had happened, so they mounted and rode after the fugitives, till they drew near the pavilion. Presently Husn Maryam arose and looked up and saw a cloud of dust which spread till it walled the view, then it lifted and flew, and lo! stood disclosed her brother and his troops, crying aloud, ""Whither will ye fly, and we on your track!"" Then said she to Ala al-Din, ""Are thy feet firm in fight?"" He replied, ""Even as the stake in bran, I know not war nor battle, nor swords nor spears."" So she pulled out the jewel and rubbed the fifth face, that on which were graven a horse and his rider, and behold, straightway a cavalier appeared out of the desert and ceased not to do battle with the pursuing host and smite them with the sword, till he routed them and put them to flight. Then the Princess asked Ala al-Din, ""Wilt thou go to Cairo or to Alexandria?""; and he answered, ""To Alexandria."" So they mounted the couch and she pronounced over it the conjuration, whereupon it set off with them and, in the twinkling of an eye, brought them to Alexandria. They alighted without the city and Ala al-Din hid the women in a cavern, whilst he went into Alexandria and fetched them outer clothing, wherewith he covered them. Then he carried them to his shop and, leaving them in the ""ben""[FN#127] walked forth to fetch them the morning-meal, and behold he met Calamity Ahmad who chanced to be coming from Baghdad. He saw him in the street and received him with open arms, saluting him and welcoming him. Whereupon Ahmad al-Danaf gave him the good news of his son Aslan and how he was now come to the age of twenty: and Ala al-Din, in his turn, told the Captain of the Guard all that had befallen him from first to last, whereat he marvelled with exceeding marvel. Then he brought him to his shop and sitting room where they passed the night; and next day he sold his place of business and laid its price with other monies. Now Ahmad al-Danaf had told him that the Caliph sought him; but he said, ""I am bound first for Cairo, to salute my father and mother and the people of my house."" So they all mounted the couch and it carried them to Cairo the God-guarded; and here they alighted in the street called Yellow,[FN#128] where stood the house of Shams al-Din. Then Ala al-Din knocked at the door, and his mother said, ""Who is at the door, now that we have lost our beloved for evermore?"" He replied, "" 'Tis I! Ala al-Din!"" whereupon they came down and embraced him. Then he sent his wives and baggage into the house and entering himself with Ahmad al-Danaf, rested there three days, after which he was minded to set out for Baghdad. His father said, ""Abide with me, O my son;"" but he answered; ""I cannot bear to be parted from my child Aslan."" So he took his father and mother and fared forth for Baghdad. Now when they came thither, Ahmad al-Danaf went in to the Caliph and gave him the glad tidings of Ala al-Din's arrival—and told him his story whereupon the King went forth to greet him taking the youth Aslan, and they met and embraced each other. Then the Commander of the Faithful summoned the arch-thief Ahmad Kamakim and said to Ala al-Din, ""Up and at thy foe!"" So he drew his sword and smote off Ahmad Kamakim's head. Then the Caliph held festival for Ala al-Din and, summoning the Kazis and witnesses, wrote the contract and married him to the Princess Husn Maryam; and he went in unto her and found her an unpierced pearl. Moreover, the Caliph made Aslan Chief of the Sixty and bestowed upon him and his father sumptuous dresses of honour; and they abode in the enjoyment of all joys and joyance of life, till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies. But the tales of generous men are manifold and amongst them is the story of

[FN#27] Arab. ""Dukhúl,"" the night of going in, of seeing the bride unveiled for the first time, etcaetera.

[FN#28] Arab. ""Barsh"" or ""Bars,"" the commonest kind. In India it is called Ma'jún (=electuary, generally): it is made of Ganja or young leaves, buds, capsules and florets of hemp (C. saliva), poppy-seed and flowers of the thorn-apple (daiura) with milk and auger-candy, nutmegs, cloves, mace and saffron, all boiled to the consistency of treacle which hardens when cold. Several-recipes are given by Herklots (Glossary s.v. Majoon). These electuaries are usually prepared with ""Charas,"" or gum of hemp, collected by hand or by passing a blanket over the plant in early morning, and it is highly intoxicating. Another intoxicant is ""Sabzi,"" dried hemp-leaves, poppy-seed, cucumber heed, black pepper and cardamoms rubbed down in a mortar with a wooden pestle, and made drinkable by adding milk, ice-cream, etc. The Hashish of Arabia is the Hindustani Bhang, usually drunk and made as follows. Take of hemp-leaves, well washed, 3 drams black pepper 45 grains and of cloves, nutmeg and mace (which add to the intoxication) each 12 grains. Triturate in 8 ounces of water or the juice of watermelon or cucumber, strain and drink. The Egyptian Zabíbah is a preparation of hemp florets, opium and honey, much affected by the lower orders, whence the proverb: ""Temper thy sorrow with Zabibah. In Al-Hijaz it is mixed with raisins (Zabíb) and smoked in the water-pipe. (Burck hardt No. 73.) Besides these there is (1) ""Post"" poppy-seed prepared in various ways but especially in sugared sherbets; (2) Datura (stramonium) seed, the produce of the thorn-apple breached and put into sweetmeats by dishonest confectioners; it is a dangerous intoxicant, producing spectral-visions, delirium tremens, etc., and (3) various preparations of opium especially the ""Madad,"" pills made up with toasted betel-leaf and smoked. Opium, however, is usually drunk in the shape of ""Kusumba,"" a pill placed in wet cotton and squeezed in order to strain and clean it of the cowdung and other filth with which it is adulterated.

[FN#29] Arab. ""Sikankúr"" (Gr. {Greek letters}, Lat. Scincus) a lizard (S. officinalis) which, held in the hand, still acts as an aphrodisiac in the East, and which in the Middle Ages was considered a universal-medicine. In the ""Adja'ib al-Hind"" (Les Merveilles de l'Inde) we find a notice of a bald-headed old man who was compelled to know his wife twice a day and twice a night in consequence of having eaten a certain fish. (Chaps. Ixxviii. of the translation by M. L. Marcel Devic, from a manuscript of the tenth century, Paris Lemaire, 1878.) Europeans deride these prescriptions, but Easterns know better: they affect the fancy, that is the brain, and often succeed in temporarily relieving impotence. The recipes for this evil, which is incurable only when it comes from heart-affections, are innumerable in the East; and about half of every medical-work is devoted to them. Many a quack has made his fortune with a few bottles of tincture of cantharides, and a man who could discover a specific would become a millionaire in India only. The curious reader will consult for specimens the Ananga-Ranga Shastra by Koka Pandit; or the ""Rujú 'al-Shaykh ila 'l-Sabáh fi Kuwwati 'l-Báh"" (the Return of the Old Man to Youth in power of Procreation) by Ahmad bin Sulaymán known as Ibn Kamál-Báshá, in 139 chapters lithographed at Cairo. Of these aphrodisiacs I shall have more to say.

[FN#30] Alá al-Din (our old friend Aladdin) = Glory of the Faith, a name of which Mohammed who preferred the simplest, like his own, would have highly disapproved. The most grateful names to Allah are Abdallah (Allah's Slave) and Abd al-Rahman (Slave of the Compassionate); the truest are Al-Hárith (the gainer, ""bread winner"") and Al-Hammám (the griever); and the hatefullest are Al-Harb (witch) and Al-Murrah (bitterness, Abu Murrah being a kunyat or by-name of the Devil). Abu al-Shámát (pronounced Abushshámát)=Father of Moles, concerning which I have already given details. These names ending in -Din (faith) began with the Caliph Al-Muktadi bi-Amri 'llah (regn. A.H. 467= 1075), who entitled his Wazir ""Zahír al-Din (Backer or Defender of the Faith) and this gave rise to the practice. It may be observed that the superstition of naming by omens is in no way obsolete.

The Fátihah, which is to Al-Islam much what the ""Paternoster"" is to Christendom, consists of seven verses, in the usual-Saj'a or rhymed prose, and I have rendered it as follows:

In the name of the Compassionating, the Compassionate! * Praise be to Allah who all the Worlds made * The Compassionating, the Compassionate * King of the Day of Faith! * Thee only do we adore and of Thee only do we crave aid * Guide us to the path which is straight * The path of those for whom Thy love is great, not those on whom is hate, nor they that deviate * Amen! O Lord of the World's trine.

[FN#47] Arab. ""Ráfizí""=the Shi'ah (tribe, sect) or Persian schismatics who curse the first three Caliphs: the name is taken from their own saying ""Inná rafizná-hum""=verily we have rejected them. The feeling between Sunni (the so-called orthodox) and Shi'ah is much like the Christian love between a Catholic of Cork and a Protestant from the Black North. As Al-Siyuti or any historian will show, this sect became exceedingly powerful under the later Abbaside Caliphs, many of whom conformed to it and adopted its tractices and innovations (as in the Azan or prayer-call), greatly to the scandal-of their co-religionists. Even in the present day the hatred between these representatives of Arab monotheism and Persian Guebrism continues unabated. I have given sundry instances m my Pilgrimage, e.g. how the Persians attempt to pollute the tombs of the Caliphs they abhor.

[FN#48] Arab. ""Sakká,"" the Indian ""Bihishtí"" (man from Heaven):

She was married to a son of the Imam Ja'afar al-Sadik and lived a life of devotion in Cairo, dying in A.H. 218=824. The corpse of the Imam al-Shafi'i was carried to her house, now her mosque and mausoleum: it stood in the Darb al-Sabúa which formerly divided Old from New Cairo and is now one of the latter's suburbs. Lane (M. E. chaps. x.) gives her name but little more. The mention of her shows that the writer of the tale or the copyist was a Cairene : Abd al-Kadir is world-known : not so the ""Sitt.""

[FN#54] Arab. ""Mustahall,"" ""Mustahill' and vulg. ""Muhallil"" (=one who renders lawful). It means a man hired for the purpose who marries pro forma and after wedding, and bedding with actual-consummation, at once divorces the woman. He is held the reverse of respectable and no wonder. Hence, probably, Mandeville's story of the Islanders who, on the marriage-night, ""make another man to lie by their wives, to have their maidenhead, for which they give great hire and much thanks. And there are certain men in every town that serve for no other thing; and they call them cadeberiz, that is to say, the fools of despair, because they believe their occupation is a dangerous one."" Burckhardt gives the proverb (No. 79), ""A thousand lovers rather than one Mustahall,"" the latter being generally some ugly fellow picked up in the streets and disgusting to the wife who must permit his embraces.

[FN#55] This is a woman's oath. not used by men.

[FN#57] Arab. ""Ál-Dáúd""=the family of David, i.e. David himself, a popular idiom. The prophet's recitation of the ""Mazámir"" (Psalter) worked miracles.

[FN#58] There is a peculiar thickening of the voice in leprosy which at once betrays the hideous disease.


[FN#59] These lines have occurred in Night clxxxiii. I quote

[FN#61] Arab. ""Zakariyá"" (Zacharias): a play upon the term ""Zakar""=the sign of ""masculinity."" Zacharias, mentioned in the Koran as the educator of the Virgin Mary (chaps. iii.) and repeatedly referred to (chaps. xix. etc.), is a well-known personage amongst Moslems and his church is now the great Cathedral-Mosque of Aleppo.

[FN#62] Arab. "" Ark al-Haláwat "" = vein of sweetness.

[FN#63] Arab. ""Futúh,"" which may also mean openings, has before occurred.

[FN#64] i.e. four times without withdrawing.

[FN#65] i.e. a correspondence of size, concerning which many rules are given in the Ananga-Rangha Shastra which justly declares that discrepancy breeds matrimonial-troubles.

[FN#66] Arab. ""Ghuráb al-Bayn""= raven of the waste or the parting: hence the bird of Odin symbolises separation (which is also called Al-bayn). The Raven (Ghurab = Heb. Oreb and Lat. Corvus, one of the prehistoric words) is supposed to be seen abroad earlier than any other bird; and it is entitled ""Abu Zajir,"" father of omens, because lucky when flying towards the right and v.v. It is opposed in poetry to the (white) pigeon, the emblem of union, peace and happiness. The vulgar declare that when Mohammed hid in the cave the crow kept calling to his pursuers, ""Ghár! Ghár!"" (cavern, cavern): hence the Prophet condemned him to wear eternal-mourning and ever to repeat the traitorous words. This is the old tale of Coronis and Apollo (Ovid, lib. ii.).

—————"" who blacked the raven o'er And bid him prate in his white plumes no more.""

[FN#67] This use of a Turkish title ""Efendi"" being=our esquire, and inferior to a Bey, is a rank anachronism, probably of the copyist.

[FN#68] Arab. ""Samn""=Hind. ""Ghi"" butter melted, skimmed and allowed to cool.

[FN#69] Arab. ""Ya Wadúd,"" a title of the Almighty: the Mac.
Edit. has ""O David!""

[FN#70] Arab. ""Muwashshahah;"" a complicated stanza of which specimens have occurred. Mr. Payne calls it a ""ballad,"" which would be a ""Kunyat al-Zidd.""

[FN#71] Arab. ""Baháim"" (plur. of Bahímah=Heb. Behemoth), applied in Egypt especially to cattle. A friend of the ""Oppenheim"" house, a name the Arabs cannot pronounce was known throughout Cairo as ""Jack al-baháim"" (of the cows).

[FN#72] Lit. ""The father of side-locks,"" a nickname of one of the Tobba Kings. This ""Hasan of: the ringlets"" who wore two long pig-tails hanging to his shoulders was the Rochester or Piron of his age: his name is still famous for brilliant wit, extempore verse and the wildest debauchery. D'Herbelot's sketch of his life is very meagre. His poetry has survived to the present day and (unhappily) we shall] hear more of ""Abu Nowás."" On the subject of these patronymics Lane (Mod. Egypt, chaps. iv.) has a strange remark that ""Abu Dáúd i' not the Father of Dáúd or Abu Ali the Father of Ali, but whose Father is (or was) Dáúd or Ali."" Here, however, he simply confounds Abu = father of (followed by a genitive), with Abu-h (for Abu-hu) = he, whose father.

[FN#73] Arab. ""Samúr,"" applied in slang language to cats and dogs, hence the witty Egyptians converted Admiral-Seymour (Lord Alcester) into ""Samúr.""

[FN#74] The home-student of Arabic may take this letter as a model even in the present day; somewhat stiff and old-fashioned, but gentlemanly and courteous.

[FN#75] Arab. ""Salím"" (not Sé-lim) meaning the ""Safe and sound.""

[FN#76] Arab. ""Haláwah""=sweetmeat, meaning an entertainment such as men give to their friends after sickness or a journey. it is technically called as above, ""The Sweetmeat of Safety.""

[FN#77] Arab. ""Salát"" which from Allah means mercy, from the
Angels intercession and pardon; and from mankind blessing.
Concerning the specific effects of blessing the Prophet, see
Pilgrimage (ii. 70). The formula is often slurred over when a man
is in a hurry to speak: an interrupting friend will say "" Bless the
Prophet!"" and he does so by ejaculating ""Sa'am.""

[FN#78] Persian, meaning originally a command: it is now applied to a Wazirial-order as opposed to the "" Irádah,"" the Sultan's order.

[FN#79] Arab. "" Mashá'ilí"" lit. the cresses-bearer who has before appeared as hangman.

[FN#80] Another polite formula for announcing a death.

[FN#81] As he died heirless the property lapsed to the Treasury.

[FN#82]This shaking the kerchief is a signal to disperse and the action suggests its meaning. Thus it is used in an opposite sense to ""throwing the kerchief,"" a pseudo-Oriental practice whose significance is generally understood in Europe.

[FN#83] The body-guard being of two divisions.
[FN#84] Arab. ""Hadbá,"" lit. ""hump-backed;"" alluding to the Badawi bier; a pole to which the corpse is slung (Lane). It seems to denote the protuberance of the corpse when placed upon the bier which before was flat. The quotation is from Ka'ab's Mantle-Poem (Burdah v . 37), ""Every son of a female, long though his safety may be, is a day borne upon a ridged implement,"" says Mr. Redhouse, explaining the latter as a ""bier with a ridged lid."" Here we differ: the Janázah with a lid is not a Badawi article: the wildlings use the simplest stretcher; and I would translate the lines,

""The son of woman, whatso his career
One day is borne upon the gibbous bier.""

[FN#85] This is a high honour to any courtier.

[FN#86] ""Khatun"" in Turk. means any lady: mistress, etc., and follows the name, e.g. Fátimah Khatun. Habzalam Bazazah is supposed to be a fanciful compound, uncouth as the named; the first word consisting of ""Habb"" seed, grain; and ""Zalam"" of Zulm=seed of tyranny. Can it be a travesty of ""Absalom"" (Ab Salám, father of peace)? Lane (ii. 284) and Payne (iii. 286) prefer Habazlam and Hebezlem.

[FN#87] Or night. A metaphor for rushing into peril.

[FN#88] Plur. of kumkum, cucurbite, gourd-shaped vessel, jar.

[FN#89] A popular exaggeration for a very expert thief.

[FN#90] Arab. ""Buka'at Ad-bum"": lit. the ""low place of blood"" (where it stagnates): so Al-Buká'ah = Clesyria.

[FN#91] That common and very unpleasant phrase, full of egotism and self-esteem, ""I told you so,"" is even more common in the naïve East than in the West. In this case the son's answer is far superior to the mother's question.

[FN#92] In order to keep his oath to the letter.

[FN#93] ""Tabannuj; "" literally ""hemping"" (drugging with hemp or henbane) is the equivalent in Arab medicine of our ""anæsthetics."" These have been used in surgery throughout the East for centuries before ether and chloroform became the fashion in the civilised West.

[FN#94] Arab. ""Durká'ah,"" the lower part of the floor, opposed to the ""liwán"" or daïs. Liwán =Al-Aywán (Arab. and Pers.) the hall (including the daïs and the sunken parts)

[FN#95] i.e. he would toast it as he would a mistress.

[FN#96] This till very late years was the custom in Persia, and Fath Ali Shah never appeared in scarlet without ordering some horrible cruelties. In Dar-For wearing a red cashmere turban was a sign of wrath and sending a blood red dress to a subject meant that he would be slain.
[FN#97] That is, this robbery was committed in the palace by some one belonging to it. References to vinegar are frequent; that of Egypt being famous in those days. ""Optimum et laudatissimum acetum a Romanis habebatur Ægyptum"" (Facciolati); and possibly it was sweetened: the Gesta (Tale xvii.) mentions ""must and vinegar."" In Arab Proverbs, One mind by vinegar and another by wine""=each mind goes its own way, (Arab. Prov. . 628); or, ""with good and bad,"" vinegar being spoilt wine.

[FN#98] We have not heard the last of this old ""dowsing rod"": the latest form of rhabdomancy is an electrical-rod invented in the United States.

[FN#99] This is the procès verbal always drawn up on such occasions.

[FN#100] The sight of running water makes a Persian long for strong drink as the sight of a fine view makes the Turk feel hungry.

[FN#101] Arab. ""Min wahid aduww "" a peculiarly Egyptian or rather
Cairene phrase.

[FN#102] Al-Danaf=the Distressing Sickness: the title would be Ahmad the Calamity. Al-Zaybak (the Quicksilver)=Mercury Ali Hasan ""Shuuman""=a pestilent fellow. We shall meet all these worthies again and again: see the Adventures of Mercury Ali of Cairo, Night dccviii., a sequel to The Rogueries of Dalilah, Night dcxcviii.

[FN#103] For the ""Sacrifice-place of Ishmael"" (not Isaac) see my Pilgrimage (iii. 306). According to all Arab ideas Ishmael, being the eldest son, was the chief of the family after his father. I have noted that this is the old old quarrel between the Arabs and their cousins the Hebrews.

[FN#104] This black-mail was still paid to the Badawin of Ramlah
(Alexandria) till the bombardment in 1881.

[FN#105] The famous Issus of Cilicia, now a port-village on the
Gulf of Scanderoon.

[FN#106] Arab. "" Wada'á"" = the concha veneris, then used as small change.

[FN#107] Arab. ""Sakati""=a dealer in ""castaway"" articles, such es old metal,damaged goods, the pluck and feet of animals, etc.

[FN#108] The popular tale of Burckhardt's death in Cairo was that the names of the three first Caliphs were found written upon his slipper-soles and that he was put to death by decree of the Olema. It is the merest nonsense, as the great traveller died of dysentery in the house of my old friend John Thurburn and was buried outside the Bab al-Nasr of Cairo where his tomb was restored by the late Rogers Bey (Pilgrimage i. 123).

[FN#109] Prob. a mis-spelling for Arslán, in Turk. a lion, and in slang a piastre.

[FN#110] Arab. ""Maka'ad;"" lit. = sitting-room.

[FN#111] Arab. ""Khammárah""; still the popular term throughout Egypt for a European Hotel. It is not always intended to be insulting but it is, meaning the place where Franks meet to drink forbidden drinks.

[FN#112] A reminiscence of Mohammed who cleansed the Ka'abah of its 360 idols (of which 73 names are given by Freytag, Einleitung, etc. pp. 270, 342-57) by touching them with his staff, whereupon all fell to the ground; and the Prophet cried (Koran xvii. 84), ""Truth is come, and falsehood is vanished: verily, falsehood is a thing that vanisheth"" (magna est veritas, etc.). Amongst the ""idols"" are said to have been a statue of Abraham and the horns of the ram sacrificed in lieu of Ishmael, which (if true) would prove conclusively that the Abrahamic legend at Meccah is of ancient date and not a fiction of Al-Islam. Hence, possibly, the respect of the Judaising Tobbas of Hiwyarland for the Ka'abah. (Pilgrimage, iii. 295.)

[FN#113] This was evidently written by a Sunni as the Shí'ahs claim to be the only true Moslems. Lane tells an opposite story (ii. 329). It suggests the common question in the South of Europe, ""Are you a Christian or a Protestant?""

[FN#114] Arab. ""Ana fí jírat-ak!"" a phrase to be remembered as useful in time of danger.

[FN#115] i.e. No Jinni, or Slave of the Jewel, was there to answer.

[FN#116] Arab. ""Kunsúl"" (pron. ""Gunsul"") which here means a well-to-do Frank, and shows the modern date of the tale as it stands.

[FN#117] From the Ital. ""Capitano."" The mention of cannon and other terms in this tale shows that either it was written during the last century or it has been mishandled by copyists.

[FN#118] Arab. ""Minínah""; a biscuit of flour and clarified butter.

[FN#119] Arab. ""Waybah""; the sixth part of the Ardabb=6 to 7
English gallons.

[FN#120] He speaks in half-jest à la fellah; and reminds us of
""Hangman, drive on the cart!""

[FN#121] Yochanan (whom Jehovah has blessed) Jewish for John, is probably a copy of the Chaldean Euahanes, the Oannes of Berosus=Ea Khan, Hea the fish. The Greeks made it Joannes; the Arabs ""Yohanná"" (contracted to ""Hanná,"" Christian) and ""Yábyá"" (Moslem). Prester (Priest) John is probably Ung Khan, the historian prince conquered and slain by Janghiz Khan in A.D. 1202. The modern history of ""John"" is very extensive: there may be a full hundred varieties and derivation' of the name. ""Husn Maryam"" the beauty (spiritual. etc.) of the B.V.

[FN#122] Primarily being middle-aged; then aid, a patron, servant, etc. Also a tribe of the Jinn usually made synonymous with ""Márid,"" evil controuls, hostile to men: modern spiritualists would regard them as polluted souls not yet purged of their malignity. The text insinuates that they were at home amongst Christians and in Genoa.

[FN#123] Arab. ""Sar'a"" = epilepsy, falling sickness, of old always confounded with ""possession"" (by evil spirits) or ""obsession.""

[FN#124] Again the true old charge of falsifying the so-called ""Sacred books."" Here the Koran is called ""Furkán."" Sale (sect. iii.) would assimilate this to the Hebr. ""Perek"" or ""Pirka,"" denoting a section or portion of Scripture; but Moslems understand it to be the ""Book which distinguisheth (faraka, divided) the true from the false."" Thus Caliph Omar was entitled ""Fárúk"" = the Distinguisher (between right and wrong). Lastly, ""Furkán,"" meanings as in Syr. and Ethiop. deliverance, revelation, is applied alike to the Pentateuch and Koran.

[FN#125] Euphemistic for ""thou shalt die.""

[FN#126] Lit. ""From (jugular) vein to vein"" (Arab. ""Waríd""). Our old friend Lucretius again: ""Tantane relligio,"" etc.

[FN#127] As opposed to the ""but"" or outer room.

[FN#128] Arab. ""Darb al-Asfar"" in the old Jamalíyah or Northern part of Cairo.

[FN#129] A noble tribe of Badawin that migrated from Al-Yaman and settled in Al-Najd Their Chief, who died a few years before Mohammed's birth, was Al-Hatim (the ""black crow""), a model of Arab manliness and munificence; and although born in the Ignorance he will enter Heaven with the Moslems. Hatim was buried on the hill called Owárid: I have already noted this favourite practice of the wilder Arabs and the affecting idea that the Dead may still look upon his kith and kin. There is not an Arab book nor, indeed, a book upon Arabia which does not contain the name of Hatim: he is mentioned as unpleasantly often as Aristides.",[],0,Richard F.

Band
Uh, I don't know it's... It's just a thing with me you know
If I see somethin' that I like, it's a... I have to go for it
And I like what I see, baby
Ah, come here

[Verse 1]
I got real bored on a friday night, I couldn't find a damn thing to do
So I pulled out a suit about the same color as my BMW
I drove to the party and I stepped on in, just to see what I could see
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for
I was lookin' for some company, that's right!

[Chorus]
Jerk out
Jerkin' everything in sight
And you know that I'm talkin' about the...
Jerk out
(I got the cash, I got the ride, Oh Lawd)
Got to make some love tonight
And you know I got the look

[Verse 2]
I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar
She looked kinda all alone
So I slid on over and I asked her name
The Stella was bad to the bone
I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek
The only kind of rap it takes
She knew I was bad when I jerked her to my ride
She said, ""How much money you make?""
Let's just say it'll be more money...

[Chorus]
Jerk out
(...Than you'll ever see in your lifetime, ha ha!)
Jerkin' everything in sight
I'm talkin' about the...

Jerk it, jerk it
Jerk out
Jerk it, jerk it
I'm talkin' about the
Jerk it, jerk it
Jerk out

[Verse 3]
I took her to my crib and I laid her down
Her body felt kinda right
Maybe I was wrong but what the hell, I figured that was what she liked
I said ""Baby, don't get too comfortable, 'cause I really like to sleep alone
Leave your number on the table by my data bank. I love you, but you got to go""
(What?)

[Chorus]
Jerk out
(You ain't got to go home, but you got to get the hell outta here)
Jerkin' everything in sight

Jerk it, jerk it
Jerk out
Jerk it, jerk it
I'm talkin' about the
Jerk it, jerk it
Jerk out

[Chorus]
Jerk out
Jerkin' everything in sight
( You look so satisfied)
I'm talkin' about the...
Jerk out
( Ha ha ha ha! That's it)
Got to make some love tonight
Jerk Out

Jerk out

Got to make some love tonight?

[Jackie Harris]
I've got the power

[Verse 1 - Turbo B]
Like the crack of the whip, I Snap attack
Front to back, in this thing called rap
Dig it like a shovel, rhyme devil on a heavenly level
Bang the bass, turn up the treble
Radical mind, day and night all the time
7:14, wise, divine
Maniac brainiac, winnin' the game
I'm the lyrical Jesse James

[Verse 2 - Turbo B]
Quality I possess and say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the microphone that I am holding
Copy written lyrics so they can't be stolen
If they all Snap, don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice will cease
So peace, stay off my back
Or I will attack, and you don't want that

174,174,Across The River,"Well, she moved back around here
Thirty-five weeks ago today
Oh, down the lane

Well, at night she walks on the banks
And remembers how she dreamed of rowing away
And how she left one day

She left with a driven look in her eyes
Came back around with it still inside
They said give it some time
And you'll forget about it too
We know they always do

Well, I know some fine day
You will find your way
Across the river, across the river
Row down slow
There's a long way to go
Across the river, across the river

She was proud and so strong
But she tried not to listen to idle talk
Downtown where she walked

Well, they sit around and they say
That she came back with her tail between her legs
Like they always said she would

Well, I hear it's better on the other side
They say you'll never do it so don't even try
Well, you may be beaten down with your closed mind
But don't try to make it mine

Well, I know some fine day
You will find your way
Across the river, across the river
Row down slow
There's a long way to go
Across the river, across the river

""Your wild days are through""
Is what they said
I dreamed she came, and I went down
And I walked where she led

Standing on the shore
She looks to the west with a look of longing
To where the grass seems greener
Well, there's a hard and distant prize
It probably won't happen but I think I'll try
Well, even if it doesn't happen for me
It still beats hanging around here

Well, I know some fine day
You will find your way
Across the river, across the river
Row down slow
There's a long, long way to go
Across the river, across the river","['well', 'she', 'move', 'back', 'around', 'here', 'thirtyfive', 'weeks', 'ago', 'today', 'oh', 'down', 'the', 'lane', 'well', 'at', 'night', 'she', 'walk', 'on', 'the', 'bank', 'and', 'remember', 'how', 'she', 'dream', 'of', 'row', 'away', 'and', 'how', 'she', 'leave', 'one', 'day', 'she', 'leave', 'with', 'a', 'drive', 'look', 'in', 'her', 'eye', 'come', 'back', 'around', 'with', 'it', 'still', 'inside', 'they', 'say', 'give', 'it', 'some', 'time', 'and', 'youll', 'forget', 'about', 'it', 'too', 'we', 'know', 'they', 'always', 'do', 'well', 'i', 'know', 'some', 'fine', 'day', 'you', 'will', 'find', 'your', 'way', 'across', 'the', 'river', 'across', 'the', 'river', 'row', 'down', 'slow', 'theres', 'a', 'long', 'way', 'to', 'go', 'across', 'the', 'river', 'across', 'the', 'river', 'she', 'be', 'proud', 'and', 'so', 'strong', 'but', 'she', 'try', 'not', 'to', 'listen', 'to', 'idle', 'talk', 'downtown', 'where', 'she', 'walk', 'well', 'they', 'sit', 'around', 'and', 'they', 'say', 'that', 'she', 'come', 'back', 'with', 'her', 'tail', 'between', 'her', 'legs', 'like', 'they', 'always', 'say', 'she', 'would', 'well', 'i', 'hear', 'its', 'better', 'on', 'the', 'other', 'side', 'they', 'say', 'youll', 'never', 'do', 'it', 'so', 'dont', 'even', 'try', 'well', 'you', 'may', 'be', 'beat', 'down', 'with', 'your', 'close', 'mind', 'but', 'dont', 'try', 'to', 'make', 'it', 'mine', 'well', 'i', 'know', 'some', 'fine', 'day', 'you', 'will', 'find', 'your', 'way', 'across', 'the', 'river', 'across', 'the', 'river', 'row', 'down', 'slow', 'theres', 'a', 'long', 'way', 'to', 'go', 'across', 'the', 'river', 'across', 'the', 'river', 'your', 'wild', 'days', 'be', 'through', 'be', 'what', 'they', 'say', 'i', 'dream', 'she', 'come', 'and', 'i', 'go', 'down', 'and', 'i', 'walk', 'where', 'she', 'lead', 'stand', 'on', 'the', 'shore', 'she', 'look', 'to', 'the', 'west', 'with', 'a', 'look', 'of', 'long', 'to', 'where', 'the', 'grass', 'seem', 'greener', 'well', 'theres', 'a', 'hard', 'and', 'distant', 'prize', 'it', 'probably', 'wont', 'happen', 'but', 'i', 'think', 'ill', 'try', 'well', 'even', 'if', 'it', 'doesnt', 'happen', 'for', 'me', 'it', 'still', 'beat', 'hang', 'around', 'here', 'well', 'i', 'know', 'some', 'fine', 'day', 'you', 'will', 'find', 'your', 'way', 'across', 'the', 'river', 'across', 'the', 'river', 'row', 'down', 'slow', 'theres', 'a', 'long', 'long', 'way', 'to', 'go', 'across', 'the', 'river', 'across', 'the', 'river']",317,Bruce Hornsby and the Range,Bruce Hornsby & The Range,1990,"[97, 91, 78, 60, 49, 31, 22, 18, 22, 29, 33, 37, 44, 50, 53, 63]",16,Across the River (In the Style of Bruce Hornsby & The Range) [Karaoke Version,https://open.spotify.com/track/2qCMV2h9DCOgraXKrTsAJg,2qCMV2h9DCOgraXKrTsAJg,spotify:track:2qCMV2h9DCOgraXKrTsAJg,Karaoke - Hits of Bruce Hornsby and Don Henley,1kta7T4rhLKX3inHLk4dHl,spotify:album:1kta7T4rhLKX3inHLk4dHl,Ameritz Karaoke Hits,1gKjPKYtt6NXhxIqJPFIYE,spotify:artist:1gKjPKYtt6NXhxIqJPFIYE,317.52,10.0,0.0,2012-01-10,0.551,0.561,7.0,-13.049,1.0,0.0343,0.0585,0.184,0.133,0.878,149.197,['karaoke'],[],1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.11100000000000002

Drying off the last year of our bind
Was it real or just a mirage?
Love has its way of making you blind
I stared deep into your heart and your soul
And I feel what any woman would want

Why did I run?
Why did I hide?
Because the memories bleed on and on

Time goes on
And the feelings stay strong
Memories laugh and play with my heart
Like thunder in a rainstorm
Tell me is this real or just a mirage?
I ask myself

Could this be love
Or just a memory
Of the two of us together
Lifetime friends forever
You and me a unity
Of friendship and love

As we moved our separate ways that day
Tears ran down my face
And I asked myself
Was I just too weak to face the truth
That love is what I have for you

You're someone special deep down inside
Your love is true
Why did I hide?
Why did I run?
Why did I hide?
Because the memories bleed on and on

Time goes on and the feeling stays strong
This word called love
Ae you the one?
That I want
Tell me is this real or just a mirage?
I ask myself

Could this be love
Or just a memory
Of the two of us together

176,176,We're All In the Same Gang,"[Intro]
Gun is Cocked and Fired
I'm King News and I come to you with the truth
The mean streets took six more lives overnight
All the result of gang-bang stupidity
By the way, you gangsters should know
One of your victims was a three-year-old girl
Well, you gang members, you still don't get it, do ya?

(With your bad self)

[Verse 1: King Tee]
It's straight up madness everywhere I look
Used to be a straight A student, now he's a crook
Robbing people just to smoke or shoot up
Used to have a crew cut, now he's a pooh-butt
Dropped out of school and he joins the neighborhood gang
Hanging on the streets selling 'caine
To his own people
Now when I say people I mean color
You a stupid mother-
I'm trying to stress the fact that you're dumb
Get yourself presentable, son, and just come
Together, you better, cause pretty soon it's gonna be too late
A message from King Tee The Great

[Verse 2: Body & Soul]
Sisters, since we are the mothers of this earth
It's time we start being good mothers from the birth
Of our children, no time for sleeping
Teach them to fight and win for the right reason
It's your time, it's your life, live it
Proud to be black, young and gifted
Lifted by the knowledge and taking the right route
Gang violence needs to be wiped out
A-L-M-I-G-H-Ty and E-Z-I-R-E
We see the F-U-T-U-R-E
Should be a positive thing
Body & Soul and you, we're in the same gang

[Verse 3: Def Jef]
One and the same
Everyone came in the same chains
Caught with the same aim
Brain games and names changed
To protect the innocent by-stander
Lies, slander and the master-planner
Destroy the black male
Crack jail and semi-automatic
For static if the crack fails
So since we all talk the same slang
Stop killin, my brother, cause we're all from the same gang

[Chorus]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Make the change cause we're all in the same gang

[Verse 4: Tone-Loc]
Now as a youth I used to get my bang on
And on the ave get my part-time slang on
Doing time for me was no joke though
They knew I was crazy, so they labelled me Loco
Khakis creased, golf hat, feelin sporty
Low ridin and tossin up a forty
Thinkin in my mind that no one could handle us
The downest brothers ever touched Los Angeles
I found life was much more suitable
Cause I'm the brother that makes black so beautiful
I ain't slippin or down with a head trip
I'm talkin to all the Bloods and all the Crips
Throw down your rag and get on the right track, man
It's time to fight, unite and be a black man
Tone-Loc is on a positive change
Cause remember, we're all in the same gang

[Verse 5: Above The Law]
Bein' the pimps that we are
We're here to speak on a situation that has gone too far
Here at home in the ghettos of LA
Where a young black brother's not promised to see the next day
Cause we used to clock on the streets before we made beats
But fools just lay and prey on the weak
It don't depend on the color of a rag
Cause if you got what they want you know they gonna take what you have
Cause violence don't only revolve from drugs and thugs
And gangs that bang
Most times it's a political thang
Yeah, a couple of spots'll get popped
And if the government wanted to freeze it it could all get stopped
But they don't because they want it like that
Because the system been set up to hold us back
Yeah, Above The Law means that we can do whatever
So why don't we stick together?
(You got it)

[Verse 6: Ice-T]
Ice-T rippin the microphone the way I do
Listen close, my brothers, cause I'm talkin to you
The problem is we got a suicidal lifestyle
Cause 90 percent of us are livin foul and wild
I say job, you say ([Hen-G:] bad joke
I rather jack another brother, watch the gun smoke)
Livin in the fast lane flippin like you're insane
You won't stop until your blood runs down the street drain
I got an idea, give me a minute
And if it makes sense, then get with it
What if we could take our enemies, feed em poison
Undereducate their girls and boys and
Split em up, make em fight one another
Better yet, make em kill for a color
All my brothers need to know one thing
No matter what you think, we're all in the same gang

[Chorus]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Stop the fighting
(Make the change)
Because we're all in the same gang

[Verse 7: Dr. Dre and MC Ren]
Yo, we're not here to preach because we're not ministers
We're telling like it is cause Ren and Dre is like sinister
Reality speaks for itself when it's spoken
A basehead cluck can't blame nobody for smoking
Yo, bullets flying, mothers crying, brothers dying
Lying in the streets, that's why we're trying
To stop it from falling apart and going to waste
And keeping a smile off of white face
N.W.A never preaching, just teaching
The knowledge of the streets to each and
All that don't understand, that's why we came
To let you know that we're all in the same gang

[Verse 8: JJ Fad]
The J double, F, the a, the d, that is
And if you want the solution to the quiz
What's black and black, yo, and kills another?
An ignorant sucker that isn't labelled as a brother
But another
So now it's time we evolve
And get together and solve it
Cause the world is revolvin
Around a terrible situation
One will kill another for a reputation
So it's time we stop and realize that we're all the same
Yo Train, tell em (We're all in the same gang)

[Verse 9: Young MC]
Brothers killin' other brothers
I thought the idea was to love one another?
Open up the paper to one more death
If y'all keep this up then there'll be no one left
I try my best to set an example
Sayin hype lyrics over hip-hop samples
Not just a brag or to boast but to inform
Cause we're livin in the calm before the storm
You see, I believe that the children are the future
But what's it all about if in the future they shoot ya?
We're all human beings, if we're cut we'll bleed
And I want to see all young people succeed
Do 9 to 5, not 5 to 10
Just go to work and not the state pen
Cause you live better when you're out there free
And that's comin straight to ya from the Young MC

[Verse 10: Digital Underground]
I'm in a rage
Oh yeah? Yo, why is that G?
Other races, they say we act like rats in a cage
I tried to argue, but check it, every night in the news
We prove them suckers right and I got the blues
America
Get busy, Humpty
The red, the white, the blue and
The blue and the red
For Crips and Bloods
The white for who's got you doin
Time bustin caps on one another
The Underground's down for peace among brothers
Kill a black man?
What?
Yo, what are you retarded?
Tell em, Hump
Yo, do you work for the Klan?
Do what ya like
Unless you like gangbangin
Let's see how many brothers leave us hangin

[Verse 11: Oaktown's 3.5.7.]
The gang that should hang is the one that contains
The sisters and the brothers who are all in the same frame of mind
Now listen, get loose, it's unity time
Yeah, yeah
Peace is a presence that we all need
The future's in our hands, in word and deed
I'm Terrible T and I'm Sweet LD
We're 3.5.7. totally

[Verse 12: MC Hammer]
Kickin on the ave 'bout a quarter to 9
All the homies gettin blind in an eight ball line
Now on this tip they started runnin at the lip
Jumped in their deuce and took a little trip
Hit the block about 12 on the tick
The windows went down and the nines went click
People started yellin, bodies started bailin
Bullets cold flyin sendin some to hell and
It's gotta stop, we don't need all the violence
Peace in the hood and a moment of silence
We got together not for ego or fame
We got involved cause we're all in the same gang

[Verse 13: Eazy-E]
Last but not least, yo, Eazy's no sell-out
And if you can't hang in the streets, then get the hell out
I'm not tryin to tell ya what to do
You have your own freedom of choice who to listen to
You knew good from bad, fair from foul, right from wrong
Now your mother's singing that sad song
(My baby ain't never hurt nobody!)
But he still got smoked at BeBe's party
But you're not the first or the last
You're nothin but a short story from the past
You're dead now, not number one but a zero
Take notes from Eazy-E, the violent hero

[Chorus]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?","['gun', 'be', 'cock', 'and', 'fire', 'im', 'king', 'news', 'and', 'i', 'come', 'to', 'you', 'with', 'the', 'truth', 'the', 'mean', 'streets',

Look, before I start I want to say, that I was never proud of what happened between me and Dose
And that's why we here today. To do this for hip hop. Aight

He still look like a sucka!
A stupid motherfucker right!?
He the type to put his hat brim in ya face and start a fucking fight
Well I never been a pussy nigga, tell me what it's like
Fronting like you hard, then running for ya fucking life
Cause when these Philly niggas see the iron
You gon see enough bodies on the ground to fill them coffins that FEMA hiding
You think he a gangsta go watch the fucking tube
So they can see we fold you up like I was cuffing Tru's
Some of y'all new that battle I wasn't fucking cool
Until a hat brim in ya face and it's touching you
Real niggas respect niggas space or its bust a move
Get ya shit rocked like a thrift shop its nothing new
I'm from Brooklyn no work then we go to rob
And take ya work, BIG BANG! Off the word of God
Light switch turn em off we turn to Mike Vick
Cause we come back around with them same numbers Like we ain't murder dog
Go ahead and talk hard, we know you ain't about to flip Remember when ""Chill dog, I'm only 19."" was coming out ya lips?
I could just give you some bars and get you out this bitch
But you the one who broke our agreement and Smack can vouch for this
Now you here on this stage, you must've upped ya luck
You lost on 106 three times cause you fucking suck
Haters said you gave me the shine, I'm like ""Enough's enough""
You bout to feel my hardest punchline like when I fucked you up
Now this next her is gon crush ya core
I pushed you off the stage and ran behind you to fuck you up some more
I said ""Get outta my face"" he said ""what's up than dawg?"" Tech 9 when its check time, another fucking fraud
This battle rap shit there ain't no competitors
Y'all seen how I was slaying the predator
I'm better than you I be the best 'fore I D-I-E
And I ain't falling back again ghost of B-I-G
No possession shit
Unless we talking a weapon that I done crept in with
Get off the handle than it's the handle I teach the lesson with
Shit is deep they thought Polo got murked off
But I'm the one URL chaps got ya birth off
There's two types of niggas in life
The niggas that find bitches and fuck em and the niggas that.... trust 'em
Who grind riches from nothing and the niggas that's suffering
Behind hiccups is bustin and the niggas that's duckin
The niggas who pop shit versus the niggas that snuff em
Yo my original verse was like a prophecy
An ill introduction to the to the realest two gorillas Hoffa live it, they fronting
If you came here to fight, let's skip thru the bluffin'
I punch a hole thru this bird and get a fist full of stuffing
I told you give me my space, you said ""Let's get it, it's nothing"".""
You disrespectful so I checked you..... end of discussion
HOFFA!

[Round 1: J. Dose]
I should start this off by knocking you the fuck out!
But I'ma spit some bars cousin
See the whole time ya thought karma was a bitch, but I'm far from it
See I ain't gotta get my point cross
You can already tell where I'm headed soon as the coin toss
Speculation when y'all seen me it's like ""WOW he really survived""
Or ""he really revived""
Or some much dirt thrown on my name thought I was buried alive
See J. Dose was never dead just certain things that was never said
Which is why he got some better cred
And I know a close mouth ain't never fed
But defeat was never on my mind an you know I'm a step ahead
You see I'm an ahead of myself I had to rewind myself to remind myself I'm behind myself
Simultaneously beyond myself so fast I had to time myself
Look at the clock and surprise myself
See I don't wanna get beside myself
But there ain't no competition besides myself
See only I can tie myself and if I do than I'm, well, by myself
It apparently doesn't show that I'm myself
So imagine if I combine myself
Dose
Yeah I know I went back in the past to give Vlad the beginning round
But I came back just in time to finish line
I give a fuck what you haters say I'm still attacking the lyrical
You know a picture say a thousand words an just imagine the video
So homie don't run lip 'fore that barrel get tongue lit
In other words I can arrange/orange to get son kissed/Sunkist
Choppers with drum clips bangin' till numbness
Ain't a genie but rubbing me the wrong way is nothing you wanna wish
This rap world is on some dumb shit
L'ma speak on behalf of those who well actually come to spit
All the way from T-Rex to well my son Clips
And if Mook was here I bet he'd wanna trip
Cause in these battles niggas drop albums
And he still relevant off, well, one hit
I mean that's gotta be demoralizing to a rappers ego
I guess now I know how quarterbacks fell about Tebow
But this times tables are turned, ain't nothing screwed
My boy problems, add them, that's not a plus for you
But don't mind us/minus unless you wanna lose
See just cause I got class don't mean I let you pass
I just rather do the math than divide through the half
Let the Eagle/equal do/to a W
And fuck what happened man, you scaring who?
Listen, before I let anything land, this pair'll shoot/parachute
I ain't about the rap, the field is where you'll find me at
Ask Dolls, I play the corner where the drivers at
I put cheese on ya head if you trying to trap
I'm a Packer plus all my G's ride in packs
What's in ya pocket? Let me find out you copping sacks
You in a Lembo? We airing (Aaron), Roger that!
Here to set the record straight, 40 make him levitate
Give this nigga wings an he can really be a featherweight
You get a box, I ain't talking in a ring I got a bullet in my neck, this nigga talkin bout a swing?!
While you was making blogs about what we did at the gym
I was trying to learn how to walk and move my fingers again
See my boy detrimental, I been mixing since 10
And still gutter ball/bol and that's without hitting the pen/pin
So go ahead start swinging again
I put a price on ya head tag on ya toe, cut ya living expense
These other rappers ain't give him an inch
I'm in the same spot Calicoe was at
And I wish this nigga would/wood cause its getting intense/in tents
You don't wanna scrap, I'ma let a hundred clap
To ya family tree I'm like a lumberjack
And I don't know why ya gun is strapped
You ain't buckin no more Ya warring done/Warren Dunn, see him running back
Running for my life, nigga I will run ya wife
I'II fuck ya dream girl till her ass cum/come to life
I ain't a pimp, that's the worse lie
Since I blew/blue birds follow me like Twitter you can check just to verify
Money, cars, clothes all a nigga knows
Triple six zero z's, all a nigga flows
Got the world in my palm I could cross him with the globe
The way Brooklyn on the net you would thought he facing Hov
Ya whole city watching probably Diddy watching
What you gonna do does he get an option
You a cold pussy I'ma bout to finger pop him
Put a price on ya head and send my niggas shopping Rah!
They'll find you sleep and awake
Get it? Sleep in a wake
You a full time rapping battle, I'll have em laughing at you
Cut ya throat to play pool with ya Adams apple
What can you draw that haven't already saw?
What can you say you want YouTube to play?
I mean what could you even mention dude that wasn't on ya interviews
The more magnified the more it became minuscule
An interview here, an interview there
This man had more interviews/inner views than a rear view mirror
Save ya breath fam, you giving me a breath tan
His breath an hot his mic need a sweatband
Before, you could've got signed by Def Jam
Now you wouldn't get signed by a deaf man
Low pro, got no flow, nigga you're loco
Rap sucks, ya gassed up, call him Sunoco
Oh no, so-so flow making them no shows
No joke, got Dose flows up in a choke hold
Homo, you old though, busting a fo' fo'
Hit [?] with Cinco, something like Ocho
Or that super Smith'n the one that's busting with logos
[?]
Encompassed by dollars on my Jerry Jones flow
A star up on the field I ain't talking logo
You think it's a game, it's more like a post show
Get 9 out the Cal boy Ton' Romo
BLAOW! Leave a mess on ya chest It's Dose bitch
Aka the best of the best
Want war? Hope you got an S on ya chest
Cause what I shoot you gon need a vest on a vest
I'm a motherfucking rider
5 to that chopper
Bang his mid frame turn his body to a tire
HA! That boy Dose you better ask about him
Head of my class I don't worry about no Math problem
What you know about bringing ya mom to the side
With a brace around ya neck cause you caught one up in the spine
Seeing her smile erode while looking in her eyes
Then tell her ya son just died
My brother caught a wig shot right up the street from me
Ever since then nigga I ain't living peacefully
My baby moms said I went crazy and gave the peace to me
It's cool cause she ain't the only one that be leaving me/believe in me
I'm a motherfucking prospect quick to let that nine peck
Spit R til it's contact lift him like a sky jet
I got places where I hit him when I use the tool about to get the shotty
But the collar get the medulla shooter
Flow colder than juice of coolers
These cats dig me like a pooper scooper
I'm the shit cause everybody feeling me
I'm superior lyrically I done killed ya ass so bad to the point where you had to swing on me
What next? Pull a gun out? Shoot the God? Huh?
Mimic Loaded Lux but I'll be in a suit and tie?
I guess this battle'll be do or die
I ain't lying I got lines that could push suicide
No I said I ain't lying, I got lines that could push Tsu aside

[Round 2: Math Hoffa]
Let's get this roast on the way
See Dose hopes and he prays
If I get smoked on the stage, maybe the jokes go away
I came here outta curiosity, mentally open for play
The fuck is Dose gonna say to make me dose him today?
I knew he'd come back with that ""Niggas still can't handle dose
Yeah I heard you handle bread, let's see if you can handle toast""
You shimmying ass nigga, fuck is up with all them antidotes?
Why you gotta dance around to tell niggas ya hammer smoke?
See that's ya problem, you too hyped when you rhyme
So I'ma start flipping yours cause I'm tired of flipping mine
You should've turned my dome to a stadium, you wasn't riding with ya 9
See you would be aight, but you be lying in ya lines
DOSE!
Get in ya zone nigga get it in
But if you get close my knuckle bones gon' hit ya chin again
This toast, I'm delivering
I'll Siamese the Glocks while you die of beady/diabetes shots
Like a DOSE of insulin
Now timeout cause  I see some new faces in my house
If t'a'll ain't see the tutorial on us, you 'bout to find out
This lil nigga here suicidal he trying to sign out
You die over Dose in vain you Amy Winehouse
What's up Dose you came back for a fight?
Well I wanna fight Smack cause I never get the match ups I like
But my Spanish niggas told me, ""Don't be mad it's aight
I mean his names Dose (dos) guess that mean you gotta battle him twice.""
But having to write for this nigga was tough
Cause ain't a dose line ya'll ain't heard
So many battle rappers done flipped you this shit could break nerves
You became the description of violating a straight herb
And it's permanent, wow, I turned dose to a verb/Aye Verb
And I seen ya interviews I'm guessing you just love to front
Just because I punched a sucka doesn't mean it was a sucker punch
These other niggas be getting violated
Cause they all a bunch of bluffing punks
But I'm the type of nigga you only gotta fuck with ONCE!
So why deprive me of just being who I be
I'm such a fly G my passport is my ID
It's NYB we the force they don't try see
They know they gotta go with the flow I'm teaching Tai Chi
I'll have this dude on the flo' screaming out ""Why me!?""
I'll send four roaming/Roman ya way you get the IV
Dose you can't fuck with me privately or publicly
But if we ran a train on a hoe this what you gonna see
See I'ma take her first, shake her earth, make her squirt
Throw it in her box s deep I bet I make her burp
But you go against the grain so when its ya time for jumping in
This lame'll put his face on the box, this nigga Uncle Ben
I mean I got so much to work off, I can crucify you with no cross
You battled Joey Jihad I was like ""Why?""I was thrown off
Cause he also got footage online of getting broke off
You got ya head cracked, he dozed off, nigga you both lost
I'm giving him pure comedy, he don't deserve hot quotes
Matter fact ya whole career is like a knock knock joke
Knock knock (who there)
Dose! (dose who?)
Exactly!

[Round 2: J. Dose]
I'm just living like I never lived it
The grim reaper called I guess he feeling pessimistic
See it's impressing how I capture every second to perpetuate the present I'm just saying I'm forever gifted
Y'all seen what I been through
Ain't no point in me trying to fake it
With all these chapters in my life is just his story/history in the making
I mean y'all know the deal so y'all knows it's real
And when the fire coming you know the drill
Stop drop and roll
'Fore I cock lock and load
My spot hot as stoves, cops got the block patrolled
You ain't a thug man you probably got a job to go
Not to switch the subject though but be honest bro
The only time you shine and flow/shining floors is with Mop & Glow
Been a loser all ya life cause it's bout time you know
Sick of defeat wanna he'll/heel but don't feel what the doctor shows/Dr. Sholes
Y'all know me and that nigga Con had a similar line
But I didn't hear him when I wrote it
And the shit is still mine listen
I ain't saying you straight chocha
But every time I see you, you kinda change ya persona
When them cameras off you don't really act that hard
You ain't bout that action you just rapping hard
They want a problem until they got Math involved
You want an ISSUE you can get the whole CATALOGUE SUBSCRIPTION MAGAZINE make the NEWS
But there's something I READ about him/red bottoms
He hate to lose/hate the Lous' (Louis Vuitton)
You gon get the feet/defeat just without the lace and shoe
And while y'all play the tube
Smack I'm thinkin major moves
All I see is dollars paper view/Pay Per View
I mean y'all put J on TV, Ray Charles'll hop out his grave to see me
Listen I'm just trying to make dough he be on that hate flow
Til the dots put a cast on him you can stay broke
I got fans in the back with their hands raised I shine an much I gotta rap with a lampshade
Cause y'all can tell ifs my time
Since '991 been labeled as a human walking time bomb
Words off the wall no timeline
Everything I write fly skyline
You a cheerleader hating on the sideline
I make the seven point and raise him like a pom pom
NIGGA! You know the money stay on my mind
So a nigga stretch ends like the wide nine
And ya bitch been trying reach me like a hotline
Cause last visit left her curling like a hot iron
Man you better recognize who the top don
'Fore you catch it on sight no dot com, no not lying
You better Dash like Dame or catch a gap in you bigger than a ROC sign
Cause niggas know I'm a tool blammer
With them loaded rhinos in that new banger
Hard to control when I use hammers
Big shit you gotta hold like a news camera
BLAOW fucking with me I hope you got a new plan
He bout to have more issues than a newsstand
Ever since I battled he became the new Stan
You remind me of a windmill; HUGE FAN
Bars impressive you just want to imitate it
Jacking my style since when you been an animated?
But let me find out you jack rhymes
You gon have to retire and get aired out flatlined
Wait wait I'ma show you why I don't think math ride
Jack Time, Air Flat, and they say I don't have lines
Don't watch me watch TV lesson to the wise
In that case Viewer discretion is advised
Wassup with this nigga so obsessed with telling lies
When I see him the ladder a get him to climbing
So I suggest you get up in the skies/disguise
Cause I grab tools act a fool, quick to hit you
I do hammers like cameras flash, shoot, get the picture
You don't want die you tripping spare the flight
Gamble with ya life and you can get that paradise
Nah I said you don't want a DIE, trippin spare the flight
Gamble with ya life and you can get that pair of dice
Futuristic flow ya history for real chump
I'm so cold I get Mr. Freeze chill bumps
Saying I ain't real
But if I pull this joker card he would never find a deal
Understand I'm kinds ill, make this rider stop and grill
You'll see ARs/C-A-Rs and be staring/steering like the man behind the wheel
This ain't no 106 Park shit this some raw shit
Blow his body parts find his head between his armpits
You call this a battle, that's a clear joke
Bet ya life and you gonna be dead broke
Flow bananas I make King Kong get amazed
Cause I go realer/gorilla with bars like he in a cage
I need a dot before I hit the stage
Cause even the deaf know my raps sick they got hearing AIDS
Think you actually can win fam'?
You got a better chance tyna use a ladder on quicksand
I get you tagged for a quick gram
Nigga I'ma boss I can make ya shadow my hitman
Turn it to a holocaust you get slaughtered dog
Eagle to the back of ya head knock a quarter off
Boom!

[Round 3: Math Hoffa]
Before I start this 3rd round, I just wanna speak to y'all
I still remember the last time I battled on URL
It's ok, I ain't got no beef with ya'll
It's not like I be throwing Hennessey bottles or DNA 12 year old teeth at
Y'all all I ask is while I'm on the stage, y'all niggas keep it tall
If you wanna boo, boo for wack bars that don't reach at all
Don't boo because he's ya dawg from ya region, you wanna even odds
Or you wanted something simple and the line was too deep for y'all
Or a nigga red sleeveless hoody just looked to sweet to y'all
Or because they call me a bully and that word just make the demons call
It brings us back to a time when were younger, naive, weak and small
And the biggest dude on the block used to put hands and feet on y'all
And you look up at me like ""Fuck Math I wanna see him fall!""
People this is battle rap, two emcees hit a stage
With no beat they compete with rap schemes and displays
Now though shit might sound real or really mean full of rage
At the end of the day they don't mean what they say
Except me!
If I ain't ya number one I should be in ya best three
Niggas know Dose cause they will never forget me
So this battle is like Bruce Lee versus Jet Li
My punches'll turn a URL stage into UFC Octagon!
I brought an As I'm into lots of dram;
If he do 't want the clips he'll get ate/eight Octomom
I sat you in the crib and raised my value like some stocks and bonds
These kinda rhymes gon send you back in long as Obama time
Nobody buys that you popping them triggers
Treat ya self and be ya self while you dropping them lyrics
You just a battle rapper battling for the spot of the illest
I solidified my spot with gorillas and I don't rock with you niggas
But I ain't come here to fight in front the city
This time you getting beat with vocals you know swizzy
Blood everywhere oh trizzy, I throw 50
The the way these Young Bucks be acting, so silly
I'm the truest; I dealt with that coke and that dope really
I don't seen an much snow in the summer you grow chilly
From collections low with that weapon that fo fizzy
Man I pull that trigger back an hard I go GIMMIE!
Tear ya wig off I'm like chemo
Low with them tools in ya home....Depot!
I put a peephole thru you and two of ya peoples
You'll die from one round but they still say it's a 3-0
Best rapper yes master, it's the Neo
X-factor colder than that cold cut trio
This gonna be the meanest Hoffa that you ever seen yo
For your sake hope there's a doctor and a lawyer in the house; Theo
Smack! Norbes! Beasley! Chico!
Y'all know that I'm a shooter why even give me a free throw
Don't wine when I do him greasy yo; Pino
This ain't even a matchup the people wanted to see though What ya'll really wanted to see? Cassidy verse Meek Mills? Please, chill!
I wouldn't be feeling that bullshit on an E pill
Them niggas can't fuck with this stage, let's be real
No disrespect they make hits, but we kill
It's Pac Juice! They know whafs up in the booth
Yeah I could make the transition but I'm stuck on the truth
Wack battles, wack music, who gives a fuck about Mook?
Smack wassup I'm trying to battle Lux up on the roof
DNA fixed his tooth now he smooth for the viewers
T-Rex a check away from removing his tumor
You named yourself Dose that's what ruined ya future
Cause being number two in a battle makes you the loser
You blew the opportunity that BET lent you
Philly niggas hate you they b-e-t against you
I know deep inside ya mind defeating me is essential
But if you the one that gave me shine than I'm the deity that sent you
Lucifer
Now I'm in ya scenery to tempt you
Are you gon be like me and just repeat what we done went through?
Or we gonna be emcees and paint the scene like we was meant to?
Now l'ma close my eyes...no surprise
You on a frequency, it's mental...
Now ya kids can look up to you
Get a job, work hard, live comfortable
Cause battling after me punking you is not gonna he enough for you
But you a grown man Dose so you gon do just what you want to do
But keep in mind I could've battled Hitman if I wanted to
But I got you paid and it wasn't just to take a dump on you
They could never say I don't give a shit, I took a number 2
You don't got bars like that
You he the running man my nigga, you ain't hard like that
I know ya'll like ""Damn, why he ain't tap his jaw like that?""
Come see my next battle I'ma bring them bars right back

[Round 3: J. Dose]
I'm sure after hearing all these bars y'all wondering why I ain't been nowhere around
I'm talking years right now
Well they say if you build it they will come
And that should explain why I'm here right now
See I let him build and build and build
To the top so I could tear him right down
And as a result literally make me the top tier right now
Two types of niggas in life huh?
Well which kind are you?
The one that put ya homies in a life threatening situation
Cause on some real I don't think you know a real nigga limitations
Somebody could've got killed what if my partner was strapped
Ya publicity stunt woulda been nullified if ya man died over rap
And that's probably why they not here, been dodging this match
Plus we haven't seen them since where all them guys in the back
Oh! well I'm guessing they not for your crap
They probably know everything you did was kind of an act
And aside from the fact you got poppin and scrapped
I know all Brooklyn niggas wasn't rockin with that
You know two types of niggas in life huh
Yeah the ones that peep a vulnerable situation and try to exploit it
Claiming they real when integrity arise they decide to ignore it
You know the kind that get around a bunch of new niggas and try to impress
Do everything in the book except rocking a dress
See I know, see a lil kid outside of his city got gritty got busy
You knew attacking my size the only way to fight with me
But in ya favor the naive couldn't recognize the deal
But tell me what you see in the mirror cause you know, real recognize real
Two types of niggas in life huh, that still ain't clear HOLD SON!
Last time I checked it takes one to know one
I only know one and that's real
Than he says ""Finally, daddy's spending time with me.""
Alright pop, what you glorifying? Deadbeats?
Wait, wait, I get it, I get it he when he says ""Get out my face...son"" he was serious clearly
Either that or this dude's confused
You know the bars an hot made him lose his cool
I probably catch a case or hit the cell for attacking with bars
Cause once he adapt to the ER I'll probably get a battery charge
What you asking me for? You ain't ask for that
Cause what I rapped really happened, you just happened to rap
OK, you put the smack in the Smack
Let's keep it real, because ya rapping was wack
You know last time I checked
Smack was for rap
In that case why didn't you put a smack in a track?
Or a smack in the deal nah nah better yet a smack in the plaque
Wait I let me get it straight he if putting smack in the Smack really mattered in rap
Than why are you trying to spark a flame by having this match
I got bars something that you actually lack
With verses that make rappers wanna smack on the Smack
So go ahead you can have ya lil smack on the smack
Hope you get a cookie a trophy pat on ya back
Enjoy it while it last cause you ain't having it back
Unless you really got me chopped cause I ain't battling ask/ax
This nigga full of hot air til he catching a flat
So save ya breath for the pumps to ya as my attack/asthma attack
I ain't rapping no mo' so cherish ya present or get ya box wrapped in a bow
Clapping a fo lay ya body flat on the flo'
Arms in the crowd, head in the back of the row
You only known cause you did what never happened befo'
Tell me this you think a fanatical blow is an actual show?
So I guess ""Get out my face son"" was a rap that you wrote
And if those were your components on how to master a flow
After that one hit wonder why you could never actually blow? So don't get full of ya self and make a fool of ya self
Cause in the and Math you only fooling ya self
See this kid, I got dumb rhymes not just sometimes
So I don't have to use a swing for a punchline
You shoulda known that nothing would last
I mean I'm young, the future, stuck in the past
Pac Juice? Now you know you can't tell him shit
Would someone tell this fucking pussy he won't sell a bit
I mean this shit got wild
You just don't need a stylist you need a list of styles
See me I give the manager illusions
Walk inside the Louie store they like ""the mannequin is moving""
Oh you mad cause I’m styling on you?
To and try that shit these Philly niggas wildin' on you
Math that's only if I ain't on you
You ain't never ride I'ma put some mileage on you
Homie when that chrome to ya cranium
Click Clack BOOM! Turn his dome to a stadium!

178,178,Cuts Both Ways,"[Verse 1:]
It cuts both ways
Our love is like knife
That cuts both ways
It's driven deep into my heart each time
That I realize
How it cuts both ways

Can't be together
Cannot live apart
We're heading straight into a broken heart
But I can't stop

[Chorus:]
'Cause I feel too much to let you go
I'm hurting you and it's hard I know
To stay and fight for what we've got
Knowing it'll never be good enough

'Cause you and I are dangerous
We want too much and life ain't that way
Don't ask for more
Don't be a fool
Haven't we already broken every rule

[Verse 2:]
It cuts both ways
We're in too deep for sorry alibis
Can't have regrets or even question why
We can't say goodbye
Because it cuts both ways

No more illusions of the love we make
No sacrifice would ever be too great
If you would just stay

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Cuts both ways
Our love is like a knife that cuts both ways
It's driving deep into my heart each time
I see we living the lie
And it cuts both ways

I can't find myself
When you go away
Makes me wonder where you are
Is there someone else
I just need to know
This charade has gone too far

For the first time in my life
Feel I'm losing control
I can't keep pretending
It's my soul that you own
I need you

My heart's in your world tonight
(Possession)
And you hold the key to my life
(Possession)
I've got to be with you
I wanna dream with you
You're my obsession
I want possession of you

I can't play this game
Am I in too deep
Cause my world
Is where you are
You're always on my mind
The little things you say
I can feel you everywhere

The trace of your lipstick
I can taste your perfume
The note that you left me
Leaves a space in this room
I need you

My heart's in your world tonight

And you hold the key to my life

But I'll do the best I can to make it happen
Don't keep me in the dark
Cause I know where I stand

183,183,The Girl I Used To Know,"You think it is a sorry thing
That I am blind.  Your pitying
Is welcome to me; yet indeed,
I think I have but little need
Of it.  Though you may marvel much
That _we_, who see by sense of touch
And taste and hearing, see things _you_
May never look upon; and true
Is it that even in the scent
Of blossoms _we_ find something meant
No eyes have in their faces read,
Or wept to see interpreted.

And you might think it strange if now
I told you you were smiling.  How
Do I know that?  I hold your hand--
_Its_ language I can understand--
Give both to me, and I will show
You many other things I know.
Listen:  We never met before
Till now?--Well, you are something lower
Than five-feet-eight in height; and you
Are slender; and your eyes are blue--

Your mother's eyes--your mother's hair--
Your mother's likeness everywhere
Save in your walk--and that is quite
Your father's; nervous.--Am I right?
I thought so.  And you used to sing,
But have neglected everything
Of vocalism--though you may
Still thrum on the guitar, and play
A little on the violin,--
I know that by the callous in
The finger-tips of your left hand--
And, by-the-bye, though nature planned
You as most men, you are, I see,
""_Left_-handed,"" too,--the mystery
Is clear, though,--your right arm has been
Broken, to ""break"" the left one in.
And so, you see, though blind of sight,
I still have ways of seeing quite
Too well for you to sympathize
Excessively, with your good eyes.--
Though _once_, perhaps, to be sincere,
Within the whole asylum here,
From cupola to basement hall,
I was the blindest of them all!

Let us move further down the walk--
The man here waiting hears my talk,
And is disturbed; besides, he may
Not be quite friendly anyway.
In fact--(this will be far enough;
Sit down)--the man just spoken of
Was once a friend of mine.  He came
For treatment here from Burlingame--
A rich though brilliant student there,
Who read his eyes out of repair,
And groped his way up here, where we
Became acquainted, and where he
Met one of our girl-teachers, and,
If you 'll believe me, asked her hand
In marriage, though the girl was blind
As I am--and the girl _declined_.
Odd, wasn't it?  Look, you can see
Him waiting there.  Fine, isn't he?
And handsome, eloquently wide
And high of brow, and dignified
With every outward grace, his sight
Restored to him, clear and bright
As day-dawn; waiting, waiting still
For the blind girl that never will
Be wife of his.  How do I know?
You will recall a while ago
I told you he and I were friends.
In all that friendship comprehends,
I was his friend, I swear! why now,
Remembering his love, and how
His confidence was all my own,
I hear, in fancy, the low tone
Of his deep voice, so full of pride
And passion, yet so pacified
With his affliction, that it seems
An utterance sent out of dreams
Of saddest melody, withal
So sorrowfully musical
It was, and is, must ever be--
But I'm digressing, pardon me.
_I_ knew not anything of love
In those days, but of that above
All worldly passion,--for my art--
Music,--and that, with all my heart
And soul, blent in a love too great
For words of mine to estimate.
And though among my pupils she
Whose love my friend sought came to me
I only knew her fingers' touch
Because they loitered overmuch
In simple scales, and needs must be
Untangled almost constantly.
But she was bright in other ways,
And quick of thought, with ready plays
Of wit, and with a voice as sweet
To listen to as one might meet
In any oratorio--
And once I gravely told her so,--
And, at my words, her limpid tone
Of laughter faltered to a moan,
And fell from that into a sigh
That quavered all so wearily,
That I, without the tear that crept
Between the keys, had known she wept;
And yet the hand I reached for then
She caught away, and laughed again.
And when that evening I strolled
With my old friend, I, smiling, told
Him I believed the girl and he
Were matched and mated perfectly:
He was so noble; she, so fair
Of speech, and womanly of air;
He, strong, ambitious; she, as mild
And artless even as a child;
And with a nature, I was sure,
As worshipful as it was pure
And sweet, and brimmed with tender things
Beyond his rarest fancyings.
He stopped me solemnly.  He knew,
He said, how good, and just, and true
Was all I said of her; but as
For his own virtues, let them pass,
Since they were nothing to the one
That he had set his heart upon;
For but that morning she had turned
Forever from him.  Then I learned
That for a month he had delayed
His going from us, with no aid
Of hope to hold him,--meeting still
Her ever firm denial, till
Not even in his new-found sight
He found one comfort or delight.
And as his voice broke there, I felt
The brother-heart within me melt
In warm compassion for his own
That throbbed so utterly alone.
And then a sudden fancy hit
Along my brain; and coupling it
With a belief that I, indeed,
Might help my friend in his great need,
I warmly said that I would go
Myself, if he decided so,
And see her for him--that I knew
My pleadings would be listened to
Most seriously, and that she
Should love him, listening to me.
Go; bless me!  And that was the last--
The last time his warm hand shut fast
Within my own--so empty since,
That the remembered finger-prints
I 've kissed a thousand times, and wet
Them with the tears of all regret!

I know not how to rightly tell
How fared my quest, and what befell
Me, coming in the presence of
That blind girl, and her blinder love.
I know but little else than that
Above the chair in which she sat
I leant--reached for, and found her hand,
And held it for a moment, and
Took up the other--held them both--
As might a friend, I will take oath:
Spoke leisurely, as might a man
Praying for no thing other than
He thinks Heaven's justice;--She was blind,
I said, and yet a noble mind
Most truly loved her; one whose fond
Clear-sighted vision looked beyond
The bounds of her infirmity,
And saw the woman, perfectly
Modeled, and wrought out pure and true
And lovable.  She quailed, and drew
Her hands away, but closer still
I caught them.  ""Rack me as you will!""
She cried out sharply--""Call me 'blind'--
Love ever is--I am resigned!
Blind is your friend; as blind as he
Am I--but blindest of the three--
Yea, blind as death--you will not see
My love for you is killing me!""

There is a memory that may
Not ever wholly fade away
From out my heart, so bright and fair
The light of it still glimmers there.
Why, it did seem as though my sight
Flamed back upon me, dazzling white
And godlike.  Not one other word
Of hers I listened for or heard,
But I _saw_ songs sung in her eyes
Till they did swoon up drowning-wise,
As my mad lips did strike her own
And we flashed one and one alone!
Ah! was it treachery for me
To kneel there, drinking eagerly
That torrent-flow of words that swept
Out laughingly the tears she wept?--
Sweet words!  O sweeter far, maybe,
Than light of day to those that see,--
God knows, who did the rapture send
To me, and hold it from my friend.

And we were married half a year
Ago,--and he is--waiting here,
Heedless of that--or anything,
But just that he is lingering
To say good-bye to her, and bow--
As you may see him doing now,--
For there's her footstep in the hall;
God bless her!--help him!--save us all!","['you', 'think', 'it', 'be', 'a', 'sorry', 'thing', 'that', 'i', 'be', 'blind', 'your', 'pity', 'be', 'welcome', 'to', 'me', 'yet', 'indeed', 'i', 'think',

185,185,The Other Side,"[Chorus]
Lovin' you has go to be (take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (take me to the other side)
Oh take me to the other side (take me to the other side)

[Verse 1]
My mamma told me there'd be days like this
And man, she wasn't foolin
Cause I just can't believe the way you kiss
Uh uh-huh
You opened up your mouth with baited breath
You said you'd never leave me
You love me, you hate me, I tried to take the loss
You're crying me a river but I got to get across

[Chorus]
Lovin' you has go to be (take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (take me to the other side)
Oh take me to the other side (take me to the other side)

[Verse 2]
I'm looking for another kind of love
Oh Lordy, how I need it
The kind that likes to leap without a shove
Oh, honey, best believe it
To save a lot of time and foolish pride I'll say what's on my mind, girl
You loved me, you hate me, you cut me down to size
You blinded me with love and yeah it opened up my eyes

[Chorus]
Lovin' you has go to be (take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (take me to the other side)
Oh take me to the other side (take me to the other side)

[Verse 3]
Take me to the other side
I'm looking for another kind of love
Oh Lordy, how I need it
The kind that likes to leap without a shove
Honey, you best believe it
Now I'm not one for saying long goodbyes
I hope all is forgiven
You loved me, you hate me, I used to be your lover
You know you had it coming girl so take me to the other

[Chorus]
Lovin' you has go to be (take me to the other side)

188,188,Only Women Bleed,"THE AMERICAN ACADEMY of Emergency Medicine confirms it: Each year, between one and two dozen adult US males are admitted to ERs after having castrated themselves. With kitchen tools, usually, sometimes wire cutters. In answer to the obvious question, surviving patients most often report that their sexual urges had become a source of intolerable conflict and anxiety. The desire for perfect release and the real-world impossibility of perfect, whenever-you-want-it release had together produced a tension they could no longer stand.

It is to the 30+ testosteronically afflicted males whose cases have been documented in the past two years that your correspondents wish to dedicate this article. And to those tormented souls considering autocastration in 1998, we wish to say: “Stop! Stay your hand! Hold off with those kitchen utensils and/or wire cutters!” Because we believe we may have found an alternative.

Every spring, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents awards for outstanding achievement in all aspects of mainstream cinema. These are the Academy Awards. Mainstream cinema is a major industry in the United States, and so are the Academy Awards. The AAs’ notorious commercialism and hypocrisy disgust many of the millions and millions and millions of viewers who tune in during prime time to watch the presentations. It is not a coincidence that the Oscars ceremony is held during TV’s Sweeps Week. We pretty much all tune in, despite the grotesquerie of watching an industry congratulate itself on its pretense that it’s still an art form, of hearing people in $5,000 gowns invoke lush clichés of surprise and humility scripted by publicists, etc.—the whole cynical postmodern deal—but we all still seem to watch. To care. Even though the hypocrisy hurts, even though opening grosses and marketing strategies are now bigger news than the movies themselves, even though Cannes and Sundance have become nothing more than enterprise zones. But the truth is that there’s no more real joy about it all anymore. Worse, there seems to be this enormous unspoken conspiracy where we all pretend that there’s still joy. That we think it’s funny when Bob Dole does a Visa ad and Gorbachev shills for Pizza Hut. That the whole mainstream celebrity culture is rushing to cash in and all the while congratulating itself on pretending not to cash in. Underneath it all, though, we know the whole thing sucks.

Your correspondents humbly offer an alternative.

Every January, the least pretentious city in America hosts the Annual AVN Awards. The AVN stands for Adult Video News, which is sort of the Variety of the US porn industry. This thick, beautifully designed magazine costs $7.95 per issue, is about 80 percent ads, and is clearly targeted at adult-video retailers. Its circulation is appr. 40,000.

Though the sub-line vagaries of entertainment accounting are legendary, it is universally acknowledged that the US adult-film industry, at $3.5-4 billion in annual sales, rentals, cable charges, and video-masturbation-booth revenues, is an even larger and more efficient moneymaking machine than legitimate mainstream American cinema (the latter’s annual gross commonly estimated at $2-2.5 billion). The US adult industry is centered in LA’s San Fernando Valley, just over the mountains from Hollywood.1 Some insiders like to refer to the adult industry as Hollywood’s Evil Twin, others as the mainstream’s Big Red Son.

It is no accident that Adult Video News—a slick, expensive periodical whose articles are really more like infomercials—and its yearly Awards both came into being in 1982. The early ’80s, after all, saw the genesis of VCRs and home-video rentals, which have done for the adult industry pretty much what TV did for pro football.

From the 12/11/97 press release issued by AVN (visitable also at www.avn.com):

- The nominations for the 15th Annual AVN Awards were announced today.2 This year’s awards show, commemorating AVN’s 15th anniversary, celebrates “History”. [sic]

- Awards will be presented in a record 106 categories over a two night period.

- The adult industry released nearly 8,000 adult releases [sic] in 1997, including over 4,000 “new” releases (non-compilation). AVN reviewed every new release in every categroy [sic] this past year, logging over 30,000 sex scenes.3

- By comparison, last year there were approximately 375 films eligible for the Academy Awards that these voters [sic—meaning different voters from the AVN voters, presumably] were required to see. AVN had to watch more than 10 times the amount of releases in order to develop these nominations [usage and repetition sic, though 4,000 divided by 375 is indeed over 10].

From the acceptance speech of Mr. Tom Byron, Saturday, 10 January 1998, Caesars Forum ballroom, Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino complex, Las Vegas NV, upon winning AVN’s 1998 Male Performer of the Year Award (and with no little feeling): “I want to thank every beautiful woman I ever put my cock inside.” [Laughter, cheers, ovation.]

From the acceptance speech of Ms. Jeanna Fine, ibid., upon winning AVN’s 1998 Best Supporting Actress Award for her role in Rob Black’s Miscreants: “Jesus, which one is this for, Miscreants? Jesus, that’s another one where I read the script and said ‘Oh shit, I am going to go to hell. [Laughter, cheers.] But that’s okay, ’cause all my friends’ll be there too!” [Huge wave of laughter, cheers, applause.]

From the inter-Award banter of Mr. Bobby Slayton, professional comedian and master of ceremonies for the 1997 AVNAs: “I know I’m looking good, though, like younger, ’cause I started using this special Grecian Formula—every time I find a gray hair, I fuck my wife in the ass. [No laughter, scattered groans.] Fuck you. That’s a great joke. Fuck you.”

Bobby Slayton, a gravelly-voiced Dice Clay knockoff who kept introducing every female performer as “the woman I’m going to cut my dick off for,” and who astounded all the marginal print journalists in attendance with both his unfunniness and his resemblance to every apartment-complex coke dealer we’d ever met, is mercifully absent from the 1998 Awards gala. The ’98 emcee is one Robert Schimmel, alumnus of In Living Color and a Howard Stern regular. Schimmel looks like a depraved, deeply tan Wallace Shawn and is no less coarse than B. Slayton but a lot better. He does a pantomime of someone attempting intercourse with a Love Doll he’s been too lazy to blow up all the way. He contrasts the woeful paucity of his own ejaculate with the concussive orgasms of certain well-known male performers,4 comparing these men’s ejaculations to automatic lawn sprinklers and doing an eerie sonic impression of same. All of 1998’s marginal print journalists are together at Table 189 at the very back of the ballroom. Most of these reporters are from the sorts of men’s magazines that sit shrinkwrapped behind the cash registers of convenience stores, and they are a worldly and jaded crew indeed, but Schimmel gets a couple of them—whose noms de guerre are Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth—laughing so uproariously that people at the Anabolic Video table nearby keep looking over in annoyance. At one point during a routine on premature ejaculation, Dick Filth actually chokes on a California roll.

… But all this is Saturday night, the main event. And there are a whole lot of festivities preceding Saturday’s climax.

The adult industry is vulgar. Would anyone disagree? One of the AVN Awards’ categories is “Best Anal Themed Feature”; another is “Best Overall Marketing Campaign—Company Image.” Irresistible, a 1983 winner in several categories, has been spelled Irresistable in Adult Video News for fifteen straight years. The industry’s not only vulgar, it’s predictably vulgar. All the clichés are true. The typical porn producer really is the ugly little man with a bad toupee and a pinkie-ring the size of a Rolaids. The typical porn director really is the guy who uses the word class as a noun to mean refinement. The typical porn starlet really is the lady in Lycra eveningwear with tattoos all down her arms who’s both smoking and chewing gum while telling journalists how grateful she is to Wadcutter Productions Ltd. for footing her breast-enlargement bill. And meaning it. The whole AVN Awards weekend comprises what Mr. Dick Filth calls an Irony-Free Zone.

But of course we should keep in mind that vulgar has many dictionary definitions and that only a couple of these have to do w/ lewdness or bad taste. At root, vulgar just means popular on a mass scale. It is the semantic opposite of pretentious or snobby. It is humility with a comb-over. It is Nielsen ratings and Barnum’s axiom and the real bottom line. It is big, big business.

Thirty-four-year-old porn actor Cal Jammer killed himself in 1995. Starlets Shauna Grant, Nancy Kelly, Alex Jordan, and Savannah have all killed themselves in the last decade. Savannah and Jordan received AVN’s Best New Starlet awards in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Savannah killed herself after getting mildly disfigured in a car accident. Alex Jordan is famous for having addressed her suicide note to her pet bird. Crewman and performer Israel Gonzalez killed himself at a porn company warehouse in 1997.

An LA-based support group called PAW (=Protecting Adult Welfare) runs a 24-hour crisis line for people in the adult industry. A fundraiser for PAW was held at a Mission Hills CA bowling alley last November. It was a nude bowling tournament. Dozens of starlets agreed to take part. Two or three hundred adult-video fans showed up and paid to watch them bowl naked. No production companies or their executives participated or gave money. The fundraiser took in $6,000, which is slightly less than two one-millionths of porn’s yearly gross.

As you know if you’ve seen Casino, Showgirls, Bugsy, etc., there are really three Las Vegases. Binion’s, where the World Series of Poker is always played, exemplifies the “Old Vegas,” centered around Fremont Street. Las Vegas’s future is even now under late-stage construction at the very end of the Strip, on the outskirts of town (where US malls always go up); it’s to be a bunch of theme-parkish, more “family-oriented” venues of the kind that De Niro describes so plangently at the end of Casino.

But Las Vegas as most of us see it, Vegas qua Vegas, comprises the dozen or so hotels that flank the Strip’s middle. Vegas Populi: the opulent, intricate, garish, ecstatically decadent hotels, cathedra to gambling, partying, and live entertainment of the most microphone- swinging sort. The Sands. The Sahara. The Stardust. MGM Grand, Maxim. All within a small radius. Yearly utility expenditures on neon well into seven figures. Harrah’s, Casino Royale (with its big 24-hour Denny’s attached), Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace. The Mirage, with its huge laddered waterfall always lit up. Circus Circus. Treasure Island, with its intricate facade of decks and rigging and mizzens and vang. The Luxor, shaped like a ziggurat from Babylon of yore. Barbary Coast, whose sign out front says CASH YOUR PAYCHECK—WIN UP TO $25,000. These hotels are the Vegas we know. The land of Lola and Wayne. Of Siegfried and Roy, Copperfield. Showgirls in towering headdress. Sinatra’s sandbox. Most of them built in the ’50s and ’60s, the era of mob chic and entertainment-cum-industry. Half-hour lines for taxis. Smoking not just allowed but encouraged. Toupees and convention nametags and women in furs of all hue. A museum that features the World’s Biggest Coke Bottle. The Harley-Davidson Cafe, with its tympanum of huge protruding hawg; Bally’s H&C, with its row of phallic pillars all electrified and blinking in grand mal sync. A city that pretends to be nothing but what it is, an enormous machine of exchange—of spectacle for money, of sensation for money, of money for more money, of pleasure for whatever be tomorrow’s abstract cost.

Nor let us forget Vegas’s synecdoche and beating heart. It’s kittycorner from Bally’s: Caesars Palace. The granddaddy. As big as 20 Wal-Marts end to end. Real marble and fake marble, carpeting you can pass out on without contusion, 130,000 square feet of casino alone. Domed ceilings, clerestories, barrel vaults. In Caesars Palace is America conceived as a new kind of Rome: conqueror of its own people. An empire of Self. It’s breathtaking. The winter’s light rain makes all the neon bleed. The whole thing is almost too pretty to stand. There could be no site but Las Vegas’s Caesars for modern porn’s Awards show—here, the AAVNAs are one more spectacle. Way more tourists and conventioneers recognize the starlets than you’d expect. Double-takes all over the hotel. Even just standing around or putting coins in a slot machine, the performers become a prime attraction. Las Vegas doesn’t miss a trick.

The Annual AVN Awards are always scheduled to coincide with the International Consumer Electronics Show (a.k.a. CES), which this year runs from 8 through 11 January. The CES is a very big deal. It’s like a combination convention and talent show for the best and brightest in the world of consumer tech. Steve Forbes is here, and DSS’s Thomson. Sun Microsystems is using this year’s CES to launch its PersonalJava 1.0. Bill Gates gives a packed-house speech on Saturday morning. Major players from TV, cable, and merchandising host a panel on the short-term viability of HDTV. A forum on the problem of product returns by disgruntled customers seats 1,500 and is SRO. The CES as a whole is bigger than your correspondents’ hometowns. It’s spread out over four different hotels and has 10,000+ booths with everything from “The First Ever Full Text Message Pager in a Wristwatch” to the world’s premier self-heating home satellite dish (“The Snow and Ice Solution!”).

But far and away the CES’s most popular venue, with total attendance well over 100,000 every year, is what is called the Adult Software5 exhibition, despite the fact that the CES itself treats the Adult tradeshow kind of like the crazy relative in the family and keeps it way out in what used to be the parking garage of the Sands hotel. This facility, a serious bus ride from all the other CES sites, is an enormous windowless all-cement space that during show hours manages to induce both agoraphobia and claustrophobia. A big sign says you have to be 21 to get in. The median age inside is 45, almost all males, nearly everyone wearing some sort of conventioneer’s nametag. Every production company in the adult industry, from Anabolic to Zane, has a booth here. The really big companies have booths that are sprawling and multidisplay and more like small strip malls. A lot of porn’s top female performers are contract players, exclusive vendors to one particular production company; and one reason why a lot of the starlets seem kind of tired and cranky by Saturday night’s Awards gala is that they will have spent much of the previous 72 hours at their companies’ CES booths, on their feet all day in vertiginous heels, signing autographs and posing for pictures and pressing all manner of flesh.

The best way to describe the sonic environment at the ’98 CES is: Imagine that the apocalypse took the form of a cocktail party. Male fans move through the fractal maze of booths in groups of three or more. Their expressions tend to be those of junior-high boys at a peephole, an expression that looks pretty surreal on a face with jowls and no hairline. Some among them are video retailers; most are not. Most are just hard-core fans, the industry’s breath and bread. A lot of them not only recognize but seem to know the names, stage names, and curricula vitae of almost all the female performers.

It takes an average of two hours and twelve minutes to traverse the Adult CES expo, counting an average of four delays for getting lost after a chicane turn or some baroque ceiling-high cheval glass designed to double the visual exposure of Heatwave Video’s display for Texas Dildo Masquerade gets you all turned around. Your correspondents are accompanied by Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, who have very generously offered to act as guides and docents, and here is a random spatter of the things we see the first time we come in:

A second-tier Arrow Video starlet in a G-string poses for a photo, forked dorsally over the knee of a morbidly obese cellphone retailer from suburban Philadelphia. The guy taking the picture, whose CES nametag says Hi and that his name is Sherm, addresses the starlet as “babe” and asks her to readjust so as to “give us a little more bush down there.” An Elegant Angel starlet with polyresin wings attached to her back is eating a Milky Way bar while she signs video boxes. Actor Steven St. Croix is standing near the Caballero Home Video booth, saying to no one in particular “Let me out of here, I can’t wait to get out of here.”6 Adult-video stores all have a distinctive smell—a mix of cheap magnetic tape and disinfectant—and the Sands’ former parking garage is rank with it. Asian businessmen move through the aisles in dense graceful packs and are assiduously cheery and polite. A young guy in a full-color Frankenstein T-shirt is spraypainting cartoon flames on an actress’s breasts at the Sin City booth. The actress—an obscure one, not even Filth and Hecuba know her name—has normal-size breasts, and there’s not much of an audience. Producer/director Max Hardcore draws a way bigger crowd at the MAXWORLD booth, where one of his girls is squatting on the countertop masturbating with the butt of a riding crop. Max’s videos’ promotional posters have him carrying a girl in minishorts over his shoulder against the backdrop of various city skylines; the pitches at the bottom say “SEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL! SEE CUM-SPLATTERED GIRLS TOO STUPID TO KNOW BETTER!” Max is a story all to himself, according to Harold Hecuba. D. Filth and a porn executive dressed entirely in Campbell Nightwatch plaid are smoking cigars and keep holding their cigars up together and comparing the ash to see which one has the cleanest burn. A lot of the industry males and even some of the starlets are also smoking cigars. 1998 is definitely the Year of the Cigar. The starlets are all in either extremely formal cocktail dresses or else abbreviated latex/vinyl/ Lycra ensembles. Heels are uniformly sharp and ultrahigh. Some of the starlets are so heavily made up they look embalmed. They tend to have complexly coiffed hair that looks really good from 20 feet away but on closer inspection is dry and dead. Someone who is either sometime-performer Jeff Marton or “Bizarro-Sleaze” filmmaker Gregory Dark is doing sleight-of-hand tricks with his trademark fedora.7 Whoever he is, he has a goatee. Harold Hecuba also has a goatee; Dick Filth has more like a soul patch. H.H. and D.F., longtime industry journalists, know everybody here and keep getting stopped and drawn into conversations. (These delays, during which yr. corresps. sort of stand there awkwardly at the edge of the conversation and try to look around as if they too know people here and are waiting only to spot them in the crowd before they go off and get into their own involved conversations, have not been included in the 132-minute Adult CES-traversal average.) This year, a good 75 percent of the males in and around the porn industry appear to be sporting variants of the goatee.8

Next to the Outlaw Video booth, a starlet in a gold lamé spaghetti-strap gown, chewing gum and blowing large blue bubbles, is being videotaped by a disabled fan whose camera and parabolic mike are bolted to the arm of his wheelchair; the starlet is pointing to the tattoos on her left arm and appears to be explaining the origin and context of each one. At the Vivid Video multibooth complex,9 Ms. Taylor Hayes has what is probably the longest autograph-and-flesh-press line in the entire Sands garage. Taylor is major-league pretty—she looks like a slightly debauched Cindy Crawford—and an oversize monitor suspended from the ceiling over the Vivid area plays clips of her scantily clad and dancing amid dry-ice fumes. There’s a berm of boxed videos on the floor by the counter and a huge man with a visor and handheld credit card machine on Taylor’s right flank as she greets each fan like a long-lost relative. According to Dick Filth, Taylor is both a genuinely nice person and a consummate pro.

The booth for XPlor Media—a company known for its “Southern Belles” video series and ORGY FOR WORLD PEACE Website—is arresting because all the execs at XPlor seem to be under 25 and the booth’s atmosphere is that of a fraternity party in its third straight day. One young bald guy is unconscious in a fetal position on the counter, and some wag has glued all sorts of feathers and flaccid plastic two-headed dildoish things to his skull. XPlor’s owner-auteurs are two brothers, trust-fund babies from a Connecticut suburb of NYC. Their names are Farrel and Moffitt Timlake. Farrel, who wears twelve-hole Doc Martens and cargo pants and what’s either a very light parka or very heavy sweatshirt with a hood that stays up at all times, is a particular cause célèbre at the ’98 CES because he’s apparently a friend of the two guys who do South Park, and these guys are rumored to be in Vegas and to possess tickets to Saturday’s Awards banquet.10

Everyone without exception is sweating. At all but a few of the booths, contract starlets treat the fans with the same absent, rigid-faced courtesy that flight attendants and restaurant hostesses tend to use. You can tell how bored the performers are by the way their faces light up when they see someone they know. Well over half of the industry’s current superstars are in this huge room.11 The infamous T.T. Boy is here, standing alone with his trademark glower, the Boy who is rumored to bring a semiautomatic pistol with him to the set and who was featured in a 1995 New Yorker article that was full of lines like “A porn shoot is an intricately delineated ecology.” Mr. Vince Vouyer (sic) is on hand, as are Seth Gecko, Jake Steed, Serenity, Missy, and Nick East. Here is the ageless Randy West, who looks just the way a surfer would look if that surfer were also a Mob enforcer, with his perennial tan and hair like frozen surf. Mr. Jon Dough—winner of AVN’s coveted Best Actor/Video statuette in both ’96 and ’97—alternates between various booths, wearing his customary expression of having psychologically evolved to the point where he’s so incredibly cool and detached that life is one long yawn. Here also is Mark Davis, far and away the most handsome of the current males, a near-double for Gregory Harrison of the old Trapper John series except for Davis’s ultrashort psych-patient haircut (plus goatee).

And 20-year veteran Joey Silvera is at this year’s CES, though mostly in his capacity as an auteur: Silvera now directs Evil Angel’s popular “Butt Row” video series.12 Following the lead of pioneers like John Leslie and Paul Thomas, most of today’s top male stars now also direct (and, per the store boxes, “Present”) their own line of videos, e.g. “Tom Byron’s Cumback Pussy” series, “Jon Dough’s Dirty Stories,” the eye-popping Rocco Siffredi’s “[Various European Cities] By Night” line, etc. The So-and-So Presents series seems to be an industry trend, like cigars and goatees.

It is difficult to describe how it feels to gaze at living human beings whom you’ve seen perform in hard-core porn. To shake the hand of a man whose precise erectile size, angle, and vasculature are known to you. That strange I-think-we’ve-met-before sensation one feels upon seeing any celebrity in the flesh is here both intensified and twisted. It feels intensely twisted to see reigning industry queen Jenna Jameson chilling out at the Vivid booth in Jordaches and a latex bustier and to know already that she has a tattoo of a sundered valentine with the tagline HEART BREAKER on her right buttock and a tiny hairless mole just left of her anus. To watch Peter North try to get a cigar lit and to have that sight backlit by memories of his artilleryesque ejaculations.13 To have seen these strangers’ faces in orgasm—that most unguarded and purely neural of expressions, the one so vulnerable that for centuries you basically had to marry a person to get to see it.14 This weirdness may account for some of the complex emotional intercourse taking place between the performers and fans at the Adult CES. The patrons may leer and elbow one another at a distance, but by the time the men get to the front of the line and face the living incarnation of their VCR’s fantasy-babe, most of them turn into quivering goggle-eyed schoolboys, sheepish and salivaless and damp. The same thing evidently happens at the hundreds of strip clubs all over the country where porn starlets appear as Featured Dancers (for five figures a week, according to Filth) and do photos and autographs after the show:

“Most of these guys become incredibly nervous when I come up to them,” veteran starlet Shane has explained. “I’ll put my arms around a guy and his whole body will be trembling. They pretty much do whatever I tell them to do.” The whole industry, now, has this oddly reversed equation—the consumers are the ones who seem ashamed or shy, while the performers are cocky and smooth and 100 percent pro.
It is no longer the 1980s, and the Meese Commission mentality that led to a major crackdown on video porn is long gone. Federal task forces and PTA outrage are now focused on the Internet and kiddie porn. But today’s adult industry is still hypersensitive about what it perceives as fascist attacks on its First Amendment freedoms. A specially prepared trailer now runs before many higher-end adult videos, right between the legal disclaimer on the product’s compliance with or exemption from 18 U.S.C §2257 and ads for phone services like 900-666-FUCK. Against shots of flowing flags and the Lincoln Memorial, a voiceover says stuff like:

Censorship goes against our Bill of Rights and the founding principles of this country. It is an attempt on the part of the government to legislate morality and to stifle free expression.15 This new, “legal” morality is dangerous to all Americans. Vote for those who believe in limiting government intrusion into your personal affairs. Vote against government control of your life and home. Vote against censorship. Only you, the People, can keep the American ideal intact.

These trailers always say they’re sponsored by either the Adult Video Association or something called the Free Speech Coalition. Both organizations (and the extent to which the two are separate is unclear) are basically industry PACs. Porn, in other words, has taken the political lessons of the ’80s to heart; it is now a hard-lobbying political force no less than GM or RJR Nabisco.

Feminists of all different stripe oppose the adult industry for reasons having to do with pornography’s putative effects on women. Their arguments are well-known and in some respects persuasive. But certain antiporn arguments in the 1990s are now centered on adult entertainment’s alleged effects on the men who consume it. Some “masculists” believe that a lot of men get addicted to video porn in a way that causes grievous psychic harm. Example: An essayist named David Mura has a little book called A Male Grief: Notes on Pornography and Addiction, which is a bit New Agey but interesting in places, e.g.:

At the essence of pornography is the image of flesh used as a drug, a way of numbing psychic pain. But this drug lasts only as long as the man stares at the image… . In pornographic perception, each gesture, each word, each image, is read first and foremost through sexuality. Love or tenderness, pity or compassion, become subsumed by, and are made subservient to, a “greater” deity, a more powerful force… . The addict to pornography desires to be blinded, to live in a dream. Those in the thrall of pornography try to eliminate from their consciousness the world outside pornography, and this includes everything from their family and friends or last Sunday’s sermon to the political situation in the Middle East. In engaging in such elimination the viewer reduces himself. He becomes stupid.

This kind of stuff might sound a little out-there, maybe, until one observes the eerie similarity between the eyes of males in strip clubs or stroke parlors and the eyes of people in their fifth hour of pumping silver dollars into the slot machines of the Sands’ casino, or maybe until one’s seen firsthand the odd kind of shock on the faces of CES patrons seeing performers now “in the flesh,” complete with chewing gum and chin-pimples and all the human stuff you never see—never want to see—in films.

Maybe just a little bit more here on the whole scene at the Adult CES, which is a lot more of a rub-elbows-type venue than the stylized Awards ceremony is going to end up being… . Mr. Harold Hecuba is deep in conversation with a marginal porn producer about one of his performers’ being sidelined with something called a “prolapsed sphincter,” which condition yr. corresps. decline to follow up on in any way. We are standing just west of a staff writer for Digital Horizons who’s dropped by to scope out the legendary scene in here again this year and is telling two presumed other tech writers that being around porn people always makes him feel like he’s been somehow astrally projected onto a cocktail napkin. It is also roughly now that Ms. Jasmin St. Claire is making an appearance at the Impressive Media booth in order to spell the starlet behind the counter, who is limping to the booth’s rear area; she (i.e., the limping starlet) has (reportedly) had to be sprayed with silicon to fit into her pants. The crowd at the Impressive Media venue immediately starts to enlarge. Jasmin St. Claire is wearing a red vinyl jacket-and-miniskirt ensemble. A porn starlet entering any kind of room or area has a distinctive energy about her—you turn your head to look even if you don’t seem to want to. It’s like watching a figure from a pinball machine illustration or high-concept comic book step out into 3-D and head your way. It turns out really to be possible to feel as though your eyeballs are protruding slightly from their sockets. What makes the whole thing so weird is that Jasmin St. Claire isn’t even all that pretty, at least not today. Her hair is dyed black in that cheap unreal Goth way, and she is so incredibly heavily made up that she looks like a crow. (She is also somewhat knock-kneed, plus of course has the requisite Howitzer-grade bust.) Ms. St. Claire is being escorted to the Impressive booth by two large men whose expressions are describable only as mug-shottish. This is another thing about porn starlets—they’re never alone. They’re always accompanied by at least one and sometimes as many as four flinty-eyed males. The impression is that of a very expensive thoroughbred being led onto the track under a silk blanket.

FYI, Ms. Jasmin St. Claire’s cult-celebrity status at the ’98 CES stems from her having broken the “World Gang Bang Record”16 by taking on 300 men in a row in Amazing Pictures’ 1996 World’s Biggest Gang Bang 2. Since most of these 300 men were amateur porn-fans who’d had only to fill out an application and produce an HIV all-clear from the DPH, she now enjoys an almost legendary populist appeal—“the People’s Porn Star”—and an enormous serpentine line of fans with cameras and autographable memorabilia has formed at the Impressive booth, which line Ms. St. Claire appears for the moment to be ignoring, because she and H. Hecuba, having exchanged double-cheek kisses, are now deep into some kind of tête-à-tête above the sockless Docksiders of the unconscious bald kid, who’s (the kid has) evidently been carried or trundled by pranksters unknown from the XPlor counter (right next door) to this one. Dick Filth—after your correspondents have remarked on how it’s kind of heartwarming that everyone in the porn industry all seem to be friends, even critics and performers—dishes an involved anecdote about how Jasmin St. Claire apparently once actually tried to strangle Harold Hecuba at an industry soirée a couple years ago, an anecdote which, if you’re interested, appears as FN17 just below. Twenty feet away, over at XPlor, Mr. Farrel Timlake has meanwhile produced what is alleged to be the prototype and world’s only authorized Kenny® Action Figure from the upcoming South Park merchandising line—fourteen inches tall, kind of heavy for a doll, w/ hood up and face obscured (not unlike F. Timlake’s own hood and face)—and is entertaining some of the IM crowd’s spillover by manipulating the doll’s limbs to simulate its “tok[ing] a bone.”

Not unlike urban gangs, police, carnival workers, and certain other culturally marginalized guilds, the US porn industry is occluded and insular in a way that makes it seem like high school. There are cliques, anticliques, alliances, betrayals, conflagratory rumors, legendary enmities, and public bloodlettings, plus involved hierarchies of popularity and influence. You’re either In or you’re not. Performers, being the industry’s fissile core, are of course In. Despite their financial power, studio execs and producers are not very In, and directors (especially those who’ve never undergone the initiation of having on-camera sex themselves) are less In than the performers. Film reviewers and industry journalists are even less In than execs; and nonindustry journalists are way, way non-In, almost as low-caste as the great mass of porn fans themselves (for which fans the Insider term is: mook18 ).

The foregoing is meant to help explain how exactly your correspondents ended up in porn titan Max Hardcore’s personal suite at the Sahara and got to hang out in the suite’s living room with Max, certain of his crew, porn starlets Alex Dane and Caressa Savage, and two B-girls—which is to say that it was actually Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth who were invited to hang out in the suite on Friday afternoon, but yr. corresps. clung almost like papooses to their backs, and the burly MAXWORLD Production Assistant wasn’t quick enough about slamming the door.
So yr. corresps. were, for a couple hours, at least logistically speaking, In.

For a regular civilian male, hanging out in a hotel suite with porn starlets is a tense and emotionally convolved affair. There is, first, the matter of having seen the various intimate activities and anatomical parts of these starlets in videos heretofore and thus (weirdly) feeling shy about meeting them. But there is also a complex erotic tension. Because porn films’ worlds are so sexualized, with everybody seemingly teetering right on the edge of coitus all the time and it taking only the slightest nudge or excuse—a stalled elevator, an unlocked door, a cocked eyebrow, a firm handshake—to send everyone tumbling into a tangled mass of limbs and orifices, there’s a bizarre unconscious expectation/dread/ hope that this is what might happen in Max Hardcore’s hotel room. Yr. corresps. here find it impossible to overemphasize the fact that this is a delusion. In fact, of course, the unconscious expectation/dread/hope makes no more sense than it would make to be hanging out with doctors at a medical convention and to expect that at the slightest provocation everyone in the room would tumble into a frenzy of MRIs and epidurals. Nevertheless the tension persists, despite the fact that the actresses are obviously tired and disassociated from the day’s CES,19 plus, it emerges, somewhat sore—it turns out that Max Hardcore is shooting one of his “Gonzo” porn spectaculars right here at the 1998 Consumer Electronics Show, using the CES as a hook and backdrop, and the girls have been alternating CES booth-duty and riding-crop shenanigans with a tight and SS-intensive filming schedule. (Max, being a firm believer in the fait accompli method of filmmaking, has not yet gotten around to chatting with the CES’s administration about his featuring the world’s biggest consumer-tech tradeshow by name in a “SEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL” video.)

Mr. Max Hardcore—a.k.a. Max Steiner, a.k.a. Paul Steiner, né Paul Little—is 5'6"" and a very fit 135. He is somewhere between 40 and 60 years old and resembles more than anything a mesomorphic and borderline-psycho Henry Gibson. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and what has to be one of the very few long-sleeved Hawaiian shirts in existence anywhere. Once the PA guarding the door mellows out and introductions are made (H.H. managing to drop the name of this magazine several times in one sentence), Max reveals himself to be a genial and garrulous host and offers everybody disposable plastic cups of vodka before settling in with yr. corresps. to discuss what for Max are the most pressing and relevant issues at this year’s AVN Awards, which issues are the career, reputation, personal history, and overall life philosophy of Mr. Max Hardcore.

Pioneered (depending whom you talk to) by either Max Hardcore or John (“Buttman”) Stagliano, “Gonzo” has become one of this decade’s most popular and profitable genres of adult video. It’s more or less a cross between an MTV documentary and the Hell panel from Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights. A Gonzo film is always set at some distinctive locale or occasion—Daytona Beach at spring break, the Cannes Film Festival, etc. There’s always a randy and salivous “host” talking directly to a handheld camera: “Well and we’re here at the Cannes Film Festival, and it looks like there’s going to be lots of excitement, John Travolta and Sigourney Weaver are supposed to both be in town, and there’s also the world-famous beach, and I’m told there’s always some real seriously good-looking little girls at the beach, so let’s us head on down.” (That’s the approximate lead-in to a recent Max-at-Cannes Gonzo, a type of signature lead-in that Max refers to with a 56-tooth grin as “always mercifully brief”—and please note the “little girls at the beach” thing, because this is another of Max’s professional signatures, the infantilization of his videos’ females as dramatic foils for his own film persona, which is always that of a sort of degenerate uncle or stepdad.) Then the shaky but ever-focused camera heads on down to the ocean or mall or CES or whatever, scoping out attractive women20 while the host moans and chews his knuckle in lust. Then pretty soon host and camera start actually coming up to the women they’ve been looking at and engaging them in little cameo “interviews” full of sideways leers and salacious entendres. Some of the interviewees are actual civilians, but some are always what Max refers to as “ringers,” meaning professional porn actresses. And so the viewer is treated to the classic frathouse fantasy of moving, via just a couple of singles-bar “Hey there babe” lines, from scoping out an attractive woman to having wild and anatomically diverse sex with her, all while one of his buddies captures the whole thing on tape.21

The issue of who exactly invented Gonzo being impossibly vexed and so notwithstanding, it is true that Max Hardcore is famous as a director for several things: (1) Being incredibly disciplined about budgets and tactical logistics, right down to forcing his crew and staff to wear identical jumpsuits of scarlet nylon so that they look like a national ski team—Max’s shoots are described (by Max) as “almost military operations”; (2) Not only employing ringers but actually sometimes being able to talk real live civilian “little girls” on the beach or in the mall into coming on back to the special MAXWORLD RV and having anal sex on camera;22 (3) Being the first in “mainstream” (meaning nonfetish) adult video to perpetrate on women levels of violation and degradation that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. W/r/t item (3), Max, after detailing for yr. correspondents the vo- and avocations that led him into the adult industry (a tale too literally incredible even to think about factchecking and trying to print), informs us that he is and always has been adult video’s “cutting-edge blade,” and that other less bold and original filmmakers have systematically stolen and used his, Max’s, degradations of women as a blueprint for their own subsequent shabby and derivative films’ degradations.23 (Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, by the way, have heard Max hold forth many times before and are now outside the circle of discourse—D.F. in the bathroom for what seems like a peculiarly long time, H.H. on the couch with the actresses hashing out the implications of Seinfeld’s retirement for NBC’s ’98 lineup.)

Alone and in a place of conspicuous honor on a wood-finish shelf above the suite’s minibar is an actual AVN Awards statuette. The trophy resembles an Oscar/Emmy/Clio except that the figurine’s arms are up and out (making it also look a bit like Richard Nixon at the climax of the ’68 GOP convention), and something slightly blurry about the casting gives it a sort of cubic-zirconium aspect. Whether the statuette is heavy and solid vs. hollow and Little Leaguish remains unknown—there is no invitation to touch or heft it. One of the B-girls on the couch is now either laughing or weeping into her hands at something Harold Hecuba has said; her bare shoulders heave. It would be totally fantastic if the Seinfeld rerun on the huge TV were the episode about everybody trying to refrain from masturbating, but it isn’t.

Asked by one of yr. corresps. what he won this AVN Award on the shelf for, Max Hardcore slaps his knee: “I fucking stole it.” It’s now that hard middle-distance inspection reveals that the MAX HARDCORE on the metal strip at the trophy’s base has been scratched in by someone who is not a professional engraver. It looks done with a screwdriver, in fact. Max expands on the statuette caper: Shut inexplicably out of the Awards for years, he last year, upon exiting the stage (he’s always a presenter every year, which he regards as the AVNAs’ way of twisting the emotional blade), espied in the wings a large cardboard box filled with blank and unused AVN Award statuettes.24 Whereupon he thought, as he now puts it, “What the fuck, I fucking deserve it” and snagged one, hiding it in his enormous Stetson and deriving no little satisfaction from attending various post-Awards parties with an illicit statuette under his hat. Max’s crew all laugh very hard at this anecdote, though the actresses don’t.

Alex Dane is now telling Harold Hecuba about a stray dog she found and has decided to keep. She is excited as she describes the dog and for a moment seems about fourteen; the impression lasts only a second or two and is heartbreaking. One of the B-girls, meanwhile, is explaining that she has just gotten a pair of cutting-edge breast implants that she can actually adjust the size of by adding or draining fluid via small valves under her armpits, and then—perhaps mistaking your correspondents’ expressions for ones of disbelief—she raises her arms to display the valves. There really are what appear to be valves.

So much about today’s adult industry seems like an undeft parody of Hollywood and the nation writ large. The top performers are comic-book caricatures of sexual allure. The prosthetic breasts and lifted buttocks and (no kidding) artificial cheekbones are nothing more than accentuations of a mentality that yields huge liposuction and collagen industries. The gynecologically explicit sexuality of Jenna, Jasmin, et al. seems more than anything like a Mad magazine spoof of the “smoldering” sexuality of Sharon Stone and Madonna and so many other mainstream iconettes.25 Not to mention the fact that the adult industry takes many of the psychological deformities that Hollywood is famous for—the vanity, the vulgarity, the rank commercialism—and not only makes them overt and grotesque but seems then to revel in that grotesquerie.

Good old Max Hardcore, for instance, is a total psychopath—that’s part of his on-screen Gonzo persona—but so is the real Max/Paul Steiner. You’d almost have to have been there in that suite. Max sits holding court in his hat and pointy boots, looking at once magisterial and mindless, while his red-suited acolytes laugh on cue and a jr. high dropout shows off her valves. In truth, the first ten minutes of the impromptu interview in the Sahara are spent passing around a copy of something called Icon magazine, which Max has told us is doing a profile on him—we are expected to leaf through the magazine and comment favorably on its content and layout while Max watches us in the same hyperexpectant way that parents watch you when you’re looking at a snapshot of their kid that they’ve taken out uninvited and pressed on you. This is the actual chronology. There then follows a torrent of autobiography and background that yr. corresps. have decided to deny Max the satisfaction of seeing reproduced here. After which is a kind of Max 101-like survey of personal philosophy and Gonzo theory and the statuette anecdote. The vodka is top-shelf and the plastic cups dusty. Then one of the starlets decides that she’s hungry, and Max insists on escorting her down to the Sahara’s restaurant and wants everybody else to come along, which eventually results in the B-girls and crewmen and yr. corresps.26 all standing there awkwardly at the maître d’s podium while Max personally conducts the starlet to her table and pulls out her chair and tucks a serviette into her cleavage and pulls out a platinum-plated money clip and announces in a voice audible to everyone in the restaurant and foyer that he “want[s] to take care of the little girl’s damages in advance” and shoves bills into the hanky-pocket of the maître d’s tuxedo and then leaves her there by herself and herds us all back out and into the elevator and jabs impatiently at the button for his suite’s floor, almost jumping up and down with fury at the elevator’s delay; and we’re all rushed back up to the suite because it’s occurred to Max that he wants to show your corresps. something from this week’s filming that he thinks will sum up his particular porn genius better than any amount of exposition could … and then, reseated, he starts flipping through a notebook to find something.

“What it is is we got this one little girl back in the [infamous MAXWORLD] trailer, and after some face-fucking27 and reaming her asshole and, like, your standard depravities, we get her to stick a pen—no, a what-do-you-call …”

Crewman: “Magic Marker.”

Max: “… Magic Marker, stick it up her asshole and write all this … this stuff,” holding up the notebook, opened to a page; again he has us pass it around:

is thereon written in a hand28 that seems impressively legible, considering. Dick Filth makes a waggish inquiry about future film plans involving this girl and a typewriter, but Max doesn’t laugh (we noticed that Max never laughs at a joke he hasn’t told), and so neither does anyone else.

Doubtless most of this is going to get cut by Premiere, but it’s worth also observing—when this magazine’s assigned photographer (who’s also gotten in here with us this afternoon on H.H. and D.F.’s coattails) begins wondering aloud about the possibility of getting some good portraits at the Awards of winners holding their statuettes—the way Max right away jumps in with his idea of the perfect photo for the title page of this very article. The proposed shot is to be of Max Hardcore, holding several of the AVN Awards trophies he pledges either to win straight up or to gain possession of in other ways, seated in some kind of imperial-looking and really nice chair that is itself set up on the palm-studded boulevard of the famous Las Vegas Strip—so the photographer’ll get lots of smeary neon and appropriately phallic bldgs. in the background—with a retinue of scantily clad starlets either draped swoonily over him or prostrate at his feet, or both. It is important to note that there are no audible scare-quotes, no irony or embarrassment or self-awareness of any sort on Max’s face as he sketches this photo’s tableau for us; he’s in the kind of earnest that one imagines Irving Thalberg was always in.29 Your correspondents immediately begin to lobby hard for Max’s idea, figuring that the photo would make a great illustration for the story of Max’s proposing this very photo—i.e., that it would point up the megalomania far more powerfully than mere reportage—but the Premiere photographer, who is no actor, does such a poor job of disguising his repulsion at Max’s self-regard that the atmosphere of the whole suite gets stilted and complexly hostile, and the rest of the interview is kind of a fizzle-yield, and overall Dick Filth said that we failed, in his phrase, to “penetrate to the core of the essence of what it is to be Max Hardcore.”30

The 15th Annual AVN Awards are actually split over two consecutive nights, a tactic that Max H. thought the legit Oscars would do well to emulate: “Get all the bullshit out of the way the first night—best packaging, marketing, best gay, shit like that. Who wants to sit through that shit?”

Held in a different, slightly smaller Caesars Palace ballroom, Friday’s Awards show is indeed brisk. The ephemeral categories include Best Videography, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Music. Each category’s nominees are listed in the program, but only the winners are announced onstage, and they’re announced four at a time, and applause is discouraged, and the master of ceremonies keeps telling the quartets of winners that “If you’ll come on up quickly and help keep things moving it’ll help us out a lot.” Friday’s only food is big wheels of vegetables and dip near the cash bar. The emcee is not headliner Robert Schimmel but a hypomanic guy named Dave Tyree, whose interpolated banter is 78 rpm and consists of stuff like “If God didn’t want us to jerk off he would’ve made our arms shorter.” There are maybe 1,000 people in attendance, most only slightly dressed up, and there are no assigned tables, and everybody in the ballroom is moving around and chattering and treating the onstage proceedings the way people in a cocktail lounge treat the piano player.

Q. $4,000,000,000 and 8,000 new releases a year—why is adult video so popular in this country?
A. Director and AVN-Hall-of-Fame inductee F. J. Lincoln: “It’s always a little funny how it’s called adult. What it really is, you get to be a kid again. You roll around and get dirty. It’s the adult sandbox.”
A. Veteran woodman Joey Silvera: “Dudes, let’s face it—America wants to jerk off.”
A. Industry journalist Harold Hecuba: “It’s the new Barnum. Nobody ever goes broke overestimating the rage and misogyny of the average American male.”
A. Porn starlet Jacklyn Lick: “I think a lot of fans are very lonely people.”
Q. There don’t seem to be a whole lot of condoms used in hard-core scenes.
A. Harold Hecuba: “Never have been. They’re viewed as a turn-off. This business is about engineering fantasies.”
Q. But even just venerially—all these anal shenanigans and everything. Is there much worry in the industry about HIV?
A. Harold Hecuba: “There’s not as much worry about AIDS now. Everybody gets tested on a schedule.”
Q. What about herpes?
A. H.H.: “I think it’s rampant.”

Last year’s Best-Sex-Scene-in-a-Film winner Vince Vouyer’s real name turns out to be John LaForme. Rhetorical Q.: How, if one’s real name was John LaForme, could that person possibly feel the need for a nom de guerre?

Mr. Tom Byron describes being able to tumesce and ejaculate more or less on demand as an exercise in “control, like meditation or surfing. It’s like a gymnast staying on the balance beam. You practice enough, you can do anything.”31

Former woodman and current auteur Paul Thomas was a member of the original Broadway cast of Jesus Christ Superstar.

The tall, crazed-looking, and ever-rampant Mike Horner, three-time Best Actor winner and a member of the AVN Hall of Fame,32 is actually a classically trained opera singer.

Deceased starlet Nancy Kelly’s real name was Kelly Van Dyke. She was the daughter of TV’s Jerry Van Dyke and so, of course, the niece of Dick.

Exotic rookie actress Midori, one of the nominees in the ’98 AVNAs’ Best New Starlet category, is the sister of ’80s pop star Jodi Whatley. Midori has stated publicly that she views upscale contemporary porn as a stepping-stone to a mainstream career, not unlike becoming Miss America or doing a couple seasons on SNL. Harold Hecuba characterizes Midori’s career strategy as “grievously ill-advised.”

Adult Video News VP and Executive Editor Gene Ross, presenting the aforementioned 1998 AVN Award for Best Director/Video to Miscreants’ Rob Black, will hail Mr. Black as “a guy who can take buttholes, midgets, and fried fish, and make a love story.”33

From The New Yorker’s 1995 article on the psychosexual plight of the adult industry’s woodman: “The Cal Jammers who are part of this feminization feel they have stormed the walls of female ornament to reclaim male prerogative, only to find themselves lost in a garden of gender irony.”

Mr. John “Buttman” Stagliano—CEO of Evil Angel Inc., a man described by US News & World Report as “the nation’s leading director of hard-core videos”—not only has publicly announced testing positive for HIV but has identified the infection’s vector as a transsexual prostitute in São Paulo with whom Stagliano had unprotected anal intercourse in 1995. He’s anxious that people not get the wrong idea: “I am not particularly interested in guys, but I am interested in dicks. Forbidden taboos lead to all sorts of neurotic behavior, which leads to me being fucked in the ass without a rubber.”

Are the AVN Awards possibly rigged? Max Hardcore (he of the purloined statuette, keep in mind) calls the Awards “a total conflict of interests.” After all, he explains, Adult Video News is heavily ad-dependent,34 and they’re under “pressure from the big hitters like Vivid and VCA to like, you know, give the nod.”

Ms. Ellen Thompson, AVN Associate Editor and an Awards judge who votes under the n.d.g. Ida Slapter:35 “We’ve heard this for years. I hear this complaining also goes on in the mainstream. I don’t like insulting anybody, but sometimes there’s sour grapes. What are we supposed to say? Vivid and VCA put out good product. We truly, honestly do vote fairly.”

Mr. Dick Filth: “The best perception, backed up by tons of anecdotal evidence, is that they are totally, totally fixed and rigged.”
Saturday’s the big night. The banquet, the onstage entertainment, the headline Awards. See & be seen. Gamblers and conventioneers and mooks of all ilk are massed at the Caesars cabstand to watch the starlets arrive. There are camcorders and flashbulbs but no paparazzi per se. Some of the performers come in limos, others in shiny penile sports cars; others seem to mysteriously just suddenly appear. There are even more starlets here than there were at the CES, and they are seriously dolled up. There are cerise halters and pear-colored Lycra bodysuits with open-toed pumps of burgundy suede. There are platinum lamé gowns slit all the way to the tenth rib. Bottoms less covered than shellacked look like they by all rights should have panty- or at least thong lines but do not have such lines. There are lime-green vinyl leotards and toile bellbottoms and fishscale bustiers and miniskirts the same texture and length as a tutu’s ruffle. Garter straps flash and Merry Widow bodices shade the interiors of translucent blouses. Several of the outfits defy very basic precepts of modern physics. Coiffures are towering and complex. The starlets are all on the arms of men, but none of these escorts are male porn performers. Average heel-height is 4""+. A loud-voiced civilian in the cabstand crowd actually utters the phrase “Va Va Voom,” which yr. correspondents had never before heard anywhere outside a Sinatra movie. Breasts are uniformly zeppelinesque and in various perilous stages of semiconfinement. Max Hardcore is under a Stetson the color of weak chocolate milk, and his adjustable B-girl—arrayed in a type of scarlet cowboy suit that’s mostly fringe—has inflated her breasts to what’s got to be maximum capacity.

Woodman-wise, black is clearly In at the 15th Annual AVNAs. A lot of the men are in black tuxedos and black ties and black dress shirts. One is wearing a paisley suit of either serge or some kind of upholstery material. Another has silver platform shoes and a silver vest w/ no shirt underneath. The XPlor boys are in Klein sweatshirts and urban-camouflage fatigues, and there’s a large contingent with them that may or may not include the South Park brain trust. A guy on the arm of Ms. Morgan Fairlane has an immense and razorous violet mohawk à la British punks of the late 1970s.

Inside the hotel, a kind of impromptu cocktail party forms in the broad marble hall outside Caesars Palace’s largest and reportedly classiest ballroom, which is called Caesars Forum. Burly casino staffers stand taking tickets and being very discouraging about anybody trying to bum-rush the show. The crush of bodies out here entails a degree of physical contact that CES mooks never even dreamed of. There are pockets of klieg-glare as cable TV reporters interview various performers about (sic:) the air of keen excitement in the air. Mysterious bundles of co-ax emerge from under the Forum doors and go all the way up the length of the hallway and disappear around the corner. A suspicion that we’d had all week but decided was unverifiable is now instantly verified when one of yr. corresps. gets accidentally shoved against a starlet and is jabbed in the side by her breasts and it hurts. A lot of people are holding drinks in plastic glasses and it’s unknown where they got them. The starlets take turns getting interviewed re atmospheric excitement while the woodmen all avoid the cameras like mafiosi. The TV lights are not doing anyone’s skin tone any good at all. In their all-black tuxes, several of the male Insiders—including e.g. John Leslie and Tony Tedeschi—are so pallid and sallow as to appear diseased. Mr. Nick East devotes a full 5.5 minutes of rapt concentration to the cuticle of his left thumb. A slight surprise is that a lot of the industry’s elite woodmen are short—5'6"", 5'7""36 —and most of their companions tower over them. Dick Filth confirms that the contemporary industry’s 5'6"" standard helps a prodigious male organ look even more prodigious on videotape, a medium that apparently does all kinds of strange things to perspective.

Tickets for Saturday’s main event are $195 per, in advance. It’s unclear whether any Insiders’ tickets are comped, but journalists pay full retail. Our tickets designate our table as #189. Twenty-five hundred tickets have been sold, and since it’s highly doubtful that anybody got past the flinty-eyed casino guys outside without a ticket, tonight’s attendance can confidently be fixed at 2,500.
The Caesars Forum ballroom itself is a huge L-shape with the stage at the—as it were—joint; thus half of the 15th Annual AVN Awards’ audience is geometrically invisible to the other half. This problem is addressed via six sail-sized video screens that hang from the ceiling at strategic points throughout the auditorium. During the nearly two hours37 between when the doors open and the Awards show actually starts, the screens alternate quick clips from porn classics38 (recall that the theme of the 15th AAVNAs is “The History of Adult”) with live shots of various people making their entrances and mugging for the remote cameras AVN has got circling the room.

Both Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth have come equipped with binoculars (H.H.’s in a very official-looking Audubon Society case), which seems mysterious until we all arrive at Table 189, which is at the very, very back of the ballroom’s L’s northern leg, hundreds of yards from even the nearest video screen. “They always put the print guys out in mookland,” Hecuba explains. This fact is unpleasant surprise #1. Unpleasant surprise #2 is the supper the $195 includes, which turns out to be buffet-steam-table-style and might best be described by inviting you to imagine a very cosmopolitan and multiethnic hospital cafeteria. 39 Several of the male Insiders, we now notice, have brought in their own picnic hampers.

Now moving w/ laden plate to a table near us is a man in a full-body leopardskin suit whose way of acknowledging people he knows is to point at them rather than wave at them. On his arm is a B-girl in a body stocking made of what appears to be a densely woven net. Two Astral Ocean Cinema contract starlets have on identical copper-colored beaded gowns with myriad lengthwise slits in the skirt parts’ fronts and backs and sides, so that as they walk to their table their upper halves look normal and their lower halves seem to be passing through an infinity of bead curtains. Obviously, the whole scene is overwhelming. The average American rarely gets to see aerobic legwarmers with 4"" spike heels. The Caesars Forum ceiling is the color of rancid meringue; it has 24 chandeliers that are designed to look like concentric opened fans but actually look more like labia or very well-organized fungus. Mr. Joey Buttafuoco is in the house, accompanying40 Al Goldstein of Screw, who is here to receive a Special AVN Achievement Award for His Lifelong Defense of the First Amendment. Black is so resoundingly In this year that even the starched linen napkins at everyone’s place settings are black. The wineglasses all have little frosted cameos of J. Caesar on them. Humorless men with walkie-talkies stand guard at each of the ballroom’s fire doors—apparently last year there were some problems with unauthorized Caesars Palace employees sneaking in to watch the gala. The video screens are now showing the climactic scene of Debbie Does Dallas, the one where the nebbishy little stand-in for all mooks everywhere finally has sex with Bambi Woods and then the screen flashes “NEXT?” The South Park boys are indeed in attendance, up at Table 37 w/ Farrel and the XPlor coterie. There are also rumors that Boogie Nights auteur Paul Thomas Anderson possesses a ticket to the gala and might show up.41

The closest thing to any kind of Insider table near ours is #182, which according to its black table-tent is reserved for Anabolic Video (not an industry force) and is currently occupied by a spiriferously coiffed and sullenly chewing Dina Jewel (who declines to return Harold Hecuba’s blown kiss) and her escort, a young fellow whom one can easily envision head-butting somebody in a mosh pit. D. Filth confides that this Anabolic guy is a close friend of woodman Vince Vouyer (again, sic), who himself is not up for many ’98 Awards because he spent a good part of the past year in court and/or detention for helping operate an escort service which authorities alleged was not a bona fide escort service at all.

It turns out that Hecuba and Filth have kept from yr. correspondents as unpleasant surprise #3 the single chintziest thing about the $195-a-head 15th AAVNAs banquet & gala: Beverages are not compris. And not just alcohol, either; even a lousy club soda w/ lime42 is $6.00. Worse, it turns out you can’t run any sort of tab—you have to pay the waiter in cash when you order the lousy club soda w/ lime, and he (theoretically) brings your change back with the beverage. Thus a separate and memory-intensive transaction is required for each drink that each of the six-to-eight persons at each of the appr. 375 tables in the auditorium might order, with additional complications if certain people are buying drinks for certain tablemates but not for certain other tablemates, etc.43 The whole unfree-drink situation is incredibly annoying, not only because of the outlandish ticket price but because the ballroom’s 100 percent Middle Eastern waiters (decent and hardworking fellows all, to be sure, who are taking some serious abuse about the pay-as-you-go beverage policy from mooks with cigars at the nearby tables, despite the fact that the waiters don’t make the rules and must surely find having to remember and make change for six to eight different customers per table a piercing pain in the ass44 ) have only rudimentary ESL skills and tend to confuse both drink orders and currency denominations. Dick Filth leans over and shouts: “Now you can maybe see why this is a multibillion-a-year industry—they’re tight as a duck’s butt!”45

The crowd lingers over hypersucrotic cake and coffee and $9.00 cordials and howls conversation at itself for 90 more minutes before the house lights dim and the 15th Annual AVN Awards gala starts. What follows thereon is a kaleidoscopic flux of stilted acceptances and blue one-liners and epileptic strobes and spotlights following winners’ serpentine and high five-studded paths to the stage, of everything from generic Awards Show schmaltz to moments of near-Periclean eloquence, as in e.g.:

“Fellow MENSA members and aficionados of Shakespeare!” intones Al Goldstein of Screw, 62 and obese and white-bearded and crazy-haired and dressed in a sportcoat whose lapels are two different primary colors, looking pretty much exactly like that one certain old guy in the neighborhood your mom warned you never to try to sell Cub Scout chocolate mints to, and glorying in a Special AVN Achievement Award he confesses to feeling he’s long deserved. “I want to thank my mother, who spread her legs and made all this possible.” Large sections of the crowd are on their feet—Goldstein is a porn icon. He was distributing NYC’s Screw on photostat when most of the people in this room were still playing with their toes. He’s been a First Amendment ninja. He drinks in the applause and loves it and is hard not to sort of almost actually like. He’s clearly an avatar of contemporary porn’s unabashedness, its modern Yeah-OK-I’m-Scum-but-Underneath-All-Your-Hypocrisy-So- Are-You-and-at-Least-I-Have-the-Guts-to-Admit-It-and-Have-a-Good-Time persona:

“I salute the women with eleven-IQs and the men with eleven-inch cocks. The real heroes are the cocks and pussies who fuck on-screen. They’re the real heroes.” Goldstein is less conducted than borne back to his seat.

This has followed Robert Schimmel’s intro and a 20-minute “Musical Salute to the History of Adult,” in which topless dancing girls do a medley of disco, new wave, and so on.46 The stage band is ragged and unevenly amplified, and they all have flared collars and tight perms—it’s like watching The Brady Bunch’s final season through borrowed binoculars. The stage is lit by autotrack spotlights whose colors alternate w/o discernible scheme.

The whole 15th AAVNAs Show lasts 3.5 hours and resembles nothing so much as an obscene and extremely well-funded high school assembly. The mix of garish self-congratulation47 and clumsy choreography is often so weird as to be endearing. There are never fewer than six presenters for each award, and they never seem to know whose turn it is to announce a nominee, and there are always a couple who don’t get close enough to the mike to be audible and a couple others who get too close to the mike and produce a jolt of feedback that sends people and cocktails flying out of chairs in the first rows of tables. Wicked Pictures’ Satyr, a multiple-category nominee, gets repeatedly pronounced “Satter.” Winners are supposed to exit stage-left after their acceptance speeches, but even people who’ve won and been through the process several times in recent years keep forgetting and trying to exit stage-right and colliding with the hostesses who are there to escort them leftward. Some presenters insert brief rote antidrug messages into their intros, while around them twitch and sniff other presenters—not many, but some—who are obviously coked to the gills.

Probably the most neutral and economical thing to say is that large parts of the ceremony are unintentionally funny. Winning woodmen extend earnest thanks to directors and execs for giving them “an opening” or “a shot” or “my big shot” and seem wholly unaware of the carnal entendres involved. Back at the journalists’ table with us is a 40ish woman in two-piece Armani who’s doing a spot on the Awards for ABC Radio; she spends most of the evening hunched over with her head in her hand and her tape recorder not even on. Dick Filth spends the show’s whole second hour trying to track down a waiter who owes him beverage change. AVN’s Gene Ross pays tribute to ’98’s Male Performer of the Year by saying: “You haven’t lived until you’ve seen Tom Byron’s wrinkled nuts on a seventy-inch TV screen.” Rob Black’s Miscreants keeps getting nominated in category after category, and time and again there’s a frantic caucus at the podium about the correct pronunciation of miscreant, complete with a couple of presenters audibly whispering what in the fuck is the word even supposed to mean.48

To be fair, some of the nominated products’ titles are genuinely confusing. Triple Penetration Debutante Sluts 4 is up for Most Outrageous Sex Scene—along with Wild Bananas on Butt Row and 87 and Still Bangin’—but loses out to a scene the Program entitles “Anal Food Express”49 from a video called My Girlfriend’s Girlfriend. Paul Thomas’s Bad Wives wins Best Film. Evil Angel’s Buda wins Best Shot-on-Video Feature. The Best Foreign Release statuette goes to something European called President By Day, Hooker By Night. Bad Wives also wins Best Actress/Film for Dyanna Lauren, Best Supporting Actress/Film for Melissa Hill, and Best Anal Sex Scene/Film50 for Lauren and Steven St. Croix. Best Compilation Tape honors go to The Voyeur’s Favorite Blow Jobs & Anals. David Cronenberg’s mainstream Crash comes out of absolutely nowhere to win something called Best Alternative Adult Feature Film. Ms. Stephanie Swift wins Best Actress/Video and tells the crowd: “Thanks, everybody. My gang bang was a blast.”51

Max Hardcore, to Table 189’s immense and unkind delight, doesn’t win one single thing.

An actor named Jim Buck wins AVN’s Gay Performer of the Year Award, and you better believe yr. corresps. sit bolt upright when the person who appears onstage to accept the award is a pink and leptosomatic 4'10"" and is wearing an Eton collar and appears, even under 125X binoculation, to be a twelve-year-old boy. And it turns out it is a twelve-year-old boy: It’s Jim Buck’s little brother. “Jim can’t be here tonight because he’s performing in a Shakespeare festival in New Orleans,” the little boy says (correspondential expressions of bug-eyed inquiry at Hecuba and Filth—Shakespeare festival? sending a prepubescent relative to collect your excellence-in-filmed-sodomy prize?—are met with bemused shrugs), “but I’m here to thank you on his behalf, and to say that I taught Jim everything he knows.” [Enormous audience laugh and ovation, single spasmodic shudder from hunched ABC Radio lady.]

A strange and traumatic experience which one of yr. corrs. will not even try to describe consists of standing at a men’s room urinal between professional woodmen Alex Sanders and Dave Hardman. Suffice it to say that the urge to look over/down at their penises is powerful and the motives behind this urge so complex as to cause anuresis (which in turn ups the trauma). Be informed that male porn stars create around themselves the exact same opaque affective privacy- bubble that all men at urinals everywhere create. The whole Caesars Forum’s men’s room’s urinal area is an angst festival; take it from us. The sink-and-mirror-and-towelette area, however, turns out to be a priceless mash of Insider jargon and shoptalk, all made extra-resonant by echolalic tile and a surfeit of six-dollar drinks. One performer-turned-auteur is telling a colleague about an exciting new project:

“Found this Russian, this chick like nineteen, can’t speak a word of English, which for this [ = for the exciting project] is perfect.”

“You going to get in there? Just for maybe like one scene?”

“Nah. That’s the whole point. I’m the director. This is my package now.”

“Oh man though but you got to get in there. Just one scene. Nineteen, no English. Probably got a butthole about this big” [illustrative gesture unseen because auditor is still standing complexly traumatized at urinal].

“Well, we’ll see.” [Mutual laughter replete w/ warmth of genuine friendship, fellow-feeling; exeunt.]

The Awards Show’s planners have obviously studied at the Oscars’ feet. Not only are the high-profile AVNAs held to the end—though with occasional teasers like Best Supporting thrown into the first two-thirds to keep people attentive52 —but the endless lists of categories and nominees are interspersed with little entr’actes of musical entertainment. Ms. Dyanna Lauren, for instance, appears between Best-Selling Tape and Best Foreign Release to sing her original composition “Psycho Magnet,” a hard-rock ballad about being a porn star and getting constantly stalked and harassed by mentally ill mooks. The song’s argumentation strikes yr. corresps. as a bit uneven, but Ms. Lauren struts and contorts and punctuates her phrasing with uppercuts to the air like a genuine MTV diva. The downside is that vocally, even with heavy amplification and digital synthesis, Dyanna Lauren sounds like a scalded cat, although Dick Filth points out that so does Alanis Morissette, and H. Hecuba chimes in by shouting: “Say whatever you want about the song-and-dance numbers here, they sure beat what Wahlberg and Reilly were coming up with in Boogie Nights!”

Hecuba’s claim seems unassailable until right before the Best Boxcover Concept category, when suddenly a piano is wheeled out for a chinless middle-aged man in the same sort of undersize porkpie that Art Carney always wore in The Honeymooners. This entertainer, who is introduced as “Doctor Dirty—the Dirtiest Musician in the History of Music,” proceeds to belt out obscene parodies of popular ditties that put Table 189 in mind of Mad magazine if everyone at Mad somehow all lost their mind at the same time. “Just got home from prison./My asshole is fizzin’./Goo goo goo drippin’ out my back door” is the only snatch of actual lyrics that persists in memory, though titles like “Sit on a Happy Face” and “It’s a Small Dick After All” have proved maddeningly hard to forget. Nobody at or around our table has ever heard of Doctor Dirty before, but almost everyone agrees that he’s the ’98 gala’s low point and a credible rival for Scotty Schwartz’s 1997 seminude rendition of “Thank Heaven for Little Girls” as the most repellent AVNA interlude in modern memory. There’s also the ’98 ceremony’s climax, in which Midori53 and two other starlets take the stage as “the Spicy Girls” and do a rappish 4/4 number that ends with pretty much every female porn performer in the crowd54 up on stage dancing lasciviously and blowing kisses at the AVN cameras. This climactic distaff shindig apparently caps the Awards every year.

Something else happens every year. It’s never part of AVN’s videotape of the gala, but it’s a tradition that finally explains why the ballroom’s poor waiters are willing to spend five hours enduring beverage abuse and scuttling around to find change. After the Awards Show is over and the lights go up, some of the starlets always pose for obscene snapshots with the Forum’s waiters. A lot of this year’s picture-taking happens at the back, right near our table. One waiter stands with his arm around the shoulders of Leanna Hart, who pulls down the starboard side of her strapless taffeta and allows the waiter to cup her right breast while Table 189’s own personal waiter55 snaps the photo. Another waiter goes around behind Ms. Ann Amoré—a very personable black lady with a 50-inch bust and gang tattoos all down both arms—and hunches over behind her as she bends forward and releases her breasts from confinement, and the waiter paws them and tries to look like he’s having intercourse with her from behind as his friend’s flash goes off. What the waiters are going to do with these photos is unguessable, but they’re visibly thrilled, and the starlets are patient and obliging with them in the same blank, distant way that they were with the mooks at the Adult CES.

Trying to leave after the AAVNAs gala is another slow process, because the broad hallway outside the ballroom is again filled with industry people with Caesar-cameo’d glasses they’ve somehow forgotten to leave at their tables, all standing in clumps and congratulating one another and making plans for various Insider parties later. But the slowest, scariest egressive part is traversing the long glass vestibule to the hotel’s side exit. A mass of fans and Caesars Palace custodians and assorted other civilians are there, and the crowd parts slightly to allow a narrow passage for the Awards’ attendees, who must run this gauntlet nearly single file. It’s late, and everyone’s tired, and this crowd has none of the awestruck reticence of the cabstand’s spectators earlier. Now it’s like every mook has his own special high-volume comment for the passing stars, and there’s a weird mix of adulation and derision:

“Love you, Brittany!”

“How’d you get that dress on, baby?”

“Look over here!”

“Does your mother know where you’re at right now?”

One florid 30ish man holding a plastic cup of beer now reaches out from the crowd and very deliberately pinches the breast of the B-girl walking just in front of us. She slaps his hand away without breaking stride. Because we cannot see her face, we don’t know whether there is any reaction there at all. We have an informed guess, though.

Mr. Dick Filth is behind us with one hand on each of yr. corresps.’ shoulders (we’re basically supporting him out). Everyone’s ears are still ringing, and Filth knows enough to almost shout:

“You know,” he says, “we’ve also got the XRCO Awards in February. X-Rated Critics Organization Awards—you get me? They’re not in Vegas, and they’re not rigged. And yet they manage to be just as ridiculous.”",[],0,David Foster Wallace,Favorite Angel,1990,"[97, 85, 69, 71, 73, 82, 99]",7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0

190,190,"It Must Have Been Love (From ""Pretty Woman"")","    HIS visit to Paul was as unreal as his night of fog and questioning. Unseeing he went through prison corridors stinking of carbolic acid to a room lined with pale yellow settees pierced in rosettes, like the shoe-store benches he had known as a boy. The guard led in Paul. Above his uniform of linty gray, Paul's face was pale and without expression. He moved timorously in response to the guard's commands; he meekly pushed Babbitt's gifts of tobacco and magazines across the table to the guard for examination. He had nothing to say but ""Oh, I'm getting used to it"" and ""I'm working in the tailor shop; the stuff hurts my fingers.""

    Babbitt knew that in this place of death Paul was already dead. And as he pondered on the train home something in his own self seemed to have died: a loyal and vigorous faith in the goodness of the world, a fear of public disfavor, a pride in success. He was glad that his wife was away. He admitted it without justifying it. He did not care.

    II

    Her card read ""Mrs. Daniel Judique."" Babbitt knew of her as the widow of a wholesale paper-dealer. She must have been forty or forty-two but he thought her younger when he saw her in the office, that afternoon. She had come to inquire about renting an apartment, and he took her away from the unskilled girl accountant. He was nervously attracted by her smartness. She was a slender woman, in a black Swiss frock dotted with white, a cool-looking graceful frock. A broad black hat shaded her face. Her eyes were lustrous, her soft chin of an agreeable plumpness, and her cheeks an even rose. Babbitt wondered afterward if she was made up, but no man living knew less of such arts.

    She sat revolving her violet parasol. Her voice was appealing without being coy. ""I wonder if you can help me?""

    ""Be delighted.""

    ""I've looked everywhere and—I want a little flat, just a bedroom, or perhaps two, and sitting-room and kitchenette and bath, but I want one that really has some charm to it, not these dingy places or these new ones with terrible gaudy chandeliers. And I can't pay so dreadfully much. My name's Tanis Judique.""

    ""I think maybe I've got just the thing for you. Would you like to chase around and look at it now?""
""Yes. I have a couple of hours.""

    In the new Cavendish Apartments, Babbitt had a flat which he had been holding for Sidney Finkelstein, but at the thought of driving beside this agreeable woman he threw over his friend Finkelstein, and with a note of gallantry he proclaimed, ""I'll let you see what I can do!""

    He dusted the seat of the car for her, and twice he risked death in showing off his driving.

    ""You do know how to handle a car!"" she said.

    He liked her voice. There was, he thought, music in it and a hint of culture, not a bouncing giggle like Louetta Swanson's.

    He boasted, ""You know, there's a lot of these fellows that are so scared and drive so slow that they get in everybody's way. The safest driver is a fellow that knows how to handle his machine and yet isn't scared to speed up when it's necessary, don't you think so?""

    ""Oh, yes!""

    ""I bet you drive like a wiz.""

    ""Oh, no—I mean—not really. Of course, we had a car—I mean, before my husband passed on—and I used to make believe drive it, but I don't think any woman ever learns to drive like a man.""

    ""Well, now, there's some mighty good woman drivers.""

    ""Oh, of course, these women that try to imitate men, and play golf and everything, and ruin their complexions and spoil their hands!""

    ""That's so. I never did like these mannish females.""

    ""I mean—of course, I admire them, dreadfully, and I feel so weak and useless beside them.""

    ""Oh, rats now! I bet you play the piano like a wiz.""

    ""Oh, no—I mean—not really.""

    ""Well, I'll bet you do!"" He glanced at her smooth hands, her diamond and ruby rings. She caught the glance, snuggled her hands together with a kittenish curving of slim white fingers which delighted him, and yearned:

    ""I do love to play—I mean—I like to drum on the piano, but I haven't had any real training. Mr. Judique used to say I would 've been a good pianist if I'd had any training, but then, I guess he was just flattering me.""

    ""I'll bet he wasn't! I'll bet you've got temperament.""

    ""Oh—Do you like music, Mr Babbitt?""

    ""You bet I do! Only I don't know 's I care so much for all this classical stuff.""

    ""Oh, I do! I just love Chopin and all those.""

    ""Do you, honest? Well, of course, I go to lots of these highbrow concerts, but I do like a good jazz orchestra, right up on its toes, with the fellow that plays the bass fiddle spinning it around and beating it up with the bow.""

    ""Oh, I know. I do love good dance music. I love to dance, don't you, Mr. Babbitt?""

    ""Sure, you bet. Not that I'm very darn good at it, though.""

    ""Oh, I'm sure you are. You ought to let me teach you. I can teach anybody to dance.""

    ""Would you give me a lesson some time?""

    ""Indeed I would.""

    ""Better be careful, or I'll be taking you up on that proposition. I'll be coming up to your flat and making you give me that lesson.""

    ""Ye-es."" She was not offended, but she was non-committal. He warned himself, ""Have some sense now, you chump! Don't go making a fool of yourself again!"" and with loftiness he discoursed:

    ""I wish I could dance like some of these young fellows, but I'll tell you: I feel it's a man's place to take a full, you might say, a creative share in the world's work and mold conditions and have something to show for his life, don't you think so?""

    ""Oh, I do!""

    ""And so I have to sacrifice some of the things I might like to tackle, though I do, by golly, play about as good a game of golf as the next fellow!""

    ""Oh, I'm sure you do.... Are you married?""

    ""Uh—yes.... And, uh, of course official duties I'm the vice-president of the Boosters' Club, and I'm running one of the committees of the State Association of Real Estate Boards, and that means a lot of work and responsibility—and practically no gratitude for it.""

    ""Oh, I know! Public men never do get proper credit.""

    They looked at each other with a high degree of mutual respect, and at the Cavendish Apartments he helped her out in a courtly manner, waved his hand at the house as though he were presenting it to her, and ponderously ordered the elevator boy to ""hustle and get the keys."" She stood close to him in the elevator, and he was stirred but cautious.

    It was a pretty flat, of white woodwork and soft blue walls. Mrs. Judique gushed with pleasure as she agreed to take it, and as they walked down the hall to the elevator she touched his sleeve, caroling, ""Oh, I'm so glad I went to you! It's such a privilege to meet a man who really Understands. Oh! The flats SOME people have showed me!""

    He had a sharp instinctive belief that he could put his arm around her, but he rebuked himself and with excessive politeness he saw her to the car, drove her home. All the way back to his office he raged:

    ""Glad I had some sense for once.... Curse it, I wish I'd tried. She's a darling! A corker! A reg'lar charmer! Lovely eyes and darling lips and that trim waist—never get sloppy, like some women.... No, no, no! She's a real cultured lady. One of the brightest little women I've met these many moons. Understands about Public Topics and—But, darn it, why didn't I try? . . . Tanis!""

    III

    He was harassed and puzzled by it, but he found that he was turning toward youth, as youth. The girl who especially disturbed him—though he had never spoken to her—was the last manicure girl on the right in the Pompeian Barber Shop. She was small, swift, black-haired, smiling. She was nineteen, perhaps, or twenty. She wore thin salmon-colored blouses which exhibited her shoulders and her black-ribboned camisoles.

    He went to the Pompeian for his fortnightly hair-trim. As always, he felt disloyal at deserting his neighbor, the Reeves Building Barber Shop. Then, for the first time, he overthrew his sense of guilt. ""Doggone it, I don't have to go here if I don't want to! I don't own the Reeves Building! These barbers got nothing on me! I'll doggone well get my hair cut where I doggone well want to! Don't want to hear anything more about it! I'm through standing by people—unless I want to. It doesn't get you anywhere. I'm through!""

    The Pompeian Barber Shop was in the basement of the Hotel Thornleigh, largest and most dynamically modern hotel in Zenith. Curving marble steps with a rail of polished brass led from the hotel-lobby down to the barber shop. The interior was of black and white and crimson tiles, with a sensational ceiling of burnished gold, and a fountain in which a massive nymph forever emptied a scarlet cornucopia. Forty barbers and nine manicure girls worked desperately, and at the door six colored porters lurked to greet the customers, to care reverently for their hats and collars, to lead them to a place of waiting where, on a carpet like a tropic isle in the stretch of white stone floor, were a dozen leather chairs and a table heaped with magazines.

    Babbitt's porter was an obsequious gray-haired negro who did him an honor highly esteemed in the land of Zenith—greeted him by name. Yet Babbitt was unhappy. His bright particular manicure girl was engaged. She was doing the nails of an overdressed man and giggling with him. Babbitt hated him. He thought of waiting, but to stop the powerful system of the Pompeian was inconceivable, and he was instantly wafted into a chair.

    About him was luxury, rich and delicate. One votary was having a violet-ray facial treatment, the next an oil shampoo. Boys wheeled about miraculous electrical massage-machines. The barbers snatched steaming towels from a machine like a howitzer of polished nickel and disdainfully flung them away after a second's use. On the vast marble shelf facing the chairs were hundreds of tonics, amber and ruby and emerald. It was flattering to Babbitt to have two personal slaves at once—the barber and the bootblack. He would have been completely happy if he could also have had the manicure girl. The barber snipped at his hair and asked his opinion of the Havre de Grace races, the baseball season, and Mayor Prout. The young negro bootblack hummed ""The Camp Meeting Blues"" and polished in rhythm to his tune, drawing the shiny shoe-rag so taut at each stroke that it snapped like a banjo string. The barber was an excellent salesman. He made Babbitt feel rich and important by his manner of inquiring, ""What is your favorite tonic, sir? Have you time to-day, sir, for a facial massage? Your scalp is a little tight; shall I give you a scalp massage?""

    Babbitt's best thrill was in the shampoo. The barber made his hair creamy with thick soap, then (as Babbitt bent over the bowl, muffled in towels) drenched it with hot water which prickled along his scalp, and at last ran the water ice-cold. At the shock, the sudden burning cold on his skull, Babbitt's heart thumped, his chest heaved, and his spine was an electric wire. It was a sensation which broke the monotony of life. He looked grandly about the shop as he sat up. The barber obsequiously rubbed his wet hair and bound it in a towel as in a turban, so that Babbitt resembled a plump pink calif on an ingenious and adjustable throne. The barber begged (in the manner of one who was a good fellow yet was overwhelmed by the splendors of the calif), ""How about a little Eldorado Oil Rub, sir? Very beneficial to the scalp, sir. Didn't I give you one the last time?""

    He hadn't, but Babbitt agreed, ""Well, all right.""

    With quaking eagerness he saw that his manicure girl was free.

    ""I don't know, I guess I'll have a manicure after all,"" he droned, and excitedly watched her coming, dark-haired, smiling, tender, little. The manicuring would have to be finished at her table, and he would be able to talk to her without the barber listening. He waited contentedly, not trying to peep at her, while she filed his nails and the barber shaved him and smeared on his burning cheeks all the interesting mixtures which the pleasant minds of barbers have devised through the revolving ages. When the barber was done and he sat opposite the girl at her table, he admired the marble slab of it, admired the sunken set bowl with its tiny silver taps, and admired himself for being able to frequent so costly a place. When she withdrew his wet hand from the bowl, it was so sensitive from the warm soapy water that he was abnormally aware of the clasp of her firm little paw. He delighted in the pinkness and glossiness of her nails. Her hands seemed to him more adorable than Mrs. Judique's thin fingers, and more elegant. He had a certain ecstasy in the pain when she gnawed at the cuticle of his nails with a sharp knife. He struggled not to look at the outline of her young bosom and her shoulders, the more apparent under a film of pink chiffon. He was conscious of her as an exquisite thing, and when he tried to impress his personality on her he spoke as awkwardly as a country boy at his first party:

    ""Well, kinda hot to be working to-day.""

    ""Oh, yes, it is hot. You cut your own nails, last time, didn't you!""

    ""Ye-es, guess I must 've.""

    ""You always ought to go to a manicure.""

    ""Yes, maybe that's so. I—""

    ""There's nothing looks so nice as nails that are looked after good. I always think that's the best way to spot a real gent. There was an auto salesman in here yesterday that claimed you could always tell a fellow's class by the car he drove, but I says to him, 'Don't be silly,' I says; 'the wisenheimers grab a look at a fellow's nails when they want to tell if he's a tin-horn or a real gent!""'

    ""Yes, maybe there's something to that. Course, that is—with a pretty kiddy like you, a man can't help coming to get his mitts done.""

    ""Yeh, I may be a kid, but I'm a wise bird, and I know nice folks when I see um—I can read character at a glance—and I'd never talk so frank with a fellow if I couldn't see he was a nice fellow.""

    She smiled. Her eyes seemed to him as gentle as April pools. With great seriousness he informed himself that ""there were some roughnecks who would think that just because a girl was a manicure girl and maybe not awful well educated, she was no good, but as for him, he was a democrat, and understood people,"" and he stood by the assertion that this was a fine girl, a good girl—but not too uncomfortably good. He inquired in a voice quick with sympathy:

    ""I suppose you have a lot of fellows who try to get fresh with you.""

    ""Say, gee, do I! Say, listen, there's some of these cigar-store sports that think because a girl's working in a barber shop, they can get away with anything. The things they saaaaaay! But, believe me, I know how to hop those birds! I just give um the north and south and ask um, 'Say, who do you think you're talking to?' and they fade away like love's young nightmare and oh, don't you want a box of nail-paste? It will keep the nails as shiny as when first manicured, harmless to apply and lasts for days.""

    ""Sure, I'll try some. Say—Say, it's funny; I've been coming here ever since the shop opened and—"" With arch surprise. ""—I don't believe I know your name!""

    ""Don't you? My, that's funny! I don't know yours!""

    ""Now you quit kidding me! What's the nice little name?""

    ""Oh, it ain't so darn nice. I guess it's kind of kike. But my folks ain't kikes. My papa's papa was a nobleman in Poland, and there was a gentleman in here one day, he was kind of a count or something—""

    ""Kind of a no-account, I guess you mean!""

    ""Who's telling this, smarty? And he said he knew my papa's papa's folks in Poland and they had a dandy big house. Right on a lake!"" Doubtfully, ""Maybe you don't believe it?""

    ""Sure. No. Really. Sure I do. Why not? Don't think I'm kidding you, honey, but every time I've noticed you I've said to myself, 'That kid has Blue Blood in her veins!'""

    ""Did you, honest?""

    ""Honest I did. Well, well, come on—now we're friends—what's the darling little name?""

    ""Ida Putiak. It ain't so much-a-much of a name. I always say to Ma, I say, 'Ma, why didn't you name me Doloress or something with some class to it?'""

    ""Well, now, I think it's a scrumptious name. Ida!""

    ""I bet I know your name!""

    ""Well, now, not necessarily. Of course—Oh, it isn't so specially well known.""

    ""Aren't you Mr. Sondheim that travels for the Krackajack Kitchen Kutlery Ko.?""

    ""I am not! I'm Mr. Babbitt, the real-estate broker!""

    ""Oh, excuse me! Oh, of course. You mean here in Zenith.""

    ""Yep."" With the briskness of one whose feelings have been hurt.

    ""Oh, sure. I've read your ads. They're swell.""

    ""Um, well—You might have read about my speeches.""

    ""Course I have! I don't get much time to read but—I guess you think I'm an awfully silly little nit!""
""I think you're a little darling!""

    ""Well—There's one nice thing about this job. It gives a girl a chance to meet some awfully nice gentlemen and improve her mind with conversation, and you get so you can read a guy's character at the first glance.""

    ""Look here, Ida; please don't think I'm getting fresh—"" He was hotly reflecting that it would be humiliating to be rejected by this child, and dangerous to be accepted. If he took her to dinner, if he were seen by censorious friends—But he went on ardently: ""Don't think I'm getting fresh if I suggest it would be nice for us to go out and have a little dinner together some evening.""

    ""I don't know as I ought to but—My gentleman-friend's always wanting to take me out. But maybe I could to-night.""

    IV

    There was no reason, he assured himself, why he shouldn't have a quiet dinner with a poor girl who would benefit by association with an educated and mature person like himself. But, lest some one see them and not understand, he would take her to Biddlemeier's Inn, on the outskirts of the city. They would have a pleasant drive, this hot lonely evening, and he might hold her hand—no, he wouldn't even do that. Ida was complaisant; her bare shoulders showed it only too clearly; but he'd be hanged if he'd make love to her merely because she expected it.

    Then his car broke down; something had happened to the ignition. And he HAD to have the car this evening! Furiously he tested the spark-plugs, stared at the commutator. His angriest glower did not seem to stir the sulky car, and in disgrace it was hauled off to a garage. With a renewed thrill he thought of a taxicab. There was something at once wealthy and interestingly wicked about a taxicab.

    But when he met her, on a corner two blocks from the Hotel Thornleigh, she said, ""A taxi? Why, I thought you owned a car!""

    ""I do. Of course I do! But it's out of commission to-night.""

    ""Oh,"" she remarked, as one who had heard that tale before.

    All the way out to Biddlemeier's Inn he tried to talk as an old friend, but he could not pierce the wall of her words. With interminable indignation she narrated her retorts to ""that fresh head-barber"" and the drastic things she would do to him if he persisted in saying that she was ""better at gassing than at hoof-paring.""

    At Biddlemeier's Inn they were unable to get anything to drink. The head-waiter refused to understand who George F. Babbitt was. They sat steaming before a vast mixed grill, and made conversation about baseball. When he tried to hold Ida's hand she said with bright friendliness, ""Careful! That fresh waiter is rubbering."" But they came out into a treacherous summer night, the air lazy and a little moon above transfigured maples.

    ""Let's drive some other place, where we can get a drink and dance!"" he demanded.

    ""Sure, some other night. But I promised Ma I'd be home early to-night.""

    ""Rats! It's too nice to go home.""

    ""I'd just love to, but Ma would give me fits.""

    He was trembling. She was everything that was young and exquisite. He put his arm about her. She snuggled against his shoulder, unafraid, and he was triumphant. Then she ran down the steps of the Inn, singing, ""Come on, Georgie, we'll have a nice drive and get cool.""

    It was a night of lovers. All along the highway into Zenith, under the low and gentle moon, motors were parked and dim figures were clasped in revery. He held out hungry hands to Ida, and when she patted them he was grateful. There was no sense of struggle and transition; he kissed her and simply she responded to his kiss, they two behind the stolid back of the chauffeur.

    Her hat fell off, and she broke from his embrace to reach for it.

    ""Oh, let it be!"" he implored.

    ""Huh? My hat? Not a chance!""

    He waited till she had pinned it on, then his arm sank about her. She drew away from it, and said with maternal soothing, ""Now, don't be a silly boy! Mustn't make Ittle Mama scold! Just sit back, dearie, and see what a swell night it is. If you're a good boy, maybe I'll kiss you when we say nighty-night. Now give me a cigarette.""

    He was solicitous about lighting her cigarette and inquiring as to her comfort. Then he sat as far from her as possible. He was cold with failure. No one could have told Babbitt that he was a fool with more vigor, precision, and intelligence than he himself displayed. He reflected that from the standpoint of the Rev. Dr. John Jennison Drew he was a wicked man, and from the standpoint of Miss Ida Putiak, an old bore who had to be endured as the penalty attached to eating a large dinner.

    ""Dearie, you aren't going to go and get peevish, are you?""

    She spoke pertly. He wanted to spank her. He brooded, ""I don't have to take anything off this gutter-pup! Darn immigrant! Well, let's get it over as quick as we can, and sneak home and kick ourselves for the rest of the night.""

    He snorted, ""Huh? Me peevish? Why, you baby, why should I be peevish? Now, listen, Ida; listen to Uncle George. I want to put you wise about this scrapping with your head-barber all the time. I've had a lot of experience with employees, and let me tell you it doesn't pay to antagonize—""

    At the drab wooden house in which she lived he said good-night briefly and amiably, but as the taxicab drove off he was praying ""Oh, my God!""",[],0,Sinclair Lewis,Roxette,1990,"[99, 93, 92, 76, 55, 42, 33, 26, 17, 11, 6, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 16, 22, 29, 34, 49, 67]",25,"It Must Have Been Love - From ""Pretty Woman""",https://open.spotify.com/track/0U0mMRtYifdTaRltbemBee,0U0mMRtYifdTaRltbemBee,spotify:track:0U0mMRtYifdTaRltbemBee,Greatest Hits,4htx3t5YHqgyTgHw3xinsf,spotify:album:4htx3t5YHqgyTgHw3xinsf,Roxette,2SHhfs4BiDxGQ3oxqf0UHY,spotify:artist:2SHhfs4BiDxGQ3oxqf0UHY,258.786,12.0,32.0,2011-07-26,0.52,0.652,5.0,-6.655,1.0,0.0274,0.34,5.4899999999999986e-05,0.256,0.722,80.609,"['europop', 'new wave pop', 'pop rock', 'swedish pop']",[],,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0

Strike a pose

[Verse 1]
Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go (look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (life that you know)
When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor, and here's what it's for, so

Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music (move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
All you need is your own imagination
So use it that's what it's for (that's what it's for)
Go inside, for your finest inspiration
Your dreams will open the door (open up the door)
It makes no difference if you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
If the music's pumping it will give you new life
You're a superstar, yes, that's what you are, you know it

[Chorus]
Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music (move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey

Let your body move to the music (move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey

192,192,Summer Vacation,"There was a time when courtesy and winning ways went out of style, when it was good to be bad, when you cultivated decadence like a taste. We were all dangerous characters then. We wore torn-up leather jackets, slouched around with toothpicks in our mouths, sniffed glue and ether and what somebody claimed was cocaine. When we wheeled our parents' whining station wagons out onto the street we left a patch of rubber half a block long. We drank gin and grape juice, Tango, Thunderbird, and Bali Hai. We were nineteen. We were bad. We read André Gide and struck elaborate poses to show that we didn’t give a shit about anything. At night, we went up to Greasy Lake.

Through the center of town, up the strip, past the housing developments and shopping malls, street lights giving way to the thin streaming illumination of the headlights, trees crowding the asphalt in a black unbroken wall: that was the way out to Greasy Lake. The Indian had called it Wakan, a reference to the clarity of its waters. Now it was fetid and murky, the mud banks glittering with broken glass and strewn with beer cans and the charred remains of bonfires. There was a single ravaged island a hundred yards from shore, so stripped of vegetation it looked as if the air force had strafed it. We went up to the lake because everyone went there, because we wanted to snuff the rich scent of possibility on the breeze, watch a girl take off her clothes and plunge into the festering murk, drink beer, smoke pot, howl at the stars, savor the incongruous full-throated roar of rock and roll against the primeval susurrus of frogs and crickets. This was nature.

I was there one night, late, in the company of two dangerous characters. Digby wore a gold star in his right ear and allowed his father to pay his tuition at Cornell’ Jeff was thinking of quitting school to become a painter/musician/head-shop proprietor. They were both expert in the social graces, quick with a sneer, able to manage a Ford with lousy shocks over a rutted and gutted blacktop road at eighty-five while rolling a joint as compact as a Tootsie Roll Pop stick. They could lounge against a bank of booming speakers and trade “man”s with the best of them or roll out across the dance floor as if their joints worked on bearings. They were slick and quick and they wore their mirror shades at breakfast and dinner, in the shower, in closets and caves. In short, they were bad.

I drove. Digby pounded the dashboard and shouted along with Toots & the Maytals while Jeff hung his head out the window and streaked the side of my mother’s Bel Air with vomit. It was early June, the air soft as a hand on your cheek, the third night of summer vacation. The first two nights we’d been out till dawn, looking for something we never found. On this, the third night, we’d cruised the strip sixty-seven times, been in and out of every bar and club we could think of in a twenty-mile radius, stopped twice for bucket chicken and forty-cent hamburgers, debated going to a party at the house of a girl Jeff’s sister knew, and chucked two dozen raw eggs at mailboxes and hitchhikers. It was 2:00 A.M.: the bars were closing. There was nothing to do but take a bottle of lemon-flavored gin up to Greasy Lake.

The taillights of a single car winked at us as we swung into the dirt lot with its tufts of weed and washboard corrugations; ’57 Chevy, mint, metallic blue. On the far side of the lot, like the exoskeleton of some gaunt chrome insect, a chopper leaned against its kickstand. And that was it for excitement: some junkie halfwit biker and a car freak pumping his girlfriend. Whatever it was we were looking for, we weren’t about to find it at Greasy Lake. Not that night.

But then all of a sudden Digby was fighting for the wheel. “Hey, that’s Tony Lovett’s car! Hey!” he shouted, while I stabbed at the brake pedal and the Bel Air nosed up to the gleaming bumper of the parked Chevy. Digby leaned on the horn, laughing, and instructed me to put my brights on. This was hilarious. A joke. Tony would experience premature withdrawal and expect to be confronted by grim-looking state troopers with flashlights. We hit the horn, strobed the lights, and then jumped out of the car to press our witty faces to Tony’s windows; for all we knew we might even catch a glimpse of some little fox’s tits, and then we could slap backs with red-faced Tony, roughhouse a little, and go on to new heights of adventure and daring.

The first mistake, the one that opened the whole floodgate, was losing my grip on the keys. In the excitement, leaping from the car with the gin in one hand and a roach clip in the other, I spilled them in the grass—in the dark, rank, mysterious nighttime grass of Greasy Lake. This was a tactical error, as damaging and irreversible in its way as Westmoreland’s decision to dig in at Khe Sanh. I felt it like a jab of intuition, and I stopped there by the door, peering vaguely into the night that puddled up round my feet.

The second mistake—and this was inextricably bound up with the first—was identifying the car as Tony Lovett’s car. Even before the very bad character in greasy jeans and engineer boots ripped out of the driver’s door, I began to realize that this chrome blue was much lighter than the robin’s-egg of Tony’s car, and that Tony’s car didn’t have rear-mounted speakers. Judging from their expressions, Digby and Jeff were privately groping toward the same inevitable and unsettling conclusion as I was.

In any case, there was no reasoning with this bad greasy character—clearly he was a man of action. The first lusty Rockette kick of his steel-toed boot caught me under the chin, chipped my favorite tooth, and left me sprawled in the dirt. Like a fool, I’d gone down on one knee to comb the stiff hacked grass for the keys, my mind making connections in the most dragged-out, testudineous way, knowing that things had gone wrong, that I was in a lot of trouble, and that the lost ignition key was my grail and my salvation. The three of four succeeding blows were mainly absorbed by my right buttock and the tough piece of bone at the base of my spine.

Meanwhile, Digby vaulted the kissing bumpers and delivered a savage kung-fu blow to the greasy character’s collarbone. Digby had just finished a course in martial arts and for phys-ed credit and had spent the better part of the past two nights telling us apocryphal tales of Bruce Lee types and of the raw power invested in lightning blows shot from coiled wrists, ankles, and elbows. The greasy character was unimpressed. He merely backed off a step, his face like a Toltec mask, and laid Digby out with a single whistling roundhouse blow … but by now Jeff had got into the act, and I was beginning to extricate myself from the dirt, a tinny compound of shock, rage, and impotence wadded in my throat.

Jeff was on the guy’s back, biting at his ear. Digby was on the ground, cursing. I went for the tire iron I kept under the driver’s seat. I kept it there because bad characters always keep tire irons under the driver’s seat, for just such an occasion as this. Never mind that I hadn’t been involved in a fight since sixth grade, when a kid with a sleepy eye and two streams of mucus depending from his nostrils hit me in the knee with a Louisville slugger, never mind that I’d touched the tire iron exactly twice before, to change tires: it was there. And I went for it.

I was terrified. Blood was beating in my ears, my hands were shaking, my heart turning over like a dirt-bike in the wrong gear. My antagonist was shirtless, and a single cord of muscle flashes across his chest as he bent forward to peel Jeff from his back like a wet overcoat. “Mother-fucker,” he spat, over and over, and I was aware in that instant that all four of us—Digby, Jeff, and myself included—were chanting “mother-fucker, mother-fucker,” as if it were a battle cry. (What happened next? The detective asks the murderer from beneath the turned-down brim of his porkpie hat. I don’t know, the murderer says, something came over me. Exactly.)

Digby poked the flat of his hand in the bad character’s face and I came at him like a kamikaze, mindless, raging, stung with humiliation—the whole thing, from the initial boot in the chin to this murderous primal instant involving no more than sixty hyperventilating, gland-flooding seconds—I came at him and brought the tire iron down across his ear. The effect was instantaneous, astonishing. He was a stunt man and this was Hollywood, he was a big grimacing toothy balloon and I was a man with a straight pin. He collapsed. Wet his pants. Went loose in his boots.

A single second, big as a zeppelin, floated by. We were standing over him in a circle, gritting our teeth, jerking our necks, our limbs and hands and feet twitching with glandular discharges. No one said anything. We just stared down at the guy, the car freak, the lover, the bad greasy character laid low. Digby looked at me; so did Jeff. I was still holding the tire iron, a tuft of hair clinging to the crook like dandelion fluff, like down. Rattled, I dropped it in the dirt, already envisioning the headlines, the pitted faces of the police inquisitors, the gleam of handcuffs, clank of bars, the big black shadows rising from the back of the cell … when suddenly a raw torn shriek cut through me like all the juice in the electric chairs in the country.

It was the fox. She was short, barefoot, dressed in panties and a man’s shirt. “Animals!” she screamed, running at us with her fists clenched and wisps of blow-dried hair in her face. There was a silver chain round her ankle, and her toenails flashed in the glare of the headlights. I think it was the toenails that did it. Sure, the gin and the cannabis and even the Kentucky Fried may have had a hand in it, but it was the sight of those flaming toes that set us off—the toad emerging from the loaf if Virgin Spring, lipstick smeared on a child; she was already tainted. We were on her like Bergman’s deranged brothers—see no evil, hear none, speak none—panting, wheezing, tearing at her clothes, grabbing for flesh. We were bad characters, and we were scared and hot and three steps over the line—anything could have happened.

It didn’t.

Before we could pin her to the hood of the car, our eyes masked with lust and greed and the purest primal badness, a pair of headlights swung into the lot. There we were, dirty, bloody, guilty, dissociated from humanity and civilization, the first of the Ur-crimes behind us, the second in progress, shreds of nylon panty and spandex brassiere dangling from ours fingers, our flies open, lips licked—there we were, caught in the spotlight. Nailed.

We bolted. First for the car, and then, realizing we had no way of starting it, for the woods. I thought nothing. I thought escape. The headlights came at me like accusing fingers. I was gone.

Ram-bam-bam, across the parking lot, past the chopper and into the feculent undergrowth at the lake’s edge, insects flying up in my face, weeds whipping, frogs and snakes and red-eyed turtles splashing off into the night: I was already ankle-deep in muck and tepid water and still going strong. Behind me, the girl’s screams rose in intensity, disconsolate, incriminating, the screams of the Sabine women, the Christian martyrs, Anne Frank dragged from the garret. I kept going, pursued by those cries, imaging cops and bloodhounds. The water was up to my knees when I realized what I was doing: I was going to swim for it. Swim the breadth of Greasy Lake and hide myself in the thick clot of woods on the far side. They’d never find me there.

I was breathing in sobs, in gasps. The water lapped at my waist as I looked out over the moon-burnished ripples, the mats of algae that clung to the surface like scabs. Digby and Jeff had vanished. I paused. Listened. The girl was quieter now, screams tapering to sobs, but there were male voices, angry, excited, and high-pitched ticking of the second car’s engine. I waded deeper stealthy, hunted, the ooze sucking at my sneakers. As I was about to take the plunge—at the very instant I dropped my shoulder for the first slashing stroke—I blundered into something. Something unspeakable, obscene, something soft, wet, moss-grown. A patch of weed? A log? When I reached out to touch it, it gave like a rubber duck, it gave like flesh.

In one of those nasty little epiphanies for which we are prepared by films and TV and childhood visits to the funeral home to ponder the shrunken painted forms of dead grandparents, I understood what it was that bobbed there so inadmissibly in the dark. Understood, and stumbled back in horror and revulsion, my mind yanked in six different directions (I was nineteen, a mere child, an infant, and here in the space of five minutes I’d struck down one greasy character and blundered into the water-logged carcass of a second), thinking, The keys, the keys, why did I have to go and lose the keys? I stumbled back, but the muck took hold of my feet—a sneaker snagged, balance lost—and suddenly I was pitching face forward into the buoyant black mass, throwing out my hands in desperation while simultaneously conjuring the image of reeking frogs and muskrats revolving in slicks of their own deliquescing juices. AAAAArrrgh! I shot from the water like a torpedo, the dead man rotating to expose a mossy beard and eyes cold as the moon. I must have shouted, thrashing around in the weeds, because the voices behind me suddenly became animated.

“What was that?”

“It’s them, it’s them: they tried to, tried to … rape me!” Sobs.

A man’s voice flat Midwestern accent. “You sons a bitches, we’ll kill you!”

Frogs, crickets.

Then another voice, harsh, r-less, Lower East Side: “Motherfucker!” I recognized the verbal virtuosity of the bad greasy character in the engineer boots. Tooth chipped, sneakers gone, coated in mud and slime and worse, crouching breathless in the weeds waiting to have my ass thoroughly and definitively kicked and fresh from the hideous stinking embrace of a three-days-dead-corpse, I suddenly felt a rush of joy and vindication: the son of a bitch was alive! Just as quickly, my bowels turned to ice. “Come on out of there, you pansy mothers!” the bad greasy character was screaming. He shouted cures till we was out of breath.

The crickets started up again, then the frogs. I held my breath. All at once was a sound in the reeds, a swishing, a splash: thunk-a-thunk. They were throwing rocks. The frogs fell silent. I cradled my head. Swish, swish, thunk-a-thunk. A wedge of feldspar the size of cue ball glanced off my knee. I bit my finger.

It was then that they turned to the car. I heard a door slam, a curse, and then the sound of headlights shattering—almost a good-natured sound, celebrator, like corks popping from the necks of bottles. This was succeeded by the dull booming of the fenders, metal on metal, and then the icy crash of the windshield. I inched forward, elbows and knees, my belly pressed to the muck; thinking of guerrillas and commandos and The Naked and the Dead. I parted the weeds and squinted the length of the parking lot.

The second car—it was a Trans-am—was still running, its high beams washing the scene in a lurid stagy light. The tire iron flailing, the greasy bad character was laying into the side of my mother’s Bel Air like an avenging demon, his shadow riding up the trunks of the trees. Whomp. Whomp. Whomp-whomp. The other two guys—blond types, in fraternity jackets—were helping out with the tree branches and skull-sized boulders. One of them was gathering up bottles, rocks, muck, candy wrappers, used condoms, pop-tops, and other refuse and pitching it through the window on the driver’s side. I could see the fox, a white bulb behind the windshield of the ’57 Chevy. “Bobbie,” she whined over the thumping, “come on.” The greasy character paused a moment, took one good swipe at the left taillight, and then heaved the tire iron halfway across the lake. Then he fired up the ’57 and was gone.

Blond head nodded at blond head. One said something to the other; two low for me to catch. They were no doubt thinking that in helping to annihilate my mother’s car they’d committed a fairly rash act, and thinking too that there were three bad characters connected with that very car watching them from the woods. Perhaps other possibilities occurred to them as well—police, jail cells, justices of the peace, reparations, lawyers, irate parents, fraternal censure. Whatever they were thinking, they suddenly dropped branches, bottles, and rocks and sprang for their car in unison, as if they’d choreographed it. Five seconds. That’s all it took. The engine shrieked, the tires squealed, a cloud of dust rose from the rutted lot and then settled back on darkness.

I don’t know how long I lay there, the bad breath of decay all around me, my jacket heavy as a bear, the primordial ooze subtly reconstituting itself to accommodate my upper thighs and testicles. My jaws ached, my knee throbbed, my coccyx was on fire. I contemplated suicide, wondered if I’d need bridgework, scraped the recesses of my brain for some sort of excuse to give my parents—a tree had fallen on the car, I was blinded by a beard truck, hit and run, vandals had got to it while we were playing chess at Digby’s. Then I thought of the dead man. He was probably the only person on the planet worse off than I was. I thought about him, fog on the lake, insects chirring eerily, and felt the tug of fear, felt the darkness opening up inside me like a set of jaws. Who was he, I wondered, this victim of time and circumstance bobbing sorrowfully in the lake at my back. The owner of the chopper, no doubt, a bad older character come to this. Shot during a murky drug deal, drowned while drunkenly frolicking in the lake. Another headline. My car was wrecked; he was dead.

When the eastern half of the sky went from black to cobalt and the trees began to separate themselves from the shadows, I pushed myself up from the mud and stepped out into the open. By now the birds had begun to take over for the crickets, and dew lay slick on the leaves. There was a smell in the air, raw and sweet at the same time, the smell of the sun firing buds and opening blossoms. I contemplated the car. It lay there like a wreck along the highway, like a steel sculpture left over from a vanished civilization. Everything was still. This was nature.

I was circling the car, as dazed and bedraggled as the sole survivor of an air blitz, when Digby and Jeff emerged from the trees behind me. Digby’s face was cross-hatched with smears of dirt; Jeff’s jacket was gone and his shirt was torn across the shoulder. They slouched across the lot, looking sheepish, and silently came up beside me to gape at the ravaged automobile. No one said a word after a while Jeff swung open the driver’s door and began to scoop the broken glass and garbage off the seat. I looked at Digby. He shrugged. “At least they didn’t slash the tires,” he said.

It was true: the tires were intact. There was no windshield, the headlights were staved in, and the body looked as if it had been sledge-hammered for a quarter a shot at the county fair, but the tires were inflated to regulation pressure. The car was drivable. In silence, all three of us bent to scrape the mud and shattered glass from the interior. I said nothing about the biker. When we were finished, I reached in my pocket for the keys, experience a nasty stab of recollection, cursed myself, and turned to search the grass. I spotted them almost immediately, no more than five feet from the open door, glinting like jewels in the first tapering shaft of sunlight. There was no reason to get philosophical about it: I eased into the seat and turned the engine over.

It was at that precise moment that the silver Mustang with flame decals rumbled into the lot. All three of us froze; then Digby and Jeff slid into the car and slammed the door. We watched as the Mustang rocked and bobbed across the ruts and finally jerked to a halt beside the forlorn chopper at the far end of the lot. “Let’s go,” Digby said. I hesitated, the Bel Air wheezing beneath me.

Two girls emerged from the Mustang. Tight jeans, stiletto heels, hair like frozen fur. They bent over the motorcycle, paced back and forth aimlessly, glanced once or twice at us, and then ambled over to where the reeds sprang up in a green fence around the perimeter of the lake. One of them cupped her hands to her mouth. “Al,” she called. ”Hey, Al!”

“Come on,” Digby hissed. “Let’s get out of here.”

But it was too late. The second girl was picking her way across the lot, unsteady on her heels, looking up at us and then away. She was older—twenty-five or –six—and as she came closer we could see there was something wrong with her: she was stoned or drunk, lurching now and waving her arms for balance. I gripped the steering wheel as if it were the ejection lever of a flaming jet, and Digby spat out my name twice, terse and impatience.

“Hi,” the girl said.

We looked at her like zombies, like war veterans, like deaf-and-dumb pencil peddlers.

She smiled, her lips cracked and dry. “Listen,” she said, bending from the waist to look in the window, “you guys seen Al?” Her pupils were pinpoints, her eyes glass. She jerked her neck. “That’s his bike over there—Al’s. You seen him?”

Al. I didn’t know what to say. I wanted to get out of the car and retch, I wanted to go home to my parents’ house and crawl into bed. Digby poked me in the ribs. “We haven’t seen anybody,” I said.

The girl seemed to consider this, reaching out a slim veiny arm to brace herself against the car. “No matter,” she said, slurring the t’s, “he’ll turn up.”” And then, as if she’d just taken stock of the whole scene—the ravaged car and our battered faces, the desolation of the place—she said: “Hey, you guys look like some pretty bad characters—been fightin’, huh?” We stared straight ahead, rigid as catatonics. She was fumbling in her pocket and muttering something. Finally she held out a handful of tablets in glassine wrappers: “Hey, you want to party, you want to do some of these with me and Sarah?”

I just looked at her. I thought I was going to cry. Digby broke the silence. “No, thanks,” he said, leaning over me. “Some other time.”

I put the car in gear and it inched forward with a groan, shaking off pellets of glass like an old dog shedding water after a bath, heaving over the ruts on its worn springs, creeping toward the highway. There was a sheen of sun on the lake. I looked back. The girl was still standing there, watching us, her shoulders slumped, hand outstretched.",[],0,T.

194,194,She Ain't Worth It,"[Intro: Bobby Brown]
Better make tracks
Fast on the double
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

[Verse 1: Glenn Medeiros]
You take her where she wants to go
And every day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind

But she just got an attitude
Leads you on
Then leaves you blue
Can't you see
She's really just a waste of time

One day
She'll treat you nice
Then she turn as cold as ice
But you think
Your love will win her in the end
Think again

[Chorus:]
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief
That she's been putting you through
Ooh

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me
I know
I know better than
Better than, better than
Bet, bet better than you

[Verse 2: Glenn Medeiros]
She gets you hot
Then leaves you cold
Keeps you waiting on the phone
Cause she knows
You'll always give her one more try

You're not the only boy in town
And she loves playing to the crowd
But tell me
Do you really like standing in line?

You give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Glenn Medeiros:]
I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie
(That would be a lie)

Cause there's no one
In this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied I know
Cause I tried

[Rap: Bobby Brown]
Jump in
One thing I hate
Is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
Cause I've tried to make you mine

For the last time
So take this here as a dis
And a goodbye

She ain't worth it
Even though she's on the high tip
She better get a grip
And get a grip quick

Fast in a hurry
Cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

[Bridge: Glenn Medeiros]
Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again

195,195,Stranger To Love,"The Ten Primitive PersecutionsThe First Persecution, Under Nero, A.D. 67The first persecution of the Church took place in the year 67, under Nero, the sixth emperor of Rome. This monarch reigned for the space of five years, with tolerable credit to himself, but then gave way to the greatest extravagancy of temper, and to the most atrocious barbarities. Among other diabolical whims, he ordered that the city of Rome should be set on fire, which order was executed by his officers, guards, and servants. While the imperial city was in flames, he went up to the tower of Macaenas, played upon his harp, sung the song of the burning of Troy, and openly declared that 'he wished the ruin of all things before his death.' Besides the noble pile, called the Circus, many other palaces and houses were consumed; several thousands perished in the flames, were smothered in the smoke, or buried beneath the ruins.

This dreadful conflagration continued nine days; when Nero, finding that his conduct was greatly blamed, and a severe odium cast upon him, determined to lay the whole upon the Christians, at once to excuse himself, and have an opportunity of glutting his sight with new cruelties. This was the occasion of the first persecution; and the barbarities exercised on the Christians were such as even excited the commiseration of the Romans themselves. Nero even refined upon cruelty, and contrived all manner of punishments for the Christians that the most infernal imagination could design. In particular, he had some sewed up in skins of wild beasts, and then worried by dogs until they expired; and others dressed in shirts made stiff with wax, fixed to axletrees, and set on fire in his gardens, in order to illuminate them. This persecution was general throughout the whole Roman Empire; but it rather increased than diminished the spirit of Christianity. In the course of it, St. Paul and St. Peter were martyred.

To their names may be added, Erastus, chamberlain of Corinth; Aristarchus, the Macedonian, and Trophimus, an Ephesians, converted by St. Paul, and fellow-laborer with him, Joseph, commonly called Barsabas, and Ananias, bishop of Damascus; each of the Seventy.
The Second Persecution, Under Domitian, A.D. 81The emperor Domitian, who was naturally inclined to cruelty, first slew his brother, and then raised the second persecution against the Christians. In his rage he put to death some of the Roman senators, some through malice; and others to confiscate their estates. He then commanded all the lineage of David be put to death.

Among the numerous martyrs that suffered during this persecution was Simeon, bishop of Jerusalem, who was crucified; and St. John, who was boiled in oil, and afterward banished to Patmos. Flavia, the daughter of a Roman senator, was likewise banished to Pontus; and a law was made, ""That no Christian, once brought before the tribunal, should be exempted from punishment without renouncing his religion.""

A variety of fabricated tales were, during this reign, composed in order to injure the Christians. Such was the infatuation of the pagans, that, if famine, pestilence, or earthquakes afflicted any of the Roman provinces, it was laid upon the Christians. These persecutions among the Christians increased the number of informers and many, for the sake of gain, swore away the lives of the innocent.

Another hardship was, that, when any Christians were brought before the magistrates, a test oath was proposed, when, if they refused to take it, death was pronounced against them; and if they confessed themselves Christians, the sentence was the same.

The following were the most remarkable among the numerous martyrs who suffered during this persecution.

Dionysius, the Areopagite, was an Athenian by birth, and educated in all the useful and ornamental literature of Greece. He then travelled to Egypt to study astronomy, and made very particular observations on the great and supernatural eclipse, which happened at the time of our Savior's crucifixion.

The sanctity of his conversation and the purity of his manners recommended him so strongly to the Christians in general, that he was appointed bishop of Athens.

Nicodemus, a benevolent Christian of some distinction, suffered at Rome during the rage of Domitian's persecution.

Protasius and Gervasius were martyred at Milan.

Timothy was the celebrated disciple of St. Paul, and bishop of Ephesus, where he zealously governed the Church until A.D. 97. At this period, as the pagans were about to celebrate a feast called Catagogion, Timothy, meeting the procession, severely reproved them for their ridiculous idolatry, which so exasperated the people that they fell upon him with their clubs, and beat him in so dreadful a manner that he expired of the bruises two days later.
The Third Persecution, Under Trajan, A.D. 108In the third persecution Pliny the Second, a man learned and famous, seeing the lamentable slaughter of Christians, and moved therewith to pity, wrote to Trajan, certifying him that there were many thousands of them daily put to death, of which none did any thing contrary to the Roman laws worthy of persecution. ""The whole account they gave of their crime or error (whichever it is to be called) amounted only to this-viz. that they were accustomed on a stated day to meet before daylight, and to repeat together a set form of prayer to Christ as a God, and to bind themselves by an obligation-not indeed to commit wickedness; but, on the contrary-never to commit theft, robbery, or adultery, never to falsify their word, never to defraud any man: after which it was their custom to separate, and reassemble to partake in common of a harmless meal.""

In this persecution suffered the blessed martyr, Ignatius, who is held in famous reverence among very many. This Ignatius was appointed to the bishopric of Antioch next after Peter in succession. Some do say, that he, being sent from Syria to Rome, because he professed Christ, was given to the wild beasts to be devoured. It is also said of him, that when he passed through Asia, being under the most strict custody of his keepers, he strengthened and confirmed the churches through all the cities as he went, both with his exhortations and preaching of the Word of God. Accordingly, having come to Smyrna, he wrote to the Church at Rome, exhorting them not to use means for his deliverance from martyrdom, lest they should deprive him of that which he most longed and hoped for. ""Now I begin to be a disciple. I care for nothing, of visible or invisible things, so that I may but win Christ. Let fire and the cross, let the companies of wild beasts, let breaking of bones and tearing of limbs, let the grinding of the whole body, and all the malice of the devil, come upon me; be it so, only may I win Christ Jesus!"" And even when he was sentenced to be thrown to the beasts, such as the burning desire that he had to suffer, that he spake, what time he heard the lions roaring, saying: ""I am the wheat of Christ: I am going to be ground with the teeth of wild beasts, that I may be found pure bread.""

Trajan being succeeded by Adrian, the latter continued this third persecution with as much severity as his predecessor. About this time Alexander, bishop of Rome, with his two deacons, were martyred; as were Quirinus and Hernes, with their families;

Zenon, a Roman nobleman, and about ten thousand other Christians.

In Mount Ararat many were crucified, crowned with thorns, and spears run into their sides, in imitation of Christ's passion. Eustachius, a brave and successful Roman commander, was by the emperor ordered to join in an idolatrous sacrifice to celebrate some of his own victories; but his faith (being a Christian in his heart) was so much greater than his vanity, that he nobly refused it. Enraged at the denial, the ungrateful emperor forgot the service of this skilful commander, and ordered him and his whole family to be martyred.

At the martyrdom of Faustines and Jovita, brothers and citizens of Brescia, their torments were so many, and their patience so great, that Calocerius, a pagan, beholding them, was struck with admiration, and exclaimed in a kind of ecstasy, ""Great is the God of the Christians!"" for which he was apprehended, and suffered a similar fate.

Many other similar cruelties and rigors were exercised against the Christians, until Quadratus, bishop of Athens, made a learned apology in their favor before the emperor, who happened to be there and Aristides, a philosopher of the same city, wrote an elegant epistle, which caused Adrian to relax in his severities, and relent in their favor.

Adrian dying A.D. 138, was succeeded by Antoninus Pius, one of the most amiable monarchs that ever reigned, and who stayed the persecutions against the Christians.
The Fourth Persecution, Under Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, A.D. 162Marcus Aurelius, followed about the year of our Lord 161, a man of nature more stern and severe; and, although in study of philosophy and in civil government no less commendable, yet, toward the Christians sharp and fierce; by whom was moved the fourth persecution.

The cruelties used in this persecution were such that many of the spectators shuddered with horror at the sight, and were astonished at the intrepidity of the sufferers. Some of the martyrs were obliged to pass, with their already wounded feet, over thorns, nails, sharp shells, etc. upon their points, others were scourged until their sinews and veins lay bare, and after suffering the most excruciating tortures that could be devised, they were destroyed by the most terrible deaths.

Germanicus, a young man, but a true Christian, being delivered to the wild beasts on account of his faith, behaved with such astonishing courage that several pagans became converts to a faith which inspired such fortitude.

Polycarp, the venerable bishop of Smyrna, hearing that persons were seeking for him, escaped, but was discovered by a child. After feasting the guards who apprehended him, he desired an hour in prayer, which being allowed, he prayed with such fervency, that his guards repented that they had been instrumental in taking him. He was, however, carried before the proconsul, condemned, and burnt in the market place.

The proconsul then urged him, saying, ""Swear, and I will release thee;--reproach Christ.""

Polycarp answered, ""Eighty and six years have I served him, and he never once wronged me; how then shall I blaspheme my King, Who hath saved me?"" At the stake to which he was only tied, but not nailed as usual, as he assured them he should stand immovable, the flames, on their kindling the fagots, encircled his body, like an arch, without touching him; and the executioner, on seeing this, was ordered to pierce him with a sword, when so great a quantity of blood flowed out as extinguished the fire. But his body, at the instigation of the enemies of the Gospel, especially Jews, was ordered to be consumed in the pile, and the request of his friends, who wished to give it Christian burial, rejected. They nevertheless collected his bones and as much of his remains as possible, and caused them to be decently interred.

Metrodorus, a minister, who preached boldly, and Pionius, who made some excellent apologies for the Christian faith, were likewise burnt. Carpus and Papilus, two worthy Christians, and Agatonica, a pious woman, suffered martyrdom at Pergamopolis, in Asia.

Felicitatis, an illustrious Roman lady, of a considerable family, and the most shining virtues, was a devout Christian. She had seven sons, whom she had educated with the most exemplary piety.

Januarius, the eldest, was scourged, and pressed to death with weights; Felix and Philip, the two next had their brains dashed out with clubs; Silvanus, the fourth, was murdered by being thrown from a precipice; and the three younger sons, Alexander, Vitalis, and Martial, were beheaded. The mother was beheaded with the same sword as the three latter.

Justin, the celebrated philosopher, fell a martyr in this persecution. He was a native of Neapolis, in Samaria, and was born A.D. 103. Justin was a great lover of truth, and a universal scholar; he investigated the Stoic and Peripatetic philosophy, and attempted the Pythagorean; but the behavior of our of its professors disgusting him, he applied himself to the Platonic, in which he took great delight. About the year 133, when he was thirty years of age, he became a convert to Christianity, and then, for the first time, perceived the real nature of truth.

He wrote an elegant epistle to the Gentiles, and employed his talents in convincing the Jews of the truth of the Christian rites; spending a great deal of time in travelling, until he took up his abode in Rome, and fixed his habitation upon the Viminal mount.

He kept a public school, taught many who afterward became great men, and wrote a treatise to confuse heresies of all kinds. As the pagans began to treat the Christians with great severity, Justin wrote his first apology in their favor. This piece displays great learning and genius, and occasioned the emperor to publish an edict in favor of the Christians.

Soon after, he entered into frequent contests with Crescens, a person of a vicious life and conversation, but a celebrated cynic philosopher; and his arguments appeared so powerful, yet disgusting to the cynic, that he resolved on, and in the sequel accomplished, his destruction.

The second apology of Justin, upon certain severities, gave Crescens the cynic an opportunity of prejudicing the emperor against the writer of it; upon which Justin, and six of his companions, were apprehended. Being commanded to sacrifice to the pagan idols, they refused, and were condemned to be scourged, and then beheaded; which sentence was executed with all imaginable severity.

Several were beheaded for refusing to sacrifice to the image of Jupiter; in particular Concordus, a deacon of the city of Spolito.

Some of the restless northern nations having risen in arms against Rome, the emperor marched to encounter them. He was, however, drawn into an ambuscade, and dreaded the loss of his whole army. Enveloped with mountains, surrounded by enemies, and perishing with thirst, the pagan deities were invoked in vain; when the men belonging to the militine, or thundering legion, who were all Christians, were commanded to call upon their God for succor. A miraculous deliverance immediately ensued; a prodigious quantity of rain fell, which, being caught by the men, and filling their dykes, afforded a sudden and astonishing relief. It appears that the storm which miraculously flashed in the face of the enemy so intimidated them, that part deserted to the Roman army; the rest were defeated, and the revolted provinces entirely recovered.

This affair occasioned the persecution to subside for some time, at least in those parts immediately under the inspection of the emperor; but we find that it soon after raged in France, particularly at Lyons, where the tortures to which many of the Christians were put, almost exceed the powers of description.

The principal of these martyrs were Vetius Agathus, a young man; Blandina, a Christian lady, of a weak constitution; Sanctus, a deacon of Vienna; red hot plates of brass were placed upon the tenderest parts of his body; Biblias, a weak woman, once an apostate. Attalus, of Pergamus; and Pothinus, the venerable bishop of Lyons, who was ninety years of age. Blandina, on the day when she and the three other champions were first brought into the amphitheater, she was suspended on a piece of wood fixed in the ground, and exposed as food for the wild beasts; at which time, by her earnest prayers, she encouraged others. But none of the wild beasts would touch her, so that she was remanded to prison. When she was again produced for the third and last time, she was accompanied by Ponticus, a youth of fifteen, and the constancy of their faith so enraged the multitude that neither the sex of the one nor the youth of the other were respected, being exposed to all manner of punishments and tortures. Being strengthened by Blandina, he persevered unto death; and she, after enduring all the torments heretofore mentioned, was at length slain with the sword.

When the Christians, upon these occasions, received martyrdom, they were ornamented, and crowned with garlands of flowers; for which they, in heaven, received eternal crowns of glory.

It has been said that the lives of the early Christians consisted of ""persecution above ground and prayer below ground."" Their lives are expressed by the Coliseum and the catacombs. Beneath Rome are the excavations which we call the catacombs, whivch were at once temples and tombs. The early Church of Rome might well be called the Church of the Catacombs. There are some sixty catacombs near Rome, in which some six hundred miles of galleries have been traced, and these are not all. These galleries are about eight feet high and from three to five feet wide, containing on either side several rows of long, low, horizontal recesses, one above another like berths in a ship. In these the dead bodies were placed and the front closed, either by a single marble slab or several great tiles laid in mortar. On these slabs or tiles, epitaphs or symbols are graved or painted. Both pagans and Christians buried their dead in these catacombs. When the Christian graves have been opened the skeletons tell their own terrible tale. Heads are found severed from the body, ribs and shoulder blades are broken, bones are often calcined from fire. But despite the awful story of persecution that we may read here, the inscriptions breathe forth peace and joy and triumph. Here are a few:

""Here lies Marcia, put to rest in a dream of peace.""

""Lawrence to his sweetest son, borne away of angels.""

""Victorious in peace and in Christ.""

""Being called away, he went in peace.""

Remember when reading these inscriptions the story the skeletons tell of persecution, of torture, and of fire.

But the full force of these epitaphs is seen when we contrast them with the pagan epitaphs, such as:

""Live for the present hour, since we are sure of nothing else.""

""I lift my hands against the gods who took me away at the age of twenty though I had done no harm.""

""Once I was not. Now I am not. I know nothing about it, and it is no concern of mine.""

""Traveler, curse me not as you pass, for I am in darkness and cannot answer.""

The most frequent Christian symbols on the walls of the catacombs, are, the good shepherd with the lamb on his shoulder, a ship under full sail, harps, anchors, crowns, vines, and above all the fish.
The Fifth Persecution, Commencing with Severus, A.D. 192Severus, having been recovered from a severe fit of sickness by a Christian, became a great favorer of the Christians in general; but the prejudice and fury of the ignorant multitude prevailing, obsolete laws were put in execution against the Christians. The progress of Christianity alarmed the pagans, and they revived the stale calumny of placing accidental misfortunes to the account of its professors, A.D. 192.

But, though persecuting malice raged, yet the Gospel shone with resplendent brightness; and, firm as an impregnable rock, withstood the attacks of its boisterous enemies with success. Tertullian, who lived in this age, informs us that if the Christians had collectively withdrawn themselves from the Roman territories, the empire would have been greatly depopulated.

Victor, bishop of Rome, suffered martyrdom in the first year of the third century, A.D. 201. Leonidus, the father of the celebrated Origen, was beheaded for being a Christian. Many of Origen's hearers likewise suffered martyrdom; particularly two brothers, named Plutarchus and Serenus; another Serenus, Heron, and Heraclides, were beheaded. Rhais had boiled pitch poured upon her head, and was then burnt, as was Marcella her mother. Potainiena, the sister of Rhais, was executed in the same manner as Rhais had been; but Basilides, an officer belonging to the army, and ordered to attend her execution, became her convert.

Basilides being, as an officer, required to take a certain oath, refused, saying, that he could not swear by the Roman idols, as he was a Christian. Struck with surpsie, the people could not, at first, believe what they heard; but he had no sooner confirmed the same, than he was dragged before the judge, committed to prison, and speedily afterward beheaded.

Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons, was born in Greece, and received both a polite and a Christian education. It is generally supposed that the account of the persecutions at Lyons was written by himself. He succeeded the martyr Pothinus as bishop of Lyons, and ruled his diocese with great propriety; he was a zealous opposer of heresies in general, and, about A.D. 187, he wrote a celebrated tract against heresy. Victor, the bishop of Rome, wanting to impose the keeping of Easter there, in preference to other places, it occasioned some disorders among the Christians. In particular, Irenaeus wrote him a synodical epistle, in the name of the Gallic churches. This zeal, in favor of Christianity, pointed him out as an object of resentment to the emperor; and in A.D. 202, he was beheaded.

The persecutions now extending to Africa, many were martyred in that quarter of the globe; the most particular of whom we shall mention.

Perpetua, a married lady, of about twenty-two years. Those who suffered with her were, Felicitas, a married lady, big with child at the time of her being apprehended, and Revocatus, catechumen of Carthage, and a slave. The names of the other prisoners, destined to suffer upon this occasion, were Saturninus, Secundulus, and Satur. On the day appointed for their execution, they were led to the amphitheater. Satur, Saturninus, and Revocatus were ordered to run the gauntlet between the hunters, or such as had the care of the wild beasts. The hunters being drawn up in two ranks, they ran between, and were severely lashed as they passed. Felicitas and Perpetua were stripped, in order to be thrown to a mad bull, which made his first attack upon Perpetua, and stunned her; he then darted at Felicitas, and gored her dreadfully; but not killing them, the executioner did that office with a sword. Revocatus and Satur were destroyed by wild beasts; Saturninus was beheaded; and Secundulus died in prison. These executions were in the 205, on the eighth day of March.

Speratus and twelve others were likewise beheaded; as was Andocles in France. Asclepiades, bishop of Antioch, suffered many tortures, but his life was spared.

Cecilia, a young lady of good family in Rome, was married to a gentleman named Valerian. She converted her husband and brother, who were beheaded; and the maximus, or officer, who led them to execution, becoming their convert, suffered the same fate. The lady was placed naked in a scalding bath, and having continued there a considerable time, her head was struck off with a sword, A.D. 222.

Calistus, bishop of Rome, was martyred, A.D. 224; but the manner of his death is not recorded; and Urban, bishop of Rome, met the same fate A.D. 232.
The Sixth Persecution, Under Maximus, A.D. 235A.D. 235, was in the time of Maximinus. In Cappadocia, the president, Seremianus, did all he could to exterminate the Christians from that province.

The principal persons who perished under this reign were Pontianus, bishop of Rome; Anteros, a Grecian, his successor, who gave offence to the government by collecting the acts of the martyrs, Pammachius and Quiritus, Roman senators, with all their families, and many other Christians; Simplicius, senator;

Calepodius, a Christian minister, thrown into the Tyber; Martina, a noble and beautiful virgin; and Hippolitus, a Christian prelate, tied to a wild horse, and dragged until he expired.

During this persecution, raised by Maximinus, numberless Christians were slain without trial, and buried indiscriminately in heaps, sometimes fifty or sixty being cast into a pit together, without the least decency.

The tyrant Maximinus dying, A.D. 238, was succeeded by Gordian, during whose reign, and that of his successor Philip, the Church was free from persecution for the space of more than ten years; but in A.D. 249, a violent persecution broke out in Alexandria, at the instigation of a pagan priest, without the knowledge of the emperor.
The Seventh Persecution, Under Decius, A.D. 249This was occasioned partly by the hatred he bore to his predecessor Philip, who was deemed a Christian and was partly by his jealousy concerning the amazing increase of Christianity; for the heathen temples began to be forsaken, and the Christian churches thronged.

These reasons stimulated Decius to attempt the very extirpation of the name of Christian; and it was unfortunate for the Gospel, that many errors had, about this time, crept into the Church: the Christians were at variance with each other; self-interest divided those whom social love ought to have united; and the virulence of pride occasioned a variety of factions.

The heathens in general were ambitious to enforce the imperial decrees upon this occasion, and looked upon the murder of a Christian as a merit to themselves. The martyrs, upon this occasion, were innumerable; but the principal we shall give some account of.

Fabian, the bishop of Rome, was the first person of eminence who felt the severity of this persecution. The deceased emperor, Philip, had, on account of his integrity, committed his treasure to the care of this good man. But Decius, not finding as much as his avarice made him expect, determined to wreak his vengeance on the good prelate. He was accordingly seized; and on January 20, A.D. 250, he suffered decapitation.

Julian, a native of Cilicia, as we are informed by St.

Chrysostom, was seized upon for being a Christian. He was put into a leather bag, together with a number of serpents and scorpions, and in that condition thrown into the sea.

Peter, a young man, amiable for the superior qualities of his body and mind, was beheaded for refusing to sacrifice to Venus. He said, ""I am astonished you should sacrifice to an infamous woman, whose debaucheries even your own historians record, and whose life consisted of such actions as your laws would punish. No, I shall offer the true God the acceptable sacrifice of praises and prayers."" Optimus, the proconsul of Asia, on hearing this, ordered the prisoner to be stretched upon a wheel, by which all his bones were broken, and then he was sent to be beheaded.

Nichomachus, being brought before the proconsul as a Christian, was ordered to sacrifice to the pagan idols. Nichomachus replied, ""I cannot pay that respect to devils, which is only due to the Almighty."" This speech so much enraged the proconsul that Nichomachus was put to the rack. After enduring the torments for a time, he recanted; but scarcely had he given this proof of his frailty, than he fell into the greatest agonies, dropped down on the ground, and expired immediately.

Denisa, a young woman of only sixteen years of age, who beheld this terrible judgment, suddenly exclaimed, ""O unhappy wretch, why would you buy a moment's ease at the expense of a miserable eternity!"" Optimus, hearing this, called to her, and Denisa avowing herself to be a Christian, she was beheaded, by his order, soon after.

Andrew and Paul, two companions of Nichomachus, the martyr, A.D. 251, suffered martyrdom by stoning, and expired, calling on their blessed Redeemer.

Alexander and Epimachus, of Alexandria, were apprehended for being Christians: and, confessing the accusation, were beat with staves, torn with hooks, and at length burnt in the fire; and we are informed, in a fragment preserved by Eusebius, that four female martyrs suffered on the same day, and at the same place, but not in the same manner; for these were beheaded.

Lucian and Marcian, two wicked pagans, though skilful magicians, becoming converts to Christianity, to make amends for their former errors, lived the lives of hermits, and subsisted upon bread and water only. After some time spent in this manner, they became zealous preachers, and made many converts. The persecution, however, raging at this time, they were seized upon, and carried before Sabinus, the governor of Bithynia. On being asked by what authority they took upon themselves to preach, Lucian answered, 'That the laws of charity and humanity obliged all men to endeavor the conversion of their neighbors, and to do everything in their power to rescue them from the snares of the devil.'

Lucian having answered in this manner, Marcian said, ""Their conversion was by the same grace which was given to St. Paul, who, from a zealous persecutor of the Church, became a preacher of the Gospel.""

The proconsul, finding that he could not prevail with them to renounce their faith, condemned them to be burnt alive, which sentence was soon after executed.

Trypho and Respicius, two eminent men, were seized as Christians, and imprisoned at Nice. Their feet were pierced with nails; they were dragged through the streets, scourged, torn with iron hooks, scorched with lighted torches, and at length beheaded, February 1, A.D. 251.

Agatha, a Sicilian lady, was not more remarkable for her personal and acquired endowments, than her piety; her beauty was such, that Quintian, governor of Sicily, became enamored of her, and made many attempts upon her chastity without success. In order to gratify his passions with the greater conveniency, he put the virtuous lady into the hands of Aphrodica, a very infamous and licentious woman. This wretch tried every artifice to win her to the desired prostitution; but found all her efforts were vain; for her chastity was impregnable, and she well knew that virtue alone could procure true happiness. Aphrodica acquainted Quintian with the inefficacy of her endeavors, who, enaged to be foiled in his designs, changed his lust into resentment. On her confessing that she was a Christian, he determined to gratify his revenge, as he could not his passion. Pursuant to his orders, she was scourged, burnt with red-hot irons, and torn with sharp hooks. Having borne these torments with admirable fortitude, she was next laid naked upon live coals, intermingled with glass, and then being carried back to prison, she there expired on February 5, 251.

Cyril, bishop of Gortyna, was seized by order of Lucius, the governor of that place, who, nevertheless, exhorted him to obey the imperial mandate, perform the sacrifices, and save his venerable person from destruction; for he was now eighty-four years of age. The good prelate replied that as he had long taught others to save their souls, he should only think now of his own salvation. The worthy prelate heard his fiery sentence without emotion, walked cheerfully to the place of execution, and underwent his martyrdom with great fortitude.

The persecution raged in no place more than the Island of Crete; for the governor, being exceedingly active in executing the imperial decrees, that place streamed with pious blood.

Babylas, a Christian of a liberal education, became bishop of Antioch, A.D. 237, on the demise of Zebinus. He acted with inimitable zeal, and governed the Church with admirable prudence during the most tempestuous times.

The first misfortune that happened to Antioch during his mission, was the siege of it by Sapor, king of Persia; who, having overrun all Syria, took and plundered this city among others, and used the Christian inhabitants with greater severity than the rest, but was soon totally defeated by Gordian.

After Gordian's death, in the reign of Decius, that emperor came to Antioch, where, having a desire to visit an assembly of Christians, Babylas opposed him, and absolutely refused to let him come in. The emperor dissembled his anger at that time; but soon sending for the bishop, he sharply reproved him for his insolence, and then ordered him to sacrifice to the pagan deities as an expiation for his ofence. This being refused, he was committed to prison, loaded with chains, treated with great severities, and then beheaded, together with three young men who had been his pupils. A.D. 251.

Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem, about this time was cast into prison on account of his religion, where he died through the severity of his confinement.

Julianus, an old man, lame with the gout, and Cronion, another Christian, were bound on the backs of camels, severely scourged, and then thrown into a fire and consumed. Also forty virgins, at Antioch, after being imprisoned, and scourged, were burnt.

In the year of our Lord 251, the emperor Decius having erected a pagan temple at Ephesus, he commanded all who were in that city to sacrifice to the idols. This order was nobly refused by seven of his own soldiers, viz. Maximianus, Martianus, Joannes, Malchus, Dionysius, Seraion, and Constantinus. The emperor wishing to win these soldiers to renounce their faith by his entreaties and lenity, gave them a considerable respite until he returned from an expedition. During the emperor's absence, they escaped, and hid themselves in a cavern; which the emperor being informed of at his return, the mouth of the cave was closed up, and they all perished with hunger.

Theodora, a beautiful young lady of Antioch, on refusing to sacrifice to the Roman idols, was condemned to the stews, that her virtue might be sacrificed to the brutality of lust. Didymus, a Christian, disguised himself in the habit of a Roman soldier, went to the house, informed Theodora who he was, and advised her to make her escape in his clothes. This being effected, and a man found in the brothel instead of a beautiful lady, Didymus was taken before the president, to whom confessing the truth, and owning that he was a Christian the sentence of death was immediately pronounced against him. Theodora, hearing that her deliverer was likely to suffer, came to the judge, threw herself at his feet, and begged that the sentence might fall on her as the guilty person; but, deaf to the cries of the innocent, and insensible to the calls of justice, the inflexible judge condemned both; when they were executed accordingly, being first beheaded, and their bodies afterward burnt.

Secundianus, having been accused as a Christian, was conveyed to prison by some soldiers. On the way, Verianus and Marcellinus said, ""Where are you carrying the innocent?"" This interrogatory occasioned them to be seized, and all three, after having been tortured, were hanged and decapitated.

Origen, the celebrated presbyter and catechist of Alexandria, at the age of sixty-four, was seized, thrown into a loathsome prison, laden with fetters, his feet placed in the stocks, and his legs extended to the utmost for several successive days. He was threatened with fire, and tormented by every lingering means the most infernal imaginations could suggest. During this cruel temporizing, the emperor Decius died, and Gallus, who succeeded him, engaging in a war with the Goths, the Christians met with a respite. In this interim, Origen obtained his enlargement, and, retiring to Tyre, he there remained until his death, which happened when he was in the sixty-ninth year of his age.

Gallus, the emperor, having concluded his wars, a plague broke out in the empire: sacrifices to the pagan deities were ordered by the emperor, and persecutions spread from the interior to the extreme parts of the empire, and many fell martyrs to the impetuosity of the rabble, as well as the prejudice of the magistrates. Among these were Cornelius, the Christian bishop of Rome, and Lucius, his successor, in 253.

Most of the errors which crept into the Church at this time arose from placing human reason in competition with revelation; but the fallacy of such arguments being proved by the most able divines, the opinions they had created vanished away like the stars before the sun.
The Eighth Persecution, Under Valerian, A.D. 257Began under Valerian, in the month of April, 257, and continued for three years and six months. The martyrs that fell in this persecution were innumerable, and their tortures and deaths as various and painful. The most eminent martyrs were the following, though neither rank, sex, nor age were regarded.

Rufina and Secunda were two beautiful and accomplished ladies, daughters of Asterius, a gentleman of eminence in Rome. Rufina, the elder, was designed in marriage for Armentarius, a young nobleman; Secunda, the younger, for Verinus, a person of rank and opulence. The suitors, at the time of the persecution's commencing, were both Christians; but when danger appeared, to save their fortunes, they renounced their faith. They took great pains to persuade the ladies to do the same, but, disappointed in their purpose, the lovers were base enough to inform against the ladies, who, being apprehended as Christians, were brought before Junius Donatus, governor of Rome, where, A.D. 257, they sealed their martyrdom with their blood.

Stephen, bishop of Rome, was beheaded in the same year, and about that time Saturninus, the pious orthodox bishop of Toulouse, refusing to sacrifice to idols, was treated with all the barbarous indignities imaginable, and fastened by the feet to the tail of a bull. Upon a signal given, the enraged animal was driven down the steps of the temple, by which the worthy martyr's brains were dashed out.

Sextus succeeded Stephen as bishop of Rome. He is supposed to have been a Greek by birth or by extraction, and had for some time served in the capacity of a deacon under Stephen. His great fidelity, singular wisdom, and uncommon courage distinguished him upon many occasions; and the happy conclusion of a controversy with some heretics is generally ascribed to his piety and prudence. In the year 258, Marcianus, who had the management of the Roman government, procured an order from the emperor Valerian, to put to death all the Christian clergy in Rome, and hence the bishop with six of his deacons, suffered martyrdom in 258.

Let us draw near to the fire of martyred Lawrence, that our cold hearts may be warmed thereby. The merciless tyrant, understanding him to be not only a minister of the sacraments, but a distributor also of the Church riches, promised to himself a double prey, by the apprehension of one soul. First, with the rake of avarice to scrape to himself the treasure of poor Christians; then with the fiery fork of tyranny, so to toss and turmoil them, that they should wax weary of their profession. With furious face and cruel countenance, the greedy wolf demanded where this Lawrence had bestowed the substance of the Church: who, craving three days' respite, promised to declare where the treasure might be had. In the meantime, he caused a good number of poor Christians to be congregated. So, when the day of his answer was come, the persecutor strictly charged him to stand to his promise. Then valiant Lawrence, stretching out his arms over the poor, said: ""These are the precious treasure of the Church; these are the treasure indeed, in whom the faith of Christ reigneth, in whom Jesus Christ hath His mansion-place. What more precious jewels can Christ have, than those in whom He hath promised to dwell? For so it is written, 'I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in.' And again, 'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.' What greater riches can Christ our Master possess, than the poor people in whom He loveth to be seen?""

O, what tongue is able to express the fury and madness of the tyrant's heart! Now he stamped, he stared, he ramped, he fared as one out of his wits: his eyes like fire glowed, his mouth like a boar formed, his teeth like a hellhound grinned. Now, not a reasonable man, but a roaring lion, he might be called.

""Kindle the fire (he cried)--of wood make no spare. Hath this villain deluded the emperor? Away with him, away with him: whip him with scourges, jerk him with rods, buffet him with fists, brain him with clubs. Jesteth the traitor with the emperor? Pinch him with fiery tongs, gird him with burning plates, bring out the strongest chains, and the fire-forks, and the grated bed of iron: on the fire with it; bind the rebel hand and foot; and when the bed is fire-hot, on with him: roast him, broil him, toss him, turn him: on pain of our high displeasure do every man his office, O ye tormentors.""

The word was no sooner spoken, but all was done. After many cruel handlings, this meek lamb was laid, I will not say on his fiery bed of iron, but on his soft bed of down. So mightily God wrought with his martyr Lawrence, so miraculously God tempered His element the fire; that it became not a bed of consuming pain, but a pallet of nourishing rest.

In Africa the persecution raged with peculiar violence; many thousands received the crown of martyrdom, among whom the following were the most distinguished characters:

Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, an eminent prelate, and a pious ornament of the Church. The brightness of his genius was tempered by the solidity of his judgment; and with all the accomplishments of the gentleman, he blended the virtues of a Christian. His doctrines were orthodox and pure; his language easy and elegant; and his manners graceful and winning: in fine, he was both the pious and polite preacher. In his youth he was educated in the principles of Gentilism, and having a considerable fortune, he lived in the very extravagance of splendor, and all the dignity of pomp.

About the year 246, Coecilius, a Christian minister of Carthage, became the happy instrument of Cyprian's conversion: on which account, and for the great love that he always afterward bore for the author of his conversion, he was termed Coecilius Cyprian. Previous to his baptism, he studied the Scriptures with care and being struck with the beauties of the truths they contained, he determined to practise the virtues therein recommended. Subsequent to his baptism, he sold his estate, distributed the money among the poor, dressed himself in plain attire, and commenced a life of austerity. He was soon after made a presbyter; and, being greatly admired for his virtues and works, on the death of Donatus, in A.D. 248, he was almost unanimously elected bishop of Carthage.

Cyprian's care not only extended over Carthage, but to Numidia and Mauritania. In all his transactions he took great care to ask the advice of his clergy, knowing that unanimity alone could be of service to the Church, this being one of his maxims, ""That the bishop was in the church, and the church in the bishop; so that unity can only be preserved by a close connexion between the pastor and his flock.""

In A.D. 250, Cyprian was publicly proscribed by the emperor Decius, under the appellation of Coecilius Cyprian, bishop of the Christrians; and the universal cry of the pagans was, ""Cyprian to the lions, Cyprian to the beasts."" The bishop, however, withdrew from the rage of the populace, and his effects were immediately confiscated. During his retirement, he wrote thirty pious and elegant letters to his flock; but several schisms that then crept into the Church, gave him great uneasiness. The rigor of the persecution abating, he returned to Carthage, and did everything in his power to expunge erroneous opinions. A terrible plague breaking out in Carthage, it was as usual, laid to the charge of the Christians; and the magistrates began to persecute accordingly, which occasioned an epistle from them to Cyprian, in answer to which he vindicates the cause of Christianity. A.D. 257, Cyprian was brought before the proconsul Aspasius Paturnus, who exiled him to a little city on the Lybian sea. On the death of this proconsul, he returned to Carthage, but was soon after seized, and carried before the new governor, who condemned him to be beheaded; which sentence was executed on the fourteenth of September, A.D. 258.

The disciples of Cyprian, martyred in this persecution, were Lucius, Flavian, Victoricus, Remus, Montanus, Julian, Primelus, and Donatian.

At Utica, a most terrible tragedy was exhibited: three hundred Christians were, by the orders of the proconsul, placed round a burning limekiln. A pan of coals and incense being prepared, they were commanded either to sacrifice to Jupiter, or to be thrown into the kiln. Unanimously refusing, they bravely jumped into the pit, and were immediately suffocated.

Fructuosus, bishop of Tarragon, in Spain, and his two deacons, Augurius and Eulogius, were burnt for being Christians.

Alexander, Malchus, and Priscus, three Christians of Palestine, with a woman of the same place, voluntarily accused themselves of being Christians; on which account they were sentenced to be devoured by tigers, which sentence was executed accordingly.

Maxima, Donatilla, and Secunda, three virgins of Tuburga, had gall and vinegar given them to drink, were then severely scourged, tormented on a gibbet, rubbed with lime, scorched on a gridiron, worried by wild beasts, and at length beheaded.

It is here proper to take notice of the singular but miserable fate of the emperor Valerian, who had so long and so terribly persecuted the Christians. This tyrant, by a stretagem, was taken prisoner by Sapor, emperor of Persia, who carried him into his own country, and there treated him with the most unexampled indignity, making him kneel down as the meanest slave, and treading upon him as a footstool when he mounted his horse. After having kept him for the space of seven years in this abject state of slavery, he caused his eyes to be put out, though he was then eighty-three years of age. This not satiating his desire of revenge, he soon after ordered his body to be flayed alive, and rubbed with salt, under which torments he expired; and thus fell one of the most tyrannical emperors of Rome, and one of the greatest persecutors of the Christians.

A.D. 260, Gallienus, the son of Valerian, succeeded him, and during his reign (a few martyrs excepted) the Church enjoyed peace for some years.
The Ninth Persecution Under Aurelian, A.D. 274The principal sufferers were: Felix, bishop of Rome. This prelate was advanced to the Roman see in 274. He was the first martyr to Aurelian's petulancy, being beheaded on the twenty-second of December, in the same year.

Agapetus, a young gentleman, who sold his estate, and gave the money to the poor, was seized as a Christian, tortured, and then beheaded at Praeneste, a city within a day's journey of Rome.

These are the only martyrs left upon record during this reign, as it was soon put to a stop by the emperor's being murdered by his own domestics, at Byzantium.

Aurelian was succeeded by Tacitus, who was followed by Probus, as the latter was by Carus: this emperor being killed by a thunder storm, his sons, Carnious and Numerian, succeeded him, and during all these reigns the Church had peace.

Diocletian mounted the imperial throne, A.D. 284; at first he showed great favor to the Christians. In the year 286, he associated Maximian with him in the empire; and some Christians were put to death before any general persecution broke out. Among these were Felician and Primus, two brothers.

Marcus and Marcellianus were twins, natives of Rome, and of noble descent. Their parents were heathens, but the tutors, to whom the education of the children was intrusted, brought them up as Christians. Their constancy at length subdued those who wished them to become pagans, and their parents and whole family became converts to a faith they had before reprobated. They were martyred by being tied to posts, and having their feet pierced with nails. After remaining in this situation for a day and a night, their sufferings were put an end to by thrusting lances through their bodies.

Zoe, the wife of the jailer, who had the care of the before-mentioned martyrs, was also converted by them, and hung upon a tree, with a fire of straw lighted under her. When her body was taken down, it was thrown into a river, with a large stone tied to it, in order to sink it.

In the year of Christ 286, a most remarkable affair occurred; a legion of soldiers, consisting of six thousand six hundred and sixty-six men, contained none but Christians. This legion was called the Theban Legion, because the men had been raised in Thebias: they were quartered in the east until the emperor Maximian ordered them to march to Gaul, to assist him against the rebels of Burgundy. They passed the Alps into Gaul, under the command of Mauritius, Candidus, and Exupernis, their worthy commanders, and at length joined the emperor. Maximian, about this time, ordered a general sacrifice, at which the whole army was to assist; and likewise he commanded that they should take the oath of allegiance and swear, at the saame time, to assist in the extirpation of Christianity in Gaul. Alarmed at these orders, each individual of the Theban Legion absolutely refused either to sacrifice or take the oaths prescribed. This so greatly enraged Maximian, that he ordered the legion to be decimated, that is, every tenth man to be selected from the rest, and put to the sword. This bloody order having been put in execution, those who remained alive were still inflexible, when a second decimation took place, and every tenth man of those living was put to death. This second severity made no more impression than the first had done; the soldiers preserved their fortitude and their principles, but by the advice of their officers they drew up a loyal remonstrance to the emperor. This, it might have been presumed, would have softened the emperor, but it had a contrary effect: for, enraged at their perseverance and unanimity, he commanded that the whole legion should be put to death, which was accordingly executed by the other troops, who cut them to pieces with their swords, September 22, 286.

Alban, from whom St. Alban's, in Hertfordshire, received its name, was the first British martyr. Great Britain had received the Gospel of Christ from Lucius, the first Christian king, but did not suffer from the rage of persecution for many years after. He was originally a pagan, but converted by a Christian ecclesiastic, named Amphibalus, whom he sheltered on account of his religion. The enemies of Amphibalus, having intelligence of the place where he was secreted, came to the house of Alban; in order to facilitate his escape, when the soldiers came, he offered himself up as the person they were seeking for. The deceit being detected, the governor ordered him to be scourged, and then he was sentenced to be beheaded, June 22, A.D. 287.

The venerable Bede assures us, that, upon this occasion, the executioner suddenly became a convert to Christianity, and entreated permission to die for Alban, or with him. Obtaining the latter request, they were beheaded by a soldier, who voluntarily undertook the task of executioner. This happened on the twenty-second of June, A.D. 287, at Verulam, now St. Alban's, in Hertfordshire, where a magnificent church was erected to his memory about the time of Constantine the Great. The edifice, being destroyed in the Saxon wars, was rebuilt by Offa, king of Mercia, and a monastery erected adjoining to it, some remains of which are still visible, and the church is a noble Gothic structure.

Faith, a Christian female, of Acquitain, in France, was ordered to be broiled upon a gridiron, and then beheaded; A.D. 287.

Quintin was a Christian, and a native of Rome, but determined to attempt the propagation of the Gospel in Gaul, with one Lucian, they preached together in Amiens; after which Lucian went to Beaumaris, where he was martyred. Quintin remained in Picardy, and was very zealous in his ministry. Being seized upon as a Christian, he was stretched with pullies until his joints were dislocated; his body was then torn with wire scourges, and boiling oil and pitch poured on his naked flesh; lighted torches were applied to his sides and armpits; and after he had been thus tortured, he was remanded back to prison, and died of the barbarities he had suffered, October 31, A.D. 287. His body was sunk in the Somme.
The Tenth Persecution, Under Diocletian, A.D. 303Under the Roman emperors, commonly called the Era of the Martyrs, was occasioned partly by the increasing number and luxury of the Christians, and the hatred of Galerius, the adopted son of Diocletian, who, being stimulated by his mother, a bigoted pagan, never ceased persuading the emperor to enter upon the persecution, until he had accomplished his purpose.

The fatal day fixed upon to commence the bloody work, was the twenty-third of February, A.D. 303, that being the day in which the Terminalia were celebrated, and on which, as the cruel pagans boasted, they hoped to put a termination to Christianity. On the appointed day, the persecution began in Nicomedia, on the morning of which the prefect of that city repaired, with a great number of officers and assistants, to the church of the Christians, where, having forced open the doors, they seized upon all the sacred books, and committed them to the flames.

The whole of this transaction was in the presence of Diocletian and Galerius, who, not contented with burning the books, had the church levelled with the ground. This was followed by a severe edict, commanding the destruction of all other Christian churches and books; and an order soon succeeded, to render Christians of all denomination outlaws.

The publication of this edict occasioned an immediate martyrdom, for a bold Christian not only tore it down from the place to which it was affixed, but execrated the name of the emperor for his injustice. A provocation like this was sufficient to call down pagan vengeance upon his head; he was accordingly seized, severely tortured, and then burned alive.

All the Christians were apprehended and imprisoned; and Galerius privately ordered the imperial palace to be set on fire, that the Christians might be charged as the incendiaries, and a plausible pretence given for carrying on the persecution with the greater severities. A general sacrifice was commenced, which occasioned various martyrdoms. No distinction was made of age or sex; the name of Christian was so obnoxious to the pagans that all indiscriminately fell sacrifices to their opinions. Many houses were set on fire, and whole Christian families perished in the flames; and others had stones fastened about their necks, and being tied together were driven into the sea. The persecution became general in all the Roman provinces, but more particularly in the east; and as it lasted ten years, it is impossible to ascertain the numbers martyred, or to enumerate the various modes of martyrdom.

Racks, scourges, swords, daggers, crosses, poison, and famine, were made use of in various parts to dispatch the Christians; and invention was exhausted to devise tortures against such as had no crime, but thinking differently from the votaries of superstition.

A city of Phrygia, consisting entirely of Christians, was burnt, and all the inhabitants perished in the flames.

Tired with slaughter, at length, several governors of provinces represented to the imperial court, the impropriety of such conduct. Hence many were respited from execution, but, though they were not put to death, as much as possible was done to render their lives miserable, many of them having their ears cut off, their noses slit, their right eyes put out, their limbs rendered useless by dreadful dislocations, and their flesh seared in conspicuous places with red-hot irons.

It is necessary now to particularize the most conspicious persons who laid down their lives in martyrdom in this bloody persecution.

Sebastian, a celebrated martyr, was born at Narbonne, in Gaul, instructed in the principles of Christianity at Milan, and afterward became an officer of the emperor's guard at Rome. He remained a true Christian in the midst of idolatry; unallured by the splendors of a court, untained by evil examples, and uncontaminated by the hopes of preferment. Refusing to be a pagan, the emperor ordered him to be taken to a field near the city, termed the Campus Martius, and there to be shot to death with arrows; which sentence was executed accordingly. Some pious Christians coming to the place of execution, in order to give his body burial, perceived signs of life in him, and immediately moving him to a place of security, they, in a short time effected his recovery, and prepared him for a second martyrdom; for, as soon as he was able to go out, he placed himself intentionally in the emperor's way as he was going to the temple, and reprehended him for his various cruelties and unreasonable prejudices against Christianity. As soon as Diocletian had overcome his surprise, he ordered Sebastian to be seized, and carried to a place near the palace, and beaten to death; and, that the Christians should not either use means again to recover or bury his body, he ordered that it should be thrown into the common sewer. Nevertheless, a Christian lady named Lucina, found means to remove it from the sewer, and bury it in the catacombs, or repositories of the dead.

The Christians, about this time, upon mature consideration, thought it unlawful to bear arms under a heathen emperor. Maximilian, the son of Fabius Victor, was the first beheaded under this regulation.

Vitus, a Sicilian of considerable family, was brought up a Christian; when his virtues increased with his years, his constancy supported him under all afflictions, and his faith was superior to the most dangerous perils. His father, Hylas, who was a pagan, finding that he had been instructed in the principles of Christianity by the nurse who brought him up, used all his endeavors to bring him back to paganism, and at length sacrificed his son to the idols, June 14, A.D. 303.

Victor was a Christian of a good family at Marseilles, in France; he spent a great part of the night in visiting the afflicted, and confirming the weak; which pious work he could not, consistently with his own safety, perform in the daytime; and his fortune he spent in relieving the distresses of poor Christians. He was at length, however, seized by the emperor Maximian's decree, who ordered him to be bound, and dragged through the streets. During the execution of this order, he was treated with all manner of cruelties and indignities by the enraged populace. Remaining still inflexible, his courage was deemed obstinacy. Being by order stretched upon the rack, he turned his eyes toward heaven, and prayed to God to endue him with patience, after which he underwent the tortures with most admirable fortitude. After the executioners were tired with inflicting torments on him, he was conveyed to a dungeon. In his confinement, he converted his jailers, named Alexander, Felician, and Longinus. This affair coming to the ears of the emperor, he ordered them immediately to be put to death, and the jailers were accordingly beheaded. Victor was then again put to the rack, unmercifully beaten with batoons, and again sent to prison. Being a third time examined concerning his religion, he persevered in his principles; a small altar was then brought, and he was commanded to offer incense upon it immediately. Fired with indignation at the request, he boldly stepped forward, and with his foot overthrew both altar and idol. This so enraged the emperor Maximian, who was present, that he ordered the foot with which he had kicked the altar to be immediately cut off; and Victor was thrown into a mill, and crushed to pieces with the stones, A.D. 303.

Maximus, governor of Cilicia, being at Tarsus, three Christians were brought before him; their names were Tarachus, an aged man, Probus, and Andronicus. After repeated tortures and exhortations to recant, they, at length, were ordered for execution.

Being brought to the amphitheater, several beasts were let loose upon them; but none of the animals, though hungry, would touch them. The keeper then brought out a large bear, that had that very day destroyed three men; but this voracious creature and a fierce lioness both refused to touch the prisoners. Finding the design of destroying them by the means of wild beasts ineffectual, Maximus ordered them to be slain by the sword, on October 11, A.D. 303.

Romanus, a native of Palestine, was deacon of the church of Caesarea at the time of the commencement of Diocletian's persecution. Being condemned for his faith at Antioch, he was scourged, put to the rack, his body torn with hooks, his flesh cut with knives, his face scarified, his teeth beaten from their sockets, and his hair plucked up by the roots. Soon after he was ordered to be strangled, November 17, A.D. 303.

Susanna, the niece of Caius, bishop of Rome, was pressed by the emperor Diocletian to marry a noble pagan, who was nearly related to him. Refusing the honor intended her, she was beheaded by the emperor's order.

Dorotheus, the high chamberlain of the household to Diocletian, was a Christian, and took great pains to make converts. In his religious labors, he was joined by Gorgonius, another Christian, and one belonging to the palace. They were first tortured and then strangled.

Peter, a eunuch belonging to the emperor, was a Christian of singular modesty and humility. He was laid on a gridiron, and broiled over a slow fire until he expired.

Cyprian, known by the title of the magician, to distinguish him from Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, was a native of Natioch. He received a liberal education in his youth, and particularly applied himself to astrology; after which he traveled for improvement through Greece, Egypt, India, etc. In the course of time he became acquainted with Justina, a young lady of Antioch, whose birth, beauty, and accomplishments, rendered her the admiration of all who knew her. A pagan gentleman applied to Cyprian, to promote his suit with the beautiful Justina; this he undertook, but soon himself became converted, burnt his books of astrology and magic, received baptism, and felt animated with a powerful spirit of grace. The conversion of Cyprian had a great effect on the pagan gentleman who paid his addresses to Justina, and he in a short time embraced Christianity. During the persecutions of Diocletian, Cyprian and Justina were seized upon as Chrisitans, the former was torn with pincers, and the latter chastised; and, after suffering other torments, both were beheaded.

Eulalia, a Spanish lady of a Christian family, was remarkable in her youth for sweetness of temper, and solidity of understanding seldom found in the capriciousness of juvenile years. Being apprehended as a Christian, the magistrate attempted by the mildest means, to bring her over to paganism, but she ridiculed the pagan deities with such asperity, that the judge, incensed at her behavior, ordered her to be tortured. Her sides were accordingly torn by hooks, and her breasts burnt in the most shocking manner, until she expired by the violence of the flames, December, A.D. 303.

In the year 304, when the persecution reached Spain, Dacian, the governor of Terragona, ordered Valerius the bishop, and Vincent the deacon, to be seized, loaded with irons, and imprisoned. The prisoners being firm in their resolution, Valerius was banished, and Vincent was racked, his limbs dislocated, his flesh torn with hooks, and he was laid on a gridiron, which had not only a fire placed under it, but spikes at the top, which ran into his flesh. These torments neither destroying him, nor changing his resolutions, he was remanded to prison, and confined ina small, loathsome, dark dungeon, strewed with sharp flints, and pieces of broken glass, where he died, January 22, 304. His body was thrown into the river.

The persecution of Diocletian began particularly to rage in A.D. 304, when many Christians were put to cruel tortures and the most painful and ignominious deaths; the most eminent and paritcular of whom we shall enumerate.

Saturninus, a priest of Albitina, a town of Africa, after being tortured, was remanded to prison, and there starved to death. His four children, after being variously tormented, shared the same fate with their father.

Dativas, a noble Roman senator; Thelico, a pious Christian;

Victoria, a young lady of considerable family and fortune, with some others of less consideration, all auditors of Saturninus, were tortured in a similar manner, and perished by the same means.

Agrape, Chionia, and Irene, three sisters, were seized upon at Thessalonica, when Diocletian's persecution reached Greece. They were burnt, and received the crown of martyrdom in the flames, March 25, A.D. 304. The governor, finding that he could make no impression on Irene, ordered her to be exposed naked in the streets, which shameful order having been executed, a fire was kindled near the city wall, amidst whose flames her spirit ascended beyond the reach of man's cruelty.

Agatho, a man of a pious turn of mind, with Cassice, Philippa, and Eutychia, were martyred about the same time; but the particulars have not been transmitted to us.

Marcellinus, bishop of Rome, who succeeded Caius in that see, having strongly opposed paying divine honors to Diocletian, suffered martyrdom, by a variety of tortures, in the year 324, conforting his soul until he expired with the prospect of these glorious rewards it would receive by the tortures suffered in the body.

Victorius, Carpophorus, Severus, and Severianus, were brothers, and all four employed in places of great trust and honor in the city of Rome. Having exclaimed against the worship of idols, they were apprehended, and scourged, with the plumbetae, or scourges, to the ends of which were fastened leaden balls. This punishment was exercised with such excess of cruelty that the pious brothers fell martyrs to its severity.

Timothy, a deacon of Mauritania, and Maura his wife, had not been united together by the bands of wedlock above three weeks, when they were separated from each other by the persecution. Timothy, being apprehended, as a Christian, was carried before Arrianus, the governor of Thebais, who, knowing that he had the keeping of the Holy Scriptures, commanded him to deliver them up to be burnt; to which he answered, ""Had I children, I would sooner deliver them up to be sacrificed, than part with the Word of God."" The governor being much incensed at this reply, ordered his eyes to be put out, with red-hot irons, saying, ""The books shall at least be useless to you, for you shall not see to read them."" His patience under the operation was so great that the governor grew more exasperated; he, therefore, in order, if possible, to overcome his fortitude, ordered him to be hung up by the feet, with a weight tied about his neck, and a gag in his mouth. In this state, Maura his wife, tenderly urged him for her sake to recant; but, when the gag was taken out of his mouth, instead of consenting to his wife's entreaties, he greatly blamed her mistaken love, and declared his resolution of dying for the faith. The consequence was, that Maura resolved to imitate his courage and fidelity and either to accompany or follow him to glory. The governor, after trying in vain to alter her resolution, ordered her to be tortured, which was executed with great severity. After this, Timothy and Maura were crucified near each other, A.D. 304.

Sabinus, bishop of Assisium, refusing to sacrifice to Jupiter, and pushing the idol from him, had his hand cut off by the order of the governor of Tuscany. While in prison, he converted the governor and his family, all of whom suffered martyrdom for the faith. Soon after their execution, Sabinus himself was scourged to death, December, A.D. 304.

Tired with the farce of state and public business, the emperor Diocletian resigned the imperial diadem, and was succeeded by Constantius and Galerius; the former a prince of the most mild and humane disposition and the latter equally remarkable for his cruelty and tyranny. These divided the empire into two equal governments, Galerius ruling in the east, and Constantius in the west; and the people in the two governments felt the effects of the dispositions of the two emperors; for those in the west were governed in the mildest manner, but such as resided in the east felt all the miseries of oppression and lengthened tortures.

Among the many martyred by the order of Galerius, we shall enumerate the most eminent.

Amphianus was a gentleman of eminence in Lucia, and a scholar of Eusebius; Julitta, a Lycaonian of royal descent, but more celebrated for her virtues than noble blood. While on the rack, her child was killed before her face. Julitta, of Cappadocia, was a lady of distinguished capacity, great virtue, and uncommon courage. To complete the execution, Julitta had boiling pitch poured on her feet, her sides torn with hooks, and received the conclusion of her martyrdom, by being beheaded, April 16, A.D. 305.

Hermolaus, a venerable and pious Christian, or a great age, and an intimate acquaintance of Panteleon's, suffered martyrdom for the faith on the same day, and in the same manner as Panteleon.

Eustratius, secretary to the governor of Armina, was thrown into a fiery furnace for exhorting some Christians who had been apprehended, to persevere in their faith.

Nicander and Marcian, two eminent Roman military officers, were apprehended on account of their faith. As they were both men of great abilities in their profession, the utmost means were used to induce them to renounce Christianity; but these endeavors being found ineffectual, they were beheaded.

In the kingdom of Naples, several martyrdoms took place, in particular, Januaries, bishop of Beneventum; Sosius, deacon of Misene; Proculus, another deacon; Eutyches and Acutius, two laymen; Festus, a deacon; and Desiderius, a reader; all, on account of being Christians, were condemned by the governor of Campania to be devoured by the wild beasts. The savage animals, however, would not touch them, and so they were beheaded.

Quirinus, bishop of Siscia, being carried before Matenius, the governor, was ordered to sacrifice to the pagan deities, agreeably to the edicts of various Roman emperors. The governor, perceiving his constancy, sent him to jail, and ordered him to be heavily ironed; flattering himself, that the hardships of a jail, some occasional tortures and the weight of chains, might overcome his resolution. Being decided in his principles, he was sent to Amantius, the principal governor of Pannonia, now Hungary, who loaded him with chains, and carried him through the principal towns of the Danube, exposing him to ridicule wherever he went. Arriving at length at Sabaria, and finding that Quirinus would not renounce his faith, he ordered him to be cast into a river, with a stone fastened about his neck. This sentence being put into execution, Quirinus floated about for some time, and, exhorting the people in the most pious terms, concluded his admonitions with this prayer: ""It is no new thing, O all-powerful Jesus, for Thee to stop the course of rivers, or to cause a man to walk upon the water, as Thou didst Thy servant Peter; the people have already seen the proof of Thy power in me; grant me now to lay down my life for Thy sake, O my God."" On pronouncing the last words he immediately sank, and died, June 4, A.D. 308. His body was afterwards taken up, and buried by some pious Christians.

Pamphilus, a native of Phoenicia, of a considerable family, was a man of such extensive learning that he was called a second Origen. He was received into the body of the clergy at Caesarea, where he established a public library and spent his time in the practice of every Christian virtue. He copied the greatest part of the works of Origen with his own hand, and, assisted by Eusebius, gave a correct copy of the Old Testament, which had suffered greatly by the ignorance or negligence of former transcribers. In the year 307, he was apprehended, and suffered torture and martyrdom.

Marcellus, bishop of Rome, being banished on account of his faith, fell a martyr to the miseries he suffered in exile, January 16, A.D. 310.

Peter, the sixteenth bishop of Alexandria, was martyred November 25, A.D. 311, by order of Maximus Caesar, who reigned in the east.

Agnes, a virgin of only thirteen years of age, was beheaded for being a Christian; as was Serene, the empress of Diocletian. Valentine, a priest, suffered the same fate at Rome; and Erasmus, a bishop, was martyred in Campania.

Soon after this the persecution abated in the middle parts of the empire, as well as in the west; and Providence at length began to manifest vengeance on the persecutors. Maximian endeavored to corrupt his daughter Fausta to murder Constantine her husband; which she discovered, and Constantine forced him to choose his own death, when he preferred the ignominious death of hanging after being an emperor near twenty years.

Constantine was the good and virtuous child of a good and virtuous father, born in Britain. His mother was named Helena, daughter of King Coilus. He was a most bountiful and gracious prince, having a desire to nourish learning and good arts, and did oftentimes use to read, write, and study himself. He had marvellous good success and prosperous achieving of all things he took in hand, which then was (and truly) supposed to proceed of this, for that he was so great a favorer of the Christian faith. Which faith when he had once embraced, he did ever after most devoutly and religiously reverence.

Thus Constantine, sufficiently appointed with strength of men but especially with strength of God, entered his journey coming towards Italy, which was about the last year of the persecution, A.D. 313. Maxentius, understanding of the coming of Constantine, and trusting more to his devilish art of magic than to the good will of his subjects, which he little deserved, durst not show himself out of the city, nor encounter him in the open field, but with privy garrisons laid wait for him by the way in sundry straits, as he should come; with whom Constantine had divers skirmishes, and by the power of the Lord did ever vanquish them and put them to flight.

Notwithstanding, Constantine yet was in no great comfort, but in great care and dread in his mind (approaching now near unto Rome) for the magical charms and sorceries of Maxentius, wherewith he had vanquished before Severus, sent by Galerius against him. Wherefore, being in great doubt and perplexity in himself, and revolving many things in his mind, what help he might have against the operations of his charming, Constantine, in his journey drawing toward the city, and casting up his eyes many times to heaven, in the south part, about the going down of the sun, saw a great brightness in heaven, appearing in the similitude of a cross, giving this inscription, In hoc vince, that is, ""In this overcome.""

Eusebius Pamphilus doth witness that he had heard the said Constantine himself oftentimes report, and also to swear this to be true and certain, which he did see with his own eyes in heaven, and also his soldiers about him. At the sight whereof when he was greatly astonished, and consulting with his men upon the meaning thereof, behold, in the night season in his sleep, Christ appeared to him with the sign of the same cross which he had seen before, bidding him to make the figuration thereof, and to carry it in his wars before him, and so should we have the victory.

Constantine so established the peace of the Church that for the space of a thousand years we read of no set persecution against the Christians, unto the time of John Wickliffe.

So happy, so glorious was this victory of Constantine, surnamed the Great! For the joy and gladness whereof, the citizens who had sent for him before, with exceeding triumph brought him into the city of Rome, where he was most honorably received, and celebrated the space of seven days together; having, moreover, in the market place, his image set up, holding in his right hand the sign of the cross, with this inscription:

""With this wholesome sign, the true token of fortitude, I have rescued and delivered our city from the yoke of the tyrant.""

We shall conclude our account of the tenth and last general persecution with the death of St. George, the titular saint and patron of England. St. George was born in Cappadocia, of Christian parents; and giving proofs of his courage, was promoted in the army of the emperor Diocletian. During the persecution, St. George threw up his command, went boldly to the senate house, and avowed his being a Christian, taking occasion at the same time to remonstrate against paganism, and point out the absurdity of worshipping idols. This freedom so greatly provoked the senate that St. George was ordered to be tortured, and by the emperor's orders was dragged through the streets, and beheaded the next day.

The legend of the dragon, which is associated with this martyr, is usually illustrated by representing St. George seated upon a charging horse and transfixing the monster with his spear. This fiery dragon symbolizes the devil, who was vanquished by St. George's steadfast faith in Christ, which remained unshaken in spite of torture and death.",[],0,John Foxe,St. Paul,1990,"[97, 86, 65, 52, 52, 58, 59, 62, 68, 83, 91]",11,Stranger to Love,https://open.spotify.com/track/748Kco0BolGQbcHu96A2bL,748Kco0BolGQbcHu96A2bL,spotify:track:748Kco0BolGQbcHu96A2bL,Easy Listening: Pour Yourself a Martini,6elQvJtjw3nhVevSHVnEUg,spotify:album:6elQvJtjw3nhVevSHVnEUg,Paul Rupert Lewis,1xYv3aZkEhxuD2fwjCThWy,spotify:artist:1xYv3aZkEhxuD2fwjCThWy,115.906,31.0,1.0,2016-10-07,0.277,0.228,10.0,-12.887,1.0,0.0335,0.97,0.18600000000000005,0.395,0.458,102.098,[],[],,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0

What time, oh oh oh oh

[Verse]
We could sail away
Or catch a freight train
Or a rocketship into outer space
Nothin' left to do
Too many things were said
To ever make it feel
Like yesterday did
Seasons must change
Separate paths, separate ways
If we blame it on anything
Let's blame it on the rain

I'd have to write this song
Too young to fall in love
Guess we knew it all along

Down from L.A
They were shooting pool all night
Sleeping half the day
They said I could crash
If I could find my own way
I told them you were leaving
On a bus to go away

We were two kids in love
Trying to find our way
Thats's alright, that's okay
Held our dreams in our hands
Let our minds run away

198,198,My Kinda Girl,"[Verse 1:]
First
There is no doubt
Not for a minute
You've always been
My heart's number one
And number two

Girl, you were right there
And I won't forget it
By my side
For all those nights
I had to hold on to you

[Hook:]
If there's one thing that I know
Girl, you are my heart and soul
When I needed love indeed
You were always there for me

And I'll make love stay
'Til my dying day
And it really makes me feel good
Just to say

[Chorus:]
After all that we've been through
It's so nice to know
Someone like you still cares for me
Baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady

And no matter what I do
I promise that I'll keep on
Loving you, pretty baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady

You're my kinda girl

[Verse 2:]
Now I know
That nothing could separate us
You'll always be my girl
I will always be your man

We go as far as love's gonna take us
To the room of love
We'll zoom
Long as we're hand in hand

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

[Bridge:]
You're my kinda girl
My kinda girl
My kinda girl

I get a real good feeling
Deep inside my soul
Girl, when you're around
I just lose control

And I can't stop thinking
'Bout the way I feel
Girl, you are the only one
That gives me chills

And I can't stop, lover
'Cause you mean too much
Ooh
I start to lose it, girl
Whenever we touch

We got too much time
And that's for sure
We need to stay together
And never let go
No

My kinda girlie
You're my kinda girl
You're my kinda girl

'Cause you're my kinda girl

[Repeat Chorus:]

199,199,That's Not Her Style,"2, 3, 4

Some people think that she's one of those mink-coated ladies
They say she wakes up at one, makes the paparazzi run till dawn
Wines and dines with Argentines and Kuwaitis
After she sips margaritas on the White House lawn

That's not her style
I can tell you that ain't my woman
It's just not her style
I can tell you, because I'm her man

The papers say she was seen in L.A. with a stranger
She found a perfect body with a Maserati right outside
And then she chartered a Lear when she heard her career was in danger
And gave the pilot somethin' extra for a perfect ride

That's not her style
I can tell you that ain't my woman
That's not her style
I can tell you, because I'm her man

That's not her style
I can tell you that ain't my woman
You know it's not her style
I can tell you, because I'm her man

It's not that she's never done something crazy, done somethng wild
It's just that she's better at doing whatever suits her style
And that's not her style, no, no, no, no, no

I've read where it's said that she sleeps in a bed made of satin
She's had her face done in every place you can try
They say she gets a piece of every lease in Manhattan
And says she's thirty when she's really pushing forty-five

That's not her style
I can tell you that ain't my woman
It's just not her style
I can tell you, 'cause I'm her man

That's not her style
I can tell you that ain't my woman
It's just not her style

Come over here!

[Verse 1]
Some girls, they like candy
And others, they like to grind
I'll settle for the back of your hand
Somewhere on my behind
Treat me like I'm a bad girl
Even when I'm being good to you
I don't want you to thank me
You can just spank me
Ooh!

[Verse 2]
Some guys like to sweet talk
And others, they like to tease
Tie my hands behind my back and
Ooh, I'm in ecstasy
Don't slobber me with kisses

Before I get too cranky
You better

201,201,The Right Combination,"[Verse 1:]
Two people together
It was just a dream
Until you came along
My heart was waiting just for you

Tomorrow forever
We both had these promises
For far too long
But now you make the words come true

So touch me now
I need to have you close tonight
And show me how
You can make me feel this way

[Chorus:]
You and me
We are the right combination
For love (For love)
We're all we need (Ooh)

It's just you and me
We make the right combination
Straight from the heart
Love is the key

[Verse 2:]
Can't keep it a secret
Everything I feel
Is written on my face
I can't hide my heart from you

You hold me, it's magic
In your arms
The world becomes a better place
Now I know what love can do

Here we go
Exactly where the road will lead us
I don't know
I just know that you'll be there

[Chorus:]
You and me
We are the right combination
For love (For love)
We're all we need (Ooh)

It's just you and me
We make the right combination
Straight from the heart
Love is the key

So strong
Now I know you and me belong
I'll be by your side forever

You treat me like a fool

You cut me like a blade

I thought that when you gave me love
My life would start to change
Instead I saw that I was wrong
My life was re-aranged
How I wonder why
You just put my love aside
You threw me in the gutter and you left me there to lie

Bad of the heart
You never wanted to start
Cause your just bad of the heart
You never played the game to smart
Cause you know your bad

When I was by your side
You kissed and told me lies
You hurt me each and everyday

Lying to myself, why did it have to be this way
I thought that when you gave me love

We never talked about it
But I hear the blame was mine
I'd call you up to say I'm sorry
But I wouldn't want to waste your time

'Cause I love you, but I can't take any more
There's a look I can't describe in your eyes
If we could try, like we tried before
Would you keep on telling me those lies? (Telling me lies)

[Chorus]
Do you remember?... (Do you remember?)
Uh, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)

[Verse 2]
There seemed no way to make up
'Cause it seemed your mind was set
And the way you looked it told me
It's a look I know I'll never forget
You could've come over to my side
You could've let me know
You could've tried to see the distance between us
But it seemed too far for you to go

[Chorus]
Do you remember?... (Do you remember?)
Uh, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)

Through all of my life
In spite of all the pain
You know people are funny sometimes
'Cause they just can't wait
To get hurt again

Tell me, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)

[Verse 4]
There are things we won't recall
And feelings we'll never find
It's taken so long to see it
'Cause we never seemed to have the time

More important to say

Situation is (serious)
Let's cure it cause we're running out of time

[Bell]
It's oh, so (beautiful)
Relationships they seem from the start
It's all so (deadly)
When love is not together from the heart

[Hook - Ricky Bell]
It's drivin' me out of my mind!
That's why it's HARD for me to find
Can't get it out of my head!
Miss her, kiss her, love her
(Wrong move you're dead!)

[Hook]
That girl is (poison)...
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is (poison)..
(""POISON!!"")

[Verse Two]
[Bivins]
[If I were you I'd take pre-]
(-caution)
Before I start to meet a fly girl, you know?

[Devoe]
Cause in some (portions)
You'll think she's the best thing in the world

[Bell]
She's so - (fly)
She'll drive you right out of your mind
And steal your heart when you're blind
Beware she's schemin', she'll make you think you're dreamin'
YOU'LL fall in love and you'll be screamin', demon, HOO..

[Ronnie Devoe - Rap Verse 1]
Poison, deadly, movin' in slow
Lookin for a mellow fellow like DeVoe
Gettin paid, laid, so better lay low
Schemin on house, money, and the whole show
The low pro ho she'll be cut like an aaa-FRO
See what you're sayin', huh, she's a winner to you
But I know she's a loser (How do you know?)
Me and the crew used to do her!

I was at the park, shake, breakin and takin 'em all
And that night, I played the wall
Checkin' out the fellas, the highs and lows
Keepin' one eye open, still clockin' the hoes
There was one particular girl that stood out from the rest
Poison as can be, the high power chest
Michael Biv here and I'm runnin' the show

207,207,All The Way,"By now everyone’s sick and tired of hearing about “Pharrell’s Grammy hat.”

Of course, by “everybody,” I’m not talking about the 70-odd million humans who have watched “Happy” — in which homeboy intermittently sports the selfsame hat — since it was posted on Twitter last November.

Me, I’m delighted about the whole little tempest in a teapot because it gives yours truly an excuse to write about a subject of no small and enduring interest:  black men and their chapeaux.  And still in time for Black History Month.

I might not have given half a fuck about Pharrell and his hat except that Pharrell himself credited the British designer Vivienne Westwood as the creator of the article in question, which led a number of folks to the, uh, meme that was most likely Pharrell’s actual inspiration:  the 1982 music video for the World Famous Supreme Team’s “Buffalo Gals.”
Both the record and the video were masterminded by Malcolm McLaren (seen above), the music biz impresario who had managed the Sex Pistols half-a-decade earlier.  Like many British popsters (and like Mr. Pharrell Williams today), McLaren was as deep into fashion as he was into music.  Indeed, Vivienne Westwood was his girlfriend at the time.  How close were they?  Well, not only is McLaren wearing the Westwood-designed hat in the video, but they’d collaborated on the fashion show at which the hat was introduced– “Buffalo Girls (Nostalgia for Mud).”

My guess is that young Mr. Williams knew all about the World Famous Supreme Team well before he’d heard of Vivienne Westwood.
No matter that Westwood was inspired to design the hat following her research into the fresh stylings of Peruvian women.  (See photo above.)  When Pharrell wears the thing – he was nine years old when the video was tearing up MTV — it is a soulful salute to the roots of hip-hop.  (And by the way, it’s not like he had to rob a museum to acquire one of his own.  Westwood sells her Mountain Hats to this very day.)

Anyway, Pharrell’s flair made me think of one of my recent flea market finds.  It was just a couple of weeks ago, at a flea market a block and a half from my apartment in Manhattan, that I picked up a copy of the November 1949 issue of Our World magazine.  I’d never seen one before.  A big splashy photo magazine, built to the specifications of Life magazine, it was a precursor to Ebony, founded by a black entrepreneur named John P. Davis.  The cover of the November ’49 issue is fairly eye-scorching.
I was, of course, beguiled by the sight of Ms. “Bunny” Evans and her special negligee, but — nerd that I am – what really killed me was the red-and-yellow-striped promo in the upper-right hand corner for a story about the great tenor saxophonist Illinois Jacquet.

Even more amazing was a feature deep inside the mag that got no shout-out on the cover:  “How to Make a Pork Pie Hat:  Jazz sophisticate Lester Young shows how he fashions slick style popular with ‘hepcats.’”
Anybody who knows anything about Young – one of a handful of the key architects of modern jazz – also knows about his pork pie hats.  When Young died in 1959, fellow jazzman Charles Mingus composed a tribute to him entitled “Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.”

Indeed, Young’s pork pie was already so iconic by 1944 that director Djon Mili starts his short movie “Jammin’ the Blues” with a close-focus shot of the hat from directly above Young’s head.  As the music — a slow blues — begins, all you see is cigarette smoke curling past two concentric black-on-black oblong circles.  The credits roll for half a minute or so, superimposed over those circles, then the camera makes a graceful 90-degree arc…and there we are face-to-face with Lester Young playing his saxophone, and we understand that those oblongs comprised the man’s hat.

You could buy the pork pie in a store in those days, but, as the Our World story reveals, that’s not the way Young rolled.  Devoted to the notion that “you got to be original, man,” he started by buying something very much like an old-fashioned ten-gallon cowboy hat…and then he “busted it down” by hand according to his own design.

Young confided to Our World that “he buys unrolled hat in Negro districts only, says:  ‘You can’t get the right type in a ‘gray’ neighborhood.’”  You can learn more about Mr. Davis and Our World by clicking here: http://www.johnpdaviscollection.org/about6.html

Fast forward to the Eighties and early Nineties, when I had the honor and pleasure of working with a group of musicians who, like Lester Young, had a thing for black hats:  Run-DMC.  Their choice of headgear – like the rest of their clothing – was heavily influenced by the personal style of Jam Master Jay, shown below in a Ricky Powell photo from 1988.
By 1985′s King of Rock, Run and D were fully on board.
Always the most fashion-forward of the crew, Jay would eventually co-found Walker Wear, an early hip-hop fashion brand, with the designer April Walker.

Jay sported his wool Stetson Godfather hats in the winter and lighter Kangols in the warm weather.  The Godfather hats, as you might have guessed, started to enjoy a vogue in the street in the wake of the 1972 movie of the same name. (That’s Marlon Brando, in the title role, on the left.)
Jay began wearing them as a junior highschooler in emulation of Marvin Thompson, his older brother.

In an illuminating recent conversation, Marvin informed your reporter that everyone who wore the Godfather customized it (just as Lester Young had customized his pork pie).  According to Marvin, Jay broke down the brim in front, but left the rear of the brim turned up…then swiveled the hat around and wore it backwards!  When I asked Marvin why Jay did it that way, Marv said, “Why?  I don’t know.  That was him.  Everybody breaks it down depending on his own style.”

The loquacious Mr. Thompson then expanded the filmography concerning the black man’s taste in hats.  “The Godfather” is all well and good, he said, but, “If you rent ‘J.D.’s Revenge’” – a 1976 blaxploitation gem starring Glenn Turman – “…you got the whole story right there.”

And by the way, as far as Marvin’s concerned, “It all goes back to Edward G. Robinson in ‘Little Caesar.’  I’m a big Edward G. Robinson fan.” (See photo below.)
In short, what we’re talking about is gangster style, although when Jay started to wear his Godfather, he saw it as a marker of the emerging b-boy style.  In either case, you couldn’t wear a hat so magnificent and be a punk.  As Jay himself recalls in Tougher Than Leather:  The Rise of Run-DMC, “I used to have to fight for my velour in the seventh grade, when guys would try me for my hat.”

Indeed, the black community has apparently always put a heavy value put on a beautiful hat.  Think of Lloyd Price’s “Stagger Lee,” a great record and a big big hit in 1959.

The lyrics tell the story of Stagger Lee and Billy, “two men who gambled late” in a barroom.  Billy won all of Stag’s money in a game of dice – “and his brand new Stetson hat.”  But Stag thought that Billy had cheated him.  So he went home, grabbed his forty-four, and shot Billy dead.

It turns out that the song sprang from a real-life incident.  In a saloon in St. Louis on Christmas night in 1895, Lee Shelton, a black pimp better known as Stack Lee, and another man named Billy Lyons were drinking.  They started beefing for some reason and Lyons stole Stag’s Stetson.  “Subsequently,” says Wikipedia, “Shelton shot Lyons and recovered his hat.”

African-American musicians and their fellow travelers have found this story riveting for nearly 120 years.  The first song devoted to it was noted in 1897.  Although it didn’t make its way onto wax until 1923, “Stagger Lee"" was formally published in 1911.  Over the decades it was recorded by Ma Rainey (with a young Louis Armstrong on cornet), Mississippi John Hurt, Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, and Woody Guthrie.  In the wake of Lloyd Price’s version, Ike & Tina Turner cut it, as did James Brown, Wilson Pickett, the Grateful Dead, Prince Buster and the Trojans, and, in 2004, the Black Keys.

If you crave even more detail, I recommend Stagolee Shot Billy, a book published by Cecil Brown in 2004. Dig some of the flavor:  Speaking of the sartorial style of the St. Louis macks of the 1890s, Brown writes, “Their choice of hat undoubtedly made their membership in a particular subculture as readily apparent as a Raiders cap on a Los Angeles gang member today.

“They had to be Stetsons and no other brand.  The Stetson was the archetypal western hat; in the 1890s its inventor had christened it ‘Boss of the Plains.’  In that era it was a mark of the highest status for blacks….The hat in ‘Stagolee’ is a symbol of masculinity.  The legend portrays Billy Lyons as wearing a derby…and Lee Shelton as wearing a wide-brimmed Stetson.  Clearly, in this context the Stetson symbolizes greater masculinity….To hurt a man symbolically, one could do no worse that cut his Stetson.”

This is the same Cecil Brown, by the way, who wrote The Life and Loves of Mr. Jiveass Nigger in 1969, another book you may enjoy. In his foreword to its reissue in 2008, Henry Louis Gates Jr. wrote that Life and Loves was “a cult classic for my friends and me at Yale, a required text on our veritable ‘Quest for Blackness’ reading list….Only Sam Greenlee’s The Spook Who Sat by the Door, also published in 1969, could successfully compete with Cecil Brown’s novel for our attention.  We read both as ‘How to be Black’ manuals masquerading as fictions.”

Read these books. How you break ‘em down depends on your own style.","['by', 'now', 'everyone’s', 'sick', 'and', 'tire', 'of', 'hear', 'about', '“pharrell’s', 'grammy', 'hat”', 'of', 'course', 'by', '“everybody”',

EXT. WINTER RIVER, CONNECTICUT - DAY

A crisp and perfect New England town.  Almost too neat
to be real.  No visible townspeople.  CAMERA EXPLORES
town.


CAMERA FLIES

over a rickety bridge -- PAST the Maitland Hardware and
Appliance store -- PAST the church -- the Historical
Society -- UP over the graveyard on the hill and
finally --

To the Maitland house.  The perfect Victorian house
surveying the tiny village.  Suddenly --


A GIANT DADDY LONGLEGS SPIDER

mounts the crest of the hill beside the house, pauses to
wave a spindly leg and then creeps menacingly on top of
the Maitland house.

ADAM (O.S..)
Well, well, you're a big fella...!

A hand -- as big as God's -- with a huge tweezer,
gently reaches down out of the sky and lies, palm up,
in the yard next to the house.  Daddy Longlegs climbs
into it.  The hand rises into the sky again.


INT. ATTIC - NEW ANGLE - DAY

Reveals Winter River as a miniature town, while The
Daddy Longlegs and the hand are normal size.  Above the
model are a homely representation of moon, sun, and
stars -- a whole, tiny, mechanical universe to track
the hours of the day.  A large plat map of the city is
prominent on the wall.

The hand is ADAM MAITLAND'S.  In his late 30's, he's a
solid easy-going citizen.  Capra used to make movies
about him.

Adam's model town sprawls across most of the attic
space.  Windows on either end of the attic shed good
light into the warm room.  Adam very carefully lifts
the spider out the open window.  Smiles as he drips him
lightly on the breeze.


CAMERA TILTS UP FROM THE WINDOW

To see the real Winter River, laid out exactly as the
model, at the foot of the hill.  Adam breathes deeply
and looks very pleased at the glorious town below him.


ON HIS HUGE HAND AGAIN

as it reaches into model and tweezes a tiny sign into
the tiny window of Maitland's Hardware Store on main
street.  It reads:

ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND
ARE
ON VACATION!
HOORAY!

Adam leans down and eyes the sign.

BARBARA
(behind him)
I'm ready!

Adam turns to see entering:  BARBARA MAITLAND, 35 -- a
wholesome beauty who is mellowing well.  She smiles at
him.  Perhaps a certain tinge of sadness about her,
because they don't have children.

ADAM
(happy to see her)
She's ready.

BARBARA
(eyeing the model)
It looks great.

ADAM
(nodding)
Thanks.

She pushes a wrapped present across the table.

BARBARA
Happy vacation, honey!

Adam smiles and gives her a present he's hidden under
the table.  He opens his present.  A can of furniture
oil.

ADAM
Manchurian Tung oil?
(playfully grabs
Barbara and kisses
her)
Where did you get it?

BARBARA
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
There's enough to refinish the
gateleg table and the cherry
wardrobe...

Adam hands Barbara a carefully-wrapped bundle -- she
unwraps her gift... rolls of very expensive floral
wallpaper.  She cradles it in her arms like gold leaf.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam... it's beautiful.

Adam nods, and embraces her.

ADAM
Enough to do the guest room...

BARBARA
(cooing)
I'm so glad we're spending our
vacation at home...
(with a sudden resolve)
... I'm going to get started right
now!

ADAM
(pulling her back)
Whoa!... hold on...

Barbara calms down, returning to Adam's embrace... as:

PHONE RINGS -- They freeze, then grin.

ADAM & BARBARA
(unison)
No one's home!

HONK HONK outside.  They look at each other horrified.
Peer out the window.

BARBARA
Oh no.

ADAM
(pointing at her)
It's your turn, darling.

She shakes her head with resignation and goes downstairs.
KNOCKING on door from below.


INT. STAIRCASE AND KITCHEN - DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS Adam and Barbara downstairs.  We see the
rambling, old fashioned quality to the house.

Clean, sentimental, warm and floral.  Some rooms in
progress.  They continue down the main staircase past
photos of themselves, old photos of the early days of
Winter River, pictures and mementos of three
generations in hardware.  Barbara goes to the kitchen
and Adam continues down to the basement.


HER POV - A WOMAN

JANE BUTTERFIELD -- tall, gawky and aggressive peeks in
the kitchen door.  She's divorced three husbands and
buried another for good measure.  She's ruthless but is
weirdly, seamlessly pleasant.  She waves a legal sized
paper at them, starts to come inside.


INT./EXT. KITCHEN DOOR

Barbara makes dash for it and holds it just as Jane gets
a foot in.  Jane smiles wildly.

JANE
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you.
I heard you were on vacation!

BARBARA
That's right, Jane.  Complete
vacation.

JANE
Honey -- today I am three hundred
fifty thousand dollars!

BARBARA
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the
morning!

JANE
Look at me, think of me as cash!
This offer is really real!  From a
rich man in New York City who only
saw a photograph!
(rattles on)
My buyer has just made a killing
in condos in Manhattan, but he's
got a little stress problem...
(taps her head)
... so -- he wants to bring the
wife and kid for the old peace and
quiet.

BARBARA
That's what we're looking for,
too.

JANE
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, just
listen now.  This house is too
big.  It really ought to be for a
couple with a family.

That hurts Barbara a little.  She looks at Jane.

JANE
(continuing)
Oh, honey... I didn't mean
anything... it's just too big for
you.

Jane compulsively affixes her business card, face inside.
in the windowpane.

BARBARA
(shutting door)
'Bye, Jane, see you in a few
weeks.


ADAM

is humming happily, looking for paint brushes in the
ground floor storeroom.  He spies a cassette deck and
looks through a stack of cassettes and plays one.  It
is an old INKSPOTS LOVE SONG.


INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

Barbara is starting to paper the walls already.  She
frowns at the MUSIC.  Goes to the door.

BARBARA
Oh, honey.  You said no Inkspots
on this vacation!

It CLICKS OFF.  She goes back into the room.


INT. STOREROOM - DAY

Adam puts away the tape but keeps humming the song.  He
opens the shutters on a small window.  ON WINDOW...

JANE
(her huge face
grinning at him)
Boo!

He jumps back, frightened.

ADAM
No, Jane.

Adam closes the shutters as Jane affixes yet another
card to the window.  He continues his search for a
brush.


JANE

exits jauntily, flapping her contract down the lawn.


INT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Adam continues rummaging for a brush.  Can't find it.

ADAM
(calling to distant
Barbara)
Honey, come with me down to the
store?

BARBARA (O.S.)
What for?

ADAM
I need a good brush for this Tung
oil and I want to pick up a piece
of the model.  Let's go early
before anyone sees us.

Barbara has already papered a few rolls in the guest
room.

BARBARA
Okay, but let's hurry back.  You
just run in okay?


EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

The Victorian house from the model ""in the flesh.""
Adam stands by the station wagon.

On the bumper of the car is a sticker reading:
WARNING:  I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS.

Barbara gets in driver's side.  They drive off.


INT. THE CAR - DAY

Adam dusts the inside of the dashboard.  Clean Clean.

BARBARA
(preoccupied)
Jane said we should sell the house
to someone with a family.

ADAM
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.

Puts his hand on her shoulder.


EXT. THE RIVER AND BRIDGE AND HILL - DAY

We see the car coming down the hill toward the bridge.

ADAM (V.O.)
We should be flattered that she
wants to sell our house.

BARBARA (V.O.)
I know... I just wish she'd leave
us alone.

ADAM (V.O.)
Let's not think about it.  We'll
have a nice romantic, quiet,
vacation.  Here comes the bridge
chorus.

Car reaches the rickety covered bridge.  Car shakes,
bobbing up and down on every plank.

ON Barbara and Adam TIGHT -- (they've done this routine
before).  They sing an old Johnny Mathis song.  With a
lot of vibrato.

TOGETHER
Chances are... When I wear a
foolish grin...

They laugh.


EXT. DOWNTOWN WINTER RIVER - DAY

Just like the model, but real.  And populated.

CAMERA PAUSES ON a gorgeous storefront with a brass
lion out front.  Sign above doors says --

BOZMAN BUILDING 1835

An old man polishes the lion as Maitlands drive by and
wave.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Wave at the lion.

ADAM (V.O.)
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.

BARBARA (V.O.)
(embarrassed)
Adam!

Ernie looks around to see no one's looking and polishes
the balls of the lion.


CAMERA SPIES A JAUNTY DOG

like Benji, peeing on the opposite corner of the lion.
Maitlands drive by store with sign:

JANE BUTTERFIELD
ANTIQUES
REAL ESTATE
TRAVEL


INT. ANTIQUE STORE REAL ESTATE OFFICE TRAVEL AGENCY -
DAY

The store is bursting with antiques of all sorts,
travel brochures, photographs of houses for sale, and a
serve-yourself Xerox machine.  LITTLE JANE, her eight-
year-old daughter is drudgingly making copies.

Jane, phone in hand, rushes to the window to watch
Maitlands drive by.  Almost popping the cord when it
reaches its end.  She's waiting for the other party to
pick up.

JANE
Y... ello.  Mrs. Deetz?  Well the
condition is what we country folk
call, fixin'... Yes, I think they
are fixin' to accept another
offer.  Well maybe if you offer
390,000 they'll take it.


EXT. MAITLAND HARDWARE - DAY

Adam sprints up the steps of his lovely hardware store.
OLD BILL, a slightly-addled ancient barber, is napping
in a chair in front of his shop, next door to Adam's.
Adam fumbles with the lock, not interested in conver-
sation.  He drops his keys, waking Old Bill.

OLD BILL
'Morning, Adam.  You need a
haircut before your vacation?

ADAM
No thanks, Bill.

OLD BILL
How's the model coming?

ADAM
Good, Bill -- Good.

Bill turns around and continues prattling even though
Adam has entered.  Bill prattles throughout.

OLD BILL
Y'know, I was thinkin'... you said
Bozman built the foundation in
1835 but y'know his grandson came
in here last week and said he
found a bottle with an 1836 stamp
in it plastered in the foundation.
(suddenly disgusted
at the memory)
He's got hair down to his
goddamned shoulders...


INT. MAITLAND HARDWARE

Adam pulls down a few good paintbrushes and carefully
picks up a small model of the Bozman building.  He
walks out.  Old Bill continues unabated.

OLD BILL
He said ""Just give me a trim..."" I
took a scissors to him so fast...
would've skimmed him clean if he
hadn't...

Adam strides by quickly to the car.

ADAM
See you, Bill.

OLD BILL
Right.


EXT. MAITLAND'S CAR - DAY

The Maitlands drive their car out of town.


ON JANE


EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE - DAY

Car approaches.


INT. CAR - DAY

Five brushes sit on the seat next to Adam.  He cradles
small replica of the Bozman building, complete with
brass lion.

BARBARA
It's a beauty.

ADAM
Yeah it turned out okay.  We
applied for a historical plaque
for it.  That'll be the third one
on Main Street.

BARBARA
(jokingly)
With all these historical
landmarks in town, where are they
going to put the condominiums?

ADAM
(grinning)
Slow down there, honey... I don't
want the vibration to weaken the
model.

BARBARA
(nervous)
Oh... I'm sorry...

Barbara starts to apply the brakes.

Just before the bridge the dog waddles out in the road.
Stops to pee.  Barbara swerves.  As the car hits the
rickety bridge, the speed is just a bit too much.

Boards RATTLE and loosen, the car skews and catches in
an open slot, careens to the right, then the left and
the bridge.


INT. CAR - DAY

A piling has smashed through the window on the pas-
senger side, crushing the upper part of Barbara's
arm.  She is wailing in pain and fright.

Adam tries to help Barbara.  He tries to get out of the
car.  None of this succeeds.


EXT. BRIDGE AND RIVER - DAY

The dog finishes, looks over at the car, walks across
the bridge and steps on the one board which holds the
car aloft.

The car rocks back and forth for a moment, and then
slides forward toward the water.


EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE

The car plunges into the rushing water.  It floats
for a moment, and then sinks like a stone.

FADE TO BLACK.


FADE IN:

INT. BARBARA AND ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Quiet, still, expectant.  There is a fire laid in the
hearth.  Suddenly and for no apparent reason it ignites
and burns with a furious cheerfulness.

Barbara and Adam enter, dazed, wet, and bedraggled.

BARBARA
Something like this always happens
when we try to go on vacation.
Always.

Adam leads her toward the fire.

ADAM
You'll feel better when you're
dry.

He holds out his hands to be warmed.  Barbara comes up
beside him.  All this time she's been holding her
injured arm with the other hand.

BARBARA
This fire wasn't burning when we
left the house.

ADAM
How's your arm?

BARBARA
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.

She holds her arms out to warm them.  One hand catches
on fire.


BARBARA'S LEFT ARM

They stare at it dumbfoundedly before Adam regains his
senses and snatches it out of the fire.  Two of the
fingers are burning like candles, and Barbara indus-
triously blows them out.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam.

CUT TO:


INT. LIVING ROOM:  A FEW MINUTES LATER - DAY

They are sitting on the couch together.  Barbara is
looking away slightly -- as one does when a doctor is
drawing blood -- while Adam looks at her fingers.  He
frowns.

He looks at his skin.  It is pale.  He looks at
Barbara.

ADAM
You'd better sit down, hon.

BARBARA
I am sitting.

ADAM
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I
don't think we survived that
crash.

BARBARA
(pause)
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own
house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some
coffee.  You get some more
firewood.

Adam gets up, a little absently, she follows him as he
wanders to the front door.  He peers out.

ADAM
Let's take things extra slow.  Do
you remember how we got back up
here?

Barbara tests her hand, clenches and unclenches her
fist.

BARBARA
I'm fine.  My arm works fine.

Adam, exploring, opens the door, steps out on the front
porch.


EXT. FRONT PORCH - TWILIGHT

Adam's face is painted with color of sunset.  He stands
atop the steps leading down to the front yard.  Barbara
stands just inside the open threshold, looking out
worriedly.

BARBARA
(quiet sarcasm)
The end of a perfect day.

Adam starts to step down to the yard.

ADAM
Honey, I'm gonna go down to the
bridge and retrace our steps.

He steps off the last step into the yard and promptly
disappears.

BARBARA
Adam!


EXT. THE GREAT VOID

Adam is nowhere.  There's no ground, no sky, nothing to
stand on or hold onto or give boundaries or distance.
Just vast nothing.  Not white and not colored either.
NOISE OF A CLOCK TICKING.

Adam looks about surprised, doesn't like what he
doesn't see.  He turns around to head back up the
steps.  There are no steps.

ADAM
Barbara?

His VOICE ECHOES STRANGELY.  He runs off a little in
the distance, and calls again from over there.

ADAM
(continuing; quietly)
Where are you?

He goes even farther away.


IN THE FOREGROUND

an enormous geared wheel -- the size of a man -- rolls
by, tearing up the unseamed ground.  Something pours up
out of the tear -- ooze or stuffing.

Adam runs forward and stares after the wheel, which is
now out of sight.


TWO SMALLER GEARS

looking very much like components of a giant watch --
spin along behind him.  One of them veers suddenly
toward him, and though Adam jumps out of the way, the
gear snags his trouser leg and shreds it.  LOUD
TICKING.


A PERFECTLY ENORMOUS GEAR

comes barreling toward him.  Adam leaps out of its
way.  The gear turns, fish-tailing, kicking up ooze and
stuffing.

Adam flings himself suddenly to the right, but trips
into the path of the gear.  As he's about to be
crushed, he's suddenly jerked up to safety.


EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

It's Barbara who's grabbed him, and quite evidently
saved his life -- not life, perhaps -- but existence.
He's shaken, breathless.

Barbara stares at him, as if wondering what he's just
been through.

ADAM
(weakly)
You saved my -- uh -- life... or
whatever...

BARBARA
Two hours.

ADAM
What?

BARBARA
That's how long you were gone.

ADAM
(pondering that)
... Hmmm?


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Barbara leads Adam into the house.

ADAM
Anything happen while I was away?

BARBARA
Yes, it did.  Yes, it did.  I made
a couple of small discoveries.


BARBARA

stands by the mirror over the hearth mantle.  On the
mantle is Barbara's prize collection of porcelain
horses.  Adam comes to stand beside her.  They look
into the mirror, and there is no reflection of them.

Barbara picks up one of the horses, and trots it through
the air.  The horse is imaged in the mirror.

BARBARA
(continuing)
There's that, and there's this.

She picks up an ancient, leather-bound book.  It's
yellow and worn, about the size of the Boy Scout
manual.

CLOSEUP:  Its title is HANDBOOK FOR THE RECENTLY
DECEASED.

ADAM
(reading)
Handbook for the recently
diseased.

BARBARA
Deceased.  I don't know where it
came from.  Look at the publisher.

ADAM
(he does and reads)
Handbook for the Recently Deceased
Press.

BARBARA
(finally admit-
ting it)
I don't think we survived the
crash.


INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam is already in bed, reading from the handbook.
Barbara is getting ready for bed -- going through a
ritual of sorts that they practiced every night of
their married lives.

BARBARA
I don't like situations like this.
I hate it when I'm not in control.
So just tell me the basics.

ADAM
This book isn't arranged that
way.  What do you want to know?

BARBARA
There are a thousand things... Why
did you disappear when you walked
off the front porch?  Is this a
punishment?  Are we halfway to
heaven or are we halfway to hell?
And how long is this going to
last?

ADAM
I don't see anything about
""Rewards and Punishments"" or
""Heaven and Hell.""
(frustrated)
This book reads like stereo
instructions!  Listen to this...
'Geographical and Temporal
Perimeters... Functional
perimeters vary from manifestation
to manifestation.""  This is going
to take some time.


BARBARA

paces, she trips on her wallpaper rolls.  Kicks them.

BARBARA
I knew I'd never finish the guest
room.  Adam, we just can't stay in
here forever!

They look at each other, the question hangs in the air.
Can't they?

Adam stands and walks to the window.

ADAM
(thoughtfully)
Maybe we should set up a normal
routine.

She looks at him like he's nuts.

ADAM
(continuing)
I mean, let's try to nail down
something in our lives.  A regular
schedule.  We can keep track of
time and go on with our projects
up here in the attic.

She shakes her head, exasperated.  Flops down on the
bed.

BARBARA
Oh, God, maybe this is all just a
bad dream.

ON ADAM - TIGHT - a somber look comes across his face.

ADAM
I'm afraid not, honey.

Barbara looks up at him, questioningly.

BARBARA
Why?  What's wrong?  Adam?

She stands and joins him at the window.


THEIR POV THROUGH THE WINDOW

In the distance we see an automobile funeral procession
threading its way toward the nearby cemetery.  Head-
lights are on.  We recognize Jane's car in the line.


REVERSE ON BARBARA AND ADAM

somber faces.


TIGHTER ON PROCESSION

It arrives at the gravesite.  We see some familiar
faces, Ernie, and Old Bill the Barber.  Jane and little
Jane watch as two identical coffins are carried to-
gether, to two open graves.


ON BARBARA AND ADAM

She drops her head sadly on his shoulder.  He leans his
face slightly into hers.

FADE OUT.


FADE IN:

INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam is setting up a small monument in the model town
cemetery.  It reads:  ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND/UNITED
IN LIFE/UNDIVIDED IN DEATH.

ADAM
I wish I had a better view of the
cemetery from up here.  I don't
know which area is the best
placement for us.

Barbara, trying to clean, lets out a frustrated YELP!
She paces.

ADAM
(continuing)
Cabin fever, han?

BARBARA
I can't clean anything.  The
vacuum is out in the garage.  I
can't leave the house.  Why don't
they tell us something?  Where are
all the other dead people in the
world?  Why is it just you and me?

ADAM
Maybe this is heaven.

BARBARA
(looking at the
dusty walls)
In heaven there wouldn't be dust
on the wallpaper.

ADAM
Hon... I didn't want to die, but
really, this is fine with me.
Look, we never have to wash dishes
again.

BARBARA
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three
weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you.  I
really need to be around people,
get out to the church and go
grocery shopping.

ADAM
But I'm not hungry, are you?

Barbara shakes her head and picks up the Handbook and
pages through it desperately.

BARBARA
I keep having this feeling that
something has got to happen.

CAR DOOR SLAMS outside.  Adam and Barbara look at one
another.  Run to window.


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Jane Butterfield is staring up at the old house.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam, from his angle, can just barely see her.

ADAM
God, it's Jane.

BARBARA
What's she doing here?

ADAM
I don't know.
(shouting)
Jane, Jane, up here!


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Unhearing, Jane heads for car.  SOUND OF WIND UP.
Blows her dress.  Little Jane straggles along with her
like an apprentice.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara watches Adam, and shakes her head.  He stops.

BARBARA
She can't see you, right?

Adam nods.

BARBARA
(continuing)
In the book, Rule Number Two:  the
living usually won't see the dead.

ADAM
Won't?  Or can't?

BARBARA
Just says ""won't.""  Wait a minute.
Here it says ""the living are
arrogant... they think they'll
never die, so they refuse to see
the dead.""

ADAM
Arrogant.  That's Jane all right...

Barbara sighs and nods.

BARBARA
At least we won't have to worry
about her.

Adam smiles and goes to his model.


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Jane drives away.  CAMERA HINGES to see a FOR SALE
sign.  Across it -- another smaller banner.  It reads:
SOLD!

CUT TO:


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

The Maitlands are asleep.  CAMERA EXPLORES the room a
bit.  It is getting slightly tatty.  Adam rolls over,
pulling the covers off Barbara.  We see:

ON BARBARA -- she is hovering off the side of the bed.

An OMINOUS RUMBLE -- like a 4.0 earthquake shakes
the house.  GLASS RATTLES, the ceramic horses on the
mantelpiece jump around.  Barbara falls to the floor.
They look at one another with horror.  They leap up and
run downstairs.


INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

The RUMBLE BUILDS TO A CLIMAX, there is a LOUD METALLIC
SQUEAL, and then a CRASH... just as Barbara and Adam
arrive.


THE FRONT DOOR

smashes open revealing a moving van ramp.


A TEN-FOOT ELECTRIC-BLUE ITALIAN LEATHER COUCH

slides smoothly down the ramp.  On the couch sits DELIA
DEETZ.

The couch CRASHES into the base of the staircase,
smashing the newel post and several of the balusters.
Barbara cringes.  One of the balusters falls at Delia's
side.  She grasps it like a scepter.

Two MOVING MEN rush down the ramp.

MOVING MAN #1
Sorry about that, Mrs. Deetz.

DELIA
Don't worry.  It was going anyway.

Delia is relentlessly New York, relentlessly fashion-
able, relentlessly thin -- totally self assured.

She is also a woman with a mission -- to gut Barbara
and Adam's house and remake it in her own very upscale
image.

Delia's gaze is on the living room, but she looks
through Adam and Barbara as if they weren't even there
(which to her eyes they're not).

Still holding the baluster, Delia gets up off the couch
and moves into the living room, surveying it with an
odd mixture of ambition, and resolution.


BEHIND HER

the two Moving Men bring in a matching blue leather
armchair.  In the armchair sits LYDIA DEETZ.

Lydia, age 14, is a pretty girl, but wan, pale and
overly-dramatic, dressed as she is in her favorite
color, black.  She's a combination of a little death
rocker and an 80's version of Edward Gorey's little
girls.

She has a couple of expensive cameras around her neck
-- and is already taking photographs of the moving
men.  Lydia is cool, Lydia is sullen, Lydia is her
father's daughter by his first marriage.  Lydia is
usually about half-pissed off.  But underneath... we
like her a lot.

The Moving Men still hold up the chair, waiting for
Delia to decide where she wants it.

DELIA
(continuing)
Jesus.  Who lived here?  The
Waltons?

TIGHT ON Lydia -- calmly surveys the house.

Delia signals wearily that the Moving Men can put the
chair down anywhere.

DELIA
(continuing)
Get all this other crap out of
here.

Lydia hops down out of the chair, and comes farther
into the living room.

DELIA
(continuing)
Where is your father?... probably
in the kitchen.

That's the cue for CHARLES DEETZ, who comes in through
the swinging door, and across the dining room... a ner-
vous but basically pleasant man, CHARLES DEETZ is
intent on attacking rest and relaxation with the same
vengeance that earned him millions in real estate.

CHARLES
The noise in that kitchen.  Noisy
refrigerator, noisy faucets...
We'll have to replace it all.  I
want no humming in the house.


LYDIA

exploring on her own, gazes around the living room with
growing pleasure, she backs up for a good angle to
photograph.

CAMERA HINGES -- She is standing with her back right up
to Barbara -- who is horrified at this creature.

Charles enters.

CHARLES
(to Lydia)
What do you think, honey?

LYDIA
Delia hates it.

Lydia gazes at a dusty maze of spider webs.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I could live here.

A movement makes Lydia turn around and scream.  It is
Delia.  Not Barbara.

DELIA
Settle down, Lydia.  I wonder
where we are going to get
counseling for you out here.

A VIOLENT FALSETTO SCREAM turns the Deetz family's
attention to the front windows.

OTHO (O.S.)
Help!  Oh help!


OTHO'S MASSIVE BODY

Wedged in the window frame.  The short, stubby legs,
dressed in the world's largest pair of Georgia Armani
slacks, protrude into the living room, waving fran-
tically.  Expensive Italian loafers are kicked off the
feet, revealing a pair of expensive patterned socks.
By their feet shall ye know them.

DELIA
It's Otho!

CHARLES
Otho, why didn't you just come in
the door?

Otho's voice comes as if from a great distance.

OTHO (O.S.)
It's bad luck.  And I believe
hugely in luck.

DELIA
Hold your breath and we'll pull.

Delia turns to Charles and Lydia for help -- doesn't
get it -- and at last pulls Otho into the living room
single-handedly.

All this while the Moving Men are variously carting out
the handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous
new furniture.

Otho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and
faggoty.  But he's not all fat and fun -- this customer
carries nasty emotional weight as well.


OTHO

holds onto the curtains for support as he is pulled
through the window.  And when he is at last all the way
through, and upright on his feet, he suddenly gives a
tremendous yank.  The whole drapery apparatus,
including valences, crashes to the floor.

OTHO
That was the single most
unattractive window treatment I
have ever seen in the entire of my
existence.

DELIA
(starry eyed)
I'm so glad you could leave the
city to consult me, Otho.

Otho is looking around the room with an eye of quiet
horror.

OTHO
Yes, of course you are.  Well,
Otho had an intuition.  Call it a
hunch -- that it was going to be a
fabled monstrosity of a house.
And it certainly is.  Charles,
you're lucky the yuppies are
buying condos, so you can afford
what I'm going to have to do to
this place.  We are talking from
the ground ups'ville!

CHARLES
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me
out of it.  I am here to relax and
clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I
mean to do it.

He exits to find solace in a quiet corner of his house.
During this speech, Otho has been surreptitiously pos-
ing for Lydia's camera.  She clicks the shutter.

OTHO
(ignoring her)
Is the rest of the house as bad as
this?

DELIA
The rest of the house is probably
worse.  When can you and I get
started?

OTHO
No time like the present, as my
wicked stepmother used to say.

Out of the pockets of his size 56 Georgia Armani
jacket, Otho takes two cans of spray paint -- the kind
the graffiti artists use -- and shakes them as if they
were castanets.  They certainly sound like it.

OTHO
Delia, let's get this show on the
road.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

At one end, near the stairs leading up to the attic,
Barbara and Adam are slumped against opposite walls.

BARBARA
Adam, we are in hell.  I hate
these people.

ADAM
They make Jane look good.

BARBARA
Is this a punishment for something
we did in life?  What can we do?

ADAM
(determined)
We're not completely helpless.
I've been reading the book.
There's a word for people in our
predicament, honey.

Barbara looks at him.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Ghosts!

Barbara is shocked at the reality.

Otho and Delia come up the stairs at the end of the
hallway.

OTHO
We're dealing with negative
entertainment potential here.  I
mean, there's absolutely no organic
walking flow-through.

Otho looks down the hallway.  It's empty.  Adam and
Barbara are no longer there.

DELIA
What's wrong?

OTHO
I thought I saw something.

DeLia turns and spray-paints on the wall -- in luminous
orange -- the word MAUVE.

DELIA
Okay?

OTHO
(screaming with delight)
You read my mind!  I love clients
who can read my mind.  I don't
think people realize how strong a
connection there is between
interior design and the
supernatural.

DELIA
(fawning)
I know... I read your book, The
Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf.

OTHO
Gooood!

Delia opens the door and they step inside another room.

DELIA
This will be Lydia's room.


INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - DAY

It's not Lydia's room yet, of course, because it still
has the Maitlands' furniture in it.  Barbara had partly
wallpapered it before the accident.  Her tools are still
there.

DELIA
What do you think?

OTHO
Viridian?

DELIA
Viridian?  What is...?

Otho spray-paints the word VIRIDIAN on the wall -- plus
the word BLUE GREEN -- and Cr2 03, right over a picture
of Adam and Barbara as kids.

OTHO
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic
oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in
chemistry.  I was a hair analyst!
Briefly.  Interior design is a
science, Delia!  Think of me as
Doctor Otho.
(looking at wall)
And this patient is truly sick!

DELIA
Of course, her favorite color!
How beautiful!

Delia smiles.  Behind Delia and Otho, the room's closet
door swings slowly open with and ominous CREAK.


DELIA AND OTHO

turn that way, with a suggestion of dread.  Inside the
closet, Barbara's corpse is suspended from the ceiling
by a belt.  The corpse twists with a CREAK, and Barbara
grins ghostly -- and slowly tears off her face, leaving
nothing but muscle and bone beneath.  Her eyeballs
dangle on her cheeks.

Delia and Otho stare aghast.

DELIA
Oh my God!

OTHO
We just have to pray that the
other closets are bigger than this
one.

He walks over.  Looks inside.

OTHO
(continuing)
Were these people dwarfes? (sic)
(spies something)
Oooooo!...  Look!

He finds, neatly hung in plastic, the Maitlands'
wedding outfits.  Totally captivated by this powerful
image, he peers through the plastic at them.  Holding
each up to Delia.  Barbara watches wide-eyed at them.

OTHO
(continuing)
Ozzie...
(holding up
her dress)
... and... Harriet!  What happened
to these people?

Delia slams the door in Barbara's contorted face.

DELIA
They died.


INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

Delia and Otho come out of Lydia's bedroom and go
through the bathroom.  Disgusted, they continue on to
the study.


OTHO

reaches out and turns the knob.  The door swings omi-
nously open on Charles' study.  This had been Adam's
reading and birdwatching study.  Bird posters on the
wall, books everywhere.  Straight out of Better Homes
and Gardens 1963.

OTHO
Ooo.  Deliver me from L.L. Bean!


ANGLE

There is one slight difference, however, because on the
rag rug in the middle of the floor lies Adam's headless
corpse.  Standing over him, holding in one hand a long
knife and in the other Adam's blood-and-gore dripping
head is Barbara -- with a maniacal look on her face.
Behind them, Charles is thumbing through Adam's Audubon
collection.  He sits up like a cornered animal protect-
ing his territory.

CHARLES
(to Otho and Delia)
This room is off limits.  I don't
want either of you to touch one
piece of furniture in here.  This
is my room.


INSIDE THE ROOM

The eyes of Adam's severed head open and look up at
Barbara -- she stops screaming.

ADAM'S HEAD
They don't see us.  They can't
hear us.

Outside, Delia is shaking her head.

DELIA
The woman who lived here had the
aesthetic instincts of Betty
Crocker.

BARBARA
I'm going to get her.

DELIA
I cannot convey to you the extent
to which this house bores me.

OTHO
(looking around
scientifically)
Once you cover up the wallpaper,
knock down a few walls, alter the
traffic patterns, and -- perhaps
-- think about an inground pool --
the place might just be livable.
What's on the third floor?

DELIA
Attic space.

OTHO
Let's see.  We could turn that
into a media room.

They head up the stars to the attic.


INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Adam's head has a look of terror on it.

ADAM'S HEAD
Oh, God.  I forgot to lock the
attic door!

Adam's headless body jumps up off the floor and rushes
out of the room.


INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - SAME TIME

Otho and Delia climbing.  The headless corpse careens
past them, around the bend in the stairs and out of
sight.

OTHO
Did you feel something?

Delia shakes her head.

OTHO
(continuing)
I felt a cool wind.

The expression on Otho's face suggests he knows more
than he's telling.


INT. LANDING OUTSIDE ATTIC DOOR - SAME TIME

The headless corpse rushes through the open door into
the attic.


INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

The headless corpse slams the door shut, turns the key
in the lock.  Then he slumps against the locked door in
an exaggerated stance of relief.


INT. ATTIC LANDING - SAME TIME

Delia tries the knob.  The door is locked.

OTHO
You don't have a key?

DELIA
Maybe Charles does.

OTHO
I have a feeling there's some very
interesting space behind this
door.

DELIA
(sarcastic)
Probably the world's largest
Reader's Digest collection!
C'mon, let's have some chablis,
Otho, I'm laid bare by this
experience.  Entirely bare.


INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Barbara still holding Adam's head.

Charles still calmly leafing through the Audubons.

ADAM'S HEAD
Whew!  That was close.

BARBARA
I cannot witness this.

Barbara distractedly puts Adam's head on a bookshelf.
His headless body fumbles with the books and finally
reattaches the head.


INT. STUDY - DAY

Adam turns away from the window.

Barbara, fuming, moves around Charles making wild
gestures.

BARBARA
What's the good of being a ghost
if you can't frighten people to
death?

ADAM
Oh, honey...

BARBARA
No, I'm not putting up with this.

She storms out of the room.


INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Barbara storms in, as if straight from the room up-
stairs.  She heads straight for the back door.  Just as
she opens the door, Adam rushes up.

ADAM
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out
there.  You don't know --

BARBARA
Nothing can be worse than this...

She flings open the door and steps outside.  She
promptly disappears.

ADAM
Barbara!


EXT. SURFACE OF SATURN'S MOON TITAN - DAY

Barbara plunges into the dusty surface of Titan with an
enormous Saturn looming in the sky.  She looks around
with wonder and some fear.


A SULFUR VOLCANO

erupts in the distance.  A meteor CRASHES with a lurid
EXPLOSION.  As from a great distance she hears Adam's
VOICE.  Like THUNDER.

ADAM
Barbara!

She turns slowly in the yellow dense sand that covers
the surface of this distant moon.


BARBARA'S POV

Adam is trudging towards her.  Behind him, hovering
isolated in the air, is the kitchen door.


BACK TO SCENE

Adam at last catches up with her.  Surveys around them.

BARBARA
Oh Adam.  Find somebody.  I'm
getting all yellow.  Do something!


BEHIND THEM

Something is burrowing rapidly toward them through the
sand.  The Something could be right out of ""Dune"".


BARBARA AND ADAM

stare for a moment, then Adam grabs her and pulls her
toward the kitchen door.  But the kitchen door has
moved, so they veer in the new direction.

The Something follows them and rises out of the sand.


ON SOMETHING

It is a very big, very nasty, and very hungry SNAPPING
SANDWORM.  It ROARS and lunges at them.


BARBARA

slightly angered at it, instinctively bats at it.


THE SANDWORM

is momentarily stunned at Barbara's audacity.  It
freezes and shakes its loathesome head.


BARBARA

bats at it again.  Adam is wide-eyed, tries to pull her
away.  The Sandworm recovers and ROARS after them.


ADAM

grabs Barbara and tries to escape, but they slip and
sink in the sand.

They make it to the door just in time, swing it open
and hurl themselves through.  The door shuts with a
BANG just in front of the ROARING SANDWORM.

THE SANDWORM

rears and ROARS in frustration, HOWLING to the ringed
planet.


INT. KITCHEN

Barbara, weeping, throws herself in Adam's arms.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me
alone.

ADAM
You left me.

BARBARA
I know.  I'm sorry.

She hugs him tight.

BARBARA
(continuing)
I just realized that I could have
been killed alone.  Don't ever
leave me, honey.

Both contemplate that horror.

BARBARA
(continuing)
We're trapped in this house
forever... with those... people.

ADAM
You can't say that for sure.  It
could be a transitional thing.
Like a post-life crisis.  We just
have to be tougher with them.
Come on.  Have some brandy.
Spirits?

BARBARA
(a tentative smile)
Death didn't improve your sense of
humor.

They head for the dining room.


INT. DINING ROOM

Adam has his arms around Barbara's shoulder.  They walk
in the door and stumble upon the Deetzes at their
dinner.  Lydia's back is to them.  Barbara and Adam
back out of the room but stop to listen.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The Deetz's around the dining room table.  There are
candles and good china laid out-- but they're eating
out of Chinese take-out boxes.

DELIA
I can't believe that we're eating
Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan
up here?  Hunan?

CHARLES
There's only one Chinese
restaurant out here, darling, the
owners are Irish and Irish people
happen to cook Cantonese.  They
don't know better.

LYDIA
I plan to have a stroke from the
amount of MSG that's in this food.

DELIA
This is our first meal in this
house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do
our little private parts to make
it a pleasant one?

CHARLES
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a
darkroom in the basement.

LYDIA
(dramatically)
My whole life is a darkroom!
One... big... dark... room.

Delia rolls her eyes and nods.  She's been through this
before.

DELIA
Nonsense... you'll go to school,
maybe meet a farm boy.

Delia laughs.  Charles smiles.

LYDIA
(doleful)
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll
let me hang myself from a rope in
his barn.

CHARLES
Lydia, in a couple of years this
whole town will be filled with
people like us.

DELIA
We'll be the art center of summer
New York.  I'll start sculpting
again... I'll teach those gallery
bastards to refuse my sculpture.
And when Otho and I get through
with this house, you people are
not going to recognize it.

LYDIA
(dramatically)
I say let's keep it the way it is.

Delia stares at Lydia.

CHARLES
(smiles)
Good idea!

Delia shifts her glare to Charles.

LYDIA
I do.  I really like it.  I
mean, it's already sort of like
somebody's home, isn't it?  Their
couch is comfortable and doesn't
stick to your legs.  It smells
like a real home, not a French
whorehouse.

DELIA
Lydia, at your age, you are so
young.
(back to business)
Charles, we need to call that
awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow
and get the key to the attic door.
Can't you find a way to hold back
some of her commission?

CHARLES
We're going to have a lot to do
tomorrow...
The Goodwill truck is coming.

DELIA
... and whatever is up there in
that attic goes away with it.

CHARLES
Should have it fumigated, too.  I
saw a fly today.

Lydia looks at them with a mixture of sadness and
anger.


OUTSIDE THE DOOR - ON THE STAIRS

-- listening, sit Barbara and Adam.  A tear rolls down
her face.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam and Barbara are lying down on the floor, peering
out of one of the small windows overlooking the front
yard of the house.  The handbook open in front of them.


EXT. FRONT YARD - ADAM AND BARBARA'S POV - DAY

The entire front yard is alive with workmen and their
vehicles.  Plumbers, electricians, cable TV men, etc.
In the road on front of the house are several cars of
rubbernecking locals, astonished by all the activity.
The City has come to Town.  Moving men continue to move
in the Deetz' modern, expensive and ugly furniture.
They collide with Goodwill men coming out with the
Maitlands' lovely antiques and personal possessions.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam and Barbara just look at one another as if to say
""We're next!""  Adam leafs through the handbook furi-
ously.

BARBARA
Look in the index...

ADAM
Not really...  what's this?

Adam pulls from the book an ancient, yellowed,
crumbling handbill.  He carefully opens it.

ON handbill -- very primitive, crude, red printing.

ADAM (V.O.)
(reading)
Having difficulty adjusting?
Is death a problem and not a
solution?  Unhappy with eternity?
Troubled by the living?  Call
Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.
That's Betelgeuse,  Betel...

The remainder of the sheet is torn off.

ON Barbara -- fingering the torn edge.  Looking in the
book for the remainder.  No luck.

BARBARA
That's it?  No number, or
instructions?

ADAM
Nothing.  The bio-exorcist?  I
don't get it...


INT. KITCHEN

Charles, away from the chaos outside is calmly steeping
a mug of herb tea.  His solitude is interrupted by a
2500 lb. Vulcan range breaking through a too-small
kitchen window.

CHARLES
(shouting through
the window)
What the hell are you trying to do
out there?


DELIA - OUTSIDE

is berating the inept crane operator and shrieks
periodically at some fine art movers who are struggling
under her horrid modern welded steel sculptures.


LYDIA

snaps photos of the mayhem.  She stops to scan the whole
house.


LYDIA'S POV

When her gaze reaches to top of the house, she suddenly
glimpses Barbara and Adam's faces in the window.


BACK TO SCENE

Lydia blinks hard.  Her mouth drops open.  She looks
all around -- as if she'd just seen a ghost or two.


JANE BUTTERFIELD'S CAR

pulls up.  Little Jane sits in the front seat, burdened
with an enormous stack of collated and stapled copies.

Lydia catches sight of Jane and runs over.

Little Jane locks her door, in fear of Lydia-the
strange.  Lydia stares at her.

LITTLE JANE
Are you a boy or a girl?

LYDIA
I only speak to vertebrates.

LYDIA
What happened to the people who
used to live here?

LITTLE JANE
(ratty little voice)
They drowned!

JANE
Yes, they were family.  I was
devastated.
(beat)
Here, darling.

Jane hands a key to Lydia.

LYDIA
(impressed)
Is this the key to the attic?

JANE
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open
any door in that house.  Will you
give it to your father?
(handing her a
business card)
And you might mention that I
single-handedly decorated the
house.  In case he needs advice in
that area.  Come see me.

Jane goes away.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Lydia's face sobers as she looks up at the now empty
attic window.

DELIA (O.S.)
Help!  Get off me!

Lydia drops the skeleton key into her pocket surrepti-
tiously.  She follows Delia's SHRIEKING.


EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Lydia rounds the corner to see Delia, pinned flat
against the house by one of her horrid steel sculp-
tures.  Two movers are struggling to free her.  Lydia
snaps a quick photograph.

They finally free Delia.  She clutches at her head,
just short of tearing her hair out.

DELIA
You jerks!  That is my art, and it
is dangerous!  You think I want to
want to die like that?
(seeing Lydia)
Lydia.  Moving is a family affair.
So buckle down now and go get
Mommy some drugs.

LYDIA
Any particular kind?

DELIA
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!

Lydia walks off toward the house.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara is half-hiding on the edge of the window.

BARBARA
That little girl saw us.

ADAM
She couldn't have.  We can't make
them see us.

BARBARA
But she saw us.  I could feel it.

ADAM
(pause, thinking
that over)
That's all we need.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Lydia looks up the stairs at the attic landing.  She's
a little scared.  She decides to go up the dark stairs.

IN THE HALL

At the end of the hall stands Charles, directing men
who are carrying books into the room that will be his
study.

He continues on.


A BLAST of STEAM

fills the hallway, because workmen are already going at
the wallpaper.  Lydia emerges from it.  Looking up at
stairway to attic, mounting courage.


INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - DAY

Lydia creeps upward, taking the skeleton key from her
pocket.  FLOORBOARDS SQUEAK.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam works on his model.  He hears the SQUEAK, looks up
confidently.

ADAM
(whispering)
Don't worry.  I've locked it.

Barbara smiles and knits while rocking in her chair.


INT. ATTIC LANDING

Lydia quietly inserts the key in the lock of the attic
door.  She turns it.  The key is stiff.  She turns
harder.  It's stuck.  Lydia tries the door -- it's no
go.  She turns the key again.  This time it goes all
the way around.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara and Adam, surprised by the key, look at each
other, carefully, very quietly, stand up and tiptoe
toward door.


ON THE SCREEN OF AN OLD TV SET

in the corner of the attic -- Suddenly -- a ghostly
image POPS ON.


ON TV - A BIZARRE, SMALLISH FELLOW

outfitted in a too-big cowboy hat, bad wig, and over-
sized sunglasses appears on screen singing very
quickly.  (It's a heavily disguised BETELGEUSE.)


BEHIND HIM

the CAMERA QUICKLY PANS an assortment of tombstones a
la Cal Worthington.

BETELGEUSE
(singing)
Have the living got you down?
Betelgeuse!
Are they jacking you around?
Betelgeuse!
Have you broken out in hives
'Cause you're tired of their jive?
I will drive them from your
hive... Betelgeuse!


ANOTHER ANGLE

CAMERA TILTS DOWN a flashing tombstone with
""BETELGEUSE"" written on it.  Adam rushes over to shut
it off.  He can't find a plug.  He looks around behind
set... no workings inside at all.  He peers around to
the screen.  It is blank.  Suddenly -- Betelgeuse POPS
ON AGAIN.

BETELGEUSE
Say it once... Betelgeuse
Say it twice... Betelgeuse.
The third time's a charm...
Betelgeuse!
Come on down!

He POPS OFF.  Adam and Barbara stare at each other.


INT. LANDING - DAY

Lydia listens.  Did she hear something?  She puts her
hand on the knob and tries to turn it.  It's stuck.

Then the key eerily pops out of the lock and falls on
the floor.

Charles' head suddenly appears behind her.  Scares her.

CHARLES
What are you doing?


INT. ATTIC

Adam is holding on tight to the knob of the door.  With
her knitting needle, Barbara has poked the key out.

The two stand absolutely still, listening, terrified of
the living intruders.


INT. ATTIC LANDING - LYDIA AND CHARLES

LYDIA
I was just trying to open the
door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought
over a skeleton key.

CHARLES
Let me have it.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara and Adam tighten.


ON THE LANDING

LYDIA
But it doesn't work.

She hands her father the key.  He looks at it and
throws it in the corner.

CHARLES
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway,
this can wait.  We'll get a
crowbar later.  Where's your
mother?

LYDIA
(very quick de-
cisive delivery)
Stepmother.

CHARLES
I'm going down to relax.  I want a
noise-free zone.  Do you
understand?  Noise-free.

He goes down the stairs.

LYDIA
Dad?

He continues.

CHARLES
(irritated, over
his shoulder)
What?

LYDIA
I'm lonely.

A BLAST OF STEAM from below drowns out her words.
Charles stops and turns around.  The BLAST STOPS.

CHARLES
What?


TIGHT ON LYDIA

She is resolved.

LYDIA
Nothing.

Charles continues.  She begins to follow slowly.


ON KEY

behind Lydia.  WIDEN as Adam rushes out the door, grabs
the key and rushes back in again.  Lydia hears some-
thing but doesn't see.


INT. ATTIC

Barbara and Adam have moved away from the door.

ADAM
(looking through
the handbook)
We need some help.  I found
something this morning.  Here.
Emergencies.
(reads)
""In case of emergency, draw door.""

BARBARA
Draw door?  I don't know why we
keep looking in that stupid book.

Adam takes a piece of chalk and draws a little door on
the exposed brick of the chimney.

BARBARA
(continuing)
You don't actually think this
is going to work?

Adam draws a doorknob.  Then he tries to turn it.  The
door, perhaps to his surprise, fails to open.

BARBARA
Yet another triumph for Adam and
Barbara in the afterlife.  Why
don't we try this Beetle guy??...

ADAM
Wait.

He looks at book, then writes on the door:  KNOCK AND
ENTER.  He exchanges a glance with Barbara.  She's even
more skeptical than before.  Turns away in disgust.

Adam knocks on the door, and turns the knob.  Nothing.
She is more disgusted.  Adam goes back to the book.

ADAM
(continuing)
Aha!  Knock three times.


ANOTHER ANGLE

He knocks three times.  Turns knob.  The chalked door
swings magnificently open.

Behind is an eerie light source, SOARING MUSIC, maybe
even a heavenly choir singing pear-shaped syllables.

Barbara and Adam look at one another again.  They hold
hands and step tentatively through.

Their figures are lost in the blinding light.

They start to shut door after them.


ON THE ATTIC LANDING

Lydia is staring at the light pouring from under the
attic door.  It suddenly goes out.

ON LYDIA

She is dumbfounded.  She listens.


ON THE LANDING

Lydia speeds down the steps.


INT. CHARLES' STUDY - DAY

Charles, fiercely intent on relaxing, paces like a
catfish out of water.  Ralph Lauren in K-mart.  He
stretches.  He sits uneasily in an easy chair, tries
like hell to get comfortable.  Finally, he puts a book
under his bottom to get sitting straight.  Looks around
tapping his fingers.  What to do?  Looks at watch.

He takes down a book from Adam's library, it is an
Audubon book of birds.  He whips through it like it's
the comics and then looks around for more.

He finds the ""Illustrated Walden"" by Thoreau.  He
speed reads it.

He is now really bored.  Goes to the fireplace, tries
to light it.  Cannot do it.  Goes to desk and writes:

OTHO-INSTALL GAS FIRE LOGS IN
STUDY.

He studies bird posters.  Finds beautiful cardinal
picture.

Takes field glasses and looks out window.


HIS POV

Spies big ugly-looking ratty bird devouring something.


ON CHARLES

horrified.  Wrinkles his nose.

Lydia enters.  He jumps.

CHARLES
Jesus Christ!

Lydia is shocked.

CHARLES
(continuing)
Darling, can't you see I'm
relaxing in here!

LYDIA
Well I just wanted to tell you
what I saw.

CHARLES
Lydia.  What the hell is the point
of my moving up here if you people
won't let me relax?  Go help your
mother.

Charles returns to field glasses, spies something.  She
looks at him in frustration.

LYDIA
(on her way out)
Fine.  Maybe you can relax in a
haunted house.  But I can't.

She exits.  Charles peers after her, brow furrowed.
Looks out again at the village.  Uses his field glasses
to get a better look.


HIS POV

It is the Bozman Building.  Ernie is out front pol-
ishing the brass lion.


ON CHARLES

He thinks.  Moves the field glasses to punctuate his
discovery of the building.  (His eyes never leave field
glasses throughout the following.)

CHARLES
Nice building... Bad paint.  Good
lines... bad roof.  Good
parking... hmmm???

That really registers with him.  Without looking, he
dials a familiar number on the phone with one hand,
lifts the receiver.  He clacks his teeth together pur-
posefully.

SECRETARY'S VOICE
Botco International.

CHARLES
Yes, I'd like to speak with Maxie
Dean.

SECRETARY'S VOICE
He's not in right now.

CHARLES
Well tell him that Charles Deetz
called.

He hangs up and continues to spy on Bozman Building.
Clacks his teeth.

CHARLES
(continuing)
My God what I could do with that
parking.

DISSOLVE TO:


TIGHT SHOT - BARBARA AND ADAM

Very still, they look cautiously to the right and left
-- just with their eyes.  They're astounded by what
they see, though we don't yet see it.

ADAM
... Not what I expected when we
walked through that door.

BARBARA
No. But it's somewhere without big
worms.

CAMERA DRAWS BACK and we find that Adam and Barbara are
in:


INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

The most unpleasant waiting room that you ever remember
waiting in.  Fifties furniture with broken legs,
couches propped up on telephone books.

Standing ashtrays with dirty stand.  Linoleum floors
patched a hundred times.  National Geographics with the
covers torn off.  The ""Take a number"" registers in the
millions.


AS THE CAMERA COMPLETES A CIRCLE OF THE ROOM

We see a RECEPTIONIST.  She's the quintessential 50's
receptionist -- tight sweater, bullet-breasted bra,
bleached hair, red lipstick.  She's wearing a ribbon
across her breast reading ""MISS ARGENTINA"" and there
are knife slashes across both wrists.

RECEPTIONIST
You don't have an appointment, do
you?

ADAM
W... We didn't know how to make one.

BARBARA
An appointment for what?

RECEPTIONIST
What do you want?

BARBARA
We need some help.

RECEPTIONIST
Already?  You just bit the big one
nine months ago and you want help?

ADAM
Nine months?  What difference does
that make?

RECEPTIONIST
(shrugging)
Good luck.  You're going to use up
all your help vouchers.

ADAM
Help vouchers?

RECEPTIONIST
D-90's.  You spend a hundred
and twenty-five years on earth,
actually, in that house, during
which you get only three class-one
D-90 intercessions with Juno.  You
probably haven't even read through
the manual completely yet.

BARBARA
Why three?


TYPIST

Behind the Receptionist holds up both hands each of
which have only three fingers on them.

TYPIST
Rule Number Three.  Everything
comes in threes...

RECEPTIONIST
You'll have to wait if you don't
have an appointment.

BARBARA
How long do we have to wait?

ADAM
Wait for who?

RECEPTIONIST
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not
that it matters to your type.  But
there are all these other people
here ahead of you.  I'd say 3
hours.

The waiting room is now filled with people.  Dead
people, some in fairly awful states.  A cornucopia of
carnal shreddage.

Adam and Barbara look around for a moment, then very
quietly, they reach out to grasp hands.

RECEPTIONIST
(continuing)
Number 54 million, six hundred
one.  Ferndock.

CAMERA PUSHES IN CLOSE.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. ATTIC LANDING - DAY

Lydia kneels down with a screwdriver, a nail file, an
ice pick, and a credit card.  She inserts nail file
into the door.  She struggles, and after several
attempts -- finally uses the ice pick and POP!  The
door swings open ominously.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia enters.  The room is dim, and filled with dust
motes.  There are shadows in all the corners.

She bumps into a switch which engages the model sun and
moon and that eerily illuminates the model town.  She's
frightened, then entranced.

She peers at it from different angles, her fear for-
gotten.  She notes small tools scattered around an
unfinished area.  She continues around the model,
oblivious to everything else.  Then...

She kicks something.  Ducks under the table and comes
up with something, holds it up to the light.  It's the
handbook.  She looks through it.  Finds the marked
page... looks at the chalk door.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

Barbara and Adam are still holding hands, as if they
hadn't moved.  Like waiting for an IRS audit.

BARBARA
(to Adam)
Is this what happens when you die?

The Receptionist overhears.  She points at Barbara.

RECEPTIONIST
This is what happens when YOU die.
(points to another
corpse)
That is what happens when HE dies.
That is what happens when THEY
die.  It's highly personal.  And
I'll tell you something... if I
knew then what I know now... I
wouldn't have had my little
""accident!""

She holds up her wrists and smiling at her little joke,
wriggles them indicating her slashes.

OTHER CORPSES
(all together)
Amen!

Barbara and Adam look at them.  Corpses resume doing
what they were doing.  A GRINDING NOISE O.S. -- The
Receptionist looks up.

Barbara and Adam also look O.S.


THEIR POV

A Message delivery wire GRINDS along loudly on a
pulley.  The actual message is held in the hand of the
MESSENGER, a flattened corpse, suspended as if on a
shirt clothesline, tire marks on his face and clothing.
A major roadkill.  Dust and gravel ground into him.  He
smiles wanly at Barbara and Adam as the Receptionist
takes a message on a piece of paper and reads it.

RECEPTIONIST
Maitland, party of two!  Take your
handbook and go to the sixth door.

Barbara and Adam upset at the loss of their handbook...

BARBARA
We forgot our handbook.

CUT TO:


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia is studying the handbook with intense interest.

CHARLES (O.S.)
(from distant
downstairs)
Lydia, Delia needs your help!

Lydia gives one more look at the book, and then goes to
the door quickly and silently.

CHARLES (O.S.)
Right now, Delia says!


INT. OFFICE - DAY

RECEPTIONIST
(shaking her head
in disgust)
Out that way, through the typing
pool, down the corridor, sixth
door on your left.  Sixth door.
Two threes.
(shaking her head)
Airhead.

Adam and Barbara walk through a door.


INT. TYPING POOL - DAY

A vast room of desks arranged in a grid, straight
out of ""How To Succeed In Business""... Each desk is
occupied, too, but most of the secretaries are merely
skeletons, or mouldering corpses slumped over their
typewriters.

Only one secretary, somewhere in the vast grid, is
typing slowly, with long pauses between words.

The Messenger on his return trip, parallels Barbara and
Adam as they walk along.  Barbara can't look at him.

MESSENGER
How do I look?  There're no
mirrors on this side.

ADAM
(trying to be
pleasant)
Fine, you look fine.

MESSENGER
Thanks.  I've been feeling a
little flat.


ANOTHER ANGLE

He laughs at his own joke as he goes back through the
very, very narrow slot in the wall where the line
runs.  Adam and Barbara look to the right and left.
A vast stack of files slips off a desk and spills out
onto the floor.


INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Barbara and Adam enter corridor.

Empty, like a hotel corridor, but all the doors are of
different types -- a revolving door, a dutch door,
church doors.  They walk past a waist-high window,
covered by a roll-up shade.

BARBARA
A hundred twenty-five years!
I can't believe it.  I can't
believe they didn't tell us.

She bumps into the shade and it rolls up FLAPPING.  She
stares in through the window.  Adam peers in it too.


THEIR POV

A smouldering, mist-filled room.  From the smoky plasma
floats an occasional tortured soul.  Unspeakably SAD
MUSIC wafts from within.  They get only a glimpse of
the bodies in this horrible human soup.

BARBARA
Adam, look at this.

Suddenly, floating up from below, immediately on the
other side of the window, a white-crepe face emerges.
It seems to be that of a woman, her eyes are red and
blue tears rim them.  Her pale skin is covered with a
flaking crust of salt.  She wears the saddest look
ever.  Her mouth opens plaintively but no sound comes.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Oh, Adam... what is this?

A reflection joins them on their side of the window.


A SINISTER LITTLE JANITOR

wizened and efficient, pulls the shade down firmly.

SINISTER MAN
That's the lost souls room.
A room for ghosts who have been
exorcised.  Poor devils.  That's
death for the dead.  It's all in
the handbook.  Keep moving.

The man scuttles off.  Adam and Barbara walk on sadly,
until they come to a door that looks exactly like the
swinging door between the kitchen and dining room of
their house.

ADAM
This is it... the sixth door.

Puzzled -- Barbara pushes it.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Everything is dark, quiet -- but the furniture is
obviously not theirs, and neither is the decoration.
Adam and Barbara exchange glances, and push on through
into the living room.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Quiet, dark.  Everyone's asleep.

ADAM
My God, we're back home.

BARBARA
Look at this, everything is
different down here.  All our
furniture is gone.

ADAM
How long do you suppose we were
waiting?

JUNO
Three months.


ANOTHER ANGLE

A spot comes on, revealing JUNO -- their caseworker.
She's an older woman, no nonsense about her.  Over-
dressed in an outfit that includes a blouse with
ruffled cuffs.  We will at some point catch a glimpse
of her slashed throat -- she smokes heavily.  Occa-
sionaly smoke puffs from her cut throat.

JUNO
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was
about to leave.  I do have other
clients.

BARBARA
Are you Juno, our caseworker?

JUNO
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases
and determine if help is needed,
deserved, and available.

BARBARA
We need help.  We deserve help.

ADAM
Are you available?

JUNO
No.
(beat)
What's wrong?

BARBARA
We're very unhappy.

JUNO
What do you expect?  You're dead.

ADAM
We'd like some help in getting rid
of the people who moved in here.
Barbara and I worked very hard on
this house.

BARBARA
We probably wouldn't mind sharing
the house with people who were --

JUNO
-- like you used to be?

BARBARA
Yes.

ADAM
But these people --

He indicates a particularly bad piece of Delia's sculp-
ture.  Juno walks around it shaking her head.


INT. HOUSE

The following conversation takes place as Barbara and
Adam follow Juno as she looks around the house and ends
up in their attic space.

JUNO
Things seem pretty quiet here.
You should thank God you didn't
die in Italy.
(checking the file)
The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been
studying the manual?

ADAM
We tried.

JUNO
The Intermediate Interface chapter
on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em
out yourself.  It's your house.
Haunted houses don't come easy.

BARBARA
We don't quite get it.

Juno's watch BUZZES, she stops it.

JUNO
I heard.
(refers to her file)
Tore your face right off!  Bad
news.  It obviously doesn't do
any good to pull your heads off in
front of people if they can't see
you.

ADAM
We have to start simpler, is that
it?

JUNO
Start simply.  Do what you know.
Use your talents.  Practice.  We
only help those who help
themselves.  Just do a little at a
time.  And of course, practice,
practice, practice.  It's tricky
but -- you weren't murderers by
any chance, were you?

BARBARA
No.

JUNO
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an
easy time of it.  Just look at
Amityville.
(reminiscing)
He was one of my boys.  Didn't
have to give that one any lessons.
From day one... But I must be
off... I've got a plane load of
football players crashed in the
midwest... they need a lot of
help, just with the basics.

Points at her head indicating dumbness.

BARBARA
If... we have trouble.  What about
the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...

JUNO
(quickly interrupt-
ing her)
Don't say his name, you don't want
his help.

Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Puzzled.

ADAM & BARBARA
Well... We might...


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Juno peers into the model cemetery with interest.  A
FLY BUZZES around her.  Juno blows it away.  Fly flees.

JUNO
No you don't!  He does not work
well with others.

BARBARA
What do you mean?  What's he do?

A grave look comes over Juno's face as the light
changes to suggest someone telling a ghost story around
a campfire.

JUNO
I wasn't going to bring it up --
but rather than have you stumble
into it and make another mistake,
I'll tell you --
(she nervously puffs
her cigarette)
He was my assistant, but he was a
troublemaker...
He went out on his own as a free-
lance bio-exorcist -- claims to
get rid of the living... got into
more trouble -- you remember the
Chicago Fire...

Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Juno continues.

JUNO
(continuing)
He was demoted to a Grade-6
malevolent spirit.  He's been
imprisoned on that plane ever
since... in fact, I believe he's
been sleezing around your cemetery
lately.  He can only be brought
back by saying his name three
times.

Adam and Barbara attempt to interrupt --

JUNO
(continuing)
But I strongly suggest that you
remove the Deetz's yourself.

She takes a final drag on the cigarette and smoke
billows out the hole in her throat.  Juno starts to
FADE.

ADAM
And if we need you again, how do
we...?

Juno fades.  Gone.  Barbara goes to the model, looks
at the cemetery.

BARBARA
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh,
Adam.

ADAM
(holds her shoul-
ders, calms her)
Look, she's right.  We'll just
start simple, honey, be tougher.
I feel... confident.  C'mon.

They exit.


CAMERA FOLLOWS ACTION - OVER THE MODEL

The FLY BUZZES.  It lands and crawls along into the model of
the cemetery.


THE FLY

resplendently green and iridescent, pauses and fiddles
with its hairy parts.  Starts to walk by.

VOICE
Pssstt!  Over here!

Fly stops.  Tilts its multi-eyed head.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Two hands come up from the earth of that grave holding
a candy bar.

VOICE
I can't use this.  You should have
it.  Flies get so little respect
anymore.


THE FLATTERED FLY

walks over to the grave.  In a flash, the hands grab
the struggling fly and dance it like a doll over the
grave and then pull it into the earth.

FLY
Buzzz!
(turns into)
Help me!  Help me!

A MANIACAL LAUGH grows from the grave.  WIND BLOWS as
the Fly disappears.  Ivy whips away from the grave-
stone.  We see, for the first time, the chiseled name:

BETELGEUSE

CLAP OF THUNDER.


INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT

Charles is on the phone.  He has drawings laid out in
front of him.  He is at his most urban persuasive, and
oddly relaxed -- he is finally in his own element.

CHARLES
Maxie, have I not always made you
money?  I think that is the only
real question here.


INT. MAXIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

New York office, cool design, black couch, and MAXIE
DEAN, a 55-year-old, super tan, white-haired wheeler
dealer.  Sign says:  CHAIRMAN of BOTCO INDUSTRIES.
Maxie looks rich and he looks cool as he talks to
Charles.  Behind him, Sarah, his rich-looking blonde
wife, is looking at herself in a mirror.

MAXIE
Well, Charles -- no one has made me
money like you.  Until your nerves
went, you were a demon.  It is
just that... Winter River,
Connecticut is, you'll forgive me,
no fucking where.  Why would I
invest that kind of money to buy
an old building way the hell up
there?


INTERCUT CONVERSATION

CHARLES
Not a building!  That's the beauty
of it.  I think I can buy the
whole town.  These people don't
know the value of their property!

MAXIE
Then we own a whole town full of
nowhere.

CHARLES
No, No -- C'mon, Max, you know
me.  I've got plans.  You gotta
come up here and see, then I'll
tell you about it.

Maxie isn't much interested.

MAXIE
Well, sure, Charles, but I am busy
here... you know how it was when
you were active.

This burns Charles.  But he swallows it.  He hears
something in the corridor outside -- a kind of LOW
MOANING.

CHARLES
(into telephone)
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody.

MAXIE
No listen... we'll talk about
this visiting later, I gotta go,
I gotta meeting on the Japanese
joint venture.

CHARLES
(torn between the
MOANING and Maxie)
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese
could run it for us.  Listen,
think right about it, will you?
We've almost got the house ready,
you bring Sarah with you and I'll
show you.

MAXIE
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it.
Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up
there, ya hear?

Maxie hangs up.  Shakes his head.

MAXIE
(continuing)
Putz!  Inter River?  My ass.


INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT

Charles hangs up frustrated.  MOANING INCREASES.  He
goes to the door and flings it open.

A figure is right there in the doorway -- A ghost under
a sheet.  But a ""designer"" sheet.  He wails away like a
banshee.  Eyeholes cut in sheets, Charles jumps, re-
covers.

CHARLES
Oh, Jesus, Lydia!  Is Connecticut
so boring that you have to think
up shit like this?

ON Barbara, she stands back away from the door observ-
ing skeptically.

CHARLES
(continuing)
I had Maxie Dean on the phone!
Darling, Dad's found a way to make
some money here while I relax, so
scram!

He slams the door, turns around.  Then turns around
again, and jerks the door open.  The ghost is retreat-
ing, beaten.

CHARLES
(continuing)
And your mother is going to kill
you when she sees that you cut
holes in her $300 sheets.  You
provoke her you know.  I mean she
can be an unreasonable bitch.  But
you do provoke her.

He SLAMS the door again.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Adam helps Barbara on with her sheet.

BARBARA
God, this is so corny.  Have we
been reduced to this?  Sheets?

ADAM
Think of them as death shrouds.
And the moaning is important.
Really moan!
(imitating Juno)
Practice, practice, practice.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Television still going, Delia asleep with curlers.
Adam and Barbara glide inside, go over and stand beside
the bed.

ADAM
Deep breath... and...


INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - NIGHT

She has her ever-present camera around her neck.  Sud-
denly hears MOANS from her parents' room.  Thinking it
is sexual, she cringes.  Covers her ears.

LYDIA
Gross!  How can he stand that
woman?
(louder)
Hey, cut it out!  I'm a child!
For God sakes!

The NOISE gets weirder.  Lydia gets interested.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam and Barbara moan and groan.  Delia doesn't stir.

BARBARA
I feel really stupid.

ADAM
It's not stupid.  We're ghosts.
Do you want this woman for
breakfast for 125 years?  Moan
louder!

Barbara moans louder and more weirdly.

Delia stirs, sits up, but doesn't open her eyes.

Adam and Barbara are excited then... disappointed as
Delia fumbles on the bedside table for the remote con-
trol device, and without opening her eyes, turns off
the television set.  Then she turns over, and is lost
to the world totally.

Barbara sighs.  She and Adam walk toward the door.
When they open it however, Lydia is standing there in
her pajamas -- she snaps a FLASH Polaroid -- and Adam
and Barbara jump backwards with yelps of fright.

LYDIA
Sick!  Sexual perversion!  If
you're going to do weird sexual
stuff you ought to stay in your
bedroom, okay?

Lydia starts back into her room.  Then looks at the
developing photograph.  Something catches her eye.

Lydia yelps with fear.

LYDIA
Holy cow!  No feet!

She screams.  Adam and Barbara scream.  Lydia rushes
back toward them, starts flashing pictures.

Adam and Barbara run around and are pushed into a
corner.  Polaroids fly everywhere.

Lydia runs out of film.  She stares at them, panting
with fear.  A standoff.

LYDIA
(continuing)
A... Are you the guys who're
hiding out in the attic?

ADAM
(fake terror voice)
We're ghosts.

Barbara moans.

LYDIA
(skeptical, cautious)
W... What do you look like under
there?

Adam and Barbara pull shut bedroom door, go out into
the hall -- as if to keep from waking Delia with their
conversation.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

All three stare at each other tentatively.

ADAM
Aren't you scared?

LYDIA
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren.
Those are sheets.  Are you gross
under there?  Are you ""Night of
the Living Dead"" under there?
Like all bloody veins and pus?

ADAM
What?

LYDIA
""Night of the Living Dead?""  It's
a movie.

BARBARA
(pulling off
the sheet)
If I had seen a ghost at your age,
I would have been frightened out
of my wits.

LYDIA
You're not gross.  Why were you
wearing a sheet?

BARBARA
We're practicing.

ADAM
You can actually see us?  Without
the sheets?

LYDIA
Is this like a trick question?

BARBARA
Tell the truth.

LYDIA
(offended)
Of course I can see you.

ADAM
Nobody else can.

LYDIA
I'm wearing contacts... Also I
read through the ""Handbook for the
Recently Deceased.""  It says that
live people ignore the strange and
unusual... I, myself, am strange
and unusual.

BARBARA
(tenderly)
You look like a regular girl to me.

Lydia blushes.  Barbara smiles warmly.  She is begin-
ning to like Lydia.

ADAM
You read our book?  Could you
follow it?

Lydia nods her head.

LYDIA
Why are you creeping around
Delia's bedroom?

ADAM
We were trying to scare your
mother.

LYDIA
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive
about being related to reptiles.

Barbara smiles.

LYDIA
(continuing)
You can't scare her.  She's
sleeping with Prince Valium
tonight.
(defiantly)
I stole the key to your attic, you
know.

Adam and Barbara look at each other.

BARBARA
Maybe we better talk.


INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

Adam's rigged up the moon, and stars, too.  Adam and
Barbara and Lydia stand just beyond the fringes of the
town, dimly lighted giants.

LYDIA
You did this?  You carved all
these little figures and houses
and things?

ADAM
(pleased)
I certainly did.  I'd finish it
too, but... I don't get out much.

LYDIA
And this used to be your house, I
bet.  Why do you want to scare
everybody?

ADAM
We want to frighten you away.
(a little embarrassed)
So that you'll move out.

LYDIA
You don't know the Deetz's very
well, do you?  My father bought
this place.  He never walks away
from equity.  Why don't you leave?

BARBARA
We can't.  We haven't left the
house since the funeral.

LYDIA
Funeral.  God, you guys really are
dead!
(fascinated)
What was it like?  The funeral.
Did you cry?

ADAM
We weren't there.  The handbook
says funerals aren't for the dead.

LYDIA
God, if this is true this is
amazing!  I kinda like it up
here.  Can I visit you sometimes?

ADAM
Well, I don't know... We don't get
many visitors.

BARBARA
You know you're really a pretty
girl.

Lydia flushes.

CHARLES (O.S.)
Lydia!

LYDIA
I better go...

BARBARA
Wait... I don't think it would be
a very good idea if you told your
parents that we're up here.

ADAM
Unless you think it would scare
them off.

Lydia starts to exit.

ADAM
(continuing)
You tell them that we are
desperate horrible ghoulish
creatures who will stop at nothing
to get back our house.

LYDIA
(looks him up
and down)
Wait a minute, what if this is a
dream?  Can you do any tricks to
prove I'm not dreaming?

Barbara shakes her head, a little ashamed.

LYDIA
(continuing)
Well, if you are real ghosts, you
better get another routine, those
sheets suck!

She sneaks a smile at Barbara and exits.


EXT. HOUSE - DAY

A big ugly machine is doing something unnecessary to
the yard.


INT. DARKROOM/BASEMENT - DAY

The FAST-TICKING CLOCK is a timer.  Lydia is making
Polaroid enlargements.  She's quick and expert at this.
She's examining a print with a magnifying glass.


INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY

Delia shrieks.  Going through the dirty clothes, she's
just come across the sheets with the eye holes in them.

DELIA
Lydia!  Lydia!  My hands are
shredded from doing the laundry,
and now I have to deal with your
vandalism!


INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Lydia, pounding up from the basement with the wet
print, collides with Delia, rushing down from the sec-
ond floor with the scissored sheets.

DELIA
Lydia, honest to God I'm going to
kill you.  I'm having a party
tonight.  I'm cooking, I can't get
servants.  Do I need angst?  No, I
certainly do not!

Lydia speeds by her.

DELIA
(continuing)
You owe me three-hundred bucks,
Lydia!  Don't go running to your
father, you worm.


INT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY

Lydia rushes in.  Charles is working furiously on a
word processor, amidst an array of maps and plans.

LYDIA
Dad.  Do you believe me?

CHARLES
Yes.  Except when you creep around
in your mother's --

LYDIA
Stepmother's...

CHARLES
... sheets.

LYDIA
Well this is... I mean, this is
the weirdest --

CHARLES
Lydia, I don't know what it is
with you and these pratical
jokes, but --

LYDIA
This is not a joke!  That sheet
was full of ghosts.

She hands him the photo.  He looks.  Lydia points
out...

LYDIA
(continuing)
No feet.

Charles laughs.

LYDIA
(continuing)
You don't believe me.  That sheet
was full of ghosts.  They live
here.

Charles begins to scroll through computer program.

CHARLES
(dismissing it)
Very clever, Lydia.  Now would you
please -- I'll tell you what... I
know!  You're bored, right?  You
take that camera and your bike
and photograph every building in
town.  Don't tell anyone what it's
for...
(handing her a
wad of bills)
Here, take some cash and go do
it.  How's that?  You want to
stretch, don't you?

Lydia exits, with determination.  Charles looks up on
the wall and runs his finger over a plat map of Winter
River, just like Adam's in the attic.

CHARLES
(continuing)
Look at the size of these lots...

Adam peers at the map, puzzled.

ADAM
What is this guy doing?

Barbara follows Lydia out.  Adam thinks, intrigued.
Exits.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Delia is frantically preparing for the evening's dinner
party.  Lydia is very much in her way, trying to show
her the photographs.  Delia isn't looking at them.

DELIA
I can't believe you are doing this
to me!  Ghosts.  I am giving a
dinner party for seven people
tonight.  Otho has agreed to come
back for the demolition of the
attic.  My agent, Bernard, is
bringing some woman who writes for
""Art in America.""  In fact, no one
here tonight has not been in
""Vanity Fair.""  Except you.

LYDIA
(resigned)
I told them you were too mean to
be afraid.

DELIA
Don't you dare talk to others
about me.  I'm an artist!  The
only thing that scares me is being
embarrassed in front of my
friends.  Do you know how hard it
is to get civilized people to set
foot in this part of Connecticut?
Not a solitary word of this
pubescent tripe to anyone.

Lydia exits angrily.

CAMERA HINGES.  Barbara is watching, horrified at
Delia's occupation of her (Barbara's) kitchen.  Adam
appears.

BARBARA
Lydia's trying, but they don't
believe her.

ADAM
She's got photos, Barbara.

BARBARA
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!

ADAM
This is different.  Eventually
she'll take someone to the attic.
And then what?  We've got to try
to contact this guy Betelmyer.  We
gotta get some help, hon.


INT. ATTIC ROOM - LATER - DAY

Adam looks intently through the book.

Barbara's eye is caught by something in the model
cemetery.  She moves over and sees a small gravestone
lit up by neon.

BARBARA
Adam!

Adam comes over.  Looks.

ADAM
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.

BARBARA
It's him.  Look... Betelgeuse...
Betelgeuse...

She looks at Adam, ""should I?"" Adam chews his lip
thoughtfully.

ADAM
Go ahead... third time's a charm.

BARBARA
(after a deep breath)
Betelgeuse!

ZAP!  They are transported into the model graveyard.


EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

WIND BLOWS --  With shovels and lanterns, Adam and
Barbara are unlikely gravediggers.  The mechanized
clouds move in the sky across the mechanical moon,
throwing weird shadows everywhere.  Ground fog creeps
slowly along the graves.  It is so eerie.

BARBARA
What happened?

ADAM
Three times.  Powerful number.

BARBARA
(standing in front
of grave)
Bet... el... geuse.  What an
awful name.  I thought it was like
-- you know.  The juice of
beetles.

Adam cringes too.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Where is he?  What do we do?

Adam looks down at the grave.  Knocks on the stone.
Nothing.

ADAM
Has anything been simple so far?
From the look of the shovel, we
dig.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.
My nails keep getting longer.
I'll break them.

Hands her a shovel anyway.  She digs.


EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - LATER - NIGHT

They're almost down six feet.  By now they are both
almost out of sight in the grave.  Inside the grave --
Adam suddenly hits wood.

BARBARA
It's about time.

They lean down and brush dirt off a brass plate on the
coffin.

""BETELGEUSE""

ADAM
I guess we open it.

BARBARA
Maybe we should knock first?

A slight TREMOR shakes them.  They look at each other
and try to scramble from the grave.


TOPSIDE

They just barely crawl out when a mouldering corpse
springs out of the grave and jumps on Barbara's back,
and plants a thousand-year-old kiss on her lips.  She
screams and burbles.  Adam pulls the corpse off her
back.  The corpse does a Three Stooges hammer on Adam's
head.

Adam staggers backward, unhurt but shocked.  All three
stop.


ON THE CORPSE

Something unreal about him, almost mechanical.  Then
the corpse, grinning insanely at them, flies straight
up into the air over their heads.  He CRASHES against
the tombstone...

And Adam and Barbara see the corpse is only a huge
marionette on a string and pole.  A LAUGH comes from
behind the gravestone.


PUPPETEER BETELGEUSE

steps out.  He looks like someone who just crawled out
from under a rock.  This is one slippery customer.
Betelgeuse speaks in a rapid polyglot, choosing words
and phrases from every slang in the world.  Barbara is
mighty uneasy.

BETELGEUSE
All right.  Who are you?

BARBARA
We're...

BETELGEUSE
You're the dead.

ADAM
Aren't you dead?

BETELGEUSE
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a
businessman.  I'm the man what
am.  Beeetel Jooose!  Who
do I gotta kill?

ADAM
You don't kill anyone.

BARBARA
Just get some people out of our
house.

BETELGEUSE
Bio busting.  I love it.  Who do
I gotta kill?  Family -- right?
Obnoxious, I bet.
(contorting face)
Mommie, daddy, piglets.

BARBARA
Just one daughter.

BETELGEUSE
Hey you've been on Saturn!
(brushing yellow dust
off her)
I hate those Sandworms!  Yecchhh!
I've lost a lot of buddies to
Sandworms.
(back to work)
So a daughter?  She got good legs?
God I love a young leg.

Air blows up Barbara's dress, exposing her legs.  He
leers.

BARBARA
She's only fourteen...

ADAM
... acts like she's thirty-five.

BETELGEUSE
(rubbing hands)
How does she feel about short old
men with dirty ears?

Barbara is grossed out and increasingly uneasy.  Beetle
Juice senses it and gets back to business.

BETELGEUSE
So you, the dead, want me, the
undead, to throw the live guys --
Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who
might not mind a tumble with an
older guy, out into the cold?
Even though they have paid hard
casharoonie for your dump?

ADAM
But... the Deetzes are destroying
our house.

BETELGEUSE
(scolding sarcasm)
You Maitlands are the backbone of
the afterlife.  So what's my cut?

ADAM
Can you scare them off?

Beetle Juice looks offended.

BETELGEUSE
Me, scary?  You be the judge.


ANGLE

He swirls his face and shoulders into a horrifying
image.  Pleased, he laughs at himself.

BARBARA
(decisively)
Honey.  Let's go.

ADAM
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need
help.

BARBARA
No, we don't.  We can work
something out ourselves.  We just
have to try harder.

BETELGEUSE
Hold on.  Let's not be squeamish,
missy.  You rang my bell, you
gotta lick the pump.  I'm rolling!


BARBARA

grabs Adam.  Betelgeuse is getting mad.  Not pretty.

BETELGEUSE
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at
your service.  You be the judge.
I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.

BARBARA
Home.  Home.  Home!


ZAP

They are gone.  Betelgeuse is furious.

BETELGEUSE
You fresh corpse creeps!  Who do
you think you are?... Walking
away from a professional?


BETELGEUSE

walks to a tree and kicks it hard.  The whole huge tree
falls, KABLOOM!


INT. ATTIC - DAY

A small tree falls in the model.  Adam, across the
room, walks over and straightens it.

He looks at Barbara who is poring over the handbook.
Making notes.  Counting out procedures.

ADAM
Honey, I think that was a mistake.

BARBARA
I am not going to expose that
little girl to that... pervert
down there.

ADAM
How'd you do that?

BARBARA
(proud of herself)
Just a hunch... remember things
come in threes -- three times in,
three times out... I'm getting the
hang of this stuff.

ADAM
I think we really pissed him off.

BARBARA
I don't care...

ADAM
But we let him out.

BARBARA
I've changed my mind... I feel
really confident.  We're getting
better at this stuff.  We can
scare them off ourselves --
tonight!  I've got an idea.
You're going to love it... I'm
going to hate it.


ADAM

turns to look down at the model again.  Straightens the
tree.  Turns away.  We can see a tiny light moving
through the tiny model forest towards the house.

ADAM (V.O.)
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure
seemed mad.

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
(singing)
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I
go!


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Dinner for seven, as promised.  Everything looks very
nice.  Deetzes are in control and in their element.
The element is neurotic-chic.

Some of the guests are affecting distaste for having
had to make the long drive to Connecticut.  There's a
bitchy feud going on between GRACE, the ""Art In Amer-
ica"" writer, and BERNARD, Delia's agent, that threatens
to become a full-scale war.

Otho is drunkish and engaged in his third favorite
occupation -- direct attacks on the personal weaknesses
of his friends.  He's singled out his victim, BERYL,
the editor for Ballantine, a frail-looking woman who is
dressed ""artistically.""

OTHO
(to Beryl)
Well, darling, you can only have a
hysterectomy once, so why don't you
tell us what you really went into
the hospital for last week?  Or dare
I ask, is that a nose ""nouveau?""

CHARLES
(privately; to
Otho)
Otho, you've got to help me get
Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal
that could make all of us very
comfortable.

OTHO
He's a cloven-hooved beast!

CHARLES
He's your cousin.

OTHO
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look,
nothing short of giving away free
sacks of money would get him up
here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget
it.  You can't get her out of
Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
(still on Beryl's
case)
I just hope it wasn't yet another of
your dreary suicide attempts.  You
know what they say about people who
who commit suicide.  In the afterlife,
they become civil servants.

BERNARD
Otho!  I didn't know you were into
the supernatural?

OTHO
Of course you remember!  After my
stint with the living theatre.  I
was one of New York City's leading
paranormal researchers until the
bottom dropped out of the business
in '72.

BERYL
(sick to death of
this blowhard)
Paranormal... Is that what they're
calling your kind now?

Lydia watches Otho thoughtfully.  Suddenly very cur-
ious.

Delia senses that Lydia might talk ghosts here.

DELIA
(a threat; quietly
to Lydia)
Don't you dare.

LYDIA
I saw some ghosts.

All quiet.

DELIA
(interrupting)
Lydia tried to play a most
amusing joke on me this afternoon.

LYDIA
It wasn't a joke.

DELIA
Tried to convince me that this
house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids.
Kids!  I love them.

Otho's glance sharpens at this.  Everyone else listens.

GRACE
By ghosts?

LYDIA
By what else?

DELIA
(laughing it away)
In sheets yet.  Designer sheets.
They --

Charles, seeing things aren't going well for Delia,
proposes a toast.

CHARLES
I propose a toast to our intrepid
friends.  Who braved the
expressway and fourteen toll
booths to visit us.  May your
buildings go condo.

All lift their wineglasses.  All drink.  All synchro-
nously spit out their wine.  All together now...

EVERYONE
Yechhh!

Charles lifts the wine bottle from the cooler.  Disgust
spans the room.

ON bottle -- it bears the familiar spread wings of
Thunderbird!

BERYL
Thunderbird wine?  My God, Delia,
don't you even have a Safeway up
here?

DELIA
(horrified; but
recovering)
Joke Joke!  Charles get the good
wine and I'll serve the shrimp.
It's a joke.

Delia stares a spike through Lydia.  Delia and Charles
rush into the kitchen.  Otho looks at his glass and
peers at Lydia.


INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Delia rushes to get the sushi.  Charles finds some
good wine.

DELIA
(rapidly; furious)
Lydia switched wines.  Charles --
if you do not agree right now, to
boarding school, you can forget
having what you call sex -- ever
again in your natural lifetime.

He nods reluctantly.  She rushes back to guests.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia is looking around curiously.  Delia and Charles
rush back in with sushi and good wine.  Delia pours for
Bernard, the obvious connoisseur.  He tastes the wine.
All wait.  Is it Kerosene du Pape?  He smiles.  All
smile.

Otho is more interested in Lydia's story.  He leans
toward her...

OTHO
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your
ghosts.

DELIA
No!  Do not encourage this
little... person.

OTHO
Oh, Delia, lighten up!

DELIA
She's been without therapy up here
and I will not allow her to
ruin...

But then:


DELIA

Something comes over her -- she straightens, then
crouches a little, her hand sweeps across in front of
her, almost mechanically.  And then our Delia Deetz,
unable to help herself, leaves the whitebread world
behind and possessed, sings in someone else's voice, a
rich, NEGRO TENOR.

DELIA
""If I didn't care, More than
words could say.""

Lydia's eyes widen.  MUSIC UP.  All the guests are
spellbound.

Charles, too, has the beat -- The Ink Spots in his eyes.
In a voice not his own.

CHARLES
""If my every prayer, did not
begin and end with just your
name.""

Delia is shocked.  She looks at Lydia.

DELIA
For God's sake, stop me...

She is cut short by her powerful inspiration.

DELIA
""I could not be true to you
beyond compare.""


ALL THE GUESTS

except Lydia, are possessed to become the chorus.  They
stand by their chairs, they spin in perfect Motown
choreography.

EVERYONE
(except Lydia)
""Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop.""

DELIA
""If I didn't care... for you...""

EVERYONE
""Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop.""

A look of sheer delight comes across Lydia's face,
unlike anything we have previously seen.  She dances
and claps her hands in time with the music.  She is in
teen heaven.

NOTE:  Delia and the guests are fully aware of their
singing/actions, but helpless to stop themselves.  While
it is funny, it is nevertheless just a little frighten-
ing.

Lydia excitedly looks around the room to see if she can
see the ghosts.  She can't.

Now the song pauses... Everyone tries to recover for a
shocked second.  Instead, the tempo changes.

As the tempo quickens, the guest/chorus is syncopated
like alternating pistons as they are pushed and pulled
into their chairs.  They sing throughout.


THE SONG

crashes to its end.  Bernard looks down at his shrimp
cocktail.  The shrimp draped over the rice roll
suddenly rears up like a hand and, making a tiny fist,
grabs his dangling tie and... smash --

WIDER -- All the guests are punched by the shrimp, back
over their chairs to the ground.  They are stunned.
Suddenly everyone runs frightened into the next room.


EXT./INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

Adam and Barbara with huge smiles on their faces, dance
the bugaloo then hug and kiss on the landing in front
of the attic.  Door is open.

TOGETHER
We did it!

ADAM
Let's watch 'em scatter.

They enter the attic and run to the window.  Look out
over the front yard.


YARD OF HOUSE - THEIR POV - NIGHT

filled with the cars of the guests, as well as Delia
and Charles' vehicles.

ADAM (O.S.)
Any minute now.  They'll all run
screaming.


BACK TO SCENE

They wait.  Nothing moving outside.

BARBARA
Your Ink Spots were wonderful!

Adam smiles proudly.

ADAM
And your shrimp was remarkable.

BARBARA
My shrimp?  I did the wine.
Didn't you do the sushi?

ADAM
N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Who did the?

Timid KNOCK at the door of the attic.

Barbara glances at Adam.  They don't know what to do.

LYDIA
(from outside the
door)
It's me.  Lydia.

Adam, puzzled, goes to the door and opens it.  Lydia is
standing there, sheepish.

LYDIA
(continuing)
They'd like for you to come
downstairs.  Delia says you can
pick any sheets you want.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The guests are sitting expectantly.  The photographs
are being passed around.  The wheels are turning in
Charles' mind --  he sees a gold mine.  Everyone speaks
at once.

DELIA
It does indicate a marvelously
urbane sense of humor on the part
of these ghosts -- that they
actually appear in sheets!

OTHO
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn
here, a very sophisticated pair.  We
must protect them, treat them with
respect.  Nurture them.

CHARLES
People will pay big money for
this.  Right, Grace?

GRACE
(nodding)
Charles, I want to know why you
didn't tell me about this --

DELIA
(now changing her
tune)
We were waiting for proof.
Lydia's photographs...

Charles is scheming.

BERNARD
(skeptical)
What are you all talking about?
We... we just got a little drunk,
that's all.

OTHO
No matter how drunk you get, you
cannot sound like the Ink Spots.
(to Charles)
Charles, this is it!  You can get
Maxie Dean up here now.

Charles plots and plans.

OTHO
His wife Sarah loves the
supernatural.  I did a reading for
her just last week.  Told her her
jowls would tighten soon.  I mean
she will make him sprint up here in
his helicopter if you can produce
ghosts for her.

BERYL
The ""Enquirer"" has offered fifty
thousand dollars for absolute
proof of life after death.  I'll
send them over.

BERNARD
I'm Delia's agent!  I've lost
money for years on her work.  If
anything actually happened here,
I'll handle it, thank you.  But
not until I see some real proof.

Lydia appears at the base of the stairs.  Everyone
stops squabbling, looks at her expectantly.

LYDIA
They don't want to come down.

OTHO
Why not?

Bernard shakes his head as if all this were an elaborate
hoax.  He harumphs!

LYDIA
I think the reason is they were
trying to scare you, and you
didn't get scared --

DELIA
Of course we weren't scared.
(looking around)
Just a little startled.  One of
those shrimp dropped down my
Kamali.

Bernard is now convinced this whole business was a put-
on.

BERNARD
(shaking his head)
Total collective hallucination.

BERYL
I was a little tipsie.

DELIA
This was not a hallucination,
people.  This was real, really
totally real.

GRACE
Of course, they were rather
spectacular effects -- for
Connecticut, I mean.

OTHO
All presences have a home space.  A
place where they live, so to speak.
Where do they hide out?

LYDIA
(reluctantly)
The attic.

CHARLES
The attic room is locked --

LYDIA
They're ghosts.  They do what they
want.

OTHO
Fabulous!  Otho Fenlock's ""Locked
Door"" ghosts!  Probably committed
suicide up there -- hanging like
beeves from the rafters.  I'm
totally enchanted.

Bernard gathers Grace and Beryl and walks out the door.

BERNARD
Delia, you are a flake.  You have
always been a flake.  I'm packing
up and going back to the tricks of
the city.  That I can manage.  If
you must frighten people, do it
with your sculpture.

They exit.  Delia is horrified and embarrassed.

DELIA
Wait!  I'm going to get to the
bottom of this!  Lydia, is this
some high-tech trick of yours?  I
want you to take us up there tout
sweet!


INT. LANDING OUTSIDE OF ATTIC

Delia, Charles, Otho and Lydia -- creep, creep.

DELIA
(whispering)
Shhh.  They're in there?  God,
they live like animals.  This is
where they've been hiding out?

Lydia nods.  Delia suddenly, brashly pounds on the
door.

DELIA
(shouting)
All right, you dead people!  Come
on out, or we'll break down this
door and drag you out on the ropes
you hanged yourself with!

LYDIA
Shhhh.  They didn't commit
suicide.

DELIA
It doesn't matter.
What matters is I've got a roomful
of guests down there, who think
I'm a fraud.
(to Lydia)
I am going to teach you something
here Lydia.  You've got to take
the right tone in things like
this, or people -- whether they're
dead or alive -- people will walk
all over you.
(loud)
Come on out, or I will make death
so miserable that you will wish
you had never lived!

Delia pounds on door, which opens with an eerie CREAK.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia is pushed in first.  She looks around.  Delia,
Charles and Otho come in next, carefully.  One by one
they straighten up and look around.

DELIA
(whisper)
So where are they, Lydia?

Lydia shrugs, looks around.

CHARLES
(off-handedly)
Answer your mother.

LYDIA
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts
are really nice people.  I think
we scared them off.  Let's just
leave them alone.  Okay?

Charles is suddenly transfixed.  He stares at the
model.

CHARLES
It's the whole damn town.

They gather around.  Lydia is a little sad as she looks
at the empty room and the model.

OTHO
Look at that detail!

DELIA
Look at the tiny figures.

CHARLES
Look at all that parking!

LYDIA
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.

OTHO
They're not here, Lydia?

She shakes her head.  Otho spots the handbook.  Palms
it.

DELIA
I have never been so
embarrassed... They haven't gone
for good, have they?

Delia is suddenly out the door, urging them all outside.

DELIA
(continuing)
Everyone out of there.  If they're
in there somewhere, I don't want
to scare them away.  Come on now,
stay out of there.  We've got work
to do.

Otho pockets the handbook secretly as everyone exits.
Delia carefully closes the door.


CAMERA EASES OVER TO THE WINDOW

We see two pairs of hands, white-knuckled, gripping the
window sill from the outside.


EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Barbara and Adam are hanging outside the window.
CAMERA EASES BACK to see that instead of hanging from
the house --

They are hanging from a ledge over The Inferno --


ON INFERNO

circles of rosy hell.  Several devilish Monsters slaver
up at them, hoping for new meat for the furnace.  Small
geysers spurt foul gasses.


WINDS

BLOW hard on Adam and Barbara.  They struggle to hold
on and pull themselves back up and into the window.

ADAM
Juno, help!  Juno!

After nearly falling, Adam barely saves Barbara and
they finally make it up, and disappear into the window.


INT. ATTIC LANDING - NIGHT

Delia, Charles and Otho all start down the stairs, one
by one.  All are holding the handrail.

DELIA
Lydia, I will never forgive you
for embarrassing me in front of my
social inferiors.  You help us
with these ghosts or you'll be
sorry.

LYDIA
I'm sorry already.

CHARLES
(fixing on Otho)
Now, let's get back to business.  I
I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah
up here immediately.  I can make
history here!  I'm going to turn
this sleepy little backward town
into a leading supernatural
research center... and amusement
park.

LYDIA
(disgusted)
I cannot believe this.

CHARLES
Delia will cook...

Delia glares at him.

CHARLES
(continuing)
I'll bring the wine... and the
business plan.  And Lydia --
you'll bring the ghosts.

LYDIA
(frustrated)
I can't bring the ghosts.  They're
not here!

CHARLES
... Otho, could you actually... do
something with them?

OTHO
(pats the handbook
under his coat)
Perhaps... if I were properly
motivated...

LYDIA
That's slavery and murder.  You
don't know them.  They're nice
people!

POV -- down the handrail, as they walk downstairs.
Lydia lags behind, sullen.


LOWER END OF THE HANDRAIL

lifts, and turns.  The handrail has become a long, fat,
diamond-backed snake -- unlike any we have ever seen.
It flashes terrifying steel teeth and a red-feathered
comb.  It turns and HISSES at them.


ON DELIA

She screams as she looks down at her hand on the rail
-- it grips the scaly, throbbing, dripping body of the
snake.


THE SNAKE

just gets longer and nastier as it turns back in the
air, up the stairs toward them.  Its tail circles Delia
and spins her like a top.  When she stops -- the snake
gives her a big wet snake kiss.


SNAKE

snaps Otho in the behind.  It hurts.


THE SNAKE

rears up and spreads a red-comb and HISSES loudly.


ALL THREE

of them fall over each other trying to escape.


THE SNAKE

hovers horribly over them.  Grabs Charles in its coils
and squeezes him hard -- his fearful face reddens, then
it suspends Charles over the edge of the stairs.

SNAKE
We've come for your daughter,
Chuck!


HE

leers at Lydia and drops Charles like a rock over the
bannister.  Charles screams.


THE SNAKE

Grins at a terrified Lydia.


SNAKE

rears back for a strike, when suddenly, like thunder.
One word is heard.

BARBARA
Betelgeuse!  Betelgeuse!
Betelgeuse!


THE SNAKE

looks up with familiar eyes.  At top of stairs stands
an angry Barbara.

What happens next is almost too fast for the eye to
see.


THE SNAKE

shrinks and turns back into the regular mahogany hand-
rail.


BETELGEUSE

or his outline, whips up the stairs, through the door,
and is gone like a rocket.

BETELGEUSE
RRRatt shit!


OTHO AND DELIA

rush downstairs -- Lydia is terrified.  She runs away.

LYDIA
I hate you!  I thought you were my
friends.

BARBARA
No, wait!

Lydia screams and runs down the stairs.

LYDIA
(screams)
I hate all of you!

Slowly, Barbara returns to the attic.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Adam and Barbara are exhausted.  Agitated.

ADAM
Great choice we've got here.  We
get to spend the next century
either hanging out that window or
doing parlor tricks.

Adam is working with the model town.  Barbara is pac-
ing.

ADAM
Maybe they'll leave now.  That
snake was a pretty nasty customer.

BARBARA
He might have hurt somebody.

ADAM
But he didn't.  We've got him
where we want him.


ON THE MODEL

A column of water shoots high in the air.

Adam rushes over to the model -- looks down.


INT. MODEL - DAY

Betelgeuse has run a beat-up old pickup into a fire
hydrant.  He stands nearby, hopping mad; shakes his
fist at Adam.

BETELGEUSE
You pansy-assed cretins!  How dare
you do that to me.  I coulda
finished the job!


IN THE ATTIC

Barbara and Adam, obviously disturbed, look at one
another with concern.

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
(thin and pip-
ing voice)
Why did you stop me?

BARBARA
I don't like Charles Deetz
particularly, but you could have
killed him.

BETELGEUSE
Hey, I've been bottled up for six
hundred years.  Every dog has his
day.  This is my town.  I need a
night to howl.

ADAM
This is my town.

BETELGEUSE
You wish!  I nearly scored with
that little blonde.  I need me a
short little queen.


ANGLE

Angry, Barbara reaches down into the model and plucks
Betelgeuse up.

Barbara lifts him up toward her, squeezing him
slightly.

BARBARA
You leave her alone, you horrid
little prick!


CLOSEUP - BETELGEUSE IN BARBARA'S HAND

Betelgeuse grins.  Suddenly large spikes shoot out all
over his body, piercing the skin of Barbara's palm and
fingers.  Barbara's blood is a rich pink.

She squeals and releases the evil spirit and he plum-
mets.


EXT. MODEL - DAY

Betelgeuse lands on the town common.  Betelgeuse is
defiant.

BETELGEUSE
Go ahead.  Make my millenium!


ANGLE

We hear the tinny strains of ""Honky Tonk Angel"" as if
from down the street.  He turns around to follow it.

BETELGEUSE
This burg got a cathouse?  I'm
getting anxious if you know what I
mean.  Six hundred years and all.

He turns the corner to a whorehouse, with women --
women with demon horns -- hanging out of the window,
beckoning.  Betelgeuse rubs his hands together and
swaggers inside.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara aghast, watching this from above.

BARBARA
Adam!  Why did you build a whore
house?  Have you ever been to...?

ADAM
I didn't --


ANGLE

He doesn't finish -- a strong WIND blows through the
attic, nearly knocking Barbara and Adam over.  They
close their eyes against the gale.

When they open their eyes again, they're no longer in
the attic.  They're in --


INT. JUNO'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

A cubicle in a much larger office.  Miss Argentina
swishes by.

RECEPTIONIST
God, you have got her steaming
now.

She exits.  There are other special workers.  The place
is really, really busy.  Adam and Barbara sit down to
wait.  Juno storms through with a sheaf of papers.  She
sees them.  She is steaming mad.

JUNO
The whorehouse was my idea.  I
want Betelgeuse out of the
picture!  We've got some serious
talking to do.

BARBARA
About what?

JUNO
You people have really screwed
up!  I received word that you
allowed yourselves to be
photographed.  And you let
Betelgeuse out and didn't put him
back, and you let Otho get ahold
of the handbook.

ADAM
Handbook?  When...?

JUNO
(continuing tirade)
Never trust the living!  We cannot
have a routine haunting like yours
provide incontrovertible visual
proof of existence beyond death.

ADAM
Well, we didn't know --


A BUNCH OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS

follow Juno like hungry dogs.

DUMB #1
Hey, Coach, where's the men's
room?

JUNO
(frustrated)
I'm not your coach.  He survived.

DUMB #2
You don't need a men's room.
You're not no man no more.  But
Coach, let me get this -- What's
our curfew over here?

They start squabbling.  Juno has to wrangle them into
another room.

JUNO
(frustrated)
I'll be right back.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Charles sits at the table with a small bandage on his
head.  Delia takes off her Gucci belt and whips it on a
chair absent-mindedly.

DELIA
I feel like we've been at war,
Charles.

CHARLES
At least insofar as we have our
first casualty.  Me.

DELIA
Otho'll know what to do.

CHARLES
What's he going to do?  Viciously
rearrange their environment?

DELIA
Otho knows just as much about the
supernatural as he knows about
interior design.

CHARLES
Let's hope he knows how to produce
those damn ghosts for Max and
Sarah... Because I've bought
options on property all over town.
I need Max's financing...

DELIA
Just don't tell Lydia.

CHARLES
Why not?

DELIA
I think she's in with them.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. LYDIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

It's dark.  The bedroom curtains have been closed.
DRAMATIC OPERA MUSIC builds throughout.

Lydia melodramatically dressed in a long black dress
appears carrying a candle.  She is softly crying.

She sits at her dressing table, the candlelight shows
her writing paper.  She begins a very dramatic letter.

LYDIA
I am alone.

She looks at it and crumpling the paper, starts again.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I am utterly... alone.  You have
sealed my fate with your betrayal.
I can no longer stand to be used
like a puppet between two
deceitful worlds.  By the time you
read this, I will be gone, having
jumped off...

She scratches that out.

LYDIA
(continuing)
... having plummeted off the
Winter River Bridge.  Then you
will know that I am no longer a
toy in your petty feuds.  Goodbye,
Lydia.

A tear falls on the paper as she folds it and puts it
in an envelope.  OPERA MUSIC BUILDS AND CONTINUES.


INT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY

Lydia slowly makes a copy of the suicide note.  The
green of the Xerox light falls eerily on her sad face.


INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Lydia at bottom of attic stairs.


LYDIA'S POV - STAIRS AND DOOR AT TOP

They look ominous.  She starts upward.


INT. ATTIC ROOM - DAY

The door opens and Lydia peers in.

The room is empty.  Lydia comes inside.

LYDIA
Are you here?

She hears SOMETHING.  Looks all around the room.
Nothing.

LYDIA
(continuing)
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come
for the last time?
(laying note on
table)
Where are you?  Barb...

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
They're dead.

Lydia looks around, then peers into model.

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
(continuing)
Think small.  I'm talking to you.


EXT. MODEL TOWN - BUILDING ROOF - DAY

A tiny Betelgeuse on the roof of a building, wearing a
silk dressing gown, looking like he just dragged him-
self out of bed.  One of the horned whores is nude,
sunbathing in the corner, and Betelgeuse drapes a
blanket over her.  Lydia's face looms enormous in the
sky.

BETELGEUSE
Cookie, they are dead, dead,
deadski.

LYDIA
Of course they're dead.  They're
ghosts.

BETELGEUSE
No, I mean they've gone.
Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.

LYDIA
Where'd they go?

BETELGEUSE
The happy hunting ground.  Who
cares?

LYDIA
Are you a spirit too?

BETELGEUSE
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh.
Listen, cookie, I've been trapped
in this burg for hundreds of
years.  All I want is to get out.

LYDIA
I want to get in.

BETELGEUSE
You do?  Over here?  On my side?

LYDIA
I think so.

BETELGEUSE
(scheming quickly)
Well, yes, of course.  It's great
over here.  You'll meet all the
greats.  James Dean.  Sid
Vicious...

LYDIA
Well, it can't be any worse than
my life here.

BETELGEUSE
(sinister, encouraging
her)
That's right.  They treat you like
scum, I bet?

LYDIA
Yeah.

BETELGEUSE
I can't help you from this side,
but here's how we do it.  So
simple.  Say my name three
times.  That's all.  I'll be all
yours.  Then I'll bring you over
here in style.

LYDIA
I... I don't know what your name is.

BETELGEUSE
Minor problem.  The rules.  I
can't tell it to you.  But.. do
you know how to play charades?

LYDIA
Yes.

BETELGEUSE
Of course you do.

He holds up two fingers in a V.

LYDIA
Two words.

Betelgeuse holds up one finger.

LYDIA
(continuing)
First word.

Betelgeuse puts two fingers on his arm.

LYDIA
(continuing)
Three syllables.

BETELGEUSE
No, dummy.  Two.

LYDIA
Your fingers are so small I can't
see them.  First word -- two
syllables.

He points behind her.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I don't know what that signal
means.

BETELGEUSE
It means look behind you, bimbo.


ANGLE

Lydia looks behind her.  A greet beetle the size of a
Volkswagen is crouching.  Its feathery antennae reach
out toward her menacingly.  Lydia yelps.

LYDIA
Beetle!

BETELGEUSE
Good girrrl!

POP!  The beetle disappears.  Betelgeuse holds up two
fingers.

LYDIA
(still shaken)
Second word.  Be careful.


ANGLE

Apprehensive, she jumps when a simple carton of orange
juice materializes.  Orange juice pours out into a
ghostly glass.

LYDIA
Breakfast?  Orange?

The orange juice disappears.  He shakes his head.

LYDIA
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle
fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit Battle?
Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?

BETELGEUSE
Good thing you are a beautiful
kid.  You are dumb!

Betelgeuse does the signal for ""Now Put Them Together.""

LYDIA
I am not!  Beetle... Juice?

BETELGEUSE
(jumping with delight)
That's it!

LYDIA
Your name is Beetle Juice?  Yecch!
That's as bad as Deeelia Deeetz.

BETELGEUSE
It's spelled different, but
basically... Now you said it
twice, just one more time.  And
I'll be free.
(sinister)
And then you'll be free.

Lydia, puzzled, gets the magnifying glass and peers at
him.


ON HIS UGLY FACE BIG IN THE GLASS

Betelgeuse jumps in the air, his robe parts -- we don't
see anything, but maybe Lydia does.

LYDIA
God, you're anatomically correct!

BETELGEUSE
Just say it.

LYDIA
(recognizing something
about him)
You were the snake!  Right?  I
know.  It was you.

BETELGEUSE
You've got to say it!

LYDIA
No I don't.  I don't take orders
from Smurfs.

BETELGEUSE
How'd you like to be married to...
the King...?

Lydia doesn't get it.

BETELGEUSE
(continuing)
... Elvis?...
(boasting)
You know, ever since he came over
he and I have been just like this.
(crosses his fingers)
I can arrange it.  Just say my
name one more time.

She thinks about that one.  Shakes her head.

LYDIA
No, No... I need to talk to
Barbara.

Betelgeuse smiles.

BETELGEUSE
Well, cookie, just say my name.  I
can get her.
(rubbing his horny little
hands together)
That and so much more...

Lydia walks around thinking for a moment.

LYDIA
Who else did you say is over
there?


INT. JUNO'S OFFICE - DAY

Juno staring at them, hard.

JUNO
Yes... or no?  Do you want the
Deetzes out or in?

ADAM
Out.

BARBARA
What about Betelgeuse?

JUNO
Forget him.  He'll remain with his
whores until someone calls him.
You need to worry about people like
Otho.  There are a lot of
phony trance mediums.  They
usually can't make the formulas
work, but if Otho stumbles on the
right words in that handbook... he
could hurt you.  As in --
exorcism.

They both look puzzled.

JUNO
(continuing)
In plain English -- that's death
for the dead.  I don't care what
it takes, just get them out of
there now.  It's not pretty, but
-- that's death!

Adam stands to go.

JUNO
(continuing)
Wait a minute.  Let's see what
you're going to do...

They look at Juno.

JUNO
(continuing)
... to scare her.  I want to make
sure it's not some silly parlor
trick.

Barbara looks at Adam.

ADAM
I'll do the hard part, hon.


ADAM

reluctantly pulls on his face, and contorts it into a
living, breathing, horror.  Juno is even a little
repulsed.

JUNO
Not bad.  Not bad.  Now you?  Go
ahead.


ANGLE

She reluctantly does with her face a minor version of
Adam's horror.

JUNO
(continuing)
Okay.  You look great!  Now go
clean house.  And don't forget the
photographs and the damned
handbook.


ANGLE

Barbara and Adam slowly stand and walk out the door.
Barbara/Monster looks back pleadingly.  Football
players flood into Juno's office.  One PARTICULARLY
DUMB PLAYER has a revelation.  (He's pretty grisly,
maybe sat too close to the engine.)

PARTICULARLY DUMB PLAYER
Coach!  Coach, I don't think we
survived the crash!

Barbara and Adam look at each other and continue out the
door.


OUTSIDE JUNO'S OFFICE

They enter a long dark hallway.  They suddenly find
themselves standing in front of Lydia's room.  Adam/
Monster looks at Barbara/Monster as he grabs the door-
knob.  She stops him.  Tears fall down her sad ghostly
face.

BARBARA
Adam.  I can't do it.  I like that
little girl.

ADAM/MONSTER
It's too late.  Sometimes things
just work out this way.  We have
to, honey.

BARBARA/MONSTER
No we don't.  We can rebel or
something.  We'll just stay up
there in our room.  I'll read, you
can build on the model.  Come on.

She rushes up the stairs, toward the attic.  He follows
her.

ADAM/MONSTER
Wait.  We can't, honey.  Our
house...

She gets to the door.  Grabs the handle.

BARBARA
I want to be with Lydia!

She throws open the door.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia is standing over the model, about to say
Betelgeuse's name.

LYDIA
Okay.  Beetle... J...

Barbara/Monster, horrified, screams!

BARBARA/MONSTER
!  Lydia, stop!

Adam/Monster runs to grab her.  Lydia is terrified.
Screams.

ADAM/MONSTER
No, don't say it!

BETELGEUSE
Say it!  Rat shit!

Betelgeuse slips off the roof into a patch of thorny
bushes.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Lydia screams, Adam/Monster tries to calm her.  Lydia
struggles and, thinking she is being attacked, runs out
the door.  Smack into Barbara/Monster.

Barbara catches her, frightens Lydia even more.
Barbara holds onto her as she struggles.  Barbara/
Monster slowly changes back into regular Barbara.
Lydia sees who it is and she hugs her.  Like mother and
daughter.

ON ADAM - slowly returning to himself.  He smiles
slightly at the scene.

BETELGEUSE (O.S.)
You lily-livered bleeding hearts!

BARBARA
I'm so sorry we frightened you.
What were you doing?

LYDIA
He... Beetle Jui...

Barbara quickly puts her hand over her mouth.

LYDIA
(continuing)
He said if I let him out he would
take me over to the other side to
find you.

BARBARA
No, Lydia, we're dead.

LYDIA
I want to be dead, too.

BARBARA
(shocked)
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?

LYDIA
(after a pause,
dramatically
but for real)
Life is just... unliveable...

Barbara hugs her.  She fumbles for words.  This is an
unusual situation, a dead person talking a live person
out of killing herself.  She rocks Lydia a little.
Barbara looks at Adam.

BARBARA
Lydia, believe me... we know...
all the hard stuff is the same
over here.  You're going to be who
you are... whether you're alive or
dead... and over here -- it's...
It's flat... there's no food, no
colors... you can't smell the
flowers.
(thinking)
If we knew then what we know
now... we'd have been more
careful...

ADAM
(in the style of the
dead receptionist)
... we wouldn't have had our
little accident.

Lydia looks at Barbara lovingly.

BARBARA
So never let Beetlejuice out --
never.  Besides...
(looking at Adam)
We're thinking about letting
everyone stay... you and your
father and mother can stay too.

LYDIA
(smiles and says
slowly)
Step... mother.


ADAM/MONSTER

is not sure, huffs around a little.  He is trying to
change back into Adam, except for his nose, which
remains like a beak for a minute.  Finally, it changes
too.

Lydia and Barbara laugh at him.


ANGLE

Without noticing Lydia, Otho and Charles push in
through the door and grab the model.  They take it out
the door.

Adam is beside himself.  Doesn't know what to do.

Barbara stops him from taking action.

ADAM
What is going on?

LYDIA
Really.  I don't know.

Adam looks suspiciously at her.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I really don't.  I'll go find out.

She runs out the door.

BARBARA
Be careful.


INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lydia runs through the hallway and into the dining
room.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia walks into a presentation in progress.  Sitting
around the table are Otho, Maxie, and Delia.  Sarah Dean
is there, too.  She looks around Lydia hoping for
ghosts.  Sarah is heavily made up, smells bad.

Lydia's photos of the sheeted ghosts are blown up and
standing on a nearby easel.  Charles, over the model
with a pointer, is lost in mid-sentence.

CHARLES
-- In short, I've got options to
buy enough of Main Street to
control the city council for a
hundred years.  And at the prices
I'm talking about, if it all fell
apart tomorrow, we just move out and
sell to the Arabs and we still come
out... I've talked to Ed Cornwall
about a wax museum, here... in
Thanksgiving Park... Ed's the man
who made the talking Jesse Jackson
statue.
And I've got a museum dedicated to
50 Great Moments in the Paranormal
-- and parenthetically, D-Con wants
to the right to start an insect zoo
here in the old hardware store.
(seeing Lydia)
Lydia, did you finally decide to
join us?

They all give her an oily smile.

CHARLES
Honey, I am just finishing the first
phase presentation about our little
project here.  Then we'll take a
stretch and invite our friends... to meet
your friends.

Sarah gets Maxie's attention and unable to contain her
excitement, silently urges him to get on with the
ghosts.

SARAH
Are they here yet?

MAXIE
Yes, Charles, let's cut the
bullcorn.  We're here to see
ghosts.  This whole ghost town
museum and such like follows a
train, if you've got the engine...
so let's see your goddamned engine.

Everyone looks at Lydia.

LYDIA
They're... not here anymore.

CHARLES
(smiling apologetically)
Nonsense, every time she says
that, the paint peels, and some
wild creature tries to kill us.

SARAH
(motioning)
We've got these pictures, Lydia.

LYDIA
No, really... they said they might
come back and all of us could live
in peace if you agreed not to
tease them or make them do silly
tricks.

Sarah is disappointed.  She goes to Maxie.  Delia takes
over.

DELIA
She's become a little emotional
about all this.  No counseling up
here.  But we aren't relying on
her.  No, we rely on
professionals.  We have... Otho.

The whole room turns to Otho.  Who is scribbling some-
thing and mumbling.

CHARLES
Are they still here, Otho?

Otho looks up; he missed the question.

DELIA
Are they still here, Otho?

OTHO
Oh, they're still here.  They're
just not showing up.

CHARLES
They're probably guilty about what
they did to me.

DELIA
Not these people!  They are
ruthless!

MAXIE
I don't care from guilt.  I just
want to see them.

CHARLES
Otho, can you do it?

OTHO
It's tricky, but I think I can
handle it.

He dramatically produces the handbook.

LYDIA
No!

Lydia begins to think about this scene and she shifts
to another point of view.

LYDIA
Wait a minute!  What am I worried
about?  Otho, you can't even
change a tire!

OTHO
(taking the challenge)
I'll need something personal of
theirs.

LYDIA
You'll have to go to the Goodwill.

Delia gets an idea.


EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

The moon stares down icily through gray clouds.  Wind
up.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Barbara is looking out the window.

BARBARA
(wistful)
You know, I've been thinking.  I
could teach Lydia to sew.

ADAM
Little black party dresses?

BARBARA
(punching him playfully)
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything
about little girls.  She's just...
missed out on some love, that's
all...

ADAM
(huffy)
Let's see if she can get my model
back.

BARBARA
You can build another one... with
her.

Adam isn't convinced.  Barbara motions him to sit next
to her.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Come here, I want to talk to you.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Delia carefully brings out a big plastic bag.  Lays
something out on the dining room table.

DELIA
I'm deeply sentimental about...
weddings.

Lydia stands to see:  Delia carefully lays out
Barbara's white wedding dress.  Then next to it, Adam's
wedding tux.

Lydia looks at it.  A chill runs through her.

LYDIA
(hushed realization)
Their wedding clothes.

OTHO
(dramatically)
Their wedding clothes.

Otho then holds up the handbook.

SARAH
The ""words"".

Otho nods.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia is nervous now.  Otho lights a candle and Delia
turns out the lights.

OTHO
Hands vermillion / start of five
bright cotillion / raven's dive
nightshades promise / spirit's strive,
to the living / let now the dead...
come alive.

Nothing happens.  Lydia nervously turns away.

LYDIA
(sarcastically)
Doo wah.


ANGLE

Then a SIZZLE, a TINY CRACKLE, along one side of the
square.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Barbara with her arm on his shoulder, talks to Adam.

BARBARA
We've been given a gift here,
honey.  A real live little girl.
She likes us a lot.  She needs
us.  Maybe that's why we died so
young, to keep us from getting
so... attached to things.  The
house, antiques, your model.  Look
at us.  We didn't have room for
anyone.

ADAM
(after a long thought)
What makes you think she likes me?

Barbara slowly smiles.  He does too.

He turns to Barbara.  CAMERA HINGES WITH him to see --


ON BARBARA

Her face is frightened.  She cannot speak.  She reaches
out to him -- but is disappearing.  He reaches for her
but she is suddenly -- GONE.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Varicolored lightning bolts shoot from every corner of
the square.  A gasp from everyone but Lydia.


ON LYDIA -- she is looking away.  She turns to see:


ON THE DRESS

Barbara's wedding dress floats over the table and fills
slowly, painfully, with the arms, legs and finally the
frightened face of Barbara.  A lightning bolt flares.

Lydia rises slowly to her feet, unable to resist.

More lightning bolts.

OTHO
As sudden thunder / Pierces the night;
As magic wonder / Mad affright
Rives asunder / Man's delight:
Our ghost, our corpse and we
Rise to be.

Lydia walks slowly toward Barbara.


ON BARBARA

She is in pain, she is very slowly aging.  She speaks,
but no words can be heard.  Not even by Lydia.  But we
can see she is calling for... Adam.

LYDIA
Stop it!

MAXIE
Shhhh!

Lydia screams for Adam.

LYDIA
Adam.  Adam.

OTHO
(louder)
As flies the lizard / Serpent fell;
As goblin vizard, / At the spell
Of pale wizard, / Sinks to hell;
The buried, dead, and slain...
Rise again.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

In a lightning flare we see: Adam searching for
Barbara.  He rushes out into the hallway.

ADAM
Barbara!  Barbara?  Ba...

His last plaintive call becomes mute as he too begins
slowly to disappear.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

On each of the watchers one by one, scared but
delighted too.  No one is watching Lydia.

ON LYDIA -- tears well up in her eyes.


ON BARBARA

She is slowly aging.  Now a bewildered Adam appears,
floating in his wedding suit.  Seeing his Barbara, now
older than he is, Adam reaches for her hand...

ON HANDS -- as he grasps her hand, it seems to be made
of white crepe; it wrinkles and nearly collapses.

Adam... puzzled, calls her name silently.

DELIA
What's happening to them?

OTHO
I don't know.

CHARLES
Are they suffering?

LYDIA
(screams)
They're dying.

MAXIE
They're already dead.  They can't
feel a thing.

Obviously not true.

ON BARBARA -- she looks down slowly at Lydia and with
effort makes a loving smile.  She reaches out toward
Lydia.

Completely helpless now, Lydia weeps openly and then
something comes over her.  She rushes across the room.
Stares down at the model.

LYDIA
Where are you?  Help us!  Please.
Betelgeuse!

A CRACK OF LIGHTNING.


EXT. MODEL TOWN GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Someone, or something, like the figure of death in the
Goya drawing, is perched atop the gravestone of Barbara
and Adam Maitland.  The graves beneath him are open.
The figure turns... it is Betelgeuse.  He is filing his
talons casually.

He speaks with a ghastly rasp.

BETELGEUSE
So... You're ready for me now?

LYDIA
You've got to help them.

BETELGEUSE
Can you help me?

LYDIA
(frightened)
... I will.

BETELGEUSE
Then I'll help them.  For a price.

He grins.

LYDIA
W... What is it?

BETELGEUSE
(his words echo
horribly
Be... my... queen!

LYDIA
(repulsed)
Your qu...?  But you're...

BETELGEUSE
(smiling devilishly)
I'm beeyoo-teeful.


ON LYDIA

She is chilled.  Steps back.
She turns back to the Maitlands who are continuing to
age.  Looks back to the model.

LYDIA
... All right... Betelgeuse...


ON BETELGEUSE

He doubles in size.  The tombstone crumbles beneath
him...

LYDIA (V.O.)
(louder)
Betelgeuse...


WIDER ON GRAVEYARD

He doubles in size again.


ON LYDIA

She hesitates.


ON BETELGEUSE - TIGHT

He looks up at her confidently.

LYDIA
Betelgeuse!


DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Barbara and Adam's corpses are nearly at the end of
their ropes.

CHARLES
All right, that's enough.  Can you
stop this now?

Otho doesn't answer.

CHARLES
(continuing)
Otho?

OTHO
It's too late, Charles.  I'm
sorry.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia peers at the model.  Betelgeuse is transforming.
There's a LOW RUMBLE.  The model town starts to shake.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia backs away.  Betelgeuse's head, now human-size,
rises from the center of the model town.


TIGHT ON HIS FACE

His grin is malevolent and malicious.  It's showtime,
folks!

BETELGEUSE
Attention, K-Mart shoppers!


ON DEETZES

-- who have been focused on the Maitlands now turning
around to the model.


ON MODEL

Betelgeuse begins a bright but sinister Carnival
Barker's pitch.  His shoulders now are clearing the
model.

BETELGEUSE
Welcome to Winter River!


ANGLE

Sarah rushes over to the model, thinking this is more
of the show.  Maxie follows.

BETELGEUSE
Hel LO Piggies!  Welcome to Winter
River!  See the Museum of Natural
Greed.  The Monument to Bored
Businessmen!  Come closer!


ANGLE

Suddenly Betelgeuse's arms elongate, swell and CRACKLE.


ON MAXIE AND SARAH

Their eyes grow wide.


TIGHT ON BETELGEUSE'S HANDS

They split, unfurl, and transmutate into two, shiny,
huge sledgehammers.


ON BETELGEUSE

He grins, his eyes sparkle in anticipation.  CARNEY
MUSIC UP.

BETELGEUSE
(roughly to the tune
of ""Santa Claus is
Coming to Town"")
You better not sell, you better
not buy...


ON MAXIE AND SARAH

Behind each of them, a graduated CARNIVAL BELL RINGING
GAME STANDARD erects itself.


ON BETELGEUSE

BETELGEUSE
(still singing)
Or old Uncle Beetle Claus will be
makin'... you... fly.

Betelgeuse swings his hammer/hands and sends Max and
Sarah zooming through the roof.  GONG.  GONG.


ANGLE

BETELGEUSE
(in style of game
show host)
Yowser, yowser.  Well, who do we
have here tonight?


ANGLE

He looks up at the suspended Maitlands.

BETELGEUSE
Let's have a hand for the
Maitlands, Barbara and Adam.  They
deserve a rest.


ON MAITLANDS

Wispy shadows by now, but still alive/dead.  They fall
in a heap on the floor.  NOTE:  They immediately start
to regenerate themselves.

BETELGEUSE
Well, we'll get back to them after
they recover from their flight.


ON ADAM

Filling out again, he struggles to stand, but falls.
Barbara shakes her head, trying to regain her focus.

BETELGEUSE
(looking around)
My God, what ugly wall dressing.
Who is responsible for all this
ugliness?
(spying Otho trying
to hide)
Otho, it's you!  Watch out for the
taste patrol!


ANGLE

He waves and the door opens.  A little Italian gentle-
man appears.

OTHO
No.  Noooo!  My God.  It's Giorgio
Armani!

GIORGIO
Before youa getta started herea, I
joost wanta to saya, Otho,
don'ta weara my stuff?  Okay?
Youa too fat for human-type
clothes.  Ita makes my designs
looka like aircraft covering!


ANGLE

Otho is horrified.  Suddenly he looks down and sees his
clothing has transformed into a polyester nightmare.
He runs out the door screaming.  Betelgeuese laughs
with delight then focuses on Lydia.

BETELGEUSE
Let's leave this crazy world
behind us.  I'll take you out in
style!

Sound of eerie WEDDING MARCH.  The fireplace changes
into an expressionist altar.


ANGLE

His leering horned whores walk like bridesmaids, in
step, through the door.  They rush toward Lydia.


ANGLE

Frightened, Lydia is assaulted and pulled forward by
these ugly handmaidens; she suddenly looks down and
sees she is now clothed in a blood-red wedding dress.
Lydia screams!!

BARBARA
No... No!

Adam's eyes widen.

LYDIA
(frightened, but
hurling the incan-
tation to make him
disappear)
No... Betelgeuse.  Bet...

Betelgeuse waves a hand and Lydia's mouth freezes.
Delia and Charles plead with the recovering Maitlands.

DELIA
(frantic)
Please, can't you do something!
Please!



ON BARBARA AND ADAM

Adam, not fully recovered, heroically tries to speak --
but his jaw falls off.  An exhausted Barbara tries to
help him reattach it.

Betelgeuse looks at Lydia.

BETELGEUSE
You know if we're going to get
married, we're going to need
witnesses!

Betelgeuse shifts his glare to Charles and Delia.
From Behind, Delia's horrid sculptures come to life
and attack Charles and Delia.  The sculptures twist
around them, forcing them to watch the hideous
spectacle.

Adam and Barbara are rapidly trying to recover as the
ceremony begins.


A DEATH-MASKED OLD PREACHER

slides down the fireplace, ready to perform the
service, speaks with a hissing death rattle.

PREACHER
Do you, Betel...

His mouth drops and is frozen.

BETELGEUSE
Uh-uh!  No one says the B word!

PREACHER
Do you, _____________, take this
woman to be your wedded wife?  To
honor...

BETELGEUSE
(interrupting)
You betcha!

Lydia screams and struggles.

PREACHER
And... you?  Do you, Lydia, take
this man?... er, uh... man... to
be your lawful wedded husband?...
In sickness...

Lydia struggles.  Her screams are muffled and distant.
Betelgeuse grabs her and shakes her.

BETELGEUSE
You don't have to answer him,
snookums.  I'll do it for you.
(eerily, speaking in
her voice)
I'm Lydia Deetz and I'm of sound
mind.  The man next to me is the
one I want.  You asked me... I'm
answering.  Yes.  How I love that
man of mine.

Adam, now fully regenerated, moves toward them.  He
shouts the incantation.

ADAM
Beetle...


ANGLE

Betelgeuse turns to him and with a sweep of his hand,
Adam's teeth (as if they were false), fly out of his
mouth and CLATTER to the floor.  Adam, toothless,
musters up his ghost powers and --

ON TEETH - TIGHT -- they rare back and continue
shouting...

TEETH
Beetleju...


ANGLE

Mayhem breaks out.  A furious Betelgeuse stomps at them
with his feet.  The teeth scuttle under the model.

BETELGEUSE
(angrily, to old man)
Now move it, pops!


ON ADAM

Speechless, Adam heroically charges toward Betelgeuse,
ready to strike him.  Betelgeuse spins on him and waves
his hand.  SOUND OF RUSHING WIND.


ON ADAM

He has been zapped into his model town.


ANGLE

Barbara screams and jumps at Betelgeuse.

BARBARA
Beetlegeuse...

Betelgeuse turns on her, eyes flashing.


ON BARBARA

A gag comes over her mouth.


ON MODEL

Adam is running around the streets trying to get out of
the model.  He looks up into the sky, sees a red glow
and THUNDERING WEDDING MUSIC.  He doesn't know what to
do.


ON BARBARA

She tears away her face (like tissue) and tries to say
his name again...

BARBARA
Betelgeuse...


ON BETELGEUSE

More angry, he waves his hand.


ON BARBARA

Her lips are zippered shut.


IN MODEL

Desperate, Adam gets an idea.  He runs over to the
truck Betelgeuse had crashed earlier, jumps in and
tries to start it.


ON BARBARA

She unzips her mouth and tries again.

BARBARA
Be


ON BETELGEUSE

Fire darts from his eyes....


ON BARBARA

A chromium steel plate is riveted across her mouth.
She screams wordlessly behind it.


IN MODEL

Adam finally gets the truck started.


BARBARA

Struggling with her mouth, frustrated to the breaking
point, she looks all around the room and rushes to the
window and CRASHES through into the night.


IN MODEL

Adam sees Barbara rush out.  He looks back at
Betelgeuse, floors the gas pedal and goes for one last
shot.


BETELGEUSE

BETELGEUSE
(angry)
Now, let's get rolling!

PREACHER
Then, by the authority vested in
me by...

A RUMBLE comes from outside.  Everyone notices but the
Preacher.  He stutters to finish the wedding.

BETELGEUSE
By me!  Get on with it!

LOUDER NOISE from outside.  Now nearly DEAFENING.

PREACHER
Yes... by him.  I now pronounce
you man and...


ANGLE

The truck is racing up to Betelgeuse's foot.  Adam
bails out just in time as the truck hits Betelgeuse's
foot and EXPLODES, giving him a distracting hot foot,
then --


ON WINDOW

Through it -- amidst a cloud of yellow dust -- CRASHES
the sand worm.  Barbara rides him bareback.  Barbara
struggles to control the ROARING worm.  She pulls on
his ears and looks around for Beetle Juice.  Seeing
him, she spurs the Worm after Beetle Juice.


ANGLE

Beetle Juice struggles, trying to run from the worm.
But Barbara and the worm outmaneuver him, corner him,
and when the worm reaches him, he opens his hungry
mouth and gulps Betelgeuse in one mouthful.

BETELGEUSE
Rrrrat shit!


ANGLE

Barbara leaps off, as the Sand Worm continues down
through the floorboards of the house

Betelgeuse is gone.  Adam is back to full size.
Charles and Delia are no longer held by the sculptures.
Lydia runs back to her family and Adam and Barbara.
The dust settles.


ON HOLE - JUNO

peers into the room.  She pulls the whores through the
hole.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. MAIN STREET - WINTER RIVER - A BRIGHT DAY

BIRDS SING.  Ernie polishes the lion.  Old Bill sleeps.
People stroll.


EXT. MISS SHANNON'S BOARDING SCHOOL - DAY

A lovely white boarding school with long, green lawn.
A BELL RINGS.  Girls come out the front door.  Say
goodbyes.  Lydia walks out too, carrying books.

LYDIA
'Bye, Serena.  See you later.

Lydia walks along Main Street of Winter River.


EXT. JANE BUTTERFIELD'S ANTIQUES/TRAVEL/REAL ESTATE

Jane is getting out of her car -- Little Jane follows.

JANE
Hellooo!  How's school?

LYDIA
(not particularly
interested)
It's okay.  How's the dirt
business?

JANE
Well, I'm expecting a call from
your parents.  I have some news
for them.

Jane hears PHONE RING from inside, rushes in to answer it.

LYDIA
Tell them I'll call them tonight.


EXT. MAIN STREET - WINTER RIVER - A BRIGHT DAY

Ernie polishes the lion.  Lydia passes.

LYDIA
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.

He looks around, surprised.


INT. JANE BUTTERFIELD'S ANTIQUES/TRAVEL/REAL ESTATE

Jane screams into the phone.

JANE
What do you mean no?  After all
I've done for you.  I don't do
this for my health you know.

CAMERA EXPLORES a row of photographs of houses for
sale.

ON PHOTOGRAPH -- of the old Maitland house.  It is
delapidated and haunted-looking.  A legend reads:
Fixer-Upper's Special.""

BACK TO JANE -- she is frustrated.

JANE
I have here a bona fide offer of
$250,000.00 for that dump.

Little Jane is now at the Xerox machine.  The NOISE
irritates Big Jane and she throws a wad of paper at
Little Jane.  Little Jane gets mad and throws her
papers into the air and exits.


INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY

We recognize the furniture.  It's the Deetzes'.  Delia
is on the phone to Jane.  Charles comes in with the
Wall Street Journal.  He fidgets, taps his fingers, as
he reads and pours coffee -- all at once.

DELIA
(whisper to Charles)
It's Mrs. Butterworth again.

Charles picks up the extension.

CHARLES
Listen to me, Jane.  We don't want
anyone looking at the house.  We
don't want it painted, the yard
mowed, the trees trimmed, nor do
we want it termite inspected.
It's not for sale.


INT. JANE'S STORE - DAY

Jane listens.  Silent.  Thinking.

JANE
Well.  Okay for now.  When will
you sell it?


INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY

DELIA
(smiles)
Never, honey.  Never.

She hangs up.  Looks at Charles.

DELIA
(continuing)
Some people never know when to
leave things the way they are.

Charles smiles.


INT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

SOUND OF SWEEPING -- CAMERA eases up -- Barbara is
sweeping.  Adam working on his model.

ADAM
What time is it?

BARBARA
3:30 I guess.

ADAM
Give or take a year.

Barbara smiles.

The KITCHEN DOOR SLAMS.  Barbara looks up at Adam.
They smile.

ADAM
Did you get the paint?

LYDIA'S VOICE
I got it.  And I took pictures of
the new church for you, too.

BARBARA
How'd you do on the science test?

ON LYDIA

LYDIA
(hangs her head)
It was gross.  They wanted me to
dissect a frog.  I told them no
way.  I said it was against my
religion.  I got a C.

Adam frowns a little.

BARBARA
How did you do on the math test?

Lydia looks down coyly.

ADAM
We studied all day yesterday.
Don't tell me...

LYDIA
I got an A!

They grin with pride.

LYDIA
(continuing)
So can I?

ADAM
(shaking his head)
Uh-uh.  Only if you got above a C
on science.

LYDIA
Oh, go on...

BARBARA
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You
never got an A in science in your
life!

ADAM
All right.

ON LYDIA -- she puts down her books.  Loosens her
collar, ruffles her hair and waits.

ADAM
(continuing)
Okay.

Lydia looks down.  Lydia begins to levitate.

She lifts her head and leaves the white bread world
behind!  In a voice as deep and soulful as Percy
Sledge:

LYDIA
""When a man loves a woman.
He can't keep his mind on nothin' else.""

Behind her ghostly images of the football players
appear as back-up.

FOOTBALLERS
Oooooo.  Hummm oooooo.

LYDIA
He'd change the world for the good
thing he's found.  When a main
needs a woman, He cain't keep his
mind on nothin' else.  If she's
bad, he won't see it, she can do
no wrong.

MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:


ANGLE

A great pile of sand with the whorehouse in the
middle.  An irritated Betelgeuse crawls out on the
roof.  Hating the singing he shakes his fist at the
sky -- loses his footing and tumbles into the sand.
Terrified, he scrambles to get out.


ON PILE

A moving coil under the sand sends him scurrying inside
again.  The Sandworm SNAPPING right behind him as he
runs back out on the roof.


ANGLE

CAMERA TILTS UP to see house.  It is the perfect, New
England house.  CAMERA PULLS BACK from the model -- out
the window of the real house.

Outside the real house -- we see it is dilapidated, and
undeniably, the perfect haunted house.

211,211,I Melt With You,"[Verse 1]
Moving forward using all my breath
Making love to you was never second best
I saw the world crashing all around your face
Never really knowing it was always
Mesh and lace

[Chorus]
I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference
And it's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you

[Verse 2]
(You should know better)
Dream of better lives
The kind which never hate
(You should see why)
Dropped in the state of imaginary grace

(You should know better)
I made a pilgrimage
To save this human race
(You should see why)
Never comprehending
The race was long, long lost

[Chorus]
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(I'll stop the world)
You've seen the difference
And it's getting better all the time

(I'll stop the world)
There's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you

The future's open wide

[Chorus]

But it's getting better all the time

They said they'd seen ya
You were sneakin' around with a stranger
Girl these rumors are drivin' me mad

All my good friends turn their face to the wall
When they see me, what the hell's goin' on am I so blind
That I can't see when I'm being had

I know it's silly but girl I really thought we had a chance
I must've been crazy!

Bang Bang, what's that sound
I gave you my love and you shot me down
Bang Bang, you're so cool
Playin' a game, someday you're gonna lose
Bang! Bang!

Then you showed me now you're failing the test
It was easy just an urge in the heat of the nite

I believed you, now that's all in the past
Cause I made some mistakes but I'm learnin' fast
Never put your heart on the line!
Never put your heart on the line!

A search through my distant past

Have you still got that same old look in your eyes

We grew past the love that showed we cared
We found life in reflections of the last days of a child

Raindrops splash rainbows
Perhaps someone you know
Could sparkle and shine
As daydreams slide
To colour from shadow
Picture the moonglow
That dazzles my eyes
And I love you

Just lying smiling in the dark
Shooting stars around your heart
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Pure and simple every time
Now you're crying in your sleep
I wish you'd never learnt to weep
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
Pure and simple every time

Dream of sights
Of sleigh rides in seasons
Where feelings not reasons
Can make you decide
As leaves pour down
Splash Autumn on gardens
As colder nights harden
Their moonlit delights
And I love you

Just lying smiling in the dark
Shooting stars around your heart
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Pure and simple every time
Now you're crying in your sleep
I wish you'd never learnt to weep
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
Pure and simple every time

Look at me with starry eyes
Push me up to starry skies
There's stardust in my head
Pure and simple every time
Fresh and deep as oceans new
Shiver at the sight of you
I'll sing a softer tune
Pure and simple over you

If love's the truth then look no lies
And let me swim around your eyes
I've found a place I'll never leave
Shut my mouth and just believe
Love is the truth I realize
Not a stream of pretty lies
To use us up
And waste our time

Lying smiling in the dark
Shooting stars around your heart
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Pure and simple every time
Now you're crying in your sleep
I wish you'd never learnt to weep
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
Pure and simple every time

Look at me with starry eyes
Push me up to starry skies
There's stardust in my head
Pure and simple every time
Fresh and deep as oceans new
Shiver at the sight of you
I'll sing a softer tune
Pure and simple over you

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

[Verse 1]
My, my, my my music hits me so hard
Makes me say, ""Oh my Lord""
Thank you for blessin' me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

[Chorus]
I told you homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know (You can't touch this)
Look in my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)

[Verse 2]
Fresh new kicks, and pants
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move outta yo seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on!
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

[Chorus]
Yo, I told you (Can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school's in, sucka (You can't touch this)

[Verse 3]
Give me a song, or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' 'bout the Hammer, you're talkin' 'bout a show
That's hyped, and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

[Chorus]
That's word because you know (You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
Break it down!

[Breakdown]
Stop, Hammer time!

[Verse 4]
Go with the flow, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave yo hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
(Bump, bump, bump)

[Chorus]
Yeah (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)
You better get hype, boy, because you know you can't (You can't touch this)
Ring the bell, school's back in
Break it down!

[Breakdown]
Stop, Hammer time!

[Chorus]
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down!

[Breakdown]
Stop, Hammer time!

[Verse 5]
Every time you see me, the Hammer's just so hyped
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doin' this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's ""Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo Hammer""
And the rest can go and play
You can't touch this

[Chorus]
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Yeah (You can't touch this)
I told you (Can't touch this)
Too hot (Can't touch this)
Yo, we outta here (Can't touch this)","['you', 'cant', 'touch', 'this', 'you', 'cant', 'touch', 'this', 'you', 'cant', 'touch', 'this', 'you', 'cant', 'touch', 'this', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'music', 'hit', 'me', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'me', 'say', 'oh', 'my', 'lord', 'thank', 'you', 'for', 'blessin', 'me', 'with', 'a', 'mind', 'to', 'rhyme', 'and', 'two', 'hype', 'feet', 'it', 'feel', 'good', 'when', 'you', 'know', 'youre', 'down', 'a', 'super', 'dope', 'homeboy', 'from', 'the', 'oaktown', 'and', 'im', 'know', 'as', 'such', 'and', 'this', 'be', 'a', 'beat', 'uh', 'you', 'cant', 'touch', 'fresh', 'new', 'kick', 'and', 'pant', 'you', 'gotta', 'like', 'that', 'now', 'you', 'know', 'you', 'wanna', 'dance', 'so', 'move', 'outta', 'yo', 'seat', 'and', 'get', 'a', 'fly', 'girl', 'and', 'catch', 'this', 'beat', 'while', 'its', 'rollin', 'hold', 'on', 'pump', 'a', 'little', 'bite', 'and', 'let', 'em', 'know', 'its', 'goin', 'on', 'like', 'that', 'like', 'that', 'cold', 'on', 'a', 'mission', 'so', 'fall', 'on', 'back', 'let', 'em', 'know', 'that', 'youre', 'too', 'much', 'and', 'this', 'be', 'a', 'beat', 'uh', 'they', 'cant', 'touch', 'give', 'me', 'a', 'song', 'or', 'rhythm', 'makin', 'em', 'sweat', 'thats', 'what', 'im', 'givin', 'em', 'now', 'they', 'know', 'you', 'talkin', 'bout', 'the', 'hammer', 'youre', 'talkin', 'bout', 'a', 'show', 'thats', 'hype', 'and', 'tight', 'singers', 'be', 'sweatin', 'so', 'pass', 'them', 'a', 'wipe', 'or', 'a', 'tape', 'to', 'learn', 'whats', 'it', 'gonna', 'take', 'in', 'the', '90s', 'to', 'burn', 'the', 'chart', 'legit', 'either', 'work', 'hard', 'or', 'you', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'quit', 'break', 'it', 'down', 'stop', 'hammer', 'time', 'go', 'with', 'the', 'flow', 'it', 'be', 'say', 'that', 'if', 'you', 'cant', 'groove', 'to', 'this', 'then', 'you', 'probably', 'be', 'dead', 'so', 'wave', 'yo', 'hand', 'in', 'the', 'air', 'bust', 'a', 'few', 'move', 'run', 'your', 'finger', 'through', 'your', 'hair', 'this', 'be', 'it', 'for', 'a', 'winner', 'dance', 'to', 'this', 'and', 'youre', 'gonna', 'get', 'thinner', 'move', 'slide', 'your', 'rump', 'just', 'for', 'a', 'minute', 'let', 'all', 'do', 'the', 'bump', 'ring', 'the', 'bell', 'school', 'back', 'in', 'break', 'it', 'down', 'stop', 'hammer', 'time', 'you', 'cant', 'touch', 'this', 'you', 'cant', 'touch', 'this', 'you', 'cant', 'touch', 'this', 'you', 'cant', 'touch', 'this', 'break', 'it', 'down', 'stop', 'hammer', 'time', 'every', 'time', 'you', 'see', 'me', 'the', 'hammer', 'just', 'so', 'hype', 'im', 'dope', 'on', 'the', 'floor', 'and', 'im', 'magic', 'on', 'the', 'mic', 'now', 'why', 'would', 'i', 'ever', 'stop', 'doin', 'this', 'with', 'others', 'makin', 'record', 'that', 'just', 'dont', 'hit', 'ive', 'tour', 'around', 'the', 'world', 'from', 'london', 'to', 'the', 'bay', 'its', 'hammer', 'go', 'hammer', 'mc', 'hammer', 'yo', 'hammer', 'and', 'the', 'rest', 'can', 'go', 'and', 'play', 'you', 'cant', 'touch', 'this', 'you', 'cant', 'touch', 'this', 'you', 'cant', 'touch', 'this']",389,MC Hammer,M.C.

218,218,The Humpty Dance,"[Verse One: Shock G as Humpty Hump]
All right! Stop whatcha doin', 'cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny—but yo I'm making money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a ""umpty""
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

[Verse Two]
People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's all right cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothing, like looptid
I sang on ""Doowutchalike"", and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'im in the biscuits""
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

[Breakdown]
Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

[Verse Three]
First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shaking and twitching kinda like I was smoking
Crazy wack funky
People say 'ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty'
That's all right cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humping, funking, jumping
Jig around, shaking ya rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doing the Hump

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doing the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Let's get stoopid!

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Oh, yeah, come on and break it down

[Outro]
Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world
Keep on doing the Humpty Dance
And to the ladies

Girl, I close my eyes
And then I start to cry for you
You're the reason why
I have to say goodbye to you

This pain I have inside
Just makes me want to die for you
All these lonely nights
They just don't seem so right for you

I'm sending you all my...

Sending all my love
I'm sending all my love to you
I'm sending all my love
I'm sending all my love to you

Every move you make
Day by day I pray for you
When I close my eyes
Teardrops start to fall for you

I'm sending all my love
Sending all my love to you

Just makes me want to die for you

Sending all my love to you

But nothing seems to satisfy me the way you do, no
You make it easy, the way you please me
Everytime I'm close to you

Never had a girl in my life 'til I met you, no no no

Who's a dancin' on the table right in front of you
She works all day in her old man's store
But she don't get enough, she wanna earn some more

Daddy's little angel's tongue in cheek
So by the end of the week, she close the boutique
Change her name, that's part of the game
While her daddy sits and wonders who's the hell to
Blame

Do you wanna dance, do you wanna dance here
Do you wanna dance here, wanna take a chance tonight
Do you wanna dance, do you wanna dance here
Do you wanna dance here, wanna make romance tonight

Oh, oh she's in the spotlight!
She's all lips and hips
She knows how to use 'em to make you flip
Lips and hips

And she gets ya with a wink of a fingertip
Lips and hips
You can tell that she knows how to give a kiss
Lips and hips
When she's found the target, she never miss

Now did I ever tell ya about the tattoo on her breast
She's got a tattoo on her breast tattooed by the best
It keeps rockin' from the East to the West
And she don't try to hide it by the way she's dressed

When she comes walking straight up to the table
Like a boy in a cradle you begin to shake
It's not only the time that gets hard for you
When she whispers in your ear you'll...

Do you wanna dance, do you wanna dance here...

222,222,The Emperor's New Clothes,"[Verse 1]
It seems years since you held the baby
While I wrecked the bedroom
You said it was dangerous after Sunday
And I knew you loved me
He thinks I just became famous
And that's what messed me up
But he's wrong
How could I possibly know what I want
When I was only twenty-one?
And there's millions of people
To offer advice and say how I should be
But they're twisted
And they will never be any influence on me
But you will always be
You will always be

[Chorus]
If I treated you mean
I really didn't mean to
But you know how it is
And how a pregnancy can change you

[Verse 2]
I see plenty of clothes that I like
But I won't go anywhere nice for a while
All I want to do is just sit here
And write it all down and rest for a while
I can't bear to be in another city
One where you are not
I would return to nothing without you
If I'm your girlfriend or not

[Chorus]
Maybe I was mean
But I really don't think so
You asked if I'm scared
And I said so

[Verse 3]
Everyone can see what's going on
They laugh `cause they know they're untouchable
Not because what I said was wrong
Whatever it may bring
I will live by my own policies
I will sleep with a clear conscience
I will sleep in peace

[Chorus]
Maybe it sounds mean
But I really don't think so
You asked for the truth and I told you

[Outro]
Through their own words
They will be exposed
They've got a severe case of
The emperor's new clothes

Kilauea, activate now, imma kill this, imma slayer
Lava flowing down, this a game, I'm a player
Starting shit off right, each track is a layer
Peel em from my brain, get close to the surface
Fireballs drop from the sky like birdshit
Innocents travel in packs like a circus
This is act 1, opening of the curtains
So now I burn shit, with my serpents
No emotion, I'm a step below a person
In the dark, with a light, see me lurking
Motherfuckers follow when they feeling like they hurting
Kilauea got em running, holding fake shit close guess the cross give em something
Father told me I don't have a damn function
Reason why I'm shackled in the corner of his dungeon
I'm a packrat, keeping different backpacks
Filling em with pipes, kinda need em for this crack rap
Keep the stash in the back where the bats at
Killing off a clown cuz he acting like an asshat
I ain't a killer but don't push me
I keep the inner peace till you overlook me
Now the listener is sucked in
Coming out the gates with the sounds of eruptions

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Android]
Dumb bitch who be stealing my rhymes, who be stealing my heart, who be stealing my time
I ain't into crime but you fucking with my mind
So I gotta seek revenge, see ya dead, flat line
See you in the morgue, with your toe tag sticking out
Night falls, look who's acting like a chicken now
Giving off peace but my mind stay flipping out
Fucked up life, but my mother saying live it out
Shit, that's for the sixth or the seventh
Heart full of hell, I ain't good enough for heaven
Beast tendencies, 2 p's, what I'm repping
Chewing up MCs, mouthpiece, like Stephen
Kilauea got em running, holding fake shit close, guess the cross give em something
Yeah, that shit dont do nothing
Imma play shit live, get your whole crew jumping
This is my life served raw on a platter
My rise to fame, climbing long ass ladders
Imma show you bullshit and what really matters
I don't how imma do it, cuz my brain so battered
I start it off with a bang
By myself, I don't walk with a gang
You know this shit is done right
Shout this shit one time, it go just like

When the shades are drawn
And the light of the moon is banned
And the stars up above
Walk the heavens hand in hand
There's a shady place
At the end of the working day
Where young lovers go
And this hot little trio plays

[Chorus] [x2]
That's where we meet[x2]
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

[Verse 2]
From the alleyways
Where the catwalks gently sway
You hear the sound of Otis
And the voice of Marvin Gaye
In this smoky room
There's a jukebox plays all night
And we can dance real close
Beneath the pulse of a neon light
There's a downtown smell of cooking
From the flame on an open grill
There's a sax and a big bass pumping
Lord have mercy
You can't sit still[x2]","['when', 'the', 'shade', 'be', 'draw', 'and', 'the', 'light', 'of', 'the', 'moon', 'be', 'ban', 'and', 'the', 'star', 'up', 'above', 'walk', 'the', 'heavens', 'hand', 'in', 'hand', 'theres', 'a', 'shady', 'place', 'at', 'the', 'end', 'of', 'the', 'work', 'day', 'where', 'young', 'lovers', 'go', 'and', 'this', 'hot', 'little', 'trio', 'play', 'me', 'and', 'you', 'rendezvous', 'in', 'the', 'club', 'at', 'the', 'end', 'of', 'the', 'street', 'from', 'the', 'alleyways', 'where', 'the', 'catwalks', 'gently', 'sway', 'you', 'hear', 'the', 'sound', 'of', 'otis', 'and', 'the', 'voice', 'of', 'marvin', 'gaye', 'in', 'this', 'smoky', 'room', 'theres', 'a', 'jukebox', 'play', 'all', 'night', 'and', 'we', 'can', 'dance', 'real', 'close', 'beneath', 'the', 'pulse', 'of', 'a', 'neon', 'light', 'theres', 'a', 'downtown', 'smell', 'of', 'cook', 'from', 'the', 'flame', 'on', 'an', 'open', 'grill', 'theres', 'a', 'sax', 'and', 'a', 'big', 'bass', 'pump', 'lord', 'have', 'mercy']",125,Elton John,Elton John,1990,"[90, 69, 63, 57, 42, 28, 30, 35, 35, 39, 45, 55, 65, 74, 76, 86]",16,Club At The End Of The Street,https://open.spotify.com/track/3spWfMlB39jSkstIslYnvG,3spWfMlB39jSkstIslYnvG,spotify:track:3spWfMlB39jSkstIslYnvG,Sleeping With The Past (Remastered with bonus tracks),0j12QW17dkUCCI7eOAiT1r,spotify:album:0j12QW17dkUCCI7eOAiT1r,Elton John,3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b,spotify:artist:3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b,292.173,11.0,37.0,1989-08-29,0.65,0.755,2.0,-9.645,1.0,0.0281,8.120000000000001e-05,0.0145,0.326,0.782,124.844,"['glam rock', 'mellow gold', 'piano rock', 'soft rock']",[],1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12399999999999999

Hey, Slim. Come here, check this out
Uh-uh, wait. Let me tell you something
If you ain't got a Bronco, a BMW, a band or big bank
Aw, I knew it. I knew it. I KNEW IT
Another B girl
Yo I think it's about time
We gonna tell Slim about ourselves
Believe that

[Verse 1]
Now let's bring up the subject
[?] Which we brought to mind
Let's discuss the ""B"" girls
Cause they're one-of-a-kind

Now you can [?]
Wherever you go
Put 'em in your black Benz
Or your blue Bronco

[?]
Everything is chill
With the A C pushin'
In your automobile
You call yourself a lady?
""B"" girl is your name
And if you don't know what ""B"" means
Let us explain

[Hook]
""B"" stands for:
Broncos, Benz, BMW, bass, bangles and a pair of bars
When you see us pulling up down the Ave
You'll act like we are stars

We're not tryin' to make a joke
We're just tryin' to make it known
That people of the world that we call ""B"" girls
Like bars on a Cadillac Brougham.

[Verse 2]
Now that ain't it, and I believe
That we had to rehearse
Another rhyme on the line
For the second verse:
About a girl in the city
Her name is Judy
Had breasts like Dolly
With a big old booty

Well she was [?]
And everything was in place
She was my girl for two years
And [?] doctor [?]

When I took her to [?]
She was frontin' 'bout my Nova
And she wanted a Benz

She said ""We need a Benz""
And all of a sudden, I paused -
Who did Judy think I was?
Santa Claus?
You call yourself Judy
""B"" girl is your name
And if you don't know what ""B"" means
Let us explain:

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I was pushin' on my rims
With no context [?]
It wasn't BMW
It was BMX
When I seen a young thing
Comin' down the Ave
And I knew from the moment
She's the girl I'd have
So I slammed on the brake
And I asked her name
She said, ""My name is Janet
But my friends call me Jane.""

I said, ""Well Jane, I'm Prince
Can we be friends?""
She said
""Yes, if you could change a BMX to a Benz!""
You call yourself Jane
""B"" girl is your name
And if you don't know what ""B"" means
Let us explain:

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Now me and [?] was at the beach
With a couple of friends --
I parked my Nova by a Bronco
And a baby blue Benz
And pass [?] bottles [?]
So I said, [?]
Already drunk from an overdose
Of malt liquor beer

She turned around
And had a nice figure
She said, ""Can't you see me walkin' my nigga?""

""Hey, so? He's a punk!"" [?]

She said, ""I know he's a punk though
But you in a Nova
And he's in a Bronco!""

She came in my face, she kept yakkety-yakkin'
That's when I popped the trunk, I put the clip in the MAC-10

I'm tired of you ""B"" girls
Yeah, that's your name!

And if you don't know what 'B' means
Let us explain:

[Hook]

[Intro 1: Producer Tag]
Finny Music

[Intro 2: DJ Paul]
Who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
These niggas got plenty Anna but they ain't got plenty guns
I'm bustin' out luxury cars, still got these hoes on the run
I'm hearin' plenty mean words, but ain't no actions to boot
We can do some straight war for war, we can do some stickin' and movin'
We can meet in the middle of these streets or in the middle of this ring
I can pop your chest, plastic Glock, or pop your jaw diamond rings
Bitch don't hate me hate the bank, for stacks of cheese that I take
Or hate my shiny wristband, and big ass rims I rotate
See people flip when I'm comin', got suckas sick at the stomach
They wonderin' what I brought in, they wonderin' what I got comin'
Niggas I'm comin' like this, off in your mouth like a bitch
Trust me when you think of me, I'm bringing water, I'll start it

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
What's the business?
It's that player that you love to hate, always see come out the bank
Always have to mention my name, when you high on that drank
Catch up with this boy you can't, cause you know I'm holdin' rank
When you see the platinum Rolex with the ice it make you faint
Through the streets now have you heard, 'bout the Mafia droppin' birds
Runnin' from the narcs and cops, tossin' out the bags of herb
Ain't afraid to pop the steel, hollow tips to make you feel
If you wanna punk me out, Cartier's and a Dracula grill

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]
I can't take anymore, I'm 'bout to explode
I'm 'bout to overload, I'm 'bout to get it, boy
All I wanna know is where the G's at, where the key's at
Keep it easy, you don't want to get skeeted
All on this motherfuckin' room, nigga, boom
Lay down on your back so you can get up soon
Stab you in your heart with a har-fuckin-poon
Nigga, boom, nigga, boom

[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow's on it, I'm still hungry, starvin' for a platinum supper
Wipe it easy, some black founded, crooked ass set'll be eating rubber
'Cause if they skit-skat, gun 'em all down, even ghost towns
Splish-Splash, brains on the ground, with a cannon round
Ball bat, bash him in his back, beatin' bitches down
Battleaxe blaze from the cross, body never found
Catch a close encounter cause the Anna kills off these rap bums
Chemical reaction cobra venom shot into his arm

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These, these, these bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These...
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one of y'all step, the first one I'm a toss out

[Verse 5: Gangsta Boo]
Here we go, all you weak ass hoes
In my face like you my friend
Triple Six dropped in again, time to make ends
Dope game, my game, hoes lame, it's a shame
How that Gangsta Boo is runnin' the click up on you bitches man
Fat cat, what I be, packin', how you love that
Fuck a platinum plaque, gimme money, where the dollars at
(Blap, blap) You're dead in a second for 10 G's
(Where you from?) Black haven is where I be on my P's and Q's

[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
Parents please, watch out for your children
This the one that'll lock 'em in the basement
Some of them talkin' so rugged, some corrupted ugly pussa-pussa
Close your fucking mouth, my nigga, Koopsta tryin' to tell ya somethin'
Peter-Peter, pussy eater, one of them fucked by Koopsta Knicca
Lord, I done some sins, cause she married, but I don't know that nigga
Figured he is a killa, so he figures he'll watch us fuckin'
Put them muthafuckin' slugs upside that thug, cuz, oh my

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These, the-these, these, these bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one of y'all step, the first one I'm a toss out

[Verse 7: Juicy J & DJ Paul]
For that dick game, wouldn't buy your bitch with my loose change
Thirsty niggas eatin' bitches ass with the shit stain
Insane like my motherfuckin' wrist game, nigga
Houses on the hill cost the same fuckin' thing
Counted up a hunnid this mornin'
Then I went spent me 50
Then I hit the VLive, tryna buy me some ass and titties
Rappers sample my old shit, keep runnin' 'em bags, I'm uh rich
Get 'em samples cleared 'cause that publish you might not get some
Niggas act like they don't owe me somethin'
I'm the reason bitches twerkin' they ass, now show me somethin'
Payin' homage is a real nigga move, bitch I paid my dues
Sold a million out the trunk, you niggas uber poo
Pour that mud up like that butter, first nigga with that pipe in the club
Used to have to turn my shit up, had niggas tryna fight in the club
Y'all leaving with them, we hit them hoes right in the club
And I know I'm icy'd up, pinky just like that dub
You gotta like my shit, you a hater or somethin'
I'm a grown ass man, you a baby or somethin'
Probably fucked yo mama on the come up in the 80's, homie
Don't you ever try to play me, homie
Got a wife now like Kanye
And I wish a bitch would try to bite her like Beyonce
My daughter 2 months and she been paid
Boutta sign more deals, cop more real estate
Me and Pat used to rob for 'em petty things
Now it's nothin' less than private jets, 7 figure checks
Hater, catch yo fuckin' breathe, you broke, ain't got nothin' left
We them niggas in Dubai from the north, don't you ever flex
Mafia, runnin' shit, Juicy J ain't never quit
Ain't a bitch I never hit, still countin' paper, bitch
When the smoke clears, nigga, I'm still here
Higher than I been in 20 goddamn years, uh
Motherfuckin' legend get your smoke right, dope right (Who run it)
Ain't no conversation for that broke life, show right,  (Who run it) bitch

[Verse 8: CupcakKe & DJ Paul]
Let me talk my shit real quick (Who run it), all the real niggas gon' feel this
How that's yo' kid but he ain't got bills? Can't find you in family pics
Food stamps, they go so quick when you up in a family of six
So it's funny how they sell that shit for a little pack of weed and a new pair of kicks
Man, I'm so dead, I can't, inside I feel so blank
Little girls on Twitter talkin' 'bout they break up, girl, sit back on Paint
If I'm alive, no complaints, none of these judges saints
Let the black beat her, that's 10 years, but if white beat her, ""nice tank""
It's so ridiculous, ain't shit funny, ain't ticklish
Don't test me if I'm with the shits, end up in a cage, no Nicholas
Everything about me is interesting, I'ma need more and more Benjamins
Damn, I can't breathe, stop smoking them trees, got your insides looking like Christmas
Ungrateful hoes, get the fuck out of here, you had a rough day and I had a rough year
So when I get money I really do care, go and invest it, not spending on gear
Think about that, just stating facts, niggas don't chart when it's real rap
Earn my respect then you get it right back, that go hand in hand ain't talkin' dap
A lot of issues in my past still hurt me to this day, to the core
I don't ever open up 'cause I know people change like the oil
Over 100k up on tour, still got a mindset like I'm poor
But I'm on the roll when it come to rappin' like a pack of aluminum foil
Man, I love walking barefoot, I really like the feel when I'm at the bottom (what?)
'Cause I know it's only for a couple of seconds, then I'm right back to my stardom (that's right)
Motherfuckers ain't woke, man, I gotta fuck around and re-alarm 'em
I'm woke all day, 3 AM, when they call me Jake from State Farm
Okay, lil' bitch, act like you know, anything I say is right like nose
Walk right over there, hoe, like roach, and it's over for these hoes, no dose
Walk in that bitch with a white T, they don't really like me but you know how that goes
Walk out that bitch you would think I'm little red riding hood, how I got blood on my clothes

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 9: G Herbo]
All I smoke is loud, you got that mild like Darius (yeah)
My son ain't gotta work because he gon' inherit it, uh huh (gon' inherit it)
We yell, ""Gang-gang first,"" you don't even know your heritage (bitch)
Took the cash from verses, I give that shit to charity
Lovin' my city like Chano, I swear
Why the fuck I still gotta ride everywhere with it?
""Herb I seen you on the news, I was worried""
We was just jokin' with y'all, that's a parody
We don't talk too much, got D's everywhere (everywhere)
We still fresh, double G's everywhere (everywhere)
I put the VV's everywhere (everywhere)
I do Mike Amiri's, every pair
And they know me for shittin' on everybody
I'm the one that do shit that you hear about
I'm the one that told y'all that I move like Obama
Then how the fuck they end up with my whereabouts?
Hold on everybody gotta clear it out
Middle of summer, hot like a sauna
We was laid back in the back of the Honda
Told young to sneak up, anaconda
It ain't happen, not one day, your honor
I was somewhere eatin' Benihana's
Get valet and Lil' Benny to park it
All my life I had been in apartments
Move to Bali, get a brib, I’m ballin
My bitch always primpin', keep ballin'
Yes I'm a lil' workaholic
Hit the crib with a 50 and all 20's
I'ma just make her count all of 'em
But I get the backend all blues
Nah don't fuck around, bruh, do all of it
Know it's goin' right to lil' dude
Already got a closet, all shoes
Bought 10 pairs of baby G-Fazos
And my bitch got a closet with some Loubs
Cashed out on the crib, I ain't get the view
I'm like, ""Fuck it, no problem, it'll do""
Mama's crib got a pond, not a pool
We had roaches and rats, I ain't get to move
I survived through it all, it's true (yes, it's true)
Slept on couches and floors all through middle school
Now I'm cool, now I'm 'bool
Now my car go vroom, (vroom)
Niggas hatin' on me, but it's bool
Guess I got rich too soon
Nigga, I've been rappin' like six years (what?)
I seen ten niggas get killed
What about me turnin' down them deals? (Huh)
Now you pissed off 'cause I switched wheels?

[Interlude: G Herbo]
Uh, who run it? Limit
No Limit run it
No Limit man
No Limit
Who run it? G Herbo
I'm done with this shit

[Verse 10: Lil Uzi Vert]
Who y'all think you foolin'? Not me
Y'all niggas really ain't airin' nothin'
This bust down, tryna scare us or some'
Your shit weak, tryna compare us or somethin'
What I made last week? Like a million or somethin'
Rich, mad 'cause your bitch ate my kids or somethin'
Man, I could fuck your wife like you sharin' or somethin'
Galore ass mansion with lira or somethin'
Nigga tried to get my ho, tried to fuck my bitch
You think I'ma miss that?
Man she sucked Meen's dick and she sucked Rock's dick
So you think I'ma kiss that?
I was in L.A., bitch powdered her nose
Told her I ain't with that
Boy you trippin', SI diamonds on your neck
Mean you better give your wrist back
Me no broke, Akademiks, yeah, that's where you get your news at
Ask your bros, Grammy-nominated songs just to prove that
Know your bros told you, nah, you better not just do that, uh
I'm going mode, T.Y., tell me when to go, boy, you ain't rich, you a bitch (facts)
Oh you T'd out? Bitch, you beat out
Y'all worried 'bout me, better get your lick back
Just like bitches, y'all all chit chat
Car so foreign got an engine in the back
Balenciaga with the Gucci and the Prada
With the Louis and the Pucci and it's all mismatched
Ho, it's Lil Uzi and I'm far from a goofy
In Chiraq, 150, be strapped
Got a 40 shorty, boy, better get back
Gun loud, backyard party, kick back
How I'm broke If I just hired myself a hitman?
Be quiet, bro, them niggas over there'll turn to six rats
Not lyin', bro, I been fucked this bitch for six racks
After I drop that shit, me, Herbo, Ari and my bitch is gonna relax
Prolly somewhere on a beach, prolly somewhere on an island
You know that my Rollie got XO diamonds in it, so that's that Perfect Timing
Said, ""Elliot, bezel it,"" ice kettle chips, I run it back like a Heisman
Pull up, I'm swervin', I'm mergin', I got the whip, yeah the one right with the curtains
Got boys that be workin' their block to be twerkin', the Tesla pull up for diversion
On the beat, me and Herbo, we purgin', the Perky the molly the lean got us slurrin'
You call her phone, you think she sleep, but she suckin' my dick while her words keep on slurpin'
She said that my shit the same size as a two-liter ginger ale, why she keep burpin'
I take out my hair and I stand on my money, your bitch think I'm Julius Erving

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 11: 21 Savage]
(on God)
I'm on Percocet's, I think I'm finna skydive (yeah)
You little pussycat, you must think you got nine lives (21)
I'm so sick of all this fruity shit, you niggas on thin ice
That stick gon' cut you half-time, now these niggas wanna switch sides (straight up)
I ain't really with that takin' shit, lil' nigga, I'm walkin' up (straight up)
That .30 like a tree lil' nigga, watch where you barkin' up (straight up)
We got way too many shots, y'all lil' niggas can't dodge enough (on God)
We can even challenge ya, 'cause y'all lil' niggas ain't charged enough (fast)
Quarter million dollar for a walkthrough (straight up)
Get the utmost respect when I walk through (straight up)
I love the way you suck that dick, lil' bitch, don't forget who taught you (straight up)
Way too much, can't stalk you (straight up)
Bogeyman, nigga, I'll haunt you (on God)
All these bullets 'round me, nigga, I ain't got time to punch you (21)
Hit 'em wit' the 3-2, all y'all niggas see through (yeah)
Broad day, I'll see food, had to hit a lick at Kiku (yeah-yeah)
Lil' bitch I don't need you (yeah-yeah)
Hell Nah, I can't eat you (yeah-yeah)
Let the whole gang G you, then I left that bitch at Jeju (yeah-yeah)
You must be scared or some, nigga, let's bet the spread or some (21)
That's your main bitch, but I bet that lil' bitch spread for some (on God)
I got all these blues like I ain't bangin' red or somethin' (trre)
I bought all these cars like l ain't got no legs or somethin' (yeah)
Fuck that other side, pull up in ya hood switch it (21)
Sex, money, murder, two guns, nigga, big B's (21)
Every time I hit that bitch she come back like a frisbee (yeah)
I ain't got time to play with nobody kids, go watch Disney (yeah)
Skin made of concrete, nigga, you can never be me (21)
My brother down the road with a touchscreen and a FeFe (BF)
Candlelight gang, leave a nigga on the TV (21)
Fish fry gang, y'all can't even afford to die
Bitch, I'm way too real, I can't even afford to lie

[Verse 12: A$AP Rocky]
Make a bitch wanna stare or something
Niggas stare, you queer or somethin'?
You's a bitch, yeah we stay done
Chose a whip but I'm staying sunny
Diamonds sunny like I'm Cher or something
Smiley faces with the glasses
Fashion brands invite you to Paris
Boy you late that's a demerit, dang it
Get fucking maggot brain having
Rappers claiming the trap and the fashion
They only got Louis and the trap
I'm causing the flood and the traffic
The way that you be moving is whack
All of them rumors is facts
They've been in clap for the clap back
Your baby mama a nag nag
Nag nag nag nag nag nag...

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 13: Trippie Redd]
Lil' nigga let them llamas fly, leave a young nigga so traumatized
Totin' gats jit, all my niggas ride
Don't make me make another mama cry
Do a drill, catch another homicide
Fix your face, nigga, you got butterflies?
Chopper at your throat and you afraid to die
Big 14, fuck the other side
Jugg, jugg, got all this jewelry
Man, this shit ain't new to me
Your bitch new to you, she ain't new to me
I ain't really with the fucking foolery
Glistenin' in these fucking diamonds
Bad bitch and I'm fucking shining
I got a bad bitch from the fucking islands
Taking trips to the fucking islands
Guess these guys don't realize
When they talking fly, man, it's suicide
Don't talk, do a nigga do or die
Nobody else, nigga, you and I
Big chopper, I'ma let the bullets fly
That red dot right between your eyes
I don't play, pussy, wish a nigga try
'Cause that'd be the night niggas die
Niggas act like I ain't G.O.A.T. or somethin'
Take a trip, go chill with the bros or somethin'
Call a few bitches, chill with some hoes or somethin'
Niggas be flexin', they bold or somethin'
They don't want that war, go home or somethin'
Internet flexin' with the phone or somethin'
You a lil' pup, nigga, fetch a bone or somethin'
Niggas male strippers when them poles bummin'

[Bridge: Trippie Redd & Lil Yachty]
Gang (uh), gang (uh), huh, gang (uh)

Act like you hard and you careless (yeah)
Nigga, I'm a real ass nigga, ain't fake a nigga
Free my big brother out the prison cell (woo)
QC and P told 'em, ""Give 'em hell""
Ridin' 'round in a Maybach with my nigga Pellz
Glock out, running we empty 12
Bitch on my dick, that's a love spell (yeah)
Bitch with the shits, call her Annabelle (yeah)
If they won't call, I don't gotta yell (yeah)
Hundreds so crisp like a pack of kettles
Fuckin' her jewels with my nigga Jack
Crotched up, all of my brothers sack (yep)
Gotta run up them Ricky Racks (yep)
In the safe in the real, we got hella plaques (yep)

Hundred niggas in your section
Hmm, where the hoes? Nigga, that's weird (pussy, pussy)
Cop a new Lamb, cop a new 'Rari
Just to go and switch gears (skrt)
Burn out, burn out
Every time we turn out, make a big scene (yeah)
2K, 3K, 4K, 5K, spent it on my new jeans (skrt skrt skrt)
Gave big bro twenty-seven racks for his birthday, the world made a scene (facts)
Y'all don't even know how a nigga live
Spend twenty racks like two bands (facts)
Uh, came with the sticks like they hunting nigga
Throwing gang signs, call it taunting nigga
Can't nobody at QC get punked, nigga
What is a one-on-one, nigga? We jumpin' niggas
We got the strap, nigga, fuck it, we stompin' niggas
I'm just as rich as your favorite rapper, nigga, might be richer (yeah)
Hit the pent like I'm Derek Fisher
Fuck the bitch right, then I kiss her
Ride around town, you the one who licked her (ew)
Ha, real player like my pops (pops)
Thirty round in my Glock (doot-doot-doot)
We run it, not opps (ha)
Ten toes on my sole, niggas wouldn't double dare to cross the big Boat (yeah)
Last year

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

[Verse 15: Tutweezy]

[Verse 16: Young M.A.]
Twenty racks in the back of jeans
Tatted sleeves, Patek freeze
Pretty nigga, that indeed
Thottie with me, black and cream
African, Japanese
I just call her blackanese
I'm just gonna tap that and leave
I don't leave the house unless I got a bag waitin' for me at the front door
If you short on my cash, thirty niggas hoppin' out a Uber truck
So don't try your luck, hoes down to fuck
Top floor of the hotel
Smokin' weed in the bathroom, put the shower on so it's no smell
Street cold, don't tell
But I'd rather live where it's no hell
It's funny how hatin' niggas be the ones who names ring no bells
Oh well, my bitch bad
And her pussy got a soap smell
She a model, nah she a model
She a little bougie
And I'm just tryna put this big wet tongue on top of that coochie
Earlier she a little mad at me, she a little moody
Sometimes I don't understand the bitch, she a little confusing
Like half the time I don't be even doin' shit, and she be assuming
Like I ain't loyal or somethin'
You act like I don't call you or somethin'
You act like you a little spoiled or somethin'
Is you hot like you boiling somethin'?
So all you rappers it's a rap for you like aluminum foil or somethin'
Better crown her, came from the ground up, from the soil or somethin'
Been 'bout it, every nigga with me poppin' like oil or somethin'
I was slackin', had to get on track like I'm recordin' or somethin'
I hear a lot of talk, but honestly they ain't really talkin' 'bout nothin'
And nowadays I don't trust a thing, so I ain't really sure about nothin'
I just fucked your bitch in Givenchy flip flops
And yeah we spendin' money, but we also spin blocks
Bend blocks, shout out my nigga Jezz, big opps
They ain't open up them doors, I had to pick locks
Free Bobby, free Rowdy, free the whole 9
Got lit on my own nigga, didn't need a cosign
It's Red Lyfe, no red lights, green lights go time
But before you get on the road, nigga make sure you know your road signs
He asked did I fuck his bitch, I said ""uh yeah nigga, four times""
My sex drive longer than my show lines, make her cum in no time
RL that's the bro sign, can't come in, we got closed sign
Can't hang here, this is not a clothesline
Fuck around and get clotheslined
No ghostwriter, I wrote mine
Wrote the whole rap and the whole rhyme
They like ""MA, where the album at?""
I just need a lil' more time
I got guns, but if I ain't usin' it, no need to show mine
Don't mean I won't blow, ma
Bitch nigga, you could blow, ma
In the club I drink out the bottle, ain't no need to even pour mine
Stripper bitches don't like me 'cause I get money and don't throw mine
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me, ain't gotta say it, you already know why
If I had a dick, you could suck it
If I had nuts, you could hold mine

[Refrain: Young M.A.]
I said, if I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Haha
If I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Fuck y'all niggas
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

[Verse 17: Bhad Bhabie]
Ayy
When I look around, don't see nobody in my lane
See these rappers need the clout, that's why they always say my name
I'm only gettin' better, bitter bitch it ain't gon' change
Why you tryna hang around me, bitch, get off 'cause you ain't gang
You ain't gang, treat you like a stain
All my biz is straight, I'd still be good without the fame
I got so many cousins, aunts, uncles that I never knew
On me for my revenue, I'm big now like I'm 7'2""
New whip and my leather smooth, try me, I'ma play it cool
Windows down, AC blowin', 20 below, I'm extra cool
You lookin' fed up 'cause of my bread up, I keep my head to the sky
Run up, [?] and I'm back to [?] where I'm droppin' the fire
Who want it? Tell me, bitches, who blunted?
You ain't know my crew run it? All we see is blue hundreds
On my dash, 200, these bitches sad and can't run it
Ho I'm a star, you wanna walkthrough you better tell me who fundin'

[Verse 18: Crank Lucas]

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

[Verse 19: Chevy Woods & Wiz Khalifa]
Ay bitch, this a brand new chain
Put her in Vera Wang
She got a crazy top
I let her go insane
G-shit in my veins
Limited seats on my plane
Get to the country they know my name
I could pay for anything I'm ordering
Whether it's bitches, California weed, fourth down
Got 20 inches
I'm rolling up hella green by the pound
You wanna pinch this
Wondering what the stench is
Always played my position
We balling cause we the realest
...

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 20: Roy Purdy]
Just make sure to always stay true to who you are"", and I did that
Jeans black with a pink hat
Sorry, I don't wanna come to ya kickback
Oh no, so cold like Frozone
9-2-0, what I rep, that's home
Big racks, big facts, no foolery
Got 'em like ""God damn, man, who is he?""
It's me, ya boy Roy so crispy
Really had to go and hit 'em with the quick speed
Too fast, look left, look right
You ain't gon' see nothin' like me in sight
Hit my dance real quick, ouu, I just might
Wanna sleep on me? Okay, good night
I'm gone, new song comin' soon
Ya boy Roy really been up in the stu'
It's nothin' new, yeah, this what I do
Been makin' music way before all the views
Whi-white T with the white vans
Oh man, god damn, I'm fresh
Kickin', laid back, life's good, no stress
I don't gotta flex, you know I'm up next
Sike, bitch, I'm up now
I'm holdin' it down
I'm feelin' great
I cannot frown
""Who Run It"" remix
Just something light
Had to snap real quick, now I'm droppin' the mic
Okay

[Verse 21: Slim Jesus]
Ayy, ayy, gang
Y'all know how the fuck I'm rockin' man
I'm hearin' a whole lot of talk about who run this shit
I be countin' stacks
Who run Ohio, that's me
Which one of y'all hotter than me?
Leave the beat like a hundred degrees
And it's still all this ice on me
Who getting plays like me?
Who getting paid like me?
Y'all was not made like me
And I put that on my G's
Remember they hated on me
I knew all I needed was cheese
Ran it up and I blew it on jeans
Had to run it back up times three
None of y'all wanna be like me
Run around with them pipes like me
Fresh pair of Off-Whites on my feet
Gold chain on a Polo white tee
In a trap with a whole lot of P's
Smoking dope 'til we Vietnamese
I threw bro lil thirty
He threw like fifty to me
All of these rappers is broke
That shit be sickening to me
You blew the whole bag on the road
You look like a victim to me
I just pulled up in a foreign
And you got a Honda on E
All black tints on all my whips
'Cause I know they're looking for me
Just know wherever I go
It's a glizzy with me right up under the seat
I give a fuck what you claiming you is
You can get touched with the heat
I remember being irrelevant
Now I get bands for all of my feats
Remember totin' tourists
Now we got AR's that's chopping down trees
It's a fifty on bro and a thirty on me
You don't really really want the beef
You can talk that shit on the internet
Run up, get done up, get wrapped up in sheets
They was talking crazy last night
'Til a hundred shots hit they block
I don't even know who got hit with that shit
But we smoking all opps
Everywhere I go I'm with the gang
It's at least three or four of them Glocks
If you speaking on who run it, ain't say my name, you smoking on rocks
I'm in the street like fuck 12, bitch I'm off the Henny
You can find me with the gang 'cause I don't fuck with many
Them my brothers, if I'm busting they gon' dump it with me
They know I'm a threat and that's the reason they ain't fucking with me, gang

Niggas goin down fast like stop drop

[Verse 23: TA Double Dolla]
They say I'm bougie and cocky

Threw a bag at my baby mama here you go, go shopping
Every other day I'm waking up to new money
Gettin deposits in
From negative to positive
Dollar boy just landed
In the city of angels
...

[Verse 24: Idontknowjeffery]
Point me out to who run it
Fuckin' man or a woman
I kick they ass in the stomach until they vomit from it
Nigga I'm sick I'm bubonic and you and that bitch is platonic
Stab your ass in the stomach and clean the mess up with Comet
Fuck all that extra shit
I'm in the bed with a naked bitch and her head just twist like damn exorcist
What ya tryna posses me with
The way she suck my dick was an accident cause I ain't even have to ask the bitch
Nigga I'm stingy as hell
I'm face my hoes nigga I don't even pass the bitch
And I shit on niggas on accident like I ate some laxatives
Try to impress me with that bullshit turn him to an acronym
Nigga its Prick Harper
I'm a shit starter
And all that bullshit you talkin' make my dick harder
I treat a rapper like his father I don't text him I don't call him
I don't bother
Nigga I let the Glock solve problems

[Verse 25: Xavier Wulf]
These rappers ain't runnin' shit but ya bitch
Who, where she at?
She at the crib tryna cook me something every damn day
Told her ""bitch I do it better"" by myself go move away
Here to stay
Up from now until whenever the fuck I say
...
Well I could I ain't never had a juug but I had a blunt to finish
You rap niggas still capping
...
Pulled up with a bitch so thick I'ma leave a little bit early just to hit

[Verse 27: Jeremih]
Lil' mama give me head 'til I'm dead, I call it brainstormin'
You ain't even halfway 'Yonce, I could put a ring on it
Pop, country, rap, trap, punk, rock, I could still sing on it
On the block wit' niggas big as Shaq but I could still hang on it
3 story, no story, no Tory, this a different lane on 'em
Lane to lane, white ghost, red gust, that's a candy cane, homie
Everybody wanna be the king but who gon' make the claim for it
I'ma say me for the moment
[?]
So [?], I ain't scared or nothin'
Chicago made me a bear or somethin'
I just skydive, I'm so live, you could catch me comin' out the air or somethin'
Lost some niggas gettin' this money, still got a pocket full of dead homies
Got a bad bitch wit' a head on her
Versace robe, two bands for it
It's God's plan, I ain't playin' for it
I'm just tryna be the landlord
I came to fuck up the buildin'
Hitman, I'm gon' make a killin'
I'm used to shoppin' at Sears, now I be shoppin' wit Siri
Used to be stealin' cologne, now I be stealin' your bitches

[Bridge]
Yeah
Nah mean?
[?]
[?] slow it down, you know?
Go the other way on 'em

[Verse 28: Jeremih]
Yeah
Pull up to the Valley, car got no keys
Diamond pinky ring cost a low key
Make a play [?], you should proceed
Big ballin', put the money on the flo' seats
Bank account always doin' backflips
Used to have the walls and the matress
Numbers still the same since the old me
Don't get it fucked up, I ain't the old me
Who run it? Now who run it?
My pockets on cucumber
I'ma have yo' girl over
Have her speakin' boonomics
Got the Kevin Gates, I got that two phones, I got two numbers
Ain't talking YouTube numbers
I could take a few summers

[Verse 33: Dax]
Had to come here and enlighten
Had to come give you the facts, trapping is wack
You might get a stack
Your daughter at home, your mama still crying
Blacks in America dying
Trump in office, he wildin'
Droppin these bars for fun, we going to war
But look at the timing, buying
They put me in chains, confined me
I'm rapping the real but can't get a deal
These niggas is not replying
Why the system be falsifying?
They say that I might be crazy
They say that my shit too real
The reason that they cannot play me
Industry cannot detain me
A cross of Pac and Baby
I've been to hell and back, that's why they say they cannot save me
Ain't poppin' no pills, I stay in the field
These niggas is fakes, they mad that I'm real
I see that you broke, don't know how that feel
You gave up your life by signin' a deal
Might shout out to Kaep for taking a kneel
Might shout out to Jag for rappin the real
My bars is guns, they can't conceal
These niggas dumb
Not a rapper, I be in my own division
Save the world by 2020, nigga I be on a mission
I just started and I'm right exactly where I had envisioned
Niggas blind, that's why I rap, to clear their motherfucking vision
Fucking on the game
Fucking on you bitches who've been fucking for the fame
I've be getting rich and dodging niggas who ain't changed
Tried to tell my shooters, had to read [?] out the chain
With a bitty lil name, lil nigga you ain't gang
You not, circle small, like a dot
Keep it tight 'cause people like to come and try and make you fall
I've seen it all, it's fine
They'll try and stop your shine
They snakes, still smile up in your face but talk that shit behind, behind
I seen it all baby, watch out for these snakes in the grass
They sayin' just enough to your face to keep you happy
That way in case you do make it, they can say they been there
Ayy DJ cut the beat, cut the beat

[Bridge: Dax]
Hip hop is not dead and never left
It's just a book collectin' dust I found on the shelf
I don't care if you wanna read it or anybody else
'Cause I'll turn myself to Jesus and resurrect it myself

[Verse 34: 6ix9ine]
Yo, I usually don't do this
But you know what I'm saying
Had to come body bag this one time
Niggas really thought I was in jail or something
Momma didn't raise no hoe or something
I was really in the store bought a Snickers or something
I - I was trapping in the-in the way back and I got that
And I flip that and I really get that
But I told my mom ""I don't do that!""
But she was really there
And I told her that ""Yeah, I'm coming in,""
But she was like, ""Nah, don't come near""
And I was like, ""GED""
And I said, ""I flip that, really get that""
I whip that and I hit that and I-yeah
LA see you next week, Coachella I'm here today
But fuck that we here and we live wit' TR3YWAY
Fuck that umm
Cut it

Got this bad bitch with blonde hair, I call her Russian Cream
And I got that baby chopper, I'll rock your ass to sleep
Can't stand me, take a seat (ho), designer head to feet, yeah
Everything on fleek, Cartier on me, yeah
I dress like a geek, yeah, boy your swag is weak, yeah
That shit is so cheap, yeah, my shit overseas, yeah
I'm fly like a butterfly and I sting like a bee, yeah
Call me Glock Ali, yeah, diamonds fighting like Tina
Turner, bitch I turn up, Royal Rumble
Thirty niggas with me and you know they ready to burn you
Knuck if you buck, run up and you get done up
No I'm not from Louisville, but bitch I keep my slugger
Straight up out the jungle, ain't no talk or tussle
Got no time to scuffle, I'm 'bout my chips like Ruffles
Workin like a butler, ain't no more struggle
Tell these niggas catch up, tennis chains mustard
Ran up my racks, run and tell that
Ran through a bag and got that shit right back
These niggas ain't doing shit, these niggas ain't talkin' jack
You niggas ain't running shit, this chopper make you run a lap
Yeah
Glizzock

Hundred thousand my key or somethin'
Two hundred my Jeep or somethin'
Niggas broke as hell actin' like they don't know how to eat or somethin'
Miami Beach Louis sandals, know I got my heat or somethin'
At the condo, you can't get in unless you got a key or somethin'
Smokin' out the 440 and it smoke a P or somethin'
Took the doors off, ridin' through Cali in my Jeep stuntin'
Long as they print money it's gon' keep comin'
I know you hear my Jeep runnin'
I ain't pumpin' gas, they gon' keep pumpin'
Ride through the hood and they keep honkin'
People look at me and they see money
I'm a boss, d-money
Load em' people up, my phone gon' keep jumpin'
They like ""Ball, is it weed or is it d-money?""
Bankroll like street money
Walk in Neiman's, leave the Hellcat and the Jeep runnin

My bitch said she gon' leave me like she complete somethin'
Bitch, you [?] met you at 2:30 and fucked your ass at 3 somethin'
Who you run up on? Not us
I'ma take my own heat, shoot three or somethin'
Might be in the trap, call Jeep or somethin'
Might get Ball with a whole P or somethin'
Might be in SRT or somethin'
Krispy might make a bitch cream or somethin'
Cross that red line, get a beam or somethin'
Wake you up like you had a bad dream or somethin'
Who, Chief Sosa think he Rambo?
I was in the field with the lizard
Doing spinouts since the blizzard
Like Snoop Dogg ""What's the wiz-zard?""
Disappear on that bitch like a wizard
And I'm cuttin' real sharp like a scissor
Roll by so fast, Big Dipper
I'm in LA more than a Clipper
Balenciaga more than a owner
Bitch, we out here more than a corner
Smoke way more dope than a stoner
And I drink way more than Homer
I can see like Christopher Columbus
Juiceman, the trap house bunkin'
You niggas ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
King Sosa don't care about nothin'
F on my shirt, on my feet double Gs
Start gettin' F's in sixth grade, couldn't even get a couple B's
All for my habit, whats the fee? A couple G's
Aye lil' bitch, these Moncler, no need to buckle these
Aye lil' baby, these not me, no need to upload these
And when you hear that [?], bitch that's me up your street
And just make you think about when they put that thing up your teeth
Lil' nigga said up yo chest talkin' to me, up your speech

[Verse 40: Chief Keef & Ballout]
Pullin' off from Neiman's doin' donuts in the Jeep
Track [?] Look like Black Hawk flying out the street
Hopped out for twenty minutes for a backend
Seen your girlfriends tryna get back in
Hopped in the Hellcat, had to put the track in
Ball, you got the blues, why the fuck you blackin'?
Ball, you can rap, why you steady trappin'?
'Cause I get it for the L-O like Shawty nigga, tap in
Sosa, why you pay a thousand for that headband?
Because Ben Franklin is a dead man
Any time you see me, wonder that's that bread man
If he step in front his gun, then that's a brave man

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 41: Moneybagg Yo]
Pink and purple in my cup, I'm Lil Pump-in'
Trap jumpin' (like what, like what?)
Like some fingers, it's thumpin'
Who done it?
Pockets fat with bricks of hundreds, I'm Klump-in' (Sherman)
I run it
Headed to the top, like quickies I'm comin' (ugh ugh)
Bagg
Talkin' 'bout quickies, I'm comin'
Ugh ugh, yeah
2 Heartless, 2 Heartless, two of 'em
Get hit for lookin' suspicious (watch how you look)
Diamonds wet, they gon' wash the dishes
Sittin' in the coupe with the missus, Whitney
If you bad you can fuck her with me
I'm taking chances, risks (risks)
Learn how to dance, my wrist did (Breezy)
I'm like the Memphis Kendrick (Lamar)
I was broke, now I""m a rich kid (look at my shoes, watch me plug walk)
This new freezer cost right here sixty (sixty K, shout out to Icebox)
AP ring and watch Jordan Pippen (duo)
And you know I run this shit, pockets keep me limpin'
2 Heartless, 2 Heartless, two of 'em, yeah

[Verse 42: Skippa Da Flippa]
Flippa
I get trippy like three six
I just hit a bad bitch with my new bitch
I don't do Kel-Tec, FN can't miss
Souped up box Chevy came with a kill switch (kill out)
I stack bread, mister winners (stack it)
I drive a tank in the winter (kill 'em)
No L's, nigga I'm a winner
This year is not for beginners
These pair of [?] call 'em Sprinters
Seventy K for a new straight A
I'm havin' shooters, no mayday
Every day to me is more money Monday
And my neck is cold like I ate a sundae
Get up, stack the money, never switch up
A hundred for the Patty, know I stay lit up
I'm pushin' for greatness but I don't do sit-ups
And I love a bitch that can get my dick up
I been quiet but I can really start a riot
You can get it grilled or fried
Your favorite rapper be cappin' with lies
I call it burnt out and tied, therefore we don't have ties
Water on me, submarine
Break the pot, I cook up clean
What's the blue strip without greens
When it comes [?] I'm the king
I say I'm too blunt, I'm not mean
Good game from an old head, call him Sega
Ice talk crazy on the Razr
I keep it player, new crib got layers
It ain't 'bout paper, I'll talk to you later
I give you pimpin', but I stay drippin'
You small like a wiz then I ball like I'm Pippen
You be slippin', they call you Tristan
You tell the tea so I named you Lipton
Hundred bows, kicked a hundred doors
They cash me out then I bring a hundred more
New Rari came with Lambo doors
House in Berlin came with three stoves
She ride the dick, no Rodeo Drive
Hit you with a combo, you get two sides
Black excellence, I'm excellent
I bought the block back for the Nobel Prize
Pink slip shawty right now 'cause I'm on
You pop big shit now then it's on
Think smart, first get a call then a home
You don't need a loan, get a zone, get it gone
I'm on my ten flip now, get your own
AP two-tone freeze, honeycomb
I'm lightskinned, call me Kev Combs
And I get money, badda-bing badda-bom
I could count a whole hundred in your face
I got air, fuck a pair of human race
Walk in safe, look like a Chase
Dipped out my safe and it turned to a chase
You tryna be me, I bet you gon' fail
Big checks comin', now I check the mail
I'm thinkin' money, blue or green hundreds
House in the hills, it look like a whale's (whoa)
I could say somethin' but it ain't the time
It ain't on me if ain't mine, eliminate me with a lime
I got heart of a lion, if I said they ain't bitin' I'd be lyin'
Lowkey in a low-rider, I write mines, no ghostwriter
I be leanin' and lookin' for the new Spider
I'm on fire and my chains firefighter (Flippa)

[Verse 43: Cdot Honcho]
I paid a G for my sneakers bitch
These ain’t no regular Adidas, hah
Have fo'nem parked outside your shit
Like your shit an arena
I’m up on Hollywood Boulevard
Fo'nem with me, not a bodyguard
Try it, you know they be choppin' shit
Might turn this bitch to a lumberyard
I was the first one in SRT
And I drove that bitch like a bumper car
I got your bitch up on DVD
Ain’t got a heart, need another heart
Roc, he'll circle around your block
On point like he really can’t find a park
Pop out you only gon' see a spark
Police said they only seen a dart
I got ten K in my joggers, ayy
You don’t want problems
Five on your head, niggas gon' pop out your closet
Smokin' biscotti, too much gelato
Feel like I’m sitting on a rocket
Ain’t no more space in my pockets
Ain’t no more space in my closet either
I just be thinking 'bout profit
I'm in the coupe with a mamacita
She only good for the noggin
That bitch know she got a mouth on her
She eat me up then I’m out on her
No we don’t play with the police games
She know we put a route on her
Look I ain't shit, with another one
Nothing was given l ran it up, bitch

[Verse 44: Sauce Walka]
If I really want his body I'ma sleep in the grass
If I get my hands dirty I'ma wash 'em in gas
Get that gunpowder off me, roll a wood up, and laugh
'cause I'm really 'bout that murder, I'll smoke your ass
Pay a bitch to wrap you with a cord and choke your ass nigga
Yeah I could get on some evil shit
Rip out your heart like a demon shit
Send body parts to your people shit
Yeah I send your hands to your mama
I send your legs to your daddy
I send your eyes to your granny
I send your foot to your daughter
Fuck it, the label some horror
Fuck it, the label some saw
Granny playin' guitar, 'cause you ain't never ever comin' back no more
I got guns when it comes to the store
I got guns that you niggas can't order
I got guns that you never can borrow
I got guns that can still shoot good underwater
I got guns that can shoot through brick walls, I got guns that got night vision
I got guns that shoot hand grenades, I got handguns that hold fifty
I got guns with long barrels on 'em, look so ugly, shoot so pretty
I got guns in my bitch titties, moral is don't fuck with me
If it's an issue we see him 'bout it, if it's an issue we be about it
It ain't a question if we about it, it ain't a question if we about it
Master P, yeah I'm 'bout it 'bout it
'bout it 'bout it, 'bout it 'bout it, 'bout it
Ran up him with a shotty, ran up on him with a shotgun
Make him jump like a pop gun, let both kids play with pop guns
Like a needle I'ma pop somethin', like a football I'ma drop somethin'
Ooh-wee
Who done it? who done it?
Who done it? who done it? nigga
The kid done did, one and done nigga
Sorry for the Sauce 3
Who done it? who done it? me

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side (word, word, word)
Oh well, fuck 'em, dawg, we gon' see how hard they ride (huh, fuck 'em)
I get racks to go outside and I split it with the guys (outside)
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since, like, July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide (hah)
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us but I lied (hah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, ayy, look who I'm around, man
If I fucked up, I'ma be downtown, man
Fourth floor bound, man, that's if I get caught, man
Pushed me to the edge, so it really ain't my mothafuckin' fault
Man, I'm not to blame, man, this fuckin' industry is cutthroat
I'm not the same, man, and I could let you check the tag now
I'm rockin' name brand, I'm only chasin' after bags now
I got a game plan and I'm out here with the woo!

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
700, three high fives, look alive, look alive ('live)

[Bridge: Joyner Lucas]
508 all on my side, they gon' ride, they gon' ride
Nigga, this a homicide, oh my god, oh my god
I said I was gon' retire, bitch I lied, bitch I lied
I ain't got no fucking job, this my life, this my, wait—

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
All of y'all wishy and washy
All y'all my kids in a car seat
I take my dime to hibachi, we do 69 like Tekashi
Lyin' in the sand, too much time in your hands, I think I need to find you a hobby
God got a plan, hope that God hold your hand, I think I'm 'bout to catch me a body!
Tell all my teachers that I said I'm back on my G shit and I'm coming back to get even
I went on tour and got paid, now I'm back in the region, I let off this mac for no reason
You are now witnessing greatness, I'm practically preaching and this is the passion of Jesus
And all you basic motherfuckas are lacking achievement, and I've just been laughing and geekin'
Back to business, I got mad intentions, I ain't perfect, I done made some bad decisions
But it's competition, I'm a savage winning
You can have the digits, I'm a mathematician
I don't see you niggas, I've been lacking vision
You've been acting different, I've been acting distant
I'ma do some shit to bring me mad attention
You gon' do some shit that send me back to prison, whoa!
This is uncomfortable, you just keep putting your feet in a fire
I think my gun got a crush on you, boy, you 'bout to meet your secret admirer
How you do shit you don't wanna do? I do that shit just to keep me inspired
I used to hit it and leave when I wanted to, now I hit it and be sleepin' inside her, woo
Roll up on 'em when I pull up on 'em, put that motherfucking smoke up on 'em with that holy water
Joyner Lucas, I'm a holy mona leader motor runnin'
Man, too many niggas know about it, but I thought about it
Prayed about it to the Lord about it in the morning, but I gotta show 'em what it's all about and I'ma call 'em out
I ain't that nigga you could talk about, you better calm it down
Don't be tryna give me the runaround, I'ma shut 'em down god damn, wait

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive ('live)

[Verse 3: Rocky Badd]
Ayy, ayy
Look who I'm around man
A couple people switched, that's why you don't see 'em round man
Four four down man, know that that's a man down
I make bitches stand down then make them put they heads down
Only time you sendin' shots is when you sneak dissin'
Only time I'm on the block is when the bitches send chicken
I ain't trippin' on that nigga, he don't call unless it's business
I ain't trippin' on these bitches, once they eat they in they feelings
I ain't trippin' on no rapper that can't fight but in my business
Get to trippin' on that rapper, if she start I gotta finish
And if you fuck your niggas you can't call them boys your killers
'Cause they playin' with your feelings, mines ain't playin' with these niggas, haha
And I got shit they want but the shit they cannot buy
Bitches brazy on they Live but they barely go outside
I seen pussy in they eyes, I said fuck it, let' em slide
Told 'em I won't text these bitches, I just ho 'em, but I lied
I don't know why bitches tryin' while they funds lookin' tied
I can't trip because they lyin', let 'em take it up with God
These bitches plan winning, we gon' see how hard they grind
'Cause I push these bitches back every time I spit a line, haha

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive ('live)

Mama's gonna cry, man, I like to get motherfuckin' high
Man, you're not the guy, man

Ay, stay alive, stay alive (stay alive)
Stick on me right now, Skep I lie?
Think I'm just a rapper, they like ""Suspect is the guy""
'Cause they won't be expectin' it when we make gutter slide
Catch you pussy niggas by surprise

Now what will I do
Now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you
Now what will I do, now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you

Now love is gone

You would have been so rich with love but set it free
Now you want home but it's too late for me

229,229,Don't You Love Me,"[Round 1: Charlie Clips]
Wale dreads is something you gotta deal with
Wake Flocka, Chief Keef and the nigga in the wheelchair from Oz
You look like a thousand niggas and that's real shit
Now I don't know if you gang banging or you joking
But how is your best friend a Blood and you still Crip?
That gotta be one of the lamest groups
You fake ass Game and Snoop
See when you have a son
Here's some shit your little man gon' have to deal with
Now around the age of 6 he gon' think he's five
He gon' come home like, ""What up Blood?""
You gon' get mad and sit him in the corner real quick
So now you punishing your little man for trying to be his godfather and that ain't real shit
See you're a school bus driver, well stay in your lane before that steel spit
Cause when that tool out, that shit'll take your school out
If any nigga on your field trip
Damn I just threw a hail mary on like 1st and 10, that was a good call
You wanna play hardball brother? Pause
I'ma coach him like the Harbaugh Brothers
Let's talk football, if your man Shotgun play
I'm picking a shotgun play or I'ma grab the fifth
He run the wrong route and get picked off cause he's sad as shit
My bullets hit bird niggas like Flacco when he accurate
I use 49'ers to hit this crab tree like Kaepernick
Hold up, you know what?
I got a different way of telling your game
You'll see helicopters with hella choppers, I propeller your frame
They'll find Surf next to Suge with a shell in his brain
And then find O next to Ars' like I saw spelling his name
What you gon' tell a bunch of lies?
Like how I lost to Serius, right?
Well why you paying me to battle after that? Let's be serious, right
What I was supposed to do?
Go hard and take him serious, right?
Why should I? When he don't even spell the word ""serious"" right
Darell Jones, you're not a man, you get compared to a dyke
Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act, even your hair is alike
I'm in your Blood's house, putting the beam on ya kids, I be airing the pipe
It'll be little Blood's all over the pad like a bitch when her period light
Arsonal Da Pebble you not that nice
You just happen to battle the right people
Grind Time you was the man
Taking on midgets and thousands of white people
You play the bully role with them
And that's the shit that be getting me heated
Since you hate midgets, this next one is for my nigga Conceited
I dare him to front, I'ma put him in the corner, straight back him down
Poke your chin out, I got a Rocket, shit look like I'm packing Yao
Wait, slow it down, I just dissed him, bring it back around
I said I got a Rocket, shit look like I'm packing Yao
Everything I rap is wild, like why would you even doubt and test?
Ars', when it comes to bars, it's like I'm serving life
Why would you doubt the best?
When my niggas come home, they'll be all in his crib
Even the mouse gets stretched
So when that thing come off the ankle, bow, the whole house arrest
Speaking of house, that reminds me, I got a little prediction
You gon' flip my ""guess which room I'm in"" scheme
Say I'm fat, that I'm in the kitchen
Well just remember, you gotta flow my scheme, don't try to talk it
You could sink trying to play in that kitchen so don't you force it (faucet)
If I see your hand reaching for a can, I'ma draw a knife and start stabbing it
You ain't got a car, you broke my nigga, we know you cabbing it (cabinet)
Me and  your girl spooning cause she know I wear the iller gear
All I rock is white gold, Ars', you see silver? Where?
Silverware, white gold, spooning? Come on Ars' you so late
How you owning your own league but your breath stink, get your gold straight
Aye Hollow, I aim with the Scope, wash his mouth with an '08
So for brushing me wrong I'ma send him up to that cold gate (Colgate)
Aye UW, why you put a fucking Walkman against an iPod?
Fendi against Fubu? Polo to an Izod?
This ain't even my city, I got Jersey like ""My God!""
This the lightest I ever went, just imagine if I try hard
Round 1 man

[Round 1: Arsonal]
You original Lionz Den right?
You started out with Lux then with Smack
No matter where you rap you still fat
It started on your neck then your back
No matter where you rap you still fat
But you could have that...that ain't even what I'm mad at
Before I kill this nigga y'all, I'ma go off topic
And do a small display this day just to show off logic
URL tried to negotiate at the lowest rates like I don't know y'all pockets
That's why I gotta overcharge them niggas now just to show off my shit
See all that he said she said how Beasley throw off gossip
Paying Mook $20,000 to bring him back just to show off garbage
That's nonsense, they better pay homage
I gave y'all 2 battles, 4 million plus views y'all still getting dough off my shit
So all them subliminal disses like, ""Follow the innovator not the imitator""
That'll have a midget, Hitman and Smack refrigerator playing instigator
His defibrillator then hooked to a generator, I""ll get him later
Fuck being an entrepreneur
He gon' need 64 gigs like I'm trying to give him data
Meaning he gon' get this work, in the words of my Beloved
Lux threw me in the ring, why can't I quote the nigga? Fuck it...
But back to you, what I do with a Clip I load it, shoot it and I tuck it
Pull it back out, put it in your bitch lips and tell her to suck it
Now you wanted Arsonal, but Da Rebel is who you stuck with
That big clip spit shit, bullets kick flip through your Trukfit
I'll snatch your tongue out your esophagus cause you done ran enough lip
Nigga this match up is preposterous, obnoxious, I'm disgusted
You got a cartoon lifestyle with the heart of a Muppet
I put 3 fingers to your bitch like the top part of a trumpet
That bullshit got your memory clogged you better plunge before you flush it
Cause when my toy lit (toilet) it'll overflow
Yo' bathroom ain't the only thing that's congested
Now yeah, yeah you right, you did a house scheme, that was cool
But what you forgot to mention is out of all them rooms you drug a nigga through
You really made your first stop the kitchen
I know cause every time I'm in the kitchen, you in the kitchen
And the pots is missing
Niggas like ""Arsonal has returned""
No I been/bend back but without my posture shifting
I hit Charlie on the jack, I said, ""Charlie I got a proposition
It involves you getting paid while hundreds of people watch you spitting.""
Gave you detail after detail after detail but what I forgot to mention
Is that I'm your competition now go 'head and open your composition
Cause nigga I'm here to snatch every bit of confidence from your conscience
Since you trying to convince the world your accomplishments
I'm your consequences
I done traveled 'round this world, every state, all 7 continents
You've unable been able to complete that task, you so incompetent
And for the niggas who don't understand that word just go define the shit
But ""Haters pivot winners travel""
Where's your passport? You will never shine
If I had a chance I""ll battle Satan in Hell and in a masjid battle Farrakhan
Nigga I'll even give DIzaster a rematch in the middle of Lebanon
I'll battle cancer smoking a cigarette every time
What nigga? This little nine of mine, I'ma let it shine
Hide some food on your treadmill bet you Charlie chips he would never find
Then I use the same razor on your face that bitch
Britney Spears used to shave her head with right after Kevin fed her lines (Federline)
Now real talk you'll know when it's get the weapon time
Baby Loc's grab them Glocks, tell them Bloods go get your Wesson slime
Heaven's your hotel, my nigga Jesus said, ""It's your check in time.""
I'll have so many Jersey niggas lined up to get the pump
You'll think that bitch Hurricane Sandy hit us a second time
But these ain't no gas petro pumps
Only guns get drew, I call 'em Bletzo pumps
But when that pump on your tongue you should respect those punks
If it's a pump on my tongue than them some Retro dunks
Get it?
This what you wanted Clips?
Me to be disrespectful?
Put my dick in your niece fish tank and pour the water on your nephew
Yeah you said that, but who that sound like y'all?
I started this disrespect shit and I find it real ironic
That you gotta fuck a little girl fish tank to get a wet dick
But let me guess Clips
You must've gotten in some type of argument with your ex bitch
And your ex bitch is now X bitch
You mad cause you ain't on her guest list
Nigga dead it, let it go, forget it
You better charge it to the game, what you want? Credit or debit?
I cherish every bar I ever spit instead of regret it
This black history month, Clips got the dream, Ars' shot the King
You better hope your Cloretta's a medic
Tell that bitch get to operating cause you gon' be the doctor patient
What you trying to bring fat back?
On that back?
Nigga you gon' need your posture straightened
I'm just waiting on the green light, the thumbs up nigga the confirmation
Oh yeah next time you try to fuck that little girl fish tank
Please make sure they ain't no piranhas pacing
I say that to say this, no disrespect my nigga, not for nathan
But I got a date with the nastiest ugliest bitch on the planet
And I ain't trying to keep DNA mama waiting
Now Hollow....Hollow...oh Hollow....
You got a recycle fourth verse, yes cause it was over in three
But I did put on a show in OT
I put him in the ER for trying to go against me
Now I just told y'all I was the shooter without you knowing it, see
I said I did put on a show in OT put him in the ER
For trying to go against me
Nigga my shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
Think about this, you can't spell ""bars"" without putting that ""Ars"" in it
Nigga! Time motherfucker!

[Round 2: Charlie Clips]
Before I get into my 2nd round and I talk about how that steel clap
Ultimate Warrior had to have the battle in Newark
Cause Smack would've got his shit peel back
Damn you so gangsta Arsonal
On some G shit I could feel that
But if Trick Trick made you forget what a Shotgun is
Then what gun you gon' use to kill Smack?
You gave you $1,500 to battle Calicoe in the D, let's keep it real scrap
You was supposed to kill Calicoe
But Calicoe saved your life and that's real rap
You was so fucking scared you said, ""Watch them nigga cuz.""
And you was talking to a Blood, you gotta feel wack
You almost died for $1,500 now no wonder you wanna kill Smack
But stop worrying about URL or your league ain't gon' see no cash at all
See you be moving wrong David Stern, let me talk to you using basketball
Ars' look at your squad, they remind me of Charlotte, your whole team ass
Your bitch the mascot cause she'll bob cats whenever she need cash
I'll giver her cum 'til she gets tired of my sons/Suns; Steve Nash
No free dick, she gotta pay to see these balls; league pass
Ars' we squeeze mags and my whole clique dumping
You think Clips soft 'til I let a hollow tip off and get this shit jumping
If you drive by in a Spur, I'll be gunning at your rims, have that fifth busting
Put it on a windshield and shoot off the glass like Tim Duncan
Now that there was light, but I'ma school him
Cause I got a grown man delivery
You got a high school flow and your swag is elementary
You think you got the science, but your bars and the crowd lack chemistry
Rex exposed your government, then that Math made you history
But let's get back to elementary cause this is the best part
I catch little man on his way to school, run up let that tech spark
Bury him behind the school, under flowers he'll be a dead mark
So I give his kin a garden (kindergarten)
When I send him a shot where his head start
Get it? Kindergarten? I'm sorry Ars' this a man sport
You was pussy in high school, niggas robbed you for your Jansport
Your bitch was giving everybody top
And you was standing there with that queer look
She gave head 365, so we nicknamed her ""Yearbook""
Ars', look at what a year took, your career look funny to who
Your 30 battles to my 5 and I already made more money than you
Just remember, it's not the card you get, it's how you play it
Just remember, it's not the bars you spit, but how you say it
For example, I could take the words, ""Steeler fan""
And tell niggas how you been on my dick
Since Lionz Den and you still a fan
Or how your mother was broke with no AC, you had to steal a fan
Don't where your chain cause we black for that gold like we Steeler fans
Y'all could relax, that's just filler fam'
But these next lines gon' make niggas say ""Clips is the best""
Your bottom bitch got saggy titties, you gotta pick up her breasts
Everybody from Camden, Patterson, and Newark done been in her neck
That bitch throwing back more Jersey niggas then Mitchelle & Ness
Lady Arsonal? I gotta say her name with disgust
She'll wear a UW t-shirt while my niggas banging her guts
Then take the t-shirt off then give me neck so hard
I thought she lost her metro card the way she got charged for the bus (bust)
Listen Ars', I need nothing in this world, just my black duffle
Big gat, when that shit clap, it give me back trouble
You stole my Temple Run line that I said against Jones
You must've had app trouble
You love my wordplay well I don't play with words, you can ask Russel
For example Ars', you got goons, but will they clap it off?
Exactly that's what I thought, my nigga you ain't half the boss
I know Bloods too that'll face time to let that ratchet off
So once I phone 5 he coming to knock your Apple off
I nicknamed Lux, ""Coach K""
Cause without him we would've never heard of Duke
You could bring your niggas in packs Ars', I'll murder groups
You could try to run but I toke heat, when that burner shoot
I shoot all body parts, I even smoke feet, I'm Murda Mook
You ain't nothing but a bus ass Crip, on some G shit I really think 6 dirty
I run up on 6, send him 6, he'll die around 6:30
You think it's all funny like Martin
Til catch a bitch with that Tommy, let off a clip early
I don't give a fuck I'm cold to these hoes; Big Shirley
Once again, why would they put a motherfucking Walkman to an Ipod?
Why would the compare Fendi against Fubu? Or Gucci to a Izod?
Ars' you ain't shit my nigga, I'm thinking ""My God""
I fucked up, but fuck it you can have it my nigga...
Sike! I lied nigga!
....No I didn't time nigga

[Round 2: Arsonal]
If y'all know y'all history on Ars'
Y'all know my 2nd rounds always the heavy hitter
Second round's approached, all hay makers at this heavy nigga
How the fuck is you top 5 when battles, you got 5?
That's why I'm only paying you 2K for this 'bout cause you not live
But go 'head and lie tell all these other battle rappers you got 5
I bet you won't swear to God and put that on the day DNA pop died
Fuck you and him, I'm disrespectful, ain't no limit to what I might spit
I'm evil, I'm a pro with my Eagle, some say I'm Mike Vick
I load a light clip, I aim, I squeeze with a tight grip
You underpaid and all your guns rubber made, you like a dyke dick
But pause!
Gun in my draws hugging my right hip
Shoot him in the face, when eh fall give him a light kick
See man made gun so this man won't have to fight shit
I empty, reload and give your ass a second shot now that's a polite clip
Now grown man bars is something you gotta deal with
Funny thing is, the Harlem nigga who's slogan that is
He don't know nothing about no real shit
Clips what you know about real shit?
What you know about stealing utensils out your chemistry class
So you could finally whip that work to make that minimal cash?
Hurting inside expressing feelings with your pen and your pad
Putting in work but covering your face with your enemy flag
What you know about violations nigga? Penalty flags
Standing in circles for 3 minutes while niggas whipping your ass
Your fiend uncle stealing from you, steady spending your cash
And your best friend, your right hand man is hitting your stash
You don't know nothing cause you fronting
That ain't the life you accustomed to
Fuck is you? Your lifestyle's like Theo Huxtable
You wasn't that misfortuned kid, you ain't had to play that part to live
Your life was fancy and heart pump Braxton P. Hartnabrig
You talk the biz, you don't even know what a Larkin is
We was all born to die, but unlike you I was taught to live
Now they say the good Lord foresees
Our every move and our days to come
If you ever was an atheist or non believer
This battle should make you one
God said no man nor woman knows when the world to fall over
The Mayans predicted 12-21-12 said it was all over
But God seen way passed that
Which means he foresaw this ass whooping
Way before A.I. hit Jordan with that crossover
I said I long nose ya, my aim right now I'm shooting off the wrong shoulder
I shell 'em, derail 'em then tell 'em, yoooou!
Tested the wrong soldier
My chopper sound like when you pull a string on a lawnmower
So many Grapes in the building
All you see is the Color Purple you better call Oprah
You gon' need that loan from Ceelie nigga, throw your bread up
If I ever lend you cash and you talk back you get 85 when that lead bust
Translation: You gon' need a loan from Oprah, nigga throw your bread up
If I ever lend you cash and you talk back to get that Ocho headbutt
Now we in Newark right now, right?!
This ain't this nigga house
I tell my waiter, ""I need a container; I'm 'bout to take this nigga out.""
Your bitch do a lot of ass kissing and ass licking she probably ate this nigga out
But my bitch Nina, she do the same thing, she send 8, this nigga out
I tell him let's play hide and seek and then I make this nigga count to a hundred
70,000 as I rape this nigga spouse
I cut your eyelids off then I take you to the couch
And tell you, ""Don't believe me just watch nigga nigga nigga""
That's how you make it in the south
Now you ready to die?
Before you jump in that coffin go get your shirt fitted
I'm a lil' upset I ain't gon' be the first Newark nigga to kill DNA
Why? Cause Surf did it
But soon enough he'll figure that real niggas go in the dirt with it
Martin made it clear years ago that your Tommy ain't got no job
So how the fuck you gon' put in work with it?
Now I called you a sixth man so let's take it to the court
I will bang at your center, aim point precision
The way I travel, I could never play the point position
I'm on the block and the way I move the rock, the points fuck with me
Now what hand you roll up with? Bow! Take your blunt
Nigga that's what I call having joint custody
All I need is an ounce, 10 swishas a pen and a pad, my survival pack
All I wear is true's, gun in my Billie Jeans
Glove on my shooting hand like I'm Michael Jack
Motor Vehicle couldn't help you to get your title back
I been all over this globe repping US
Meaning the UW and every American need to Idol that
I keep two straps in both hands, four arms like when Goro flex
I'm tired of fucking random bitches, Charlie your hoe next
Your bitch don't adore your sex, she played with balls since birth
Before she learned to walk she did a Euro step
Now any battle rapper could've started a league
Mine successful cause I got the larger movement
You was mediocre against Tay Roc
But since then I've seen large improvement
I think mine all the way through, see my visuals got a sharper blueprint
This what happen when you put a high school dropout
Against the IQ of a Harvard student
It's all confusing, but it tickles my soul, it's somewhat amusing
You say you got me figured all out, so what I'm using
If I say I'm tired of hearing bars about drugs or what you shooting
I rip your shoulders out the socket take your arms and hammer
Now what you using?
I heard when Hollow went down he
Tried to start up a movement
But was snugged with the wrong inmate so now he losing
If I ran through all the New York and my title still undisputed
I got everything to gain so explain just what I'm losing
I will Clorox the stain in your brain soon as you lose it
Then take the 4 quarters and start the machine, that's how you do it
You ain't sick nigga, you a hypochondriac
I knew how they was gon' react, but you and everybody in this building
Still don't realize that I just took you to the laundromat
Now all these years DNA was missing a tooth
You ain't think that was a problem and wild?
You supposed to be the big brother figure to that nigga
You ain't acknowledge his smile?
Rumor has it his mom's retarded
That bitch must be or she just being childish and wild
For actually give you the responsibility
To try to be the daddy of her fatherless child
Now I ain't the big nose midwest nigga
To school niggas about their priorities
But I am that disrespectful black Newark nigga
That tell niggas just how they oughta be
In your face all out in public cause your death I want 'em all to see
That Cannon bend you, while seven camera angles is recording me
We gon' Youtube, Worldstar, Twitvid the whole crime
Eyewitness news, Fox, UPN the whole nine
Two big techs, I""m throwing bullets like it's two ticks left
I'm down 6 and I'm on the opposite goal line
I put my paw prints amoungst your offense
Nigga the whole line/lion
Your boss sprints I turn to John Lynch and give him a clothesline
I'm all tense, this crowd is convinced I'm earn mine
Then I'm a slice you across your center, you a do not turn sign
Now you 'bout six minutes closer to death,  you got about 3 minutes left
So I advise you pray to your worshipper and take a deep breath
Cause in this last round of bars, I'ma do a whole lot of exposing you
Wait...I could hear his heartbeat, mannnn that's what it's supposed to do
My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
You can't spell bars without putting that Ars' in it

[Round 3: Charlie Clips]
Shout out to my brother DNA, one of the best battle rappers alive
When niggas say that I celebrate, I pop a bottle give my nigga a five
Buy two cars, throw him the keys to one and just tell him to drive
When he was running around lost
I'm the one who showed him how to survive
That's real brother shit, but you and Surf is on some other shit
Y'all ain't even in the same gang, y'all banging for some other Crips
Ya'll don't even fuck with each other
But y'all be pumping all this brother shit
What's up with your real brother, Ars'?
Oh yeah he running with Joe Budden's clique
So we ain't ever see Treach or Redman get treated like a sucka
But that's the only two niggas out of Jersey, what about the others?
Cause if you got beef with Joe Buddens and he's fucking with your brother
Then it sounds like to me you got a family full of suckas
I could see mama Arsonal texting his phone
""Hey baby come over for supper.""
He walk in with an attitude cause the first person he spot is his brother
On his way to wash his hands in the bathroom, what did he discover?
A woman kissing on Joe Budden's neck and it's ya mother!
Everybody in your family likes Joe Budden's Ars'/arse
I'm sorry y'all I gotta him him where it hurt
You used to be the million view man now your view is in the dirt
Your career's taking a fall and to make matters worse
Buddens took your brother out your life and then he just recruited Surf
Aye Tsunami where you at?
I got some information
It might get you a little heated
I don't need to slow it down, put it in subtitles
I don't even need to repeat it
After this call my phone on some G shit, you need it
It's about a conversation that this snake nigga had with Conceited
See I know who said you know what about you know who
But let's keep that between me and you
What happened Ars'? These bars getting a little close to you?
I could hear your heart beating, that's what the fuck it's supposed to do!
I just wanted to see your face when all them personal hit
But let's get back to these bars, I don't do all this personal shit
If I catch your aunt lamping in her living room
I'ma blow her brains all over the couch
But wait don't try to guess which room I'm in
Cause this time I'm all over the house
I'm even in your backyard, that's the the spot I'ma ditch my weed out
Got a special spit I bag up grass, call that my tree house
Ars' you claiming how you moving keys, you gotta stop it
If you got keys they always to a door, but I ain't trying to knock it
You said you got knocked for serving an addict but where that case went?
How are you the best seller
And you ain't know what base meant/Basement?
I said look at your swag, you got the type of style that get your moms tight
Big blade, I get 6'8"" like Lebron height
Nigga I kill you with all filler, Arsonal this gon' be a long night
Cause you was suited before I got to the punch, this is prom night
You know what, Newark I appreciate the love
I ain't gon' go past the speed limit
Aye Jones that's how you murder a nigga in less than three minutes
Light!

[Round 3: Arsonal]
Is the Bloods and the Crips in the building?
All the hoods
Is the neutral niggas in the build?
And all them good
See even uptown in the building, Uptown that's a Harlem hood
And since I'm battling a nigga from Uptown
I'ma beat you like the best nigga from Harlem would
""And you gon' love it""
All third verse
With you, I'm lacking patience, so I gotta go back to basics
False accusations will leave your face with cross interactions
I'm ready to eat, but like a pregnant bitch, see I been having cravings
You coming at me for the same reasons Goliath tried to go after David
To make a statement
But what you talking ain't speaking louder than the actions that you lacking
If you don't iron out these problems
Then that increases the chances of you slacking
But you going for the belt
Which means to me that you just headed for your casket
This your funeral I just put your dress pants on you
Now here's your full metal jacket
Now I don't need a knife or a gun to kill you Clips
I know how to hunt smart
Crossbow action pierce his face from 100 yards with one dart
This the shakedown once you breakdown nigga you gon' need a jump start
Cause that battery DNA put in your back ain't stronger than John Q son heart
Now let's rewind back to high school, I'm in a cab, before lunch start
Hiding from the detectives that's patrolling in un-marks
Skip a few years, let's fast forward to the fun part
Ain't no Idaho Potato on the barrel when my gun bark
Fuck a potato nigga my barrel got a mango beak
See I'm Frank Lucas in Harlem soon as Tango speak
Put the metal all in your face, give him Kano cheek
Your man Mook was smoking a hookah out of Django feet
I smoke sour, let a nigga think my lango sweet
I know sign language but think my Ruger ain't gon' speak
I meet you anywhere in Harlem nigga, nigga name your street
Grab Lebron, Bosh and D. Wade, you better bring your Heat
Now I'm like Mayweather to this battle rap I would say y'all Zab
But he had some good bouts and y'all fights stay all bad
You can't contest with what's in AR pack, make my AR mad
So I can murder you then do an interview telling on myself like I'm AR-Ab
You did a house scheme, that was cool
But that just proves you don't get out a lot
Now I'm from Newark, this the stolen car capital right?
Niggas got choppers out the sunroof coming round the spot
Now I'm confused on how you drug a nigga through all these rooms
When you and DNA live in a one bedroom right down the block
But now I get it, you made all that shit up because it sounded hot
Well I got a scheme for you Clips, what stole car I'm in?
High mileage and the engine is a monster
Suge already told y'all he the shooter and the driver
But what he failed to mention is that nigga is a boxer
So if I'm with a fat nigga with quick hands, a true Street Fighter
What car I'm in? I'm whipping in an E. Honda
Hold on, all third verse
What stolen car I'm in now?
Snatch bar pop the lock and I call my boys over
It's not a Coupe it's a four door but your poor stores all on my toy soldiers
She's a kinky little bitch, got a vibrator with four motors
Stick it in her pussy and left it on your backseat purposely
So you can smell that toy odor (Toyota)
I mean I'm great, I'm A.R.S.O., you tried to steal my style like a clepto
Well I been at this for awhile I guess I'm retro
See my last name is Jones but with no relations to Esco
You draw nigga, my gun get Drew, I called it Bledsoe
But the fact of the matter, if I don't get the respect that I'm after
The whole cake get the rest of the batter
Then I gotta flex on this rapper
What car I pull off to the face off in?
I was trying to see how that Lambo' feel it's like I ref for the Packers
Fuck a body bag I put this big nigga in a Hefty bag
Ship him down to Atlanta overnight, spend that extra cash
Comeback to New York to disrespect your dad
Tell him you'll find your son's remains in the south pa(w)
Cause he done made this lefty mad
I visualize a boxing gym, Clips gon' be my heavy bag
I dip, dip, right hook, dip, hook then a lefty jab
This gang bang central more red and blue than a Pepsi ad
I paid a million dues nigga you need this million views very bad
Now let's get personal, let's compare resumes
You got 5 battles, 4 mixtapes, with a Lionz Den/Smack background
I got both those, plus King Of The Dot, Don't Flop
UW, Grind Time, using all that background
My first bout ever was against a nigga named Hollyhood
He caught ever clip out that Arsonal that I had ready to body Goodz
Second time round same stage onto the next man
Lux pulled a fully auto at me when he know how quick that Tec jam
3rd and 4th was at the Fight Klub and a pot was a pretty penny
It was an elimination process so I took shots instead of sipping Remy
I used all hollow heads on your boy Hollow head my trigger friendly
When it rain slugs, you better borrow that umbrella from Mr. Bently
Now my fifth battle was in the Bronx
But I'd rather had kilt that Queens nigga
Gladiators, Ars' vers' Rich, the skinny leg jean nigga
Left hook known to lean niggas
And when I'm in that Shotgun formation I throw bullets
To knock skin off your dog back I call that playbook a flea flicker
These all bars, 6th battle, oh I passed you already
Sixth battle over in Grind Time my first trip to the west coast
I battled a white boy he was OK with words that's Okwerdz, yes folks
7th battle Conceited, he was easily defeated
My 8th battle was a Dizaster, the cops came and I couldn't believe it
Now that's nine whole battles, nope 8
Before I ever stepped foot on a URL stage
Number 9 was against Holla, no nine though, I had a 12 gauge
That's when a devil inside came out and all Hell raised
Shooting a chopper is the only reason a rapper would ever say Darell wave
Battle 10 was up in Canada, King Of The Dot against Pat Stay
He's a sucka and he speak to the cops
Battle 11 out in Philly, Jersey we in the spot
I was hoping that E. Ness gave me a reason to pop
So I spoke on his dead daddy and how he in a box
Battle 12 against a lost nigga in need of his pops
Out in Detroit, he expected me to flee from the spot
Same nigga who said he was skinny dipping with six bitches
Aye Ripley, do you believe it or not?
But my 13th battle is when I finally get a home game
Against a nigga named T-Rex who couldn't protect his own chains
His man Mook was doing his own thing, talking which is so lame
So Swag choked him and said, ""This Newark nigga
You'll lose here (hair) with or without the Rogaine.""
My 14th battle against Illmac', a no name
So I cut his ass like Chinese chicken without the Lo Mein
15th battle with Math Hoffa, an old lame
He like, ""Ars' what you holding up your fifth for?""
What I'm holding up my fifth for? Nigga I think I'm Broman
16th battle out in London, me and Shotty Horroh going round for round
Where's your passport? Oh you ain't never get overseas money
So y'all could never go pound for pound
17th battle out in Europe and you know I hate midgets
So I shot the Crome, I tossed it, you the Clip that came with it
So this make 18 to your 6?
And y'all thought Clips was my best match up?
That's 54 rounds to 16, not 18 cause he had a one rounder versus X-Factor
So in a battle rap war zone
How can y'all compare Clips to the best rapper?
When every battle this nigga had y'all gave him 7 months to rest after?
Nigga in a shootout would you rather 16 bullets or 54 and some?
A whole Arsonal to spray a one Charlie Clip in your handgun
Nigga when my hammer drawn cut the cameras on
Let's tape the man one
Cause Junior M.A.F.I.A. had them cameras on, pointed at Cam'Ron
And we seen Cam' run
Now I ain't ever seen Redman or Treach get treated like a sucka
But I did see Cam' and Jim Jones both get ran out the Rucker
Now question, why oh why did Cam' not do Junior M.A.F.I.A
Like he did Mitch in the closing scenes of Paid In Full?
I mean why he wasn't acting like Rico then?
Started running round like a raging bull
Answer? Cause you Harlem niggas is pussy
That's one of the cards that I hate to pull
But since we battling a Harlem nigga that's pussy
That's one of the cards that you made me pull
Now sweetheart I know I'm killing this nigga I disrespected you, I apologize
So I'ma go have ma a Coke and a smile and treat you to some dollar fries
Cause I'ma quadruple what I paid this nigga
For them 3 rounds of all kind of lies
Soon as they edit, upload this video to Youtube and I click ""monetize""
Nigga your life ain't worth the tag on my motherfucking shoe
I put all this together, that you motherfucking knew
So accepting those 2 racks for me to kill you
Is something you should never motherfucking do
Especially when you know I'm getting paid off of every motherfucking view
My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
You can't spell ""bars"" without putting that ""Ars"" in it
Time nigga!
Sike I lied nigga!
You can no longer eat Big Mac's with fries nigga
I'm at your front door with a big mac like ""Surprise nigga!""
February 17th, 2013 Clips died nigga
Your bitch be hoeing around, she hoeing 'round when she slob niggas
Three words before that fat bitch suck dick
I'm Going Down she Mary J. Blige niggas
Now I'm a refugee without Wyclef, Lauryn Hill and Pras nigga
I just wild on this nigga, don't cry nigga

230,230,All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You,"It was a rainy night
When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat

So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right

He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree

Don't try to find me
Please don't you dare
Just live in my memory
You'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

Whoa, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes

I said, ""Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa
Was the one little thing that you can""

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, baby, want me too

All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long

All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew","['it', 'be', 'a', 'rainy', 'night', 'when', 'he', 'come', 'into', 'sight', 'stand', 'by', 'the', 'road', 'with', 'no', 'umbrella', 'no', 'coat', 'so', 'i', 'pull', 'up', 'along', 'side', 'and', 'i', 'offer', 'him', 'a', 'ride', 'he', 'accept', 'with', 'a', 'smile', 'so', 'we', 'drive', 'for', 'a', 'while', 'i', 'didnt', 'ask', 'him', 'his', 'name', 'this', 'lonely', 'boy', 'in', 'the', 'rain', 'fate', 'tell', 'me', 'its', 'right', 'be', 'this', 'love', 'at', 'first', 'sight', 'please', 'dont', 'make', 'it', 'wrong', 'just', 'stay', 'for', 'a', 'night', 'all', 'i', 'wanna', 'do', 'be', 'make', 'love', 'to', 'you', 'say', 'you', 'will', 'you', 'want', 'me', 'too', 'all', 'i', 'wanna', 'do', 'be', 'make', 'love', 'to', 'you', 'i', 'get', 'love', 'arm', 'to', 'hold', 'onto', 'so', 'we', 'find', 'this', 'hotel', 'it', 'be', 'a', 'place', 'i', 'know', 'well', 'we', 'make', 'magic', 'that', 'night', 'oh', 'he', 'do', 'everything', 'right', 'he', 'bring', 'the', 'woman', 'out', 'of', 'me', 'so', 'many', 'time', 'easily', 'and', 'in', 'the', 'morning', 'when', 'he', 'wake', 'all', 'i', 'leave', 'him', 'be', 'a', 'note', 'i', 'tell', 'him', 'i', 'be', 'the', 'flower', 'you', 'be', 'the', 'seed', 'we', 'walk', 'in', 'the', 'garden', 'we', 'plant', 'a', 'tree', 'dont', 'try', 'to', 'find', 'me', 'please', 'dont', 'you', 'dare', 'just', 'live', 'in', 'my', 'memory', 'youll', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'all', 'i', 'wanna', 'do', 'be', 'make', 'love', 'to', 'you', 'one', 'night', 'of', 'love', 'be', 'all', 'we', 'know', 'all', 'i', 'wanna', 'do', 'be', 'make', 'love', 'to', 'you', 'i', 'get', 'love', 'arm', 'to', 'hold', 'onto', 'whoa', 'oh', 'we', 'make', 'love', 'love', 'like', 'strangers', 'all', 'night', 'long', 'we', 'make', 'love', 'then', 'it', 'happen', 'one', 'day', 'we', 'come', 'round', 'the', 'same', 'way', 'you', 'can', 'imagine', 'his', 'surprise', 'when', 'he', 'saw', 'his', 'own', 'eye', 'i', 'say', 'please', 'please', 'understand', 'im', 'in', 'love', 'with', 'another', 'man', 'and', 'what', 'he', 'couldnt', 'give', 'me', 'oh', 'whoa', 'be', 'the', 'one', 'little', 'thing', 'that', 'you', 'can', 'all', 'i', 'wanna', 'do', 'be', 'make', 'love', 'to', 'you', 'one', 'night', 'of', 'love', 'be', 'all', 'we', 'know', 'all', 'i', 'wanna', 'do', 'be', 'make', 'love', 'to', 'you', 'come', 'on', 'say', 'you', 'will', 'you', 'want', 'me', 'too', 'all', 'i', 'wanna', 'do', 'be', 'make', 'love', 'to', 'you', 'one', 'night', 'of', 'love', 'be', 'all', 'we', 'know', 'all', 'i', 'wanna', 'do', 'be', 'make', 'love', 'to', 'you', 'say', 'you', 'will', 'baby', 'want', 'me', 'too', 'all', 'night', 'long', 'all', 'night', 'long', 'all', 'night', 'long', 'all', 'night', 'long', 'all', 'i', 'wanna', 'do', 'all', 'i', 'wanna', 'do', 'all', 'i', 'wanna', 'do', 'all', 'i', 'wanna', 'do', 'all', 'i', 'wanna', 'do', 'be', 'make', 'love', 'to', 'you', 'one', 'night', 'of', 'love', 'be', 'all', 'we', 'know']",401,Heart,Heart,1990,"[98, 81, 59, 53, 43, 31, 21, 11, 6, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 18, 26, 41, 57]",20,All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You,https://open.spotify.com/track/5YjKdeES9QRJ8NmF4Xc8pV,5YjKdeES9QRJ8NmF4Xc8pV,spotify:track:5YjKdeES9QRJ8NmF4Xc8pV,Brigade,5CuSWXFhWielWXrXK8Sd8m,spotify:album:5CuSWXFhWielWXrXK8Sd8m,Heart,34jw2BbxjoYalTp8cJFCPv,spotify:artist:34jw2BbxjoYalTp8cJFCPv,310.893,13.0,65.0,1990-03-25,0.626,0.746,7.0,-8.832,1.0,0.0282,0.16,0.0,0.0618,0.8,102.896,"['album rock', 'classic rock', 'hard rock', 'heartland rock', 'mellow gold', 'new wave pop', 'pop rock', 'rock', 'soft rock']",[],1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.24900000000000003
231,231,I'm Never Gonna Give You Up,"[Verse 1 - Tonedeff]
Can you feel the speed coming? The beats humming
You need something to keep your knees buckling?
Keep frontin', you'll be duckin from these huntin' obese gunmen
Airing out these fuckin' MCs puffin', so breath some in
See each one of my words is just stunningly stern
And it's funny you learn through action, not example
That's exactly why I have to smack you
Learn that {smack, smack} Learn it again {smack} got it now?
Didn't ya know that Tonedeff can flow fast enough to mow Sonic down?
Well, I'm on it; shower your senses, power defenses up
If you don't wanna get offended, or else it's death and
A negative attendance in the census when I render you senseless
I'm the veteran that was sent with a vengeance
That's leaving you with a set of bent wrists
And a dented cleft chin, left with a horsejaw
Prolly gonna need a veterinarian or a dentist
Better get a move on; call U-Haul and troop on to Sioux Falls
With blue balls; you all really think you're ill?
Until we're just sharing the bill with you all and we're too raw
Who's stalling? Cause I done never held it back man
Step or take your last stand while we enact raps to packed jams
Idiot niggas, figure they're quicker 'til the maniac
Is leaving them with one shoulder missing like it's Flashdance
Can't stand these motherfuckers that can't rap
Tonedeff and Stan, instrumental like Sam Ash
Fuck a bitch until her pussy cat naps
Y'all niggas are pretty in pink
And you been chillin with the Brat Pack
Fact is, my stats kick your ass bitch
You're too average to consider surpassing
The task is tedious, really, this beat is just feeding me
You thought Gonzalez was Speedy!

[Hook]
Do you feel the need for speed?
Indeed ya do, we need ya to
Clear the way to speed ya through
Can you feel the velocity? Just hold tight
Bare witness to what future emcees will flow like

[Verse Two: Substantial]
You're wacker than Ja Rule, we fast and furious like Vin Diesel
Ink penetrates the papyrus, my pen's lethal
Sookie, Sookie you rookie; goodie, goodie, we been evil
Fuck one-on-one! Tone and I take ten people
To even up the odds cause you and your friends feeble
Styles been played like movies with ten sequels
(Do you love hip-hop?) Does Eminem offend people?
Well, so do we, so absolutely nothing's what you're showing me
Vocally magnificent; what you want is insignificant
In the big picture, bitch nigga, you're so sensitive
Gonna squirt some, I hurt one or two persons before the verse done
Your mom be sucking the girth numb, beat it up and made her cum
E Famm making you nerds run; when I get the mic, it's curtains
If you don't like it when your earth's done blow me homey
Hold that mouth full of cock sauce and a bozack
UV and E til I got wack that's never homey know that

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 3 - Tonedeff]
Say what you want, but don't ever claim that you want it
Stay in the closet or you'll sustain so much pain
That you'll vomit solid objects you never swallowed
Like hollow organs, you'll cough up dried esauphagus knots and notches
We're the marvelous two that are part of the crew
That came to astonish, The Plague is brolic
Scrape your face with abrasive cleanser, say that we're raining comet
Fame's a promise you'll never fulfill, I'll just set up the kill
Substantial lances in your neck, and then sets your head on a hill
Really, for the world to see, everybody wanna get busy
Until they really gotta twirl with me; I score with ease
And floor your team I'm sure you dream of fuckin'
If weren't for your ball disease, you'd prolly skeez a broad or three
But all of 'em see that you ain't nothing but a poor MC
So, if you're looking for your pride, and a reason to die
In the blink of an
Eye, then keep in mind that they all with me
Now, hold your screams in, you don't wanna play in the court
The kings in From Newport to Kingston
I'll give you more defeats in wars than Normandy
Complete with hordes of soldiers beefin'
Keep your orders straight, cause sweepin me is more than fate could even orchestrate
Erasin more pieces of you than your whore's abortion takes

[Verse 4 - Substantial]
(Substantial, why you rap so slow?) I got asthma
Give me a second... lets see if I can rap faster
I'm smarter, harder; spit quicker, stronger
Even my dick's bigger, longer
In fact it sucks to be you, but what can we do?
You're a weaker, sweeter, poster-boy wussie
Who needs a hug cause you're pussy
You stank pot, thou reek of skank twat
My speech is flame; hot E weak? I think not
We link and bang spots, we drink to slain cops
Who were crooked; the little props I got? I fucking took it
Then spat on my doubters and shattered these cowards' glass jaws
By ripping up rap tours, whether little or no audience
Killed it a capella, even killed it to accordions
Not a battle rapper, backpacker, bitch-smacker thug
Just someone who could whip your ass but would rather show you love
So any further sleeping on me is not recommended
We'll never be fam if you haven't already been befriended

No magic carpet, no genie, no shoes on my feet
Will I wake up from this nightmare
A fear that chills me to the bone
Though I may be one of many
I feel so all alone

We are the children of the night
We won't go down without a fight
Our voices strong, our futures bright
And thanks to what we've learned from you
We've grown into the children of the night

Left by my father with only this scar on my face
Told by my mother that no, you were just a mistake
I have tasted my own hunger
Sold my body to survive
So they'll pay to scratch the surface
But they can't touch what's inside

We are the children of the night
We won't go down without a fight
Our voices strong, our futures bright
And thanks to what we've learned from you
We've grown into the children of the night

How I long for something better
Than this life I know too well
Lord I know I'm bound for heaven
Cause I've done my time in hell

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing... I said nothing can take away these blues

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Verse 2]
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me?
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

On the half shell, they're the heroes four
In this day and age who could ask for more?
The crime wave is high with muggings mysterious
All police and detectives are furious
Cause they can't find the source
Of this lethally evil force
This is serious so give me a quarter
I was a witness, get me a reporter!
Call April O'Neil in on this case, and
You'd better hurry up, there's no time to waste!
We need help, like quick, on the double
Have pity on the city, man it's in trouble!
We need heroes like the Lone Ranger
When Tonto came pronto, when there was danger
They didn't say they'd be there in half an hour
Cause they displayed...Turtle Power!

Now our ace reporter was hot on the trail
Determined to put these crooks in jail
She spied the bad guys and saw what happened
But before she knew it, she fell in a trap and got caught!
Yeah, she was all alone
With no friends, and no phone
Now this was beyond her worst dreams
Cause she was cornered by some wayward teens
Headed by Shredder they were anything but good
Misguided, unloved, they called them The Foot
They could terrorize and be angry youths, and
They mugged the people. Who needed proof?
Then from out of the dark came an awesome sound!
Shouted ""Cowabunga!"" as they hit the ground
From the field of weeds the heroes rescued the flower
Cause they possessed...Turtle Power!

And find the strength to do what's right?
That's TURTLE POWER!

[Verse 3]
Heroes on a half shell, they're on a mission
When there's a battle got the enemy wishin'
That they stayed at home, instead of fightin'
These ninja masters with moves like lightnin'
They were once normal, but now they're mutants
Splinter's the teacher so they are the students
Leonardo, Michaelangelo, and Donatello
Make up the team with one other fellow
Raphael. He's the leader of the group
Transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop
Pizza's the food that's sure to please
These ninjas are into pepperoni and cheese
Back to the story, it's not hard to find
Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind
Those are the words that their master instructed
But a letter from Shredder has Splinter abducted
That was the last straw, spring into action
Step on The Foot, now they're gonna lose traction
Now this is for real, so you fight for justice
Your shell is hard so you shout, ""They can't dust us off!
Like some old coffee table.""
Since you've been born you've been willing and able
To defeat the sneak, protect the weak
Fight for rights and your freedom to speak
Now the villain is chillin' so you make a stand
Back to the wall, put your sword in your hand
Remember the words of your teacher, your master:
Evil moves fast, but good moves faster
Than light, shining for your illumination
Good versus evil equals confrontation
So when you're in trouble
Don't give in and go sour
Try to rely on YOUR...Turtle Power!

An echo of a perfect love that ended wrong

I'll see you in my dreams
There we'll be safe tonight from the lonely days of memory
I'll see you in my dreams, oh

It tries to make your memory fade, but I won't let it end
Let the sun go down, so I can drift away
Let me close my eyes and live another day

You keep comin'
You keep comin' back
You keep comin' back for more

I'll see you in my dreams
There we'll be safe tonight from the lonely days of memory
I'll see you in my dreams, oh

The truth, oh it's there for you to see
Sometimes it's painful to be on your own, on your own

I'll see you in my dreams

I'll see you in my dreams

Kickin' so hard they can feel it way back in Mississippi
Yeah, like that; aw, yeah, like that

There's so much I can do (only wanna please ya), yeah
You say you care for me, but you don't act that way

Just when I try to prove what I can do for you
I feel like I'm wasting my time (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
[Raphael Saadiq]

There's got to be a way
I'm thinking every day
C'mon, girl, please give me a clue
Tell 'em, Wayne...

[D'wayne Wiggins]
Just because he drives a Porsche (yeah), and girl, I drive a Nova
What about the man inside? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, if that is what you're into
Why don't you let me know
Instead of always giving me the blues

[Michel'le - Verse Two] (Dr. Dre)
You said you would treat me right
And I'd never be alone
*talking* But men'll say anything
Just to try to take you home (Yeah, I know that's right)
But don't get your hopes too high
Cause I've got to keep it tight
And that's the way it will stay
Until I feel it's right (Oh, is that right?)

Mennn...
(Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?)
Runnin the same ol' sayin
(Yo, you comin over? I PROMISE I won't try anything)

Just ask MEEEEEEEE...
And I'll say I'm -

[Dr. Dre]
Nicety, or whatever you wanna call it
Ask my opinion and I think that all it is
Is just an excuse to givin the boots
For dollar and cents, and remain innocent
Dre with the Ruthless Attack, check it
Cause all that you talkin about ain't Jack!
Step off of that, try a new approach
You get smoked because I ain't no joke
Yeah, yeah...

You wanna step to me, groove me
I know you wanna do me
Come on now, fellas, don't fight

I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see
I can see right through you
I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see
I can see right through you

[Verse 1]
A dream's a dream and I'm wishing on a star
So through the darkness, show me who you are
A dream's a dream and I'm wishing on a star
So through the darkness, show me who you are
I have a picture, a thought in mind
Now it's time to realise
This is something you should analyse
In your mind

[Chorus]
Are you dreaming, wishing on a star?
A dream's a dream, and so a star
So through the darkness, show me who you are
Are you dreaming, wishing on a star?
A dream's a dream, and so a star
So through the darkness, show me who you are

[Verse 2]
Now as I see the things in front of me
Open my arms and welcome you
That hoping this dream will come true
So many rivers to cross
Somehow you could get lost
But by the time I'm through
I can see right through you

[Hook]
I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see
I can see right through you
I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see
I can see right through you

[Chorus]
Are you dreaming, wishing on a star?
A dream's a dream, and so a star
So through the darkness, show me who you are
Are you dreaming, wishing on a star?
A dream's a dream, and so a star
So through the darkness, show me who you are

[Bridge]
Now I can see all these things in front of me
I'll open my arms and welcome you
And I hope that this dream will come true

I don't know why your feelings are changing but I've seen it in your face
And all those times when our lips were kissing, our tongues were telling lies
And all those signs I've been missing right there in your eyes

So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye

I sometimes feel when we're together baby, everything has turned out wrong
And I know you feel exactly the same way but still we carry on
I've been waiting up by the window watching these cars go by
And I tell myself that I'll go through the motions for the last time tonight

So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye

Now I'm watching the fumes foul up the sunrise, I'm watching the light fade away
And I'm hoping tonight that I'll open the door, and you'll stand here and say

Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you

I remember the day
It was oh so sad
She was the sweetest dearest friend I ever had
She could talk to me almost anytime
And at the end of my day
I felt fine

Her mother broke the news to my heart
She said theyre leaving
And now I'm torn all apart
I think I'll never forget that day
And for you, girl
This is all I have to say

Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you

I had a dream
Me, myself and I
You were my girl
And of course I was your guy
We were together forever in love for life
And now it don't seem so very nice

Forever to me was short but sweet
You never let me down
You kept me on my feet
Now today all I have to say
Take it out, girl
And try to find a way

Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you

Believe it or not
I can't get over you
You are my everything
What a dream come true
What I feel for you is really hard to explain
I'm in love, girl
I'll never feel the same

You and me can save our love
We'll be together one day
Like hand in glove
All I have to say is
I'll wait forever and a day

Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you

Wait a minute, fellas
This has gotta be a dream
You know
I'm so used to seeing her every single day

My life will never be the same
I know it seems like we just met
And now shes leaving

You think if we keep singing this song
She'll hear it on the radio and come back?

245,245,Welcome To The Real World,"Fact is often
Much stranger than fiction
No danger
It's easy to ignore it
Hide your head
And don't look for it

Ain't no way to run a universe
Someone's holding
The strings of the purse
Got his finger on the trigger
Will he pull it?
Do you figure

Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world

Who's winning the human race?
Who's running?
Who's setting the pace?
Makes my blood boil in defiance
I fall to my knees
And pray for guidance

It's raining
It's pouring
The old man is snoring
Went to bed with a hole in his head
And didn't wake up in the morning

Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world

Let the world see
Let yourself be
Love each other
Just like you and me

Something's got to give
Better sooner than later
Yeah, hey
Oh, no

Somewhere, someone
Somehow, someday
We will find a way
Somewhere, someone
Somehow, someday

Yeah, hey
Oh, ho
Oh, no

Who's winning the human race?
Who's running?

247,247,Dare To Fall In Love,"One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

It's the question of the hour
How can I be sure
Of what I don't know
She comes to me with
A poison in her flower
She steals the miracle of life
Right out of my hand

And she takes the
Part of a woman
Most hard to comprehend
And she multiplies by ten

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look and she
Shot me in cold blood
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

It's the boundary I desire
There is always room enough to feel
Miles and miles of hilly road ahead
And she's got one hand on my heart
And one hand on the wheel

And she moves me one step
Closer to the deeper end
I may never love again

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look and she
Shot me in cold blood
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

One by one
I take the bitter pills
They're hard to swallow
I go round and round, my head
Is spinning out of control

I will know tomorrow
If I care to live or
Face another day of sorrow
Holding onto happy ever after

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look and she

Does it matter at all
To anyone else in this whole world
If I manage to scale up the highest of walls
To stand or to fall
Would it matter

Something in my soul sends me on
It doesn’t even know how hard the way
Something even the darkest parts can’t scare away

I’ve got to follow my heartbeat wherever
Even if it bleeds
It’s all I know to do
No matter where it leads me to

If I cherish the truth
Abhore the lies
Would the world even care
How I chose it
If I showed my face
Or I wore a disguise
Would the world have the eyes to know it

Something through the cold keeps me warm
Even as the passing storms throw rain
Something’s always there
No matter what it takes

I’ve got to follow my heartbeat wherever
Even if it bleeds
It’s all I know to do
No matter where it leads me to

Just a little dream is all I need
Even if it doesn’t change a thing
Every step I take
Will mean the world to me
And all that I know is

Even if it bleeds

Waiting for you

Wondering if everything is alright
Momma said, ""Come in boy, don't waste your time."" I said, ""I've got time
Well, he'll be here soon.""

Five years old and talking to myself
Where were you? Where'd you go?
Daddy, can't you tell?

I'm not trying to fake it
And I ain't the one to blame
There's no one home
In my house of pain
I didn't write these pages
And my script's been rearranged
No, there's no one home
In my house of pain

Wasn't I worth the time?
A boy needs a daddy like a dance to mime and all the time
I looked up to you

I paced my room a million times
And all I ever got was on big line, the same old lie
How could you?

Well, I was eighteen and still talking to myself
Where were you? Where'd you go?
Daddy can't you tell?

I'm not trying to fake it
And I ain't the one to blame

Can't help myself, you're far away with someone else
And I will never find another girl
Who makes me feel, the way you do
When I dream of you

And I've been seeing, the same visions night after night
Till the morning light
As my soul starts to ache
My heart starts to break in two
When I dream of you

When I dream of you, like dreamers do
I get this way, all night and day
When I dream of you, like dreamers do
I get this way, when I dream of you

When I think of how you made me feel
At a time, when love was real, and you were mine
I start missing all the times we spent
The words we'd say, how I never dreamt
I'd get this way when I dream of you

Oh and I've been seeing, the same visions night after night
Till the morning light
As my soul starts to ache
My heart starts to break in two
When I dream

When I dream of you, like dreamers do
I get this way, all night and day
When I dream of you, like dreamers do
I get this way, when I dream of you

Ran down my back

I wanna taste your sweet thing
I wanna feel the sting of your sex

We ripped the sheets
Right off the bed

My fingernails left fiery trails
Across your back
Oh, tell me, baby

Walk the wire of desire
And if you dare to take it higher

Dressed to kill and lookin' dynamite
With her high-laced stockings and her sweater so tight
I asked her her name, she said her name was ""Maybe.""

[Verse 2]
Well she walked up to me, and she asked me to chance
I said, ""I am lookin' for some wild romance,""
She gave me a wink--she said I should think about it, maybe

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, ""What you got babe, is what I need
Your kind of love got me on my knees.""
I'm so tied up
What you got got a hold on me, your kind of love make a man outta me
I'm so tied up, you got me so fired up

[Chorus]
Little sister, hits the stage
She can't help it, she's comin' of age
Little junior, he's all in a rage
Did you notice she was comin' of age

[Verse 3]
If looks could kill, I'd be dead on the floor
You got me all tied up, honey, beggin' for more
Somebody call a doctor, I think I'm goin' crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
(Because) What you got, babe, is what I need
Your kind of love got me on my knees
I'm so tied up
What you got got a hold on me
Your kind of love make a man outta me
I'm so tied up
You got me so fired up

There goes my old girlfriend, there's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises? I guess they don't mean a thing
So baby, what's the story? Did you find another man
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made
When you don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade away
I used to feel your fire, but now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street like you didn't miss a beat, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Girl, before I met you I was F.I.N.E, fine
But your love made me a prisoner, yeah, my heart's been doing time
You spent me up like money, then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes

[Chorus]
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go of the good times

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
Tell me that my loving didn't mean that much
Tell me you aren't dying when you're crying for me

Tell me what it takes to let you go (Ooh)

We?ll stay at home, turn the lights down low, play our favorite video
Or better still make our own private show

263,263,The Heart Of The Matter,"[Verse 1]
I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talking on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again

[Chorus 1]
I've been trying to get down to the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

[Verse 2]
These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
The trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness
They're the very things we kill, I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
You know it doesn't keep me warm

[Pre-Chorus (variant)]
I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out, I have to learn again

[Chorus 2]
I've been trying to get down to the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

[Bridge]
There are people in your life who've come and gone
They let you down, you know they hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you, baby, cause life goes on
You keep carrying that anger, it'll eat you up inside, baby

[Chorus 1]
I've been trying to get down to the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me

[Chorus 3]
I've been trying to get down to the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinking about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me

[Outro]
Forgiveness
(Yeah)
Forgiveness
(Baby)
Forgiveness
(Oh, oh)
Forgiveness
(Ah, yeah)
Forgiveness
(Oh)
Forgiveness
Even if you don't love me anymore

(Oh)

I don't know where my baby is
But I'll find him, somewhere, somehow
I've got to let him know how much I care
I'll never give up looking for my baby

[Chorus]
Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

[Verse 1]
We had a quarrel and I let myself go
I said so many things, things he didn't know
And I was oh oh so bad
And I don't think he's comin' back, mm mm
He gave the reason, the reasons he should go
And he said things he hadn't said before
And he was oh oh so mad
And I don't think he's comin', comin' back

[Pre-Chorus]
I did too much lyin', wasted too much time
Now I'm here and cryin', I, I, I

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
So open hearted
He never did me wrong
I was the one, the weakest one of all
And now I'm oh oh so sad
And I don't think he's comin' back, comin' back

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus 2X]

I'm going to find him, my baby

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Bridge]
I've been around the world, lookin' for my baby
Been around the world
And I'm gonna, I'm gonna find him

Never meant to be
Love child
Born in poverty
Love child
Never meant to be
Love child
Take a look at me

I started my life
In an old, cold run down tenement slum
(Tenement slum)
My father left
He never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

This love we're contemplating
(I'll always)
Is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating
(I'll always)
The child we maybe creating
(Love you, love you)

Never meant to be

Always second best

Love child
(Different from)
Different from the rest

(Hold on, hold on just a little bit longer)
Mmm, baby
(Hold on, hold on just a little bit longer)
Mmm, baby

I started school
In a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out
(Somebody threw out)
I knew the way it felt
To always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me

Don't think that I don't need you
(I'll always)
Don't think I don't wanna please you
But no child of mine will be bearing
(I'll always)
The name of shame I've been wearing
(Love you, love you)

Love child
Love child
Never quite as good
(Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Afraid
Ashamed
Misunderstood

And I'm cruising through Block Island Sound
I have charted a course to The Vineyard
But tonight I am Nantucket bound
I took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday
Left this morning from the bell in Gardiners Bay
Like all the locals here I've had to sell my home
Too proud to leave, I work my fingers to the bone

So I could own my Downeaster ""Alexa""
And I go where the ocean is deep
There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain can't fall asleep
I got bills to pay and children who need clothes
I know there's fish out there, but where? God only knows
They say these waters aren't what they used to be
But I got people back on land who count on me

So if you see my Downeaster ""Alexa""
And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis
And I've still got my hands on the wheel

Now I drive my Downeaster ""Alexa""
More and more miles from shore every year
Since they told me I can't sell no stripers
And there's no luck in swordfishing here
I was a bayman like my father was before
You can't make a living as a bayman anymore
There ain't much future for a man who works the sea
But there ain't no island left for Islanders like me

One look in your eyes
And there I see
Just what you mean to me
Here in my heart
I believe
Your love is all I ever need
Holding you close through the night
I need you, yeah

I look in your eyes
And there I see
What happiness really means
The love that we share
Makes life so sweet
Together, we'll always be
This pledge of love feels so right
And ooh, I need you

[Chorus]
Here and now
I promise to love faithfully
You're all I need
Here and now
I vow to be one with thee
Your love is all I need

[Verse 2]
When I look in your eyes, there I see
What all that a love should really be
And I need you more, and more each day
Nothing can take your love away
More than a just a dream
I need you

[Chorus]
Here and now
I promise to love faithfully
You're all I need
Here and now
I vow to be one with thee
Your love is all I need

[Bridge]
Starting here, ooh
I'm starting now, I believe
Starting here, I'm starting right here
Starting now, right now
I believe in your love
So I'm glad to take the vow

You're all I need

Cry
Come to me and cry
I know
I know
I know it's not easy

Your heart is aching
But so is mine
But so is mine
How can I tell you why
For so long

So long
So long I've been thinking
Now I know
I can't live a lie
Can't live a lie

They say true love lasts
Forever if we want it
There will be waiting
A second chance, baby

[Chorus:]
But now we need time
Time to learn
Time to understand

Where we went wrong
Cause I feel so strong
We are cruising for bruising
My baby
A second chance, baby

But now we need time
Time to learn
Time to understand

Where we went wrong
Cause I feel so strong
We are cruising for bruising

[Verse 2:]
Go
I must let you go
Don't stop
Don't stop
Cause it's better now

When I still love you
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye

They say true love lasts
Forever if we want it
There will be waiting
A second chance, baby

[Repeat Chorus:]

So long
So long
So long
I went away
So bye for now

Don't let it die cause
We can try some other time
So, bye for now

Don't let it die cause
We can try some other time
Some other time

So, bye for now
Don't let it die cause
We can try some other time
So, bye for now

Somebody told me
There'd be trouble at home
'Cause we never talk a lot
When we spend time alone
So how are we supposed to know
Know when something is wrong
Well, we've got a way to communicate
It keeps a happy home

[Hook 1]
And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me

[Hook 2]
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me

[Verse 2]
When we go to work
How the day seems so long
The only thing I think about
Can't wait 'til we get home
'Cause we got a way of talking
And it's better than words
It's the strangest kind of relationship
Oh, but with us it always works

[Hook 1]
And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me

[Hook 3]
Whatever you want (whatever you want babe)
It's alright with me (it's alright with me)
'Cause you've got that whip appeal
So work it on me
It's better than love
Sweet as can be
You've got that whip appeal
So whip it on me (baby)

You can eat your credit cards

277,277,All That Glitters Isn't Gold,"[Verse 1:]
Yesterday, I met a boy so fine
Right away I knew
He'd captivate my mind

So strong
The kind you dream about
Baby, together
We could really turn it out

I showed him to
Some friends of mine
They said, girl
Don't waste your time

That boy's no good for you
Listen, girl
I'm telling you
I think it's time you knew that

[Chorus:]
All that glitters isn't gold
Everything you see isn't what it seems to be
(No, oh, oh)
Oh, no
All that glitters isn't gold

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes we make the mistake
Of thinking everything
That looks good is great

We all seem to go for what shines
And then we leave all of
The other things behind

Some people always give a show
Cause it's the only way they know
But you don't have to play that game
Because the only thing that matters
Is what's inside your heart

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
So here's my advice to you
Everything you see's
Not always true

Take the time to look inside
And find out for yourself
What's really on their minds

[Repeat Chorus:]

No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold...

Oh, no, it isn't gold
No, no, it isn't gold
Everything you see's
Not what it seems to be

Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
All that glitters isn't gold
No, no, no

[Repeat Chorus x3:]

All that glitters isn't gold
(No, oh, oh)

Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky

The boy could sing
Knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more
He'd leave you longing for

And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Up in Memphis
The music's like a heatwave
White lightning
Bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every schoolgirl
""Love Me Tender"" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

The way he moved
It was a sin
So sweet and true
Always wanting more
He'd leave you longing for

Black velvet

A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees

That he sang was for you
In a flash, he was gone
It happened so soon
What could you do?

281,281,Just A Friend,"[Verse 1]
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on!
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 2]
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named ""blah-blah-blah"" that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say: ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that!
Jus' bust this

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 3]
So, I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl, that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So, I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock, my heart went down south
So please, listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend...","['have', 'you', 'ever', 'meet', 'a', 'girl', 'that', 'you', 'try', 'to', 'date', 'but', 'a', 'year', 'to', 'make', 'love', 'she', 'want',

You, the one with the haunting stare
Well you
You have the power to hypnotize

I should beware

Done everything for you
But you just won't look my way

Save me
It's time for somebody else
Save me

Well, you, you could own the universe
Think about it and you'll realize
You, you got to believe me
And take my word
Look at me

I told you once
I'm not going to tell you twice

286,286,Take It To Heart,"(Diane Warren And Michael McDonald)

I know that you're afraid to love
You've been hurt before
Love broke your heart so you closed the door
Now here I am outside your world
Wishin' you'd let me in
Give me half a chance to prove you wrong
Baby all your tears have come and gone
Talkin' 'bout a brand new start

Take it to heart, baby believe it
This love is so strong that it won't let you go
Baby hold on, you'll see just how good it's gonna be
It's gonna be here long as you need it
Never take your world and tear it apart
Take it to heart baby

You're gonna have to trust someone
It's a shame if you don't
Because it ain't no life living all alone
Let me show you how to love again
There's no broken heart that love won't mend
Talkin' 'bout a brand new start

I just want to be the one that'll be there by your side
So take this love of mine
Take it to heart

Baby believe it, this love is so strong, love is so strong baby

(love is a second chance to find all that we lost
Love's always worth a try no matter what the cost
I know you don't believe your tears have come and gone
Give me but half a chance and I will prove you wrong)","['i', 'know', 'that', 'youre', 'afraid', 'to', 'love', 'youve', 'be', 'hurt', 'before', 'love', 'break', 'your', 'heart', 'so', 'you', 'close', 'the', 'door', 'now', 'here', 'i', 'be', 'outside', 'your', 'world', 'wishin', 'youd', 'let', 'me', 'in', 'give', 'me', 'half', 'a', 'chance', 'to', 'prove', 'you', 'wrong', 'baby', 'all', 'your', 'tear', 'have', 'come', 'and', 'go', 'talkin', 'bout', 'a', 'brand', 'new', 'start', 'take', 'it', 'to', 'heart', 'baby', 'believe', 'it', 'this', 'love', 'be', 'so', 'strong', 'that', 'it', 'wont', 'let', 'you', 'go', 'baby', 'hold', 'on', 'youll', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'its', 'gonna', 'be', 'its', 'gonna', 'be', 'here', 'long', 'as', 'you', 'need', 'it', 'never', 'take', 'your', 'world', 'and', 'tear', 'it', 'apart', 'take', 'it', 'to', 'heart', 'baby', 'youre', 'gonna', 'have', 'to', 'trust', 'someone', 'its', 'a', 'shame', 'if', 'you', 'dont', 'because', 'it', 'aint', 'no', 'life', 'live', 'all', 'alone', 'let', 'me', 'show', 'you', 'how', 'to', 'love', 'again', 'theres', 'no', 'break', 'heart', 'that', 'love', 'wont', 'mend', 'talkin', 'bout', 'a', 'brand', 'new', 'start', 'i', 'just', 'want', 'to', 'be', 'the', 'one', 'thatll', 'be', 'there', 'by', 'your', 'side', 'so', 'take', 'this', 'love', 'of', 'mine', 'take', 'it', 'to', 'heart', 'baby', 'believe', 'it', 'this', 'love', 'be', 'so', 'strong', 'love', 'be', 'so', 'strong', 'baby', 'love', 'always', 'worth', 'a', 'try', 'no', 'matter', 'what', 'the', 'cost', 'i', 'know', 'you', 'dont', 'believe', 'your', 'tear', 'have', 'come', 'and', 'go', 'give', 'me', 'but', 'half', 'a', 'chance', 'and', 'i', 'will', 'prove', 'you', 'wrong']",217,Michael McDonald,Michael McDonald,1990,"[99, 98]",2,Take It to Heart,https://open.spotify.com/track/2mdNWsx6evoVi9IhD6P9uL,2mdNWsx6evoVi9IhD6P9uL,spotify:track:2mdNWsx6evoVi9IhD6P9uL,Take It To Heart,26DyP2oh3gRsq5eNR1gjtV,spotify:album:26DyP2oh3gRsq5eNR1gjtV,Michael McDonald,24hJWbo98sH84tb0nkeaqy,spotify:artist:24hJWbo98sH84tb0nkeaqy,357.96,11.0,31.0,1990-05-11,0.6859999999999999,0.58,7.0,-10.503,1.0,0.0287,0.22,7.390000000000001e-05,0.0536,0.6,92.111,"['mellow gold', 'quiet storm', 'soft rock', 'yacht rock']",[],1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11499999999999999

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know

Love will lead you back to my arms

I'm sure
Sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long

Our love will lead you back

You're gonna say how much you miss me
You walked out this door, but someday you'll walk back in

To find your way back home

290,290,Pictures Of You,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are
All I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you
Standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you
Running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go

[Verse 3]
Remembering you
Fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you
How you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes
But I never see anything

[Bridge]
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

[Verse 4]
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

[Outro]
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart

291,291,Heaven Is A 4 Letter Word,"There's a rumor here
And it's going round
Can you hear it on the street
If you realize that the pleasure lies
Between surrender and the heat

Just take a walk
On the wild side babe
And I'll meet you halfway there
And if you're talking about paradise
There's no need to say a prayer
Cause baby I'll take you there

Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
One touch is never enough
You'll find out when you enter the world
Heaven is a four letter word

Lose your innocence
For experience
But you've got to take the chance
Can you rock and roll
Can you get down babe
Cause it's tough for you to dance

Don't need to ride in a limousine
To feel like a millionaire
And if you're talking 'bout fantasy
It could happen anywhere
Baby I'll take you there

Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
One touch is never enough
You'll find out when you enter the world
Heaven is a four letter word

It's like love and kiss
And it feels like this
Baby don't wait too long
It's just me and you
We know what to do
And it's a long way til dawn

Maybe we could give it another try, one more time

And she calls me on the phone
Sees babies everywhere she goes
And she wants one of her own

She's waited long enough she says
And still he can't decide
Pretty soon she'll have to choose
And it tears her up inside

She is scared
Scared to run out of time

I see my folks are getting on
And I watch their bodies change
I know they see the same in me
And it makes us both feel strange

No matter how you tell yourself
It's what we all go through
Those lines are pretty hard to take
When they're staring back at you

Oh Oh Oh, scared you'll run out of time

When did the choices get so hard
With so much more at stake
Life gets mighty precious
When there's less of it to wa-a-a-aste

Mmm-m-m-m-m-m

Mmmmmmm, scared you'll run out of time

Just when I thought I'd had enough
And all my tears were shed
No promise left unbroken
There were no painful words unsaid

I could leave it all behind
You opened up my heart again
And then much to my surprise

295,295,"Whole Wide World (From ""True Love"")","                   Apology For Raimond Sebond

Learning is, indeed, a very great and a very material accomplishment; and those who despise it sufficiently discover their own want of understanding; but learning yet I do not prize it at the excessive rate that some others do, as Herillus, the philosopher, for one, who therein places the sovereign good, and maintained ""That it was only in her to render us wise and contented,"" which I do not believe; no more than I do what others have said, that learning is the mother of all virtue, and that all vice proceeds from ignorance, which, if it be true, required a very long interpretation. My house has long-been open to men of knowledge, and is very well known to them; for my father, who governed it fifty years and upwards, inflamed with the new ardour with which Francis the First embraced letters, and brought them into esteem, with great diligence and expense hunted after the acquaintance of learned men, receiving them into his house as persons sacred, and that had some particular inspiration of divine wisdom; collecting their sayings and sentences as so many oracles, and with so much the greater reverence and religion as he was the less able to judge of them; for he had no knowledge of letters any more than his predecessors. For my part I love them well, but I do not adore them. Amongst others, Peter Bunel, a man of great reputation for knowledge in his time, having, with some others of his sort, staid some days at Montaigne in my father's company, he presented him at his departure with a book, entitled Theologia naturalis; sive Liber Creaturarum, magistri Raimondi de Sebonde. And as the Italian and Spanish tongues were familiar to my father, and as this book was written in a sort of jargon of Spanish with Latin terminations, he hoped that, with a little help, he might be able to understand it, and therefore recommended it to him for a very useful book, and proper tor the time wherein he gave it to him; which was when the novel doctrines of Luther began to be in vogue, and in many places to stagger our ancient belief: wherein he was very well advised, wisely, in his own reason, foreseeing that the beginning of this distemper would easily run into an execrable atheism, for the vulgar, not having the faculty of judging of things, suffering themselves to be carried away by chance and appearance, after having once been inspired with the boldness to despise and control those opinions which they had before had in extreme reverence, such as those wherein their salvation is concerned, and that some of the articles of their religion are brought into doubt and dispute, they afterwards throw all other parts of their belief into the same uncertainty, they having with them no other authority or foundation than the others they had already discomposed; and shake off all the impressions they had received from the authority of the laws, or the reverence of the ancient customs, as a tyrannical yoke:

           Nam cupide eonculcatur nimis ante metutum;
           ""For with most eagerness they spurn the law,
          By which they were before most kept in awe;""
resolving to admit nothing for the future to which they had not first interposed their own decrees, and given their particular consent.

It happened that my father, a little before his death, having accidentally found this book under a heap of other neglected papers, commanded me to translate it for him into French. It is good too translate such authors as this, where there is little but the matter itself to express; but such wherein grace of language and elegance of style are aimed at, are dangerous to attempt, especially when a man is to turn them into a weaker idiom. It was a strange and a new undertaking for me; but having by chance at that time nothing else to do, and not being able to resist the command of the best father that ever was, I did it as well as I could; and he was so well pleased with it as to order it to be printed, which after his death was done.

I found the ideas of this author exceeding fine the contexture of his work well followed, and his design full of piety; and because many people take a delight to read it, and particularly the ladies, to whom we owe the most service, I have often thought to assist them to clear the book of two principal objections made to it. His design is bold and daring, for he undertakes, by human and natural reasons, to establish and make good, against the atheists, all the articles of the Christian religion: wherein, to speak the truth, he is so firm and so successful that I do not think it possible to do better upon that subject; nay, I believe he has been equalled by none. This work seeming to me to be too beautiful and too rich for an author whose name is so little known, and of whom all that we know is that he was a Spaniard, practising physic at Toulouse about two hundred years ago; I enquired of Adrian Turnebus, who knew all things, what he thought of that book; who made answer, ""That he thought it was some abstract drawn from St. Thomas d'Aquin; for that, in truth, his mind, so full of infinite erudition and admirable subtlety, was alone capable of such thoughts."" Be this as it may, whoever was the author and inventor (and 'tis not reasonable, without greater certainty, to deprive Sebond of that title), he was a man of great judgment and most admirable parts.

The first thing they reprehend in his work is ""That Christians are to blame to repose their belief upon human reason, which is only conceived by faith and the particular inspiration of divine grace."" In which objection there appears to be something of zeal to piety, and therefore we are to endeavour to satisfy those who put it forth with the greater mildness and respect. This were a task more proper for a man well read in divinity than for me, who know nothing of it; nevertheless, I conceive that in a thing so divine, so high, and so far transcending all human intelligence, as is that truth, with which it has pleased the bounty of God to enlighten us, it is very necessary that he should moreover lend us his assistance, as a very extraordinary favour and privilege, to conceive and imprint it in our understanding. And I do not believe that means purely human are in any sort capable of doing it: for, if they were, so many rare and excellent souls, and so abundantly furnished with natural force, in former ages, could not have failed, by their reason, to arrive at this knowledge. 'Tis faith alone that livelily mind certainly comprehends the deep mysteries of our religion; but, withal, I do not say that it is not a worthy and very laudable attempt to accommodate those natural and human utensils with which God has endowed us to the service of our faith: it is not to be doubted but that it is the most noble use we can put them to; and that there is not a design in a Christian man more noble than to make it the aim and end of all his studies to extend and amplify the truth of his belief. We do not satisfy ourselves with serving God with our souls and understandings only, we moreover owe and render him a corporal reverence, and apply our limbs and motions, and external things to do him honour; we must here do the same, and accompany our faith with all the reason we have, but always with this reservation, not to fancy that it is upon us that it depends, nor that our arguments and endeavours can arrive at so supernatural and divine a knowledge. If it enters not into us by an extraordinary infusion; if it enters not only by reason, but, moreover, by human ways, it is not in us in its true dignity and splendour: and yet, I am afraid, we only have it by this way.

If we hold upon God by the mediation of a lively faith; if we hold upon God by him, and not by us; if we had a divine basis and foundation, human occasions would not have the power to shake us as they do; our fortress would not surrender to so weak a battery; the love of novelty, the constraint of princes, the success of one party, and the rash and fortuitous change of our opinions, would not have the power to stagger and alter our belief: we should not then leave it to the mercy of every new argument, nor abandon it to all the rhetoric in the world; we should withstand the fury of these waves with an immovable and unyielding constancy:

                As a great rock repels the rolling tides,

            That foam and bark about her marble sides,
           From its strong bulk
If we were but touched with this ray of divinity, it would appear throughout; not only our words, but our works also, would carry its brightness and lustre; whatever proceeded from us would be seen illuminated with this noble light. We ought to be ashamed that, in all the human sects, there never was any of the faction, that did not, in some measure, conform his life and behaviour to it, whereas so divine and heavenly an institution does only distinguish Christians by the name! Will you see the proof of this? Compare our manners to those of a Mahometan or Pagan, you will still find that we fall very

short; there, where, out of regard to the reputation and advantage of our religion, we ought to shine in excellency at a vast distance beyond all others: and that it should be said of us, ""Are they so just, so charitable, so good: Then they are Christians."" All other signs are common to all religions; hope, trust, events, ceremonies, penance,

martyrs. The peculiar mark of our truth ought to be our virtue, as it is also the most heavenly and difficult, and the most worthy product of truth. For this our good St. Louis was in the right, who, when the Tartar king, who was become Christian, designed to come to Lyons to kiss the Pope's feet, and there to be an eye-witness of the sanctity he hoped to find in our manner, immediately diverted him from his purpose; for fear lest our disorderly way of living should, on the contrary, put him out of conceit with so holy a belief! And yet it happened quite otherwise since to that other, who, going to Rome, to the same end, and there seeing the dissoluteness of the prelates and people of that time, settled himself so much the more firmly in our religion, considering how great the force and divinity of it must necessarily be that could maintain its dignity and splendour among so much corruption, and in so vicious hands. If we had but one single grain of faith, we should remove mountains from their places, saith the sacred Word; our actions, that would then be directed and accompanied by the divinity, would not be merely human, they would have in them something of miraculous, as well as our belief: Brevis est institutio vit honest beauque, si credos. ""Believe, and the way to happiness and virtue is a short one."" Some impose upon the world that they believe that which they do not; others, more in number, make themselves believe that they believe, not being able to penetrate into what it is to believe. We think it strange if, in the civil war which, at this time, disorders our state, we see events float and vary aller a common and ordinary manner; which is because we bring nothing to it but our own. Justice, which is in one party, is only there for ornament and palliation; it, is, indeed, pretended, but 'tis not there received, settled and espoused: it is there, as in the mouth of an advocate, not as in the heart and affection of the party. God owes his extraordinary assistance to faith and religion; not to our passions. Men there are the conductors, and therein serve themselves with religion, whereas it ought to be quite contrary. Observe, if it be not by our own hands that we guide and train it, and draw it like wax into so many contrary figures, from a rule in itself so direct and firm. When and where was this more manifest than in France in our days? They who have taken it on the left hand, they who have taken it on the right; they who call it black, they who call it white, alike employ it to their violent and ambitious designs, conduct it with a progress, so conform in riot and injustice that they render the diversity they pretended in their opinions, in a thing whereon the conduct and rule of our life depends, doubtful and hard to believe. Did one ever see, come from the same school and discipline, manners more united, and more the same? Do but observe with what horrid impudence we toss divine arguments to and fro, and how irreligiously we have both rejected and retaken them, accord—as fortune has shifted our places in these intestine storms.

This so solemn proposition, ""Whether it be lawful for a subject to rebel and take up arms against his prince for the defence of his religion,"" do you remember in whose mouths, the last year, the affirmative of it was the prop of one party, and the negative the pillar of another? And hearken now from what quarter comes the voice and instruction of the one and the other, and if arms make less noise and rattle for this cause than for that. We condemn those to the fire who say that truth must be made to bear the yoke of our necessity; and how much worse does France than say it? Let us confess the truth; whoever should draw out from the army, even that raised by the king, those who take up arms out of pure zeal to religion, and also those who only do it to protect the laws of their country, or for the service of their prince, could hardly, out of both these put together, make one complete company of gens-d'armes. Whence does this proceed, that there are so few to be found who have maintained the same will and the same progress in our civil commotions, and that we see them one while move but a foot-pace, and another run full speed? and the same men one while damage our affairs by their violent heat and fierceness, and another by their coldness, gentleness, and slowness; but that they are pushed on by particular and casual considerations, according to the variety wherein they move?

I evidently perceive that we do not willingly afford devotion any other offices but those that least suit with our own passions.

There hostility so admirable as the Christian. Our zeal performs wonders, when it seconds our inclinations to hatred, cruelty, ambition, avarice, detraction, and rebellion: but when it moves, against the hair, towards bounty, benignity, and temperance, unless, by miracle, some rare and virtuous disposition prompts us to it, we stir neither hand nor toot. Our religion is intended to extirpate vices, whereas it screens, nourishes, and incites them. We must not mock God. If we believed in him, I do not say by faith, but with a simple belief, that is to say (and I speak it to our great shame) if we believed in him and recognised him as we do any other history, or as we would do one of our companions, we should love him above all other things for the infinite bounty and beauty that shines in him;—at least, he would go equal in our affection with riches, pleasure, glory, and our friends. The best of us is not so much afraid to outrage him as he is afraid to injure his neighbour, his kinsman, or his master. Is there any understanding so weak that, having on one side the object of one of our vicious pleasures, and on the other (in equal knowledge and persuasion) the state of an immortal glory, would change the first for the other? and yet we often renounce this out of mere contempt: for what lust tempts us to blaspheme, if not, perhaps, the very desire to offend. The philosopher Antisthenes, as he was being initiated in the mysteries of Orpheus, the priest telling him, ""That those who professed themselves of that religion were certain to receive perfect and eternal felicity after death,""—""If thou believest that,"" answered he, ""why dost thou not die thyself?"" Diogenes, more rudely, according to his manner, and more remote from our purpose, to the priest that in like manner preached to him, ""To become of his religion, that he might obtain the happiness of the other world;—""What!"" said he, ""thou wouldest have me to believe that Agesilaus and Epaminondas, who were so great men, shall be miserable, and that thou, who art but a calf, and canst do nothing to purpose, shalt be happy, because thou art a priest?"" Did we receive these great promises of eternal beatitude with the same reverence and respect that we do a philosophical discourse, we should not have death in so great horror:

          Non jam se moriens dissolvi conqurreretur;
          Sed magis ire foras, stemque relinquere ut angais,
         Gauderet, prealonga senex aut cornua cervus.

          ""We should not on a death bed grieve to be
           Dissolved, but rather launch out cheerfully
          From our old hut, and with the snake, be glad
           To cast off the corrupted slough we had;
          Or with th' old stag rejoice to be now clear
           From the large horns, too ponderous grown to bear.""
""I desire to be dissolved,"" we should say, ""and to be with Jesus Christ"" The force of Plato's arguments concerning the immortality of the soul set some of his disciples to seek a premature grave, that they might the sooner enjoy the things he had made them hope for.

All this is a most evident sign that we only receive our religion after our own fashion, by our own hands, and no otherwise than as other religions are received. Either we are happened in the country where it is in practice, or we reverence the antiquity of it, or the authority of the men who have maintained it, or fear the menaces it fulminates against misbelievers, or are allured by its promises. These considerations ought, 'tis true, to be applied to our belief but as subsidiaries only, for they are human obligations. Another religion, other witnesses, the like promises and threats, might, by the same way, imprint a quite contrary belief. We are Christians by the same title that we are Perigordians or Germans. And what Plato says, ""That there are few men so obstinate in their atheism whom a pressing danger will not reduce to an acknowledgment of the divine power,"" does not concern a true Christian: 'tis for mortal and human religions to be received by human recommendation. What kind of faith can that be that cowardice and want of courage establish in us? A pleasant faith, that does not believe what it believes but for want of courage to disbelieve it! Can a vicious passion, such as inconstancy and astonishment, cause any regular product in our souls? ""They are confident in their judgment,"" says he, ""that what is said of hell and future torments is all feigned: but an occasion of making the expedient presenting itself, when old age or diseases bring them to the brink of the grave, the terror of death, by the horror of that future condition, inspires them with a new belief!"" And by reason that such impressions render them timorous, he forbids in his Laws all such threatening doctrines, and all persuasion that anything of ill can befall a man from the gods, excepting for his great good when they happen to him, and for a medicinal effect. They say of Bion that, infected with the atheism of Theodoras, he had long had religious men in great scorn and contempt, but that death surprising him, he gave himself up to the most extreme superstition; as if the gods withdrew and returned according to the necessities of Bion. Plato and these examples would conclude that we are brought to a belief of God either by reason or by force. Atheism being a proposition as unnatural as monstrous, difficult also and hard to establish in the human understanding, how arrogant soever, there are men enough seen, out of vanity and pride, to be the authors of extraordinary and reforming opinions, and outwardly to affect the profession of them; who, if they are such fools, have, nevertheless, not the power to plant them in their own conscience. Yet will they not fail to lift up their hands towards heaven if you give them a good thrust with a sword in the breast, and when fear or sickness has abated and dulled the licentious fury of this giddy humour they will easily re-unite, and very discreetly suffer themselves to be reconciled to the public faith and examples. A doctrine seriously digested is one thing, and those superficial impressions another; which springing from the disorder of an unhinged understanding, float at random and great uncertainty in the fancy. Miserable and senseless men, who strive to be worse than they can!

The error of paganism and the ignorance of our sacred truth, let this great soul of Plato, but great only in human greatness, fall also into this other mistake, ""That children and old men were most susceptible of religion,"" as if it sprung and derived its credit from our weakness. The knot that ought to bind the judgment and the will, that ought to restrain the soul and join it to our creator, should be a knot that derives its foldings and strength not from our considerations, from our reasons and passions, but from a divine and supernatural constraint, having but one form, one face, and one lustre, which is the authority of God and his divine grace. Now the heart and soul being governed and commanded by faith, 'tis but reason that they should muster all our other faculties, according as they are able to perform to the service and assistance of their design. Neither is it to be imagined that all this machine has not some marks imprinted upon it by the hand of the mighty architect, and that there is not in the things of this world some image that in some measure resembles the workman who has built and formed them. He has, in his stupendous works, left the character of his divinity, and 'tis our own weakness only that hinders us from discerning it. 'Tis what he himself is pleased to tell us, ""That he manifests his invisible operations to us by those that are visible."" Sebond applied himself to this laudable and noble study, and demonstrates to us that there is not any part or member of the world that disclaims or derogates from its maker. It were to do wrong to the divine goodness, did not the universe consent to our belief. The heavens, the earth, the elements, our bodies and our souls,—all things concur to this; we have but to find out the way to use them; they instruct us, if we are capable of instruction. For this world is a sacred temple, into which man is introduced, there to contemplate statues, not the works of a mortal hand, but such as the divine purpose has made the objects of sense; the sun, the stars, the water, and the earth, to represent those that are intelligible to us. ""The invisible tilings of God,"" says St. Paul, ""appear by the creation of the world, his eternal wisdom and divinity being considered by his works.""

          And God himself envies not men the grace
          Of seeing and admiring heaven's face;
           But, rolling it about, he still anew
           Presents its varied splendour to our view,
          And on oar minds himself inculcates, so
           That we th' Almighty mover well may know:
         Instructing us by seeing him the cause
            Of ill, to revcreoce and obey his laws.""
Now our prayers and human discourses are but as sterile and undigested matter. The grace of God is the form; 'tis that which gives fashion and value to it. As the virtuous actions of Socrates and Cato remain vain and fruitless, for not having had the love and obedience to the true creator of all things, so is it with our imaginations and discourses; they have a kind of body, but it is an inform mass, without fashion and without light, if faith and grace be not added thereto. Faith coming to tinct and illustrate Sehond's arguments renders them firm and stolid; and to that degree that they are capable of serving for directions, and of being the first guides to an elementary Christian to put him into the way of this knowledge. They in some measure form him to, and render him capable of, the grace of God, by which means he afterwards completes and perfects himself in the true belief. I know a man of authority, bred up to letters, who has confessed to me to have been brought back from the errors of unbelief by Sebond's arguments. And should they be stripped of this ornament, and of the assistance and approbation of the faith, and be looked upon as mere fancies only, to contend with those who are precipitated into the dreadful and horrible darkness of irrligion, they will even there find them as solid and firm as any others of the same quality that can be opposed against them; so that we shall be ready to say to our opponents:

           Si melius quid habes, arcesse; vel imperium fer:

               ""If you have arguments more fit.
            Produce them, or to these submit.""
let them admit the force of our reasons, or let them show us others, and upon some other subject, better woven and of finer thread. I am, unawares, half engaged in the second objection, to which I proposed to make answer in the behalf of Sebond. Some say that his arguments are weak, and unable to make good what he intends, and undertake with great ease to confute them. These are to be a little more roughly handled, for they are more dangerous and malicious than the first Men willingly wrest the sayings of others to favour their own prejudicate opinions. To an atheist all writings tend to atheism: he corrupts the most innocent matter with his own venom. These have their judgments so prepossessed that they cannot relish Sebond's reasons. As to the rest, they think we give them very fair play in putting them into the liberty of combatting our religion with weapons merely human, whom, in her majesty, full of authority and command, they durst not attack. The means that I shall use, and that I think most proper to subdue this frenzy, is to crush and spurn under foot pride and human arrogance; to make them sensible of the inanity, vanity, and vileness of man; to wrest the wretched arms of their reason out of their hands; to make them bow down and bite the ground under the authority and reverence of the Divine Majesty. 'Tis to that alone that knowledge and wisdom appertain; that alone that can make a true estimate of itself, and from which we purloin whatever we value ourselves upon: [—Greek—] ""God permits not any being but himself to be truly wise."" Let us subdue this presumption, the first foundation of the tyranny of the evil spirit Deus superbis re-sistit, humilibus autem dal gratiam. ""God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."" ""Understanding is in the gods,"" says Plato, ""and not at all, or very little, in men."" Now it is in the mean time a great consolation to a Christian man to see our frail and mortal parts so fitly suited to our holy and divine faith that, when we employ them to the subjects of their own mortal and frail nature they are not even there more unitedly or more firmly adjusted. Let us see, then, if man has in his power other more forcible and convincing reasons than those of Sebond; that is to say, if it be in him to arrive at any certainty by argument and reason. For St. Augustin, disputing against these people, has good cause to reproach them with injustice, ""In that they maintain the part of our belief to be false that our reason cannot establish."" And to show that a great many things may be, and have been, of which our nature could not sound the reason and causes, he proposes to them certain known and undoubted experiments, wherein men confess they see nothing; and this he does, as all other things, with a curious and ingenious inquisition. We must do more than this, and make them know that, to convince the weakness of their reason, there is no necessity of culling out uncommon examples: and that it is so defective and so blind that there is no faculty clear enough for it; that to it the easy and the hard are all one; that all subjects equally, and nature in general, disclaim its authority and reject its mediation.

What does truth mean when she preaches to us to fly worldly philosophy, when she so often inculcates to us, ""That our wisdom is but folly in the sight of God: that the vainest of all vanities is man: that the man who presumes upon his wisdom does not yet know what wisdom is; and that man, who is nothing, if he thinks himself to be anything, does seduce and deceive himself."" These sentences of the Holy Spirit do so clearly and vividly express that which I would maintain that I should need no other proof against men who would with all humility and obedience submit to his authority: but these will be whipped at their own expense, and will not suffer a man to oppose their reason but by itself.

Let us then, for once, consider a man alone, without foreign assistance, armed only with his own proper arms, and unfurnished of the divine grace and wisdom, which is all his honour, strength, and the foundation of his being. Let us see how he stands in this fine equipage. Let him make me understand, by the force of his reason, upon what foundations he has built those great advantages he thinks he has over other creatures. Who has made him believe that this admirable motion of the celestial arch, the eternal light of those luminaries that roll so high over his head, the wondrous and fearful motions of that infinite ocean, should be established and continue so many ages for his service and convenience? Can any thing be imagined so ridiculous, that this miserable and wretched creature, who is not so much as master of himself, but subject to the injuries of all things, should call himself master and emperor of the world, of which he has not power to know the least part, much less to command the whole? And the privilege which he attributes to himself of being the only creature in this vast fabric who has the understanding to discover the beauty and the paris of it; the only one who can return thanks to the architect, and keep account of the revenues and disbursements of the world; who, I wonder, sealed him this patent? Let us see his commission for this great employment Was it granted in favour of the wise only? Few people will be concerned in it. Are fools and wicked persons worthy so extraordinary a favour, and, being the worst part of the world, to be preferred before the rest? Shall we believe this man?—""For whose sake shall we, therefore, conclude that the world was made? For theirs who have the use of reason: these are gods and men, than whom certainly nothing can be better:"" we can never sufficiently decry the impudence of this conjunction. But, wretched creature, what has he in himself worthy of such an advantage? Considering the incorruptible existence of the celestial bodies; beauty; magnitude, and continual revolution by so exact a rule;

                   Cum suspicimus mni clestia mundi
            Templa super, stellisque micantibus arthera fiium,
            El venit in mcntem lun solisque viarurn.

                  ""When we the heavenly arch above behold.
            And the vast sky adorned with stars of gold.
            And mark the r'eglar course? that the sun
            And moon in their alternate progress run.""

considering the dominion and influence those bodies have, not only over our lives and fortunes;

           Facta etenim et vitas hominum suspendit ab aatris;

           ""Men's lives and actions on the stars depend.""
but even over our inclinations, our thoughts and wills, which they govern, incite and agitate at the mercy of their influences, as our reason teaches us;

                ""Contemplating the stars he finds that they
          Rule by a secret and a silent sway;
           And that the enamell'd spheres which roll above
           Do ever by alternate causes move.
           And, studying these, he can also foresee,
           By certain signs, the turns of destiny;""
seeing that not only a man, not only kings, but that monarchies, empires, and all this lower world follow the influence of the celestial motions,

                 ""How great a change a little motion brings!
            So great this kingdom is that governs kings:""
if our virtue, our vices, our knowledge, and this very discourse we are upon of the power of the stars, and the comparison we are making betwixt them and us, proceed, as our reason supposes, from their favour;

                  ""One mad in love may cross the raging main,
           To level lofty Ilium with the plain;
           Another's fate inclines him more by far
           To study laws and statutes for the bar.
           Sons kill their father, fathers kill their sons,
          And one arm'd brother 'gainst another runs..
           This war's not their's, but fate's, that spurs them on
         To shed the blood which, shed, they must bemoan;
           And I ascribe it to the will of fate
           That on this theme I now expatiate:""
if we derive this little portion of reason we have from the bounty of heaven, how is it possible that reason should ever make us equal to it? How subject its essence and condition to our knowledge?
Whatever we see in those bodies astonishes us: Qu molitio, qua ferramenta, qui vectes, qu machina, qui ministri tanti operis fuerunt? ""What contrivance, what tools, what materials, what engines, were employed about so stupendous a work?"" Why do we deprive them of soul, of life, and discourse? Have we discovered in them any immoveable or insensible stupidity, we who have no commerce with them but by obedience? Shall we say that we have discovered in no other creature but man the use of a reasonable soul? What! have we seen any thing like the sun? Does he cease to be, because we have seen nothing like him? And do his motions cease, because there are no other like them? If what we have not seen is not, our knowledge is marvellously contracted: Qu sunt tant animi angusti! ""How narrow are our understandings!"" Are they not dreams of human vanity, to make the moon a celestial earth? there to fancy mountains and vales, as Anaxagoras did? there to fix habitations and human abodes, and plant colonies for our convenience, as Plato and Plutarch have done? And of our earth to make a luminous and resplendent star? ""Amongst the other inconveniences of mortality this is one, that darkness of the understanding which leads men astray, not so much from a necessity of erring, but from a love of error.
The corruptible body stupifies the soul, and the earthly habitation dulls the faculties of the imagination.""

Presumption is our natural and original disease. The most wretched and frail of all creatures is man, and withal the proudest. He feels and sees himself lodged here in the dirt and filth of the world, nailed and rivetted to the worst and deadest part of the universe, in the lowest story of the house, the most remote from the heavenly arch, with animals of the worst condition of the three; and yet in his imagination will be placing himself above the circle of the moon, and bringing the heavens under his feet. 'Tis by the same vanity of imagination that he equals himself to God, attributes to himself divine qualities, withdraws and separates himself from the the crowd of other creatures, cuts out the shares of the animals, his fellows and companions, and distributes to them portions of faculties and force, as himself thinks fit How does he know, by the strength of his understanding, the secret and internal motions of animals?—from what comparison betwixt them and us does he conclude the stupidity he attributes to them? When I play with my cat who knows whether I do not make her more sport than she makes me? We mutually divert one another with our play. If I have my hour to begin or to refus, she also has hers. Plato, in his picture of the golden age under Saturn, reckons, among the chief advantages that a man then had, his communication with beasts, of whom, inquiring and informing himself, he knew the true qualities and differences of them all, by which he acquired a very perfect intelligence and prudence, and led his life more happily than we could do. Need we a better proof to condemn human impudence in the concern of beasts? This great author was of opinion that nature, for the most part in the corporal form she gave them, had only regard to the use of prognostics that were derived thence in his time. The defect that hinders communication betwixt them and us, why may it not be in our part as well as theirs? 'Tis yet to determine where the fault lies that we understand not one another,—for we understand them no more than they do us; and by the same reason they may think us to be beasts as we think them. 'Tis no great wonder if we understand not them, when we do not understand a Basque or a Troglodyte. And yet some have boasted that they understood them, as Apollonius Tyanaus, Melampus, Tiresias, Thales, and others. And seeing, as cusmographers report, that there are nations that have a dog for their king, they must of necessity be able to interpret his voice and motions. We must observe the parity betwixt us, have some tolerable apprehension of their meaning, and so have beasts of ours,—much about the same. They caress us, threaten us, and beg of us, and we do the same to them.

As to the rest, we manifestly discover that they have a full and absolute communication amongst themselves, and that they perfectly understand one another, not only those of the same, but of divers kinds:

              ""The tamer herds, and wilder sort of brutes.
          Though we of higher race conclude them mutes.
          Yet utter dissonant and various notes,
          From gentler lungs or more distended throats,
           As fear, or grief, or anger, do them move,
          Or as they do approach the joys of love.""
In one kind of barking of a dog the horse knows there is anger, of another sort of bark he is not afraid. Even in the very beasts that have no voice at all, we easily conclude, from the society of offices we observe amongst them, some other sort of communication: their very motions discover it:

                ""As infants who, for want of words, devise
            Expressive motions with their hands and eyes.""
And why not, as well as our dumb people, dispute, argue, and tell stories by signs? Of whom I have seen some, by practice, so clever and active that way that, in fact, they wanted nothing of the perfection of making themselves understood. Lovers are angry, reconciled, intreat, thank, appoint, and, in short, speak all things by their eyes:

               ""Even silence in a lover
          Love and passion can discover.""
What with the hands? We require, promise, call, dismiss, threaten, pray, supplicate, deny, refuse, interrogate, admire, number, confess, repent, fear, express confusion, doubt, instruct, command, incite, encourage, swear, testify, accuse, condemn, absolve, abuse, despise, defy, provoke, flatter, applaud, bless, submit, mock, reconcile, recommend, exalt, entertain, congratulate, complain, grieve, despair, wonder, exclaim, and what not! And all this with a variety and multiplication, even emulating speech.
With the head we invite, remand, confess, deny, give the lie, welcome, honour, reverence, disdain, demand, rejoice, lament, reject, caress, rebuke, submit, huff, encourage, threaten, assure, and inquire.
What with the eyebrows?—what with the shoulders! There is not a motion that does not speak, and in an intelligible language without discipline, and a public language that every one understands: whence it should follow, the variety and use distinguished from others considered, that these should rather be judged the property of human nature. I omit what necessity particularly does suddenly suggest to those who are in need;—the alphabets upon the fingers, grammars in gesture, and the sciences which are only by them exercised and expressed; and the nations that Pliny reports have no other language. An ambassador of the city of Abdera, after a long conference with Agis, King of Sparta, demanded of him, ""Well, sir, what answer must I return to my fellow-citizens?"" ""That I have given thee leave,"" said he, ""to say what thou wouldest, and as much as thou wouldest, without ever speaking a word."" is not this a silent speaking, and very easy to be understood?

As to the rest, what is there in us that we do not see in the operations of animals? Is there a polity better ordered, the offices better distributed, and more inviolably observed and maintained, than that of bees? Can we imagine that such, and so regular, a distribution of employments can be carried on without reasoning and deliberation?

              ""Hence to the bee some sages have assign'd
           Some portion of the god and heavenly wind.""
The swallows that we see at the return of the spring, searching all the corners of our houses for the most commodious places wherein to build their nest; do they seek without judgment, and amongst a thousand choose out the most proper for their purpose, without discretion? And in that elegant and admirable contexture of their buildings, can birds rather make choice of a square figure than a round, of an obtuse than of a right angle, without knowing their properties and effects? Do they bring water, and then clay, without knowing that the hardness of the latter grows softer by being wetted? Do they mat their palace with moss or down without foreseeing that their tender young will lie more safe and easy? Do they secure themselves from the wet and rainy winds, and place their lodgings against the east, without knowing the different qualities of the winds, and considering that one is more wholesome than another? Why does the spider make her web tighter in one place, and slacker in another; why now make one sort of knot, and then another, if she has not deliberation, thought, and conclusion? We sufficiently discover in most of their works how much animals excel us, and how unable our art is to imitate them. We see, nevertheless, in our rougher performances, that we employ all our faculties, and apply the utmost power of our souls; why do we not conclude the same of them?

Why should we attribute to I know not what natural and servile inclination the works that excel all we can do by nature and art? wherein, without being aware, we give them a mighty advantage over us in making nature, with maternal gentleness and love, accompany and learn them, as it were, by the hand to all the actions and commodities of their life, whilst she leaves us to chance and fortune, and to seek out by art the things that are necessary to our conservation, at the same time denying us the means of being able, by any instruction or effort of understanding, to arrive at the natural sufficiency of beasts; so that their brutish stupidity surpasses, in all conveniences, all that our divine intelligence can do. Really, at this rate, we might with great reason call her an unjust stepmother: but it is nothing so, our polity is not so irregular and unformed.

Nature has universally cared for all her creatures, and there is not one she has not amply furnished with all means necessary for the conservation of its being. For the common complaints I hear men make (as the license of their opinions one while lifts them up above the clouds, and then again depresses them to the antipodes), that we are the only animal abandoned naked upon the bare earth, tied and bound, not having wherewithal to arm and clothe us but by the spoil of others; whereas nature has covered all other creatures either with shells, husks, bark, hair, wool, prickles, leather, down, feathers, scales, or silk, according to the necessities of their being; has armed them with talons, teeth, or horns, wherewith to assault and defend, and has herself taught them that which is most proper for them, to swim, to run, to fly, and sing, whereas man neither knows how to walk, speak, eat, or do any thing but weep, without teaching;

               ""Like to the wretched mariner, when toss'd
         By raging seas upon the desert coast,
          The tender babe lies naked on the earth,
         Of all supports of life stript by his birth;
         When nature first presents him to the day,
         Freed from the cell wherein before he lay,
           He fills the ambient air with doleful cries.
          Foretelling thus life's future miseries;
            But beasts, both wild and tame, greater and less,
           Do of themselves in strength and bulk increase;
            They need no rattle, nor the broken chat,
            Ay which the nurse first teaches boys to prate
            They look not out for different robes to wear,
            According to the seasons of the year;
           And need no arms nor walls their goods to save,
            Since earth and liberal nature ever have,
          And will, in all abundance, still produce
         All things whereof they can have need or use:""
these complaints are false; there is in the polity of the world a greater equality and more uniform relation. Our skins are as sufficient to defend us from the injuries of the weather as theirs are; witness several nations that yet know not the use of clothes. Our ancient Gauls were but slenderly clad, any more than the Irish, our neighbours, though in so cold a climate; but we may better judge of this by ourselves: for all those parts that we are pleased to expose to the air are found very able to endure it: the face, the feet, the hands, the arms, the head, according to the various habit; if there be a tender part about us, and that would seem to be in danger from cold, it should be the stomach where the digestion is; and yet our forefathers were there always open, and our ladies, as tender and delicate as they are, go sometimes half-bare as low as the navel. Neither is the binding or swathing of infants any more necessary; and the Lacedmoman mothers brought theirs in all liberty of motion of members, without any ligature at all. Our crying is common with the greatest part of other animals, and there are but few creatures that are not observed to groan, and bemoan themselves a long time after they come into the world; forasmuch as it is a behaviour suitable to the weakness wherein they find themselves. As to the custom of eating, it is in us, as in them, natural, and without instruction;

""For every one soon finds his natural force.
Which he, or better may employ, or worse.""
Who doubts but an infant, arrived to the strength of feeding himself, may make shift to find something to eat And the earth produces and offers him wherewithal to supply his necessity, without other culture and artifice; and if not at all times, no more does she do it to beasts, witness the provision we see ants and other creatures hoard up against the dead seasons of the year. The late discovered nations, so abundantly furnished with natural meat and drink, without care, or without cookery, may give us to understand that bread is not our only food, and that, without tillage, our mother nature has provided us sufficiently of all we stand in need of: nay, it appears more fully and plentifully than she does at present, now that we have added our own industry:

                 ""The earth did first spontaneously afford
           Choice fruits and wines to furnish out the board;
           With herbs and flow'rs unsown in verdant fields.
          But scarce by art so good a harvest yields;
            Though men and oxen mutually have strove,
           With all their utmost force the soil t' improve,""
the debauchery and irregularity of our appetites outstrips all the inventions we can contrive to satisfy it.

As to arms, we have more natural ones than than most other animals more various motions of limbs, and naturally and without lesson extract more service from them. Those that are trained to fight naked are seen to throw themselves into the like hazards that we do. If some beasts surpass us in this advantage, we surpass many others. And the industry of fortifying the body, and covering it by acquired means, we have by instinct and natural precept? That it is so, the elephant shows who sharpen, and whets the teeth he makes use of in war (for he has particular ones for that service, which he spares, and never employs them at all to any other use); when bulls go to fight, they toss and throw the dust about them; boars whet their tusks; and the ichneumon, when he is about to engage with the crocodile, fortifies his body, and covers and crusts it all over with close-wrought and well-tempered slime, as with a cuirass. Why shall we not say that it is also natural for us to arm ourselves with wood and iron?

As to speech, it is certain that if it be not natural it is not necessary. Nevertheless I believe that a child which had been brought up in an absolute solitude, remote from all society of men (which would be an experiment very hard to make), would have some kind of speech to express his meaning by. And 'tis not to be supposed that nature should have denied that to us which she has given to several other animals: for what is this faculty we observe in them, of complaining, rejoicing, calling to one another for succour, and inviting each other to love, which they do with the voice, other than speech? And why should they not speak to one another? They speak to us, and we to them. In how many several sorts of ways do we speak to our dogs, and they answer us? We converse with them in another sort of language, and use other appellations, than we do with birds, hogs, oxen, horses, and alter the idiom according to the kind.

                ""Thus from one swarm of ants some sally out.
           To spy another's stock or mark its rout.""
Lactantius seems to attribute to beasts not only speech, but laughter also. And the difference of language which is seen amongst us, according to the difference of countries, is also observed in animals of the same kind. Aristotle, in proof of this, instances the Various calls of partridges, according to the situation of places:

                 ""And various birds do from their warbling throats
          At various times, utter quite different notes,
          And some their hoarse songs with the seasons change.""
But it is yet to be known what language this child would speak; and of that what is said by guess has no great appearance. If a man will allege to me, in opposition to this opinion, that those who are naturally deaf speak not, I answer that this is not only because they could not receive the instruction of speaking by ear, but rather because the sense of hearing, of which they are deprived, relates to that of speaking, and that these hold together by a natural and inseparable tie, in such manner that what we speak we must first speak to ourselves within, and make it sound in our own ears, before we can utter it to others.

All this I have said to prove the resemblance there is in human things, and to bring us back and join us to the crowd. We are neither above nor below the rest All that is under heaven, says the sage, runs one law and one fortune:

               ""All things remain
          Bound and entangled in one fatal chain.""
There is, indeed, some difference,—there are several orders and degrees; but it is under the aspect of one and the same nature:

              ""All things by their own rites proceed, and draw
         Towards their ends, by nature's certain law.""
Man must be compelled and restrained within the bounds of this polity. Miserable creature! he is not in a condition really to step over the rail. He is fettered and circumscribed, he is subjected to the same necessity that the other creatures of his rank and order are, and of a very mean condition, without any prerogative of true and real pre-eminence. That which he attributes to himself, by vain fancy and opinion, has neither body nor taste. And if it be so, that he only, of all the animals, has this liberty of imagination and irregularity of thoughts, representing to him that which is, that which is not, and that he would have, the false and the true, 'tis an advantage dearly bought, and of which he has very little reason to be proud; for thence springs the principal and original fountain of all the evils that befal him,—sin, sickness, irresolution, affliction, despair. I say, then, to return to my subject, that there is no appearance to induce a man to believe that beasts should, by a natural and forced inclination, do the same things that we do by our choice and industry. We ought from like effects to conclude like faculties, and from greater effects greater faculties; and consequently confess that the same reasoning, and the same ways by which we operate, are common with them, or that they have others that are better. Why should we imagine this natural constraint in them, who experience no such effect in ourselves? added that it is more honourable to be guided and obliged to act regularly by a natural and inevitable condition, and nearer allied to the divinity, than to act regularly by a temerarious and fortuitous liberty, and more safe to entrust the reins of our conduct in the hands of nature than our own. The vanity of our presumption makes us prefer rather to owe our sufficiency to our own exertions than to her bounty, and to enrich the other animals with natural goods, and abjure them in their favour, in order to honour and ennoble ourselves with goods acquired, very foolishly in my opinion; for I should as much value parts and virtues naturally and purely my own as those I had begged and obtained from education. It is not in our power to obtain a nobler reputation than to be favoured of God and nature.

For instance, take the fox, the people of Thrace make use of when they wish to pass over the ice of some frozen river, and turn him out before them to that purpose; when we see him lay his ear upon the bank of the river, down to the ice, to listen if from a more remote or nearer distance he can hear the noise of the waters' current, and, according as he finds by that the ice to be of a less or greater thickness, to retire or advance,—have we not reason to believe thence that the same rational thoughts passed through his head that we should have upon the like occasions; and that it is a ratiocination and consequence, drawn from natural sense, that that which makes a noise runs, that which runs is not frozen, what is not frozen is liquid, and that which is liquid yields to impression! For to attribute this to a mere quickness of the sense of hearing, without reason and consequence, is a chimra that cannot enter into the imagination. We are to suppose the same of the many sorts of subtleties and inventions with which beasts secure themselves from, and frustrate, the enterprizes we plot against them.

And if we will make an advantage even of this, that it is in our power to seize them, to employ them in our service, and to use them at our pleasure, 'tis still but the same advantage we have over one another.
We have our slaves upon these terms: the Climacid, were they not women in Syria who, squat on all fours, served for a ladder or footstool, by which the ladies mounted their coaches? And the greatest part of free persons surrender, for very trivial conveniences, their life and being into the power of another.
The wives and concubines of the Thracians contended who should be chosen to be slain upon their husband's tomb. Have tyrants ever failed of finding men enough vowed to their devotion? some of them moreover adding this necessity, of accompanying them in death as well as life? Whole armies have bound themselves after this manner to their captains. The form of the oath in the rude school of gladiators was in these words: ""We swear to suffer ourselves to be chained, burnt, wounded, and killed with the sword, and to endure all that true gladiators suffer from their master, religiously engaging both body and soul in his service.""

                 Uire meum, si vis, flamma caput, et pete ferro
           Corpus, et iutorto verbere terga seca.

                ""Wound me with steel, or burn my head with fire.
            Or scourge my shoulders with well-twisted wire.""
This was an obligation indeed, and yet there, in one year, ten thousand entered into it, to their destruction. When the Scythians interred their king they strangled upon his body the most beloved of his concubines, his cup-bearer, the master of his horse, his chamberlain, the usher of his chamber, and his cook. And upon the anniversary thereof they killed fifty horses, mounted by fifty pages, that they had impaled all up the spine of the back to the throat, and there left them fixed in triumph about his tomb. The men that serve us do it cheaper, and for a less careful and favourable usage than what we treat our hawks, horses and dogs withal. To what solicitude do we not submit for the conveniences of these? I do not think that servants of the most abject condition would willingly do that for their masters that princes think it an honour to do for their beasts. Diogenes seeing his relations solicitous to redeem, him from servitude: ""They are fools,"" said he; ""'tis he that keeps and nourishes me that in reality serves me."" And they who entertain beasts ought rather to be said to serve them, than to be served by them. And withal in this these have something more generous in that one lion never submitted to another lion, nor one horse to another, for want of courage. As we go to the chase of beasts, so do tigers and lions to the chase of men, and do the same execution upon one another; dogs upon hares, pikes upon tench, swallows upon grass-hoppers, and sparrow-hawks upon blackbirds and larks:

                ""The stork with snakes and lizards from the wood
            And pathless wilds supports her callow brood,
           While Jove's own eagle, bird of noble blood,
          Scours the wide country for undaunted food;
            Sweeps the swift hare or swifter fawn away,
           And feeds her nestlings with the generous prey.""
We divide the quarry, as well as the pains and labour of the chase, with our hawks and hounds. And about Amphipolis, in Thrace, the hawkers and wild falcons equally divide the prey in the half. As also along the lake Motis, if the fisherman does not honestly leave the wolves an equal share of what he has caught, they presently go and tear his nets in pieces. And as we have a way of sporting that is carried on more by subtlety than force, as springing hares, and angling with line and hook, there is also the like amongst other animals. Aristotle says that the cuttle-fish casts a gut out of her throat as long as a line, which she extends and draws back at pleasure; and as she perceives some little fish approach her she lets it nibble upon the end of this gut, lying herself concealed in the sand or mud, and by little and little draws it in, till the little fish is so near her that at one spring she may catch it.

As to strength, there is no creature in the world exposed to so many injuries as man. We need not a whale, elephant, or a crocodile, nor any such-like animals, of which one alone is sufficient to dispatch a great number of men, to do our business; lice are sufficient to vacate Sylla's dictatorship; and the heart and life of a great and triumphant emperor is the breakfast of a little contemptible worm!

Why should we say that it is only for man, or knowledge built up by art and meditation, to distinguish the things useful for his being, and proper for the cure of his diseases, and those which are not; to know the virtues of rhubarb and polypody. When we see the goats of Candia, when wounded with an arrow, among a million of plants choose out dittany for their cure; and the tortoise, when she has eaten a viper, immediately go out to look for origanum to purge her; the dragon to rub and clear his eyes with fennel; the storks to give themselves clysters of sea-water; the elephants to draw not only out of their own bodies, and those of their companions, but out of the bodies of their masters too (witness the elephant of King Porus whom Alexander defeated), the darts and javelins thrown at them in battle, and that so dexterously that we ourselves could not do it with so little pain to the patient;—why do we not say here also that this is knowledge and reason? For to allege, to their disparagement, that 'tis by the sole instruction and dictate of nature that they know all this, is not to take from them the dignity of knowledge and reason, but with greater force to attribute it to them than to us, for the honour of so infallible a mistress. Chrysippus, though in other things as scornful a judge of the condition of animals as any other philosopher whatever, considering the motions of a dog, who coming to a place where three ways met, either to hunt after his master he has lost, or in pursuit of some game that flies before him, goes snuffing first in one of the ways, and then in another, and, after having made himself sure of two, without finding the trace of what he seeks, dashes into the third without examination, is forced to confess that this reasoning is in the dog: ""I have traced my master to this place; he must of necessity be gone one of these three ways; he is not gone this way nor that, he must then infallibly be gone this other;"" and that assuring himself by this conclusion, he makes no use of his nose in the third way, nor ever lays it to the ground, but suffers himself to be carried on there bv the force of reason. This sally, purely logical, and this use of propositions divided and conjoined, and the right enumeration of parts, is it not every whit as good that the dog knows all this of himself as well as from Trapezuntius?

Animals are not incapable, however, of being instructed after our method. We teach blackbirds, ravens, pies, and parrots, to speak: and the facility wherewith we see they lend us their voices, and render both them and their breath so supple and pliant, to be formed and confined within a certain number of letters and syllables, does evince that they have a reason within, which renders them so docile and willing to learn. Everybody, I believe, is glutted with the several sorts of tricks that tumblers teach their dogs; the dances, where they do not miss any one cadence of the sound they hear; the several various motions and leaps they make them perform by the command of a word. But I observe this effect with the greatest admiration, which nevertheless is very common, in the dogs that lead the blind, both in the country and in cities: I have taken notice how they stop at certain doors, where they are wont to receive alms; how they avoid the encounter of coaches and carts, even there where they have sufficient room to pass; I have seen them, by the trench of a town, forsake a plain and even path and take a worse, only to keep their masters further from the ditch;—how could a man have made this dog understand that it was his office to look to his master's safely only, and to despise his own conveniency to serve him? And how had he the knowledge that a way was wide enough for him that was not so for a blind man? Can all this be apprehended without ratiocination!

I must not omit what Plutarch says he saw of a dog at Rome with the Emperor Vespasian, the father, at the theatre of Marcellus. This dog served a player, that played a farce of several parts and personages, and had therein his part. He had, amongst other things, to counterfeit himself for some time dead, by reason of a certain drug he was supposed to eat After he had swallowed a piece of bread, which passed for the drug, he began after awhile to tremble and stagger, as if he was taken giddy: at last, stretching himself out stiff, as if dead, he suffered himself to be drawn and dragged from place to place, as it was his part to do; and afterward, when he knew it to be time, he began first gently to stir, as if awaking out of a profound sleep, and lifting up his head looked about him after such a manner as astonished all the spectators.
The oxen that served in the royal gardens of Susa, to water them, and turn certain great wheels to draw water for that purpose, to which buckets were fastened (such as there are many in Languedoc), being ordered every one to draw a hundred turns a day, they were so accustomed to this number that it was impossible by any force to make them draw one turn more; but, their task being performed, they would suddenly stop and stand still. We are almost men before we can count a hundred, and have lately discovered nations that have no knowledge of numbers at all.

There is more understanding required in the teaching of' others than in being taught. Now, setting aside what Democritus held and proved, ""That most of the arts we have were taught us by other animals,"" as by the spider to weave and sew; by the swallow to build; by the swan and nightingale music; and by several animals to make medicines:—Aristotle is of opinion ""That the nightingales teach their young ones to sing, and spend a great deal of time and care in it;"" whence it happens that those we bring up in cages, and which have not had the time to learn of their parents, want much of the grace of their singing: we may judge by this that they improve by discipline and study; and, even amongst the wild, it is not all and every one alike—every one has learnt to do better or worse, according to their capacity. And so jealous are they one of another, whilst learning, that they contention with emulation, and by so vigorous a contention that sometimes the vanquished fall dead upon the place, the breath rather failing than the voice. The younger ruminate pensively and begin to mutter some broken notes; the disciple listens to the master's lesson, and gives the best account he is able; they are silent oy turns; one may hear faults corrected and observe some reprehensions of the teacher. "" have formerly seen,"" says Arrian, ""an elephant having a cymbal hung at each leg, and another fastened to his trunk, at the sound of which all the others danced round about him, rising and bending at certain cadences, as they were guided by the instrument; and 'twas delightful to hear this harmony."" In the spectacles of Rome there were ordinarily seen elephants taught to move and dance to the sound of the voice, dances wherein were several changes and cadences very hard to learn. And some have been known so intent upon their lesson as privately to practice it by themselves, that they might not be chidden nor beaten by their masters.
But this other story of the pie, of which we have Plutarch himself for a warrant, is very strange. She lived in a barber's shop at Rome, and did wonders in imitating with her voice whatever she heard. It happened one day that certain trumpeters stood a good while sounding before the shop. After that, and all the next day, the pie was pensive, dumb, and melancholic; which every body wondered at, and thought the noise of the trumpets had so stupified and astonished her that her voice was gone with her hearing. But they found at last that it was a profound meditation and a retiring into herself, her thoughts exercising and preparing her voice to imitate the sound of those trumpets, so that the first voice she uttered was perfectly to imitate their strains, stops, and changes; having by this new lesson quitted and taken in disdain all she had learned before.

I will not omit this other example of a dog, also, which the same Plutarch (I am sadly confounding all order, but I do not propose arrangement here any more than elsewhere throughout my book) which Plutarch says he saw on board a ship. This dog being puzzled how to get the oil that was in the bottom of a jar, which he could not reach with his tongue by reason of the narrow mouth of the vessel, went and fetched stones and let them fall into the jar till he made the oil rise so high that he could reach it.
What is this but an effect of a very subtle capacity! 'Tis said that the ravens of Barbary do the same, when the water they would drink is too low. This action is somewhat akin to what Juba, a king of their nation relates of the elephants: ""That when, by the craft of the hunter, one of them is trapped in certain deep pits prepared for them, and covered over with brush to deceive them, all the rest, in great diligence, bring a great many stones and logs of wood to raise the bottom so that he may get out."" But this animal, in several other effects, comes so near to human capacity that, should I particularly relate all that experience hath delivered to us, I should easily have what I usually maintain granted: namely, that there is more difference betwixt such and such a man than betwixt such a beast and such a man. The keeper of an elephant in a private house of Syria robbed him every meal of the half of his allowance.
One day his master would himself feed him, and poured the full measure of barley he had ordered for his allowance into his manger which the elephant, casting an angry look at the keeper, with his trunk separated the one-half from the other, and thrust it aside, by that declaring the wrong was done him.
And another, having a keeper that mixed stones with his corn to make up the measure, came to the pot where he was boiling meat for his own dinner, and filled it with ashes. These are particular effects: but that which all the world has seen, and all the world knows, that in all the armies of the Levant one of the greatest force consisted in elephants, with whom they did, without comparison, much greater execution than we now do with our artillery; which takes, pretty nearly, their place in a day of battle (as may easily be supposed by such as are well read in ancient history);

                  ""The sires of these huge animals were wont
          The Carthaginian Hannibal to mount;
          Our leaders also did these beasts bestride,
           And mounted thus Pyrrhus his foes defied;
           Nay, more, upon their backs they used to bear
         Castles with armed cohorts to the war.""
They must necessarily have very confidently relied upon the fidelity and understanding of these beasts when they entrusted them with the vanguard of a battle, where the least stop they should have made, by reason of the bulk and heaviness of their bodies, and the least fright that should have made them face about upon their own people, had been enough to spoil all: and there are but few examples where it has happened that they have fallen foul upon their own troops, whereas we ourselves break into our own battalions and rout one another. They had the charge not of one simple movement only, but of many several things to be performed in the battle: as the Spaniards did to their dogs in their new conquest of the Indies, to whom they gave pay and allowed them a share in the spoil; and those animals showed as much dexterity and judgment in pursuing the victory and stopping the pursuit; in charging and retiring, as occasion required; and in distinguishing their friends from their enemies, as they did ardour and fierceness.

We more admire and value things that are unusual and strange than those of ordinary observation. I had not else so long insisted upon these examples: for I believe whoever shall strictly observe what we ordinarily see in those animals we have amongst us may there find as wonderful effects as those we seek in remote countries and ages. 'Tis one and the same nature that rolls on her course, and whoever has sufficiently considered the present state of things, might certainly conclude as to both the future ana the past. I have formerly seen men, brought hither by sea from very distant countries, whose language not being understood by us, and moreover their mien, countenance, and habit, being quite differing from ours; which of us did not repute them savages and brutes! Who did not attribute it to stupidity and want of common sense to see them mute, ignorant of the French tongue, ignorant of our salutations and cringes, our port and behaviour, from which all human nature must by all means take its pattern and example. All that seems strange to us, and that we do not understand, we condemn. The same thing happens also in the judgments we make of beasts. They have several conditions like to ours; from those we may, by comparison, draw some conjecture: but by those qualities that are particular to themselves, what know we what to make of them! The horses, dogs, oxen, sheep, birds, and most of the animals that live amongst us, know our voices, and suffer themselves to be governed by them: so did Crassus's lamprey, and came when he called it; as also do the eels that are found in the Lake Arethusa; and I have seen several ponds where the fishes come to eat at a certain call of those who use to feed them.

              ""They every one have names, and one and all
         Straightway appear at their own master's call:""
We may judge of that. We may also say that the elephants have some participation of religion forasmuch as after several washings and purifications they are observed to lift up their trunk like arms, and, fixing their eyes towards the rising of the sun, continue long in meditation and contemplation, at certain hours of the days, of their own motion; without instruction or precept But because we do not see any such signs in other animals, we cannot for that conclude that they are without religion, nor make any judgment of what is concealed from us. As we discern something in this action which the philosopher Cleanthes took notice of, because it something resembles our own. He saw, he says, ""Ants go from their ant-hill, carrying the dead body of an ant towards another ant-hill, whence several other ants came out to meet them, as if to speak with them; where, after having been a while together, the last returned to consult, you may suppose, with their fellow-citizens, and so made two or three journeys, by reason of the difficulty of capitulation. In the conclusion, the last comers brought the first a worm out of their burrow, as it were for the ransom of the defunct, which the first laid upon their backs and carried home, leaving the dead body to the others."" This was the interpretation that Cleanthes gave of this transaction, giving us by that to understand that those creatures that have no voice are not, nevertheless, without intercourse and mutual communication, whereof 'tis through our own defect that we do not participate; and for that reason foolishly take upon us to pass our censure. But they yet produce either effects far beyond our capacity, to which we are so far from being able to arrive by imitation that we cannot so much as by imitation conceive it. Many are of opinion that in the great and last naval engagement that Antony lost to Augustus, his admiral galley was stayed in the middle of her course by the little fish the Latins call remora, by reason of the property she has of staying all sorts of vessels to which she fastens herself. And the Emperor Caligula, sailing with a great navy upon the coast of Romania, his galley only was suddenly stayed by the same fish, which, he caused to be taken, fastened as it was to the keel of his ship, very angry that such a little animal could resist both the sea, the wind, and the force of all his oars, by being only fastened by the beak to his galley (for it is a shell-fish); and was moreover, not without great reason, astonished that, being brought to him in the vessel, it had no longer the strength it had without. A citizen of Cyzicus formerly acquired the reputation of a good mathematician for having learnt the quality of the hedge-hog: he has his burrow open in divers places, and to several winds, and, foreseeing the wind that is to come, stops the hole on that side, which that citizen observing, gave the city certain predictions of the wind which was presently to blow. The camlon takes her colour from the place upon which she is laid; but the polypus gives himself what colour he pleases, according to occasion, either to conceal himself from what he fears, or from what he has a design to seize: in the camlon 'tis a passive, but in the polypus 'tis an active, change. We have some changes of colour, as in fear, anger, shame, and other passions, that alter our complexions; but it is by the effect of suffering, as with the camlon. It is in the power of the jaundice, indeed, to make us turn yellow, but 'tis not in the power of our own will. Now these effects that we discover in other animals, much greater than ours, seem to imply some more excellent faculty in them unknown to us; as 'tis to be presumed there are several other qualities and abilities of theirs, of which no appearances have arrived at us.

Amongst all the predictions of elder times, the most ancient and the most certain were those taken from the flight of birds; we have nothing certain like it, nor any thing to be so much admired. That rule and order of the moving of the wing, whence they derived the consequences of future things, must of necessity be guided by some excellent means to so noble an operation: for to attribute this great effect to any natural disposition, without the intelligence, consent, and meditation of him by whom it is produced, is an opinion evidently false. That it is so, the cramp-fish has this quality, not only to benumb all the members that touch her, but even through the nets transmit a heavy dulness into the hands of those that move and handle them; nay, it is further said that if one pour water upon her, he will feel this numbness mount up the water to the hand, and stupefy the feeling through the water. This is a miraculous force; but 'tis not useless to the cramp-fish; she knows it, and makes use on't; for, to catch the prey she desires, she will bury herself in the mud, that other fishes swimming over her, struck and benumbed with this coldness of hers, may fall into her power. Cranes, swallows, and other birds of passage, by shifting their abode according to the seasons, sufficiently manifest the knowledge they have of their divining faculty, and put it in use. Huntsmen assure us that to cull out from amongst a great many puppies that which ought to be preserved as the best, the best way is to refer the choice to the mother; as thus, take them and carry them out of the kennel, and the first she brings back will certainly be the best; or if you make a show as if you would environ the kennel with fire, that one she first catches up to save. By which it appears they have a sort of prognostic which we have not; or that they have some virtue in judging of their whelps other and more certain than we have.

The manner of coming into the world, of engendering, nourishing, acting, moving, living and dying of beasts, is so near to ours that whatever we retrench from their moving causes, and add to our own condition above theirs, can by no means proceed from any meditation of our own reason. For the regimen of our health, physicians propose to us the example of the beasts' manners and way of living; for this saying (out of Plutarch) has in all times been in the mouth of these people: ""Keep warm thy feet and head, as to the rest, live like a beast.""

The chief of all natural actions is generation; we have a certain disposition of members which is the most proper for us to that end; nevertheless, we are ordered by Lucretius to conform to the gesture and posture of the brutes as the most effectual:—

                More ferarum,
         Quadrupedumque magis ritu, plerumque putantur
          Concipere uxores:
           Quia sic loca sumere possunt,
           Pectoribus positis, sublatis semina lumbis;
and the same authority condemns, as hurtful, those indiscreet and impudent motions which the women have added of their own invention, to whom it proposes the more temperate and modest pattern and practice of the beasts of their own sex:—

                 Nam mulier prohibet se concipere atque rpugnt,
           Clunibus ipsa viri Venerem si lta retractet,
           Atque exossato ciet omni pectore fluctua.
           Ejicit enim sulci recta regione viaque
          Vomerem, atque locis avertit seminis ictum.
If it be justice to render to every one their due, the beasts that serve, love, and defend their benefactors, and that pursue and fall upon strangers and those who offend them, do in this represent a certain air of our justice; as also in observing a very equitable equality in the distribution of what they have to their young. And as to friendship, they have it without comparison more lively and constant than men have. King Lysimachus's dog, Hyrcanus, master being dead, lay on his bed, obstinately refusing either to eat or drink; and, the day that his body was burnt, he took a run and leaped into the fire, where he was consumed, As also did the dog of one Pyrrhus, for he would not stir from off his master's bed from the time he died; and when they carried him away let himself be carried with him, and at last leaped into the pile where they burnt his master's body. There are inclinations of affection which sometimes spring in us, without the consultation of reason; and by a fortuitous temerity, which others call sympathy; of which beasts are as capable as we. We see horses take such an acquaintance with one another that we have much ado to make them eat or travel, when separated; we observe them to fancy a particular colour in those of their own kind, and, where they meet it, run to it with great joy and demonstrations of good will, and have a dislike and hatred for some other colour. Animals have choice, as well as we, in their amours, and cull out their mistresses; neither are they exempt from our jealousies and implacable malice.

Desires are either natural and necessary, as to eat and drink; or natural and not necessary, as the coupling with females; or neither natural nor necessary; of which last sort are almost all the desires of men; they are all superfluous and artificial. For 'tis marvellous how little will satisfy nature, how little she has left us to desire; our ragouts and kickshaws are not of her ordering. The Stoics say that a man may live on an olive a day. The delicacy of our wines is no part of her instruction, nor the refinements we introduce into the indulgence of our amorous appetites:—

                  Neque ilia
            Magno prognatum deposcit consule cunnum.

                 ""Nature, in her pursuit of love, disclaims
           The pride of titles, and the pomp of names.""
These irregular desires, that the ignorance of good and a false opinion have infused into us, are so many that they almost exclude all the natural; just as if there were so great a number of strangers in the city as to thrust out the natural inhabitants, or, usurping upon their ancient rights and privileges, should extinguish their authority and introduce new laws and customs of their own. Animals are much more regular than we, and keep themselves with greater moderation within the limits nature has prescribed; but yet not so exactly that they have not sometimes an analogy with our debauches. And as there have been furious desires that have impelled men to the love of beasts, so there have been examples of beasts that have fallen in love with us, and been seized with monstrous affection betwixt kinds; witness the elephant who was rival to Aristophanes the grammarian in the love of a young herb-wench in the city of Alexandria, who was nothing behind him in all the offices of a very passionate suitor; for going through the market where they sold fruit, he would take some in his trunk and carry them to her. He would as much as possible keep her always in his sight, and would sometimes put his trunk under her handkerchief into her bosom, to feel her breasts. They tell also of a dragon in love with a girl, and of a goose enamoured of a child; of a ram that was suitor to the minstrelless Glaucia, in the town of Asopus; and we see not unfrequently baboons furiously in love with women. We see also certain male animals that are fond of the males of their own kind. Oppian and others give us some examples of the reverence that beasts have to their kindred in their copulations; but experience often shows us the contrary:—

                  Nec habetur turpe juvenc
           Ferre patrem tergo; fit equo sua filia conjux;
           Quasque creavit, init pecudes caper; ipsaque cujus
            Semine concepta est, ex illo concipit ales.

                ""The heifer thinks it not a shame to take
          Her lusty sire upon her willing back:
           The horse his daughter leaps, goats scruple not
           T' increase the herd by those they have begot;
         And birds of all sorts do in common live,
         And by the seed they have conceived conceive.""
And for subtle cunning, can there be a more pregnant example than in the philosopher Thales's mule? who, fording a river, laden with salt, and by accident stumbling there, so that the sacks he carried were all wet, perceiving that by the melting of the salt his burden was something lighter, he never failed, so oft as he came to any river, to lie down with his load; till his master, discovering the knavery, ordered that he should be laden with wood? wherein, finding himself mistaken, he ceased to practise that device. There are several that very vividly represent the true image of our avarice; for we see them infinitely solicitus to get all they can, and hide it with that exceeding great care, though they never make any use of it at all. As to thrift, they surpass us not only in the foresight and laying up, and saving for the time to come, but they have, moreover, a great deal of the science necessary thereto. The ants bring abroad into the sun their grain and seed to air, refresh and dry them when they perceive them to mould and grow musty, lest they should decay and rot. But the caution and prevention they use in gnawing their grains of wheat surpass all imagination of human prudence; for by reason that the wheat does not always continue sound and dry, but grows soft, thaws and dissolves as if it were steeped in milk, whilst hasting to germination; for fear lest it should shoot and lose the nature and property of a magazine for their subsistence, they nibble off the end by which it should shoot and sprout.

As to what concerns war, which is the greatest and most magnificent of human actions, I would very fain know whether we would use it for an argument of some prerogative or, on contrary, for a testimony of our weakness and imperfection; as, in truth, the science of undoing and killing one another, and of ruining and destroying our own kind, has nothing in it so tempting as to make it be coveted by beasts who have it not.

                  Quando leoni Fortior eripuit vitam leo? quo nemore unquam
           Expiravit aper majoris dentibus apri?

                 ""No lion drinks a weaker lion's gore,
            No boar expires beneath a stronger boar.""
Yet are they not universally exempt; witness the furious encounters of bees, and the enterprises of the princes of the contrary armies:—

            Spe duobus Regibus incessit magno discordia motu;
           Continuoque animos vulgi et trepidantia bello
           Gorda licet long prsciscere.

                 ""But if contending factions arm the hive,
           When rival kings in doubtful battle strive,
           Tumultuous crowds the dread event prepare,
           And palpitating hearts that beat to war.""
I never read this divine description but that, methinks, I there see human folly and vanity represented in their true and lively colours. For these warlike movements, that so ravish us with their astounding noise and horror, this rattle of guns, drums, and cries,

               Fulgur ibi ad coelum se tollit, totaque circum
           re renidescit tellus, subterque virm vi
            Excitur pedibus sonitus, clamoreque montes
            Icti rejectant voces ad sidera mundi;

                 ""When burnish'd arms to heaven dart their rays,
            And many a steely beam i' th' sunlight plays,
           When trampled is the earth by horse and man,
          Until the very centre groans again,
           And that the rocks, struck by the various cries,
          Reverberate the sound unto the skies;""
in the dreadful embattling of so many thousands of armed men, and so great fury, ardour, and courage, 'tis pleasant to consider by what idle occasions they are excited, and by how light ones appeased:—

                 Paridis propter narratur amorem
           Greci Barbari diro collisa duello:

                ""Of wanton Paris the illicit love
            Did Greece and Troy to ten years' warfare move:""
all Asia was ruined and destroyed for the lust of Paris; the envy of one single man, a despite, a pleasure, a domestic jealousy, causes that ought not to set two oyster-wenches by the ears, is the mover of all this mighty bustle. Shall we believe those very men who are themselves the principal authors of these mischiefs? Let us then hear the greatest, the most powerful, the most victorious emperor that ever was, turning into a jest, very pleasantly and ingeniously, several battles fought both by sea and land, the blood and lives of five hundred thousand men that followed his fortune, and the strength and riches of two parts of the world drained for the expense of his expeditions:—

                 Quod futuit Glaphyran Antonius, hanc mihi poenam
           Fulvia constituit, se quoqne uti futuam.
           Fulviam ego ut futuam! quid, si me Manius oret
           Podicem, faciam? Non puto, si sapiam.
          Aut futue, aut pugnemus, ait
           Quid, si mihi vitii
          Charior est ips mentula? Signa canant.

                  Qui? moi, que je serve Fulvie!
          Sufflt-il quelle en ait envie?
           A ce compte, on verrait se retirer von moi
           Mille pouses mal satisfaites.
         Aime-moi, me dit elle, ou combattons. Mais quoi?
           Elle est bien laide! Allons, sonnes trompettes.

           'Cause Anthony is fired with Glaphire's charms
          Fain would his Fulvia tempt me to her arms.
          If Anthony be false, what then? must I
           Be slave to Fulvia's lustful tyranny?
            Then would a thousand wanton, waspish wives,
(I use my Latin with the liberty of conscience you are pleased to allow me.) Now this great body, with so many fronts, and so many motions, which seems to threaten heaven and earth:—

                Quam multi Lybico volvuntur marmore fluctus,
           Svus ubi Orion hibemis conditur undis,
            Vel quam solo novo dens torrentur Arist,
            Aut Hermi campo, aut Lyci flaventibus arvis;
           Scuta sonant, pulsuque pedum tremit excita tellus:

                   ""Not thicker billows beat the Lybian main,
            When pale Orion sits in wintry rain;
           Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise,
          Or Lycian fields, when Phobus burns the skies,
           Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around;
           Their trampling turns the turf and shakes the solid ground:""
this furious monster, with so many heads and arms, is yet man—feeble, calamitous, and miserable man! 'Tis but an ant-hill disturbed and provoked:—

         It nigrum campis agmen:

         ""The black troop marches to the field:""
a contrary blast, the croaking of a flight of ravens, the stumble of a horse, the casual passage of an eagle, a dream, a voice, a sign, a morning mist, are any one of them sufficient to beat down and overturn him. Dart but a sunbeam in his face, he is melted and vanished. Blow but a little dust in his eyes, as our poet says of the bees, and all our ensigns and legions, with the great Pompey himself at the head of them, are routed and crushed to pieces; for it was he, as I take it, that Sertorious beat in Spain with those fine arms, which also served Eumenes against Antigonus, and Surena against Crassus:—

                 ""Swarm to my bed like bees into their hives.
          Declare for love, or war, she said; and frown'd:
          No love I'll grant: to arms bid trumpets sound.""
                 Hi motus animorum, atque hoc certamina tanta,
          Pulveris exigui jactu compressa quiescent.

                ""Yet at thy will these dreadful conflicts cease,
            Throw but a little dust and all is peace.""
Let us but slip our flies after them, and they will have the force and courage to defeat them. Of fresh memory, the Portuguese having besieged the city of Tamly, in the territory of Xiatine, the inhabitants of the place brought a great many hives, of which are great plenty in that place, upon the wall; and with fire drove the bees so furiously upon the enemy that they gave over the enterprise, not being able to stand their attacks and endure their stings; and so the citizens, by this new sort of relief, gained liberty and the victory with so wonderful a fortune, that at the return of their defenders from the battle they found they had not lost so much as one. The souls of emperors and cobblers are cast in the same mould; the weight and importance of the actions of princes considered, we persuade ourselves that they must be produced by some as weighty and important causes; but we are deceived; for they are pushed on, and pulled back in their motions, by the same springs that we are in our little undertakings. The same reason that makes us wrangle with a neighbour causes a war betwixt princes; the same reason that makes us whip a lackey, falling into the hands of a king makes him ruin a whole province. They are as lightly moved as we, but they are able to do more. In a gnat and an elephant the passion is the same.

As to fidelity, there is no animal in the world so treacherous as man. Our histories have recorded the violent pursuits that dogs have made after the murderers of their masters. King Pyrrhus observing a dog that watched a dead man's body, and understanding that he had for three days together performed that office, commanded that the body should be buried, and took the dog along with him. One day, as he was at a general muster of his army, this dog, seeing his master's murderers, with great barking and extreme signs of anger flew upon them, and by this first accusation awakened the revenge of this murder, which was soon after perfected by form of justice. As much was done by the dog of the wise Hesiod, who convicted the sons of Ganictor of Naupactus of the murder committed on the person of his master. Another dog being to guard a temple at Athens, having spied a sacrilegious thief carrying away the finest jewels, fell to barking at him with all his force, but the warders not awaking at the noise, he followed him, and day being broke, kept off at a little distance, without losing sight of him; if he offered him any thing to eat he would not take it, but would wag his tail at all the passengers he met, and took whatever they gave him; and if the thief laid down to sleep, he likewise stayed upon the same place. The news of this dog being come to the warders of the temple they put themselves upon the pursuit, inquiring of the colour of the dog, and at last found him in the city of Cromyon, and the thief also, whom they brought back to Athens, where he got his reward; and the judges, in consideration of this good office, ordered a certain measure of corn for the dog's daily sustenance, at the public charge, and the priests to take care of it. Plutarch delivers this story for a certain truth, and that it happened in the age wherein he lived.

As to gratitude (for I think we need bring this word into a little repute), this one example, which Apion reports himself to have been an eye-witness of, shall suffice.

""One day,"" says he, ""at Rome, they entertained the people with the sight of the fighting of several strange beasts, and principally of lions of an unusual size; there was one amongst the rest who, by his furious deportment, by the strength and largeness of his limbs, and by his loud and dreadful roaring, attracted the eyes of all the spectators. Amongst other slaves that were presented to the people in this combat of beasts there was one Androdus, of Dacia, belonging to a Roman lord of consular dignity. This lion having seen him at a distance first made a sudden stop, as it were in a wondering posture, and then softly approached nearer in a gentle and peaceable manner, as if it were to enter into acquaintance with him. This being done, and being now assured of what he sought for, he began to wag his tail, as dogs do when they flatter their masters, and to kiss and lick the hands and thighs of the poor wretch, who was beside himself, and almost dead with fear. Androdus being by this kindness of the lion a little come to himself, and having taken so much heart as to consider and know him, it was a singular pleasure to see the joy and caresses that passed betwixt them. At which the people breaking into loud acclamations of joy, the emperor caused the slave to be called, to know from him the cause of so strange an event; who thereupon told him a new and a very strange story: ""My master,"" said he, ""being pro-consul in Africa, I was constrained, by his severity and cruel usage, being daily beaten, to steal from him and run away; and, to hide myself secretly from a person of so great authority in the province, I thought it my best way to fly to the solitudes, sands, and uninhabitable parts of that country, resolving that in case the means of supporting life should chance to fail me, to make some shift or other to kill myself. The sun being excessively hot at noon, and the heat intolerable, I lit upon a private and almost inaccessible cave, and went into it Soon after there came in to me this lion, with one foot wounded and bloody, complaining and groaning with the pain he endured. At his coming I was exceeding afraid; but he having spied me hid in the comer of his den, came gently to me, holding out and showing me his wounded foot, as if he demanded my assistance in his distress. I then drew out a great splinter he had got there, and, growing a little more familiar with him, squeezing the wound thrust out the matter, dirt, and gravel which was got into it, and wiped and cleansed it the best I could. He, finding himself something better, and much eased of his pain, laid him down to rest, and presently fell asleep with his foot in my hand. From that time forward he and I lived together in this cave three whole years upon one and the same diet; for of the beasts that he killed in hunting he always brought me the best pieces, which I roasted in the sun for want of fire, and so ate it. At last, growing weary of this wild and brutish life, the lion being one day gone abroad to hunt for our ordinary provision, I departed thence, and the third day after was taken by the soldiers, who brought me from Africa to this city to my master, who presently condemned me to die, and to be thus exposed to the wild beasts. Now, by what I see, this lion was also taken soon after, who has now sought to recompense me for the benefit and cure that he received at my hands."" This is the story that Androdus told the emperor, which he also conveyed from hand to hand to the people; wherefore, at the general request, he was absolved from his sentence and set at liberty, and the lion was, by order of the people, presented to him. ""We afterwards saw,"" says Apion, ""Androdus leading this lion, in nothing but a small leash, from tavern to tavern at Rome, and receiving what money every body would give him, the lion being so gentle as to suffer himself to be covered with the flowers that the people threw upon him, every one that met him saying, 'There goes the lion that entertained the man; there goes the man that cured the lion.'""

We often lament the loss of beasts we love, and so do they the loss of us:—

                 Post, bellator equus, positis insignibus, thon
          It lacrymans, guttisque humectt grandibus ora.

                 ""To close the pomp, thon, the steed of state.
            Is led, the fun'ral of his lord to wait.
          Stripped of his trappings, with a sullen pace
          He walks, and the big tears run rolling down his face.""
As some nations have their wives in common, and some others have every one his own, is not the same seen among beasts, and marriages better kept than ours? As to the society and confederation they make amongst themselves, to league together and to give one another mutual assistance, is it not known that oxen, hogs, and other animals, at the cry of any of their kind that we offend, all the herd run to his aid and embody for his defence? The fish Scarus, when he has swallowed the angler's hook, his fellows all crowd about him and gnaw the line in pieces; and if, by chance, one be got into the bow net, the others present him their tails on the outside, which he holding fast with his teeth, they after that manner disengage and draw him out.

Mullets, when one of their companions is engaged, cross the line over their back, and, with a fin they have there, indented like a saw, cut and saw it asunder. As to the particular offices that we receive from one another for the service of life, there are several like examples amongst them. 'Tis said that the whale never moves that she has not always before her a little fish like the sea-gudgeon, for this reason called the guide-fish, whom the whale follows, suffering himself to be led and turned with as great facility as the rudder guides the ship; in recompense of which service also, whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, that enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster's mouth, are immediately lost and swallowed up, this little fish retires into it in great security, and there sleeps, during which time the whale never stirs; but so soon as ever it goes out he immediately follows it; and if by accident he loses the sight of his little guide, he goes wandering here and there, and strikes his sides against the rocks like a ship that has lost her helm; which Plutarch affirms to have seen in the island of Anticyra. There is a like society betwixt the little bird called the wren and the crocodile. The wren serves for a sentinel over this great animal; and if the ichneumon, his mortal enemy, approach to fight him, this little bird, for fear lest he should surprise him asleep, both with his voice and bill rouses him and gives him notice of his danger.
He feeds of this monster's leavings, who receives him familiarly into his mouth, suffering him to peck in his jaws and betwixt his teeth, and thence to pick out the bits of flesh that remain; and when he has a mind to shut his mouth, he first gives the bird warning to go out by closing it by little and little, and without bruising or doing it any harm at all. The shell-fish called the naker, lives in the same intelligence with the shrimp, a little sort of animal of the lobster kind, which serves him in the nature of a porter, sitting at the opening of the shell, which the naker keeps always gaping and open till the shrimp sees some little fish, proper for their prey, within the hollow of the shell, where she enters too, and pinches the naker so to the quick that she is forced to close her shell, where they two together devour the prey they have trapped in their fort. In the manner of living of the tunnies we observe a singular knowledge of the three parts of mathematics. As to astrology, they teach it men, for they stay in the place where they are surprised by the brumal solstice, and never stir thence till the next equinox; for which reason Aristotle himself attributes to them this science. As to geometry and arithmetic, they always form their numbers in the figure of a cube, every way square, and make up the body of a battalion, solid, close, and environed round with six equal sides, and swim in this square order, as large behind as before; so that whoever in seeing them can count one rank may easily number the whole troop, by reason that the depth is equal to the breadth, and the breadth to the length.

As to magnanimity, it will be hard to exhibit a better instance of it than in the example of the great dog sent to Alexander the Great from the Indies. They first brought him a stag to encounter, next a boar, and after that a bear, all which he slighted, and disdained to stir from his place; but when he saw a lion he then immediately roused himself, evidently manifesting that he declared that alone worthy to enter the lists with him. Touching repentance and the acknowledgment of faults, 'tis reported of an elephant that, having in the impetuosity of his rage killed his keeper, he fell into so extreme a sorrow that he would never after eat, but starved himself to death. And as to clemency, 'tis said of a tiger, the most cruel of all beasts, that a kid having been put in to him, he suffered a two days' hunger rather than hurt it, and the third broke the grate he was shut up in, to seek elsewhere for prey; so unwilling he was to fall upon the kid, his familiar and his guest, And as to the laws of familiarity and agreement, formed by conversation, it ordinarily happens that we bring up cats, dogs, and hares, tame together.

But that which seamen by experience know, and particularly in the Sicilian Sea, of the quality of the halcyons, surpasses all human thought of what kind of animal has nature even so much honoured the birth? The poets indeed say that one only island, Delos, which was before a floating island, was fixed for the service of Latona's lying-in; but God has ordered that the whole ocean should be stayed, made stable and smooth, without waves, without winds or rain, whilst the halcyon produces her young, which is just about the solstice, the shortest day of the year; so that by her privilege we have seven days and seven nights in the very heart of winter wherein we may sail without danger. Their females never have to do with any other male but their own, whom they serve and assist all their lives, without ever forsaking him. If he becomes weak and broken with age, they take him upon their shoulders and carry him from place to place, and serve him till death. But the most inquisitive into the secrets of nature could never yet arrive at the knowledge of the wonderful fabric wherewith the halcyon builds her nest for her little ones, nor guess at the materials. Plutarch, who has seen and handled many of them, thinks it is the bones of some fish which she joins and binds together, interlacing them, some lengthwise and others across, and adding ribs and hoops in such manner that she forms at last a round vessel fit to launch; which being done, and the building finished, she carries it to the beach, where the sea beating gently against it shows where she is to mend what is not well jointed and knit, and where better to fortify the seams that are leaky, that open at the beating of the waves; and, on the contrary, what is well built and has had the due finishing, the beating of the waves does so close and bind together that it is not to be broken or cracked by blows either of stone or iron without very much ado. And that which is more to be admired is the proportion and figure of the cavity within, which is composed and proportioned after such a manner as not to receive or admit any other thing than the bird that built it; for to any thing else it is so impenetrable, close, and shut, nothing can enter, not so much as the water of the sea. This is a very dear description of this building, and borrowed from a very good hand; and yet me-thinks it does not give us sufficient light into the difficulty of this architecture. Now from what vanity can it proceed to despise and look down upon, and disdainfully to interpret, effects that we can neither imitate nor comprehend?

To pursue a little further this equality and correspondence betwixt us and beasts, the privilege our soul so much glorifies herself upon, of things she conceives to her own law, of striping all things that come to her of their mortal and corporeal qualities, of ordering and placing things she conceives worthy her taking notice of, stripping and divesting them of their corruptible qualities, and making them to lay aside length, breadth, depth, weight, colour, smell, roughness, smoothness, hardness, softness, and all sensible accidents, as mean and superfluous vestments, to accommodate them to her own immortal and spiritual condition; as Rome and Paris, for example, that I have in my fancy, Paris that I imagine, I imagine and comprehend it without greatness and without place, without stone, without plaster, and without wood; this very same privilege, I say, seems evidently to be in beasts; for a courser accustomed to trumpets, to musket-shots, and battles, whom we see start and tremble in his sleep and stretched upon his litter, as if he were in a fight; it is almost certain that he conceives in his soul the beat of a drum without noise, and an army without arms and without body:—

                 Quippe videbis equos fortes, cum membra jacebunt
          In somnis, sudare tamen, spirareque spe,
            Et quasi de palm summas contendere vires:

                  ""You shall see maneg'd horses in their sleep
            Sweat, snort, start, tremble, and a clutter keep,
           As if with all their force they striving were
            The victor's palm proudly away to bear:""
the hare, that a greyhound imagines in his sleep, after which we see him pant so whilst he sleeps, stretch out his tail, shake his legs, and perfectly represents all the motions of a course, is a hare without fur and without bones:—

           Venantumque canes in molli spe quiete
          Jactant crura tamen subito, vocesque repente
         Mittunt, et crebras reducunt naribus auras,
           Ut vestigia si teneant inventa ferarum:
          Expergeftique sequuntur inania spe
          Cervorum simulacra, fag quasi dedita cernant;
           Donee discussis redeant erroribus ad se:

               ""And hounds stir often in their quiet rest,
         Spending their mouths, as if upon a quest,
         Snuff, and breathe quick and short, as if they went
          In a full chase upon a burning scent:
         Nay, being wak'd, imagin'd stags pursue,
         As if they had them in their real view,
         Till, having shook themselves more broad awake,
         They do at last discover the mistake:""
the watch-dogs, that we often observe to snarl in their dreams, and afterwards bark out, and start up as if they perceived some stranger at hand; the stranger that their soul discerns is a man spiritual and imperceptible, without dimension, without colour, and without being:—

                Consueta domi catulorum blanda propago
            Degere, spe levem ex oculis volucremque soporem
           Discutere, et corpus de terra corripere instant,
           Proinde quasi ignotas facies atque ora tuantur.

                 ""The fawning whelps of household curs will rise,
          And, shaking the soft slumber from their eyes,
          Oft bark and stare at ev'ry one within,
          As upon faces they had never seen.""
to the beauty of the body, before I proceed any further I should know whether or no we are agreed about the description. 'Tis likely we do not well know what beauty is in nature and in general, since to our own human beauty we give so many divers forms, of which, were there any natural rule and prescription, we should know it in common, as the heat of the fire. But we fancy the forms according to our own appetite and liking:—

         Turpis Romano Belgicus ore color:

         ""A German hue ill suits, a Roman face.""
The Indians paint it black and tawny, with great swelled lips, wide flat noses and load the cartilage betwixt the nostrils with great rings of gold, to make it hang down to the mouth; as also the under lip with great hoops, enriched with precious stones, that weigh them down to fall upon the chin, it being with them a singular grace to show their teeth, even below the roots. In Peru the greatest ears are the most beautiful, which they stretch out as far as they can by art. And a man now living says that he has seen in an eastern nation this care of enlarging them in so great repute, and the ear loaded with so ponderous jewels, that he did with great ease put his arm, sleeve and all, through the hole of an ear. There are elsewhere nations that take great care to black their teeth, and hate to see them white, whilst others paint them red. The women are reputed more beautiful, not only in Biscay, but elsewhere, for having their heads shaved; and, which is more, in certain frozen countries, as Pliny reports. The Mexicans esteem a low forehead a great beauty, and though they shave all other parts, they nourish hair on the forehead and increase it by art, and have great breasts in so great reputation that they affect to give their children suck over their shoulders. We should paint deformity so. The Italians fashion it gross and massy; the Spaniards gaunt and slender; and amongst us one has it white, another brown; one soft and delicate, another strong and vigorous; one will have his mistress soft and gentle, others haughty and majestic. Just as the preference in beauty that Plato attributes to the spherical figure the Epicureans gave rather to the pyramidal or square, and cannot swallow a god in the form of a bowl. But, be it how it will, nature has no more privileged us in this from her common laws than in the rest And if we will judge ourselves aright, we shall find that, if there be some animals less favoured in this than we, there are others, and in greater number, that are more; a multis animalibus decore vincimur ""Many animals surpass us in beauty,"" even among the terrestrial, our compatriots; for as to those of sea, setting the figure aside, which cannot fall into any manner of proportion, being so much another thing in colour, clearness, smoothness, and arrangement, we sufficiently give place to them; and no less, in all qualities, to the aerial. And this prerogative that the poets make such a mighty matter of, our erect stature, looking towards heaven our original,

                  Pronaque cum spectent animalia ctera terrain,
          Os homini sublime ddit, columque tueri
          Jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus,

                ""Whilst all the brutal creatures downward bend
          Their sight, and to their earthly mother tend,
          He set man's face aloft, that, with his eyes
          Uplifted, he might view the starry skies,""
is truly poetical; for there are several little beasts who have their sight absolutely turned towards heaven; and I find the gesture of camels and ostriches much higher raised and more erect than ours. What animals have not their faces above and not before, and do not look opposite, as we do; and that do not in their natural posture discover as much of heaven and earth as man? And what qualities of our bodily constitution, in Plato and Cicero, may not indifferently serve a thousand sorts of beasts? Those that most resemble us are the most despicable and deformed of all the herd; for those, as to outward appearance and form of visage, are baboons:—

          Simia quam similis, turpissima bestia, nobis?

          ""How like to man, in visage and in shape,
         Is, of all beasts the most uncouth, the ape?""
as to the internal and vital parts, the hog. In earnest, when I consider man stark naked, even in that sex which seems to have greatest share of beauty, his defects, natural subjection, and imperfections, I find that we have more reason than any other animal, to cover ourselves; and are to be excused from borrowing of those to whom nature has in this been kinder than to us, to trick ourselves out with their beauties, and hide ourselves under their spoils, their wool, feathers, hair, and silk. Let us observe, as to the rest, that man is the sole animal whose nudities offend his own companions, and the only one who in his natural actions withdraws and hides himself from his own kind. And really 'tis also an effect worth consideration, that they who are masters in the trade prescribe, as a remedy for amorous passions, the full and free view of the body a man desires; for that to cool the ardour there needs no more but freely and fully to see what he loves:—

                 Ille quod obscnas in aperto corpore partes
            Viderat, in cursu qui fuit, hsit amor.

             ""The love that's tilting when those parts appear
         Open to view, flags in the hot career,""
And, although this receipt may peradventure proceed from a nice and cold humour, it is notwithstanding a very great sign of our deficiencies that use and acquaintance should make us disgust one another. It is not modesty, so much as cunning and prudence, that makes our ladies so circumspect to refuse us admittance into their cabinets before they are painted and tricked up for the public view:—

              Nec Veneres nostras hoc fallit; quo magis ips
          Omnia summopere hos vit postscenia celant,
         Quos retinere volunt, adstrictoque esse in amore:

              ""Of this our ladies are full well aware,
         Which make them, with such privacy and care,
         Behind the scene all those defects remove,
         Likely to check the flame of those they love,""
whereas, in several animals there is nothing that we do not love, and that does not please our senses; so that from their very excrements we do not only extract wherewith to heighten our sauces, but also our richest ornaments and perfumes. This discourse reflects upon none but the ordinary sort of women, and is not so sacrilegious as to comprehend those divine, supernatural, and extraordinary beauties, which we see shine occasionally among us like stars under a corporeal and terrestrial veil.

As to the rest, the very share that we allow to beasts of the bounty of nature, by our own confession, is very much to their advantage. We attribute to ourselves imaginary and fantastic good, future and absent good, for which human capacity cannot of herself be responsible; or good, that we falsely attribute to ourselves by the license of opinion, as reason, knowledge, and honour, and leave to them for their dividend, essential, durable, and palpable good, as peace, repose, security, innocence, and health; health, I say, the fairest and richest present that nature can make us. Insomuch that philosophy, even the Stoic, is so bold as to say, ""That Heraclitus and Pherecides, could they have trucked their wisdom for health, and have delivered themselves, the one of his dropsy, and the other of the lousy disease that tormented him, they had done well."" By which they set a greater value upon wisdom, comparing and putting it into the balance with health, than they do with this other proposition, which is also theirs; they say that if Circe had presented Ulysses with the two potions, the one to make a fool become a wise man, and the other to make a wise man become a fool, that Ulysses ought rather to have chosen the last, than consent to that by which Circe changed his human figure into that of a beast; and say that wisdom itself would have spoke to him after this manner: ""Forsake me, let me alone, rather than lodge me under the body and figure of an ass."" How! the philosophers, then will abandon this great and divine wisdom for this corporeal and terrestrial covering? It is then no more by reason, by discourse, and by the soul, that we excel beasts; 'tis by our beauty, our fair complexion, and our fine symmetry of parts, for which we must quit our intelligence, our prudence, and all the rest. Well, I accept this open and free confession; certainly they knew that those parts, upon which we so much value ourselves, are no other than vain fancy. If beasts then had all the virtue, knowledge, wisdom, and stoical perfection, they would still be beasts, and would not be comparable to man, miserable, wicked, mad, man. For, in short, whatever is not as we are is nothing worth; and God, to procure himself an esteem among us, must put himself into that shape, as we shall show anon. By which it appears that it is not upon any true ground of reason, but by a foolish pride and vain opinion, that we prefer ourselves before other animals, and separate ourselves from their society and condition.

But to return to what I was upon before; we have for our part inconstancy, irresolution, incertitude, sorrow, superstition, solicitude of things to come, even after we shall be no more, ambition, avarice, jealousy, envy, irregular, frantic, and untamed appetites, war, lying, disloyalty, detraction, and curiosity. Doubtless, we have strangely overpaid this fine reason, upon which we so much glorify ourselves, and this capacity of judging and knowing, if we have bought it at the price of this infinite number of passions to which we are eternally subject. Unless we shall also think fit, as even Socrates does, to add to the counterpoise that notable prerogative above beasts, That whereas nature has prescribed them certain seasons and limits for the delights of Venus, she has given us the reins at all hours and all seasons."" Ut vinum ogrotis, quia prodest rar, nocet sopissime, melius est non adhibere omnino, quam, spe dubio salutis, in apertam per-niciem incurrere; sic, haud scio an melius fuerit humano generi motum istum celerem cogitationis, acumen, solertiam, quam rationem vocamus, quoniam pestifera sint multis, ad-modum paucis saluiaria, non dari omnino, quam tam muniice et tam large dari? As it falls out that wine often hurting the sick, and very rarely doing them good, it is better not to give them any at all than to run into an apparent danger out of hope of an uncertain benefit, so I know not whether it had not been better for mankind that this quick motion, this penetration, this subtlety that we call reason, had not been given to man at all; considering how pestiferous it is to many, and useful but to few, than to have been conferred in so abundant manner, and with so liberal a hand."" Of what advantage can we conceive the knowledge of so many things was to Yarro and Aristotle? Did it exempt them from human inconveniences? Were they by it freed from the accidents that lay heavy upon the shoulders of a porter?
Did they extract from their logic any consolation for the gout? Or, for knowing how this humour is lodged in the joints, did they feel it the less? Did they enter into composition with death by knowing that some nations rejoice at his approach; or with cuckoldry, by knowing that in some parts of the world wives are in common? On the contrary, having been reputed the greatest men for knowledge, the one amongst the Romans and the other amongst the Greeks, and in a time when learning did most flourish, we have not heard, nevertheless, that they had any particular excellence in their lives; nay, the Greek had enough to do to clear himself from some notable blemishes in his. Have we observed that pleasure and health have a better relish with him that understands astrology and grammar than with others?

            Illiterati num minus nervi rigent?

           ""Th' illiterate ploughman is as fit
            For Venus' service as the wit:""
or shame and poverty less troublesome to the first than to the last?

                  Scilicet et morbis et debilitate carebis,
           Et luctum et curam effugies, et tempora vit
           Longa tibi post hc fato meliore dabuntur.

                   ""Disease thy couch shall flee,
           And sorrow and care; yes, thou, be sure, wilt see
          Long years of happiness, till now unknown.""
I have known in my time a hundred artisans, a hundred labourers, wiser and more happy than the rectors of the university, and whom I had much rather have resembled. Learning, methinks, has its place amongst the necessary, things of life, as glory, nobility, dignity, or at the most, as beauty, riches, and such other qualities, which indeed are useful to it, but remotely, and more by opinion than by nature. We stand very little more in need of offices, rules, and laws of living in our society, than cranes and ants do in theirs; and yet we see that these carry themselves very regularly without erudition. If man was wise, he would take the true value of every thing according as it was useful and proper to his life. Whoever will number us by our actions and deportments will find many more excellent men amongst the ignorant than among the learned; aye, in all sorts of virtue. Old Rome seems to me to have been of much greater value, both for peace and war, than that learned Rome that ruined itself. And, though all the rest should be equal, yet integrity and innocency would remain to the ancients, for they cohabit singularly well with simplicity. But I will leave this discourse, that would lead me farther than I am willing to follow; and shall only say this further, 'tis only humility and submission that can make a complete good man. We are not to leave the knowledge of his duty to every man's own judgment; we are to prescribe it to him, and not suffer him to choose it at his own discretion; otherwise, according to the imbecility, and infinite variety of our reasons and opinions, we should at large forge ourselves duties that would, as Epicurus says, enjoin us to eat one another.

The first law that ever God gave to man was a law of pure obedience; it was a commandment naked and simple, wherein man had nothing to inquire after, nor to dispute; forasmuch as to obey is the proper office of a rational soul, acknowledging a heavenly superior and benefactor. From obedience and submission spring all other virtues, as all sin does from selfopinion. And, on the contrary, the first temptation that by the devil was offered to human nature, its first poison insinuated itself into us by the promise made us of knowledge and wisdom; Eritis sicut Dii, scientes bonum et malum. ""Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."" And the sirens, in Homer, to allure Ulysses, and draw him within the danger of their snares, offered to give him knowledge. The plague of man is the opinion of wisdom; and for this reason it is that ignorance is so recommended to us, by our religion, as proper to faith and obedience; Cavete ne quis vos decipiat per philosophiam et inanes seductiones, secundum elementa mundi. ""Take heed, lest any man deceive you by philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, and the rudiments of the world."" There is in this a general consent amongst all sorts of philosophers, that the sovereign good consists in the tranquillity of the soul and body; but where shall we find it?

                   Ad summum, sapiens uno minor est Jove, dives,
            Liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex deniqne regum;
            Prcipue sanus, nisi cum pituita molesta est:

                   ""In short, the wise is only less than Jove,
            Rich, free, and handsome; nay, a king above
           All earthly kings; with health supremely blest,
            Excepting when a cold disturbs his rest!""
It seems, in truth, that nature, for the consolation of our miserable and wretched state, has only given us presumption for our inheritance. 'Tis as Epictetus says, that man has nothing properly his own, but the use of his opinion; we have nothing but wind and smoke for our portion. The gods have health in essence, says philosophy, and sickness in intelligence. Man, on the contrary, possesses his goods by fancy, his ills in essence. We have reason to magnify the power of our imagination; for all our goods are only in dream. Hear this poor calamitous animal huff! ""There is nothing,"" says Cicero, ""so charming as the employment of letters; of letters, I say, by means whereof the infinity of things, the immense grandeur of nature, the heavens even in this world, the earth, and the seas are discovered to us; 'tis they that have taught us religion, moderation, and the grandeur of courage, and that have rescued our souls from darkness, to make her see all things, high, low, first, last, and middling; 'tis they that furnish us wherewith to live happily and well, and conduct us to pass over our lives without displeasure, and without offence."" Does not this man seem to speak of the condition of the ever-living and almighty God? But as to effects, a thousand little countrywomen have lived lives more equal, more sweet, and constant than his.

                 Deus ille fuit, deus, inclyte Memmi,
          Qui princeps vit rationem invenit earn, qu
           Nunc appellatur sapientia; quique per artem
           Fluctibus  tantis vitam, tantisque tenebris,
          In tam tranquilla et tam clara luce locavit:

               ""That god, great Memmus, was a god no doubt
         Who, prince of life, first found that reason out
         Now wisdom called; and by his art, who did
         That life in tempests tost, and darkness hid,
         Place in so great a calm, and clear a light:""
here are brave ranting words; but a very slight accident put this man's understanding in a worse condition than that of the meanest shepherd, notwithstanding this instructing god, this divine wisdom. Of the same stamp and impudence is the promise of Democritus's book: ""I am going to speak of all things;"" and that foolish title that Aristotle prefixes to one of his, order only afforded him a few lucid intervals which he employed in composing his book, and at last made him kill himself,—Eusebius's Chronicon.

Of the Mortal Gods; and the judgment of Chrysippus, that ""Dion was as virtuous as God;"" and my Seneca himself says, that ""God had given him life; but that to live well was his own;"" conformably to this other: In virtute vere gloriamur; quod non contingeret, si id donum Deo, non nobis haberemus: ""We truly glory in our virtue; which would not be, if it was given us of God, and not by ourselves;"" this is also Seneca's saying; ""that the wise man hath fortitude equal with God, but that his is in spite of human frailty, wherein therefore he more than equals God."" There is nothing so ordinary as to meet with sallies of the like temerity; there is none of us, who take so much offence to see himself equalled with God, as he does to see himself undervalued by being ranked with other creatures; so much more are we jealous of our own interest than that of our Creator.

But we must trample under foot this foolish vanity, and briskly and boldly shake the ridiculous foundation upon which these false opinions are founded. So long as man shall believe he has any means and power of himself, he will never acknowledge what he owes to his Maker; his eggs shall always be chickens, as the saying is; we must therefore strip him to his shirt. Let us see some notable examples of the effects of his philosophy: Posidonius being tormented with a disease so painful as made him writhe his arms and gnash his teeth, thought he sufficiently scorned the dolour, by crying out against it: ""Thou mayst do thy worst, I will not confess that thou art an evil."" He was as sensible of the pain as my footman, but he made a bravado of bridling his tongue, at least, and restraining it within the laws of his sect: Re succumbere non oportebat, verbis gloriantem. ""It did not become him, that spoke so big, to confess his frailty when he came to the test."" Arcesilas being ill of the gout, and Car-neades, who had come to see him, going away troubled at his condition, he called him back, and showing him his feet and breast: ""There is nothing comes thence hither,"" said he. This has something a better grace, for he feels himself in pain, and would be disengaged from it; but his heart, notwithstanding, is not conquered nor subdued by it. The other stands more obstinately to his point, but, I fear, rather verbally than really. And Dionysius Heracleotes, afflicted with a vehement smarting in his eyes, was reduced to quit these stoical resolutions. But even though knowledge should, in effect, do as they say, and could blunt the point, and dull the edge, of the misfortunes that attend us, what does she, more than what ignorance does more purely and evidently?—The philosopher Pyrrho, being at sea in very great danger, by reason of a mighty storm, presented nothing to the imitation of those who were with him, in that extremity, but a hog they had on board, that was fearless and unconcerned at the tempest. Philosophy, when she has said all she can, refers us at last to the example of a gladiator, wrestler, or muleteer, in which sort of people we commonly observe much less apprehension of death, sense of pain, and other inconveniences, and more of endurance, than ever knowledge furnished any one withal, that was not bom and bred to hardship. What is the cause that we make incisions, and cut the tender limbs of an infant, and those of a horse, more easily than our own—but ignorance only? How many has mere force of imagination made sick? We often see men cause themselves to be let blood, purged, and physicked, to be cured of diseases they only feel in opinion.—When real infirmities fail us, knowledge lends us her's; that colour, that complexion, portend some catarrhous defluxion; this hot season threatens us with a fever; this breach in the life-line of your left hand gives you notice of some near and dangerous indisposition; and at last she roundly attacks health itself; saying, this sprightliness and vigour of youth cannot continue in this posture; there must be blood taken, and the heat abated, lest it turn against yourself. Compare the life of a man subjected to such imaginations, to that of a labourer that suffers himself to be led by his natural appetite, measuring things only by the present sense, without knowledge, and without prognostic, that feels no pain or sickness, but when he is really ill. Whereas the other has the stone in his soul, before he has it in his bladder; as if it were not time enough to suffer the evil when it shall come, he must anticipate it by fancy, and run to meet it.

What I say of physic may generally serve in example for all other sciences. Thence is derived that ancient opinion of the philosophers that placed the sovereign good in the discovery of the weakness of our judgment My ignorance affords me as much occasion of hope as of fear; and having no other rule for my health than that of the examples of others, and of events I see elsewhere upon the like occasion, I find of all sorts, and rely upon those which by comparison are most favourable to me. I receive health with open arms, free, full, and entire, and by so much the more whet my appetite to enjoy it, by how much it is at present less ordinary and more rare; so far am I from troubling its repose and sweetness with the bitterness of a new and constrained manner of living. Beasts sufficiently show us how much the agitation of our minds brings infirmities and diseases upon us. That which is told us of those of Brazil, that they never die but of old age, is attributed to the serenity and tranquillity of the air they live in; but I rather attribute it to the serenity and tranquillity of their souls, free from all passion, thought, or employment, extended or unpleasing, a people that pass over their lives in a wonderful simplicity and ignorance, without letters, without law, without king, or any manner of religion. And whence comes that, which we find by experience, that the heaviest and dullest men are most able; and the most to be desired in amorous performances; and that the love of a muleteer often renders itself more acceptable than that of a gentleman, if it be not that the agitation of the soul in the latter disturbs his physical ability, dissolves and tires it, as it also ordinarily troubles and tires itself. What puts the soul beside itself, and more usually throws it into madness, but her own promptness, vigour, and agility, and, finally, her own proper force? Of what is the most subtle folly made, but of the most subtle wisdom? As great friendships spring from great enmities, and vigorous health from mortal diseases, so from the rare and vivid agitations of our souls proceed the most wonderful and most distracted frenzies; 'tis but half a turn of the toe from the one to the other. In the actions of madmen we see how infinitely madness resembles the most vigorous operations of the soul. Who does not know how indiscernible the difference is betwixt folly and the sprightly elevations of a free soul, and the effects of a supreme and extraordinary virtue? Plato says that melancholy persons are the most capable of discipline, and the most excellent; and accordingly in none is there so great a propension to madness. Great wits are ruined by their own proper force and pliability; into what a condition, through his own agitation and promptness of fancy, is one of the most judicious, ingenious, and nearest formed, of any other Italian poet, to the air of the ancient and true poesy, lately fallen! Has he not vast obligation to this vivacity that has destroyed him? to this light that has blinded him? to this exact and subtle apprehension of reason that has put him beside his own? to this curious and laborious search after sciences, that has reduced him to imbecility? and to this rare aptitude to the exercises of the soul, that has rendered him without exercise and without soul? I was more angry, if possible, than compassionate, to see him at Ferrara in so pitiful a condition surviving himself, forgetting both himself and his works, which, without his knowledge, though before his face, have been published unformed and incorrect.

Would you have a man healthy, would you have him regular, and in a steady and secure posture? Muffle him up in the shades of stupidity and sloth. We must be made beasts to be made wise, and hoodwinked before we are fit to be led. And if one shall tell me that the advantage of having a cold and dull sense of pain and other evils, brings this disadvantage along with it, to render us consequently less sensible also in the fruition of good and pleasure, this is true; but the misery of our condition is such that we have not so much to enjoy as to avoid, and that the extremest pleasure does not affect us to the degree that a light grief does: Segnius homines bona quam mala sentiunt. We are not so sensible of the most perfect health as we are of the least sickness.

                Pungit
           In cute vix sum ma violatum plagula corpus;
          Quando valere nihil quemquam movet. Hoc juvat unum,
         Quod me non torquet latus, aut pes;
         Ctera quisquam Vix queat aut sanum sese, aut sentire valentem.

              ""The body with a little sting is griev'd,
         When the most perfect health is not perceiv'd,
         This only pleases me, that spleen nor gout
         Neither offend my side nor wring my foot;
         Excepting these, scarce any one can tell,
         Or e'er observes, when he's in health and well.""
Our well-being is nothing but the not being ill. Which is the reason why that sect of philosophers, which sets the greatest value upon pleasure, has yet fixed it chiefly in unconsciousness of pain. To be freed from ill is the greatest good that man can hope for or desire; as Ennius says,—

           Nimium boni est, cui nihil est mali;
for that every tickling and sting which are in certain pleasures, and that seem to raise us above simple health and passiveness, that active, moving, and, I know not how, itching, and biting pleasure; even that very pleasure itself aims at nothing but insensibility as its mark. The appetite that carries us headlong to women's embraces has no other end but only to cure the torment of our ardent and furious desires, and only requires to be glutted and laid at rest, and delivered from the fever. And so of the rest. I say, then, that if simplicity conducts us to a state free from evil, she leads us to a very happy one according to our condition. And yet we are not to imagine it so stupid an insensibility as to be totally without sense; for Crantor had very good reason to controvert the insensibility of Epicurus, if founded so deep that the very first attack and birth of evils were not to be perceived: ""I do not approve such an insensibility as is neither possible nor to be desired. I am very well content not to be sick; but if I am, I would know that I am so; and if a caustic be applied, or incisions made in any part, I would feel them."" In truth, whoever would take away the knowledge and sense of evil, would at the same time eradicate the sense of pleasure, and finally annihilate man himself: Istud nihil dolere, non sine magn mercede contingit, immanitatis in animo, stuporis in corpore. ""An insensibility that is not to be purchased but at the price of inhumanity in the soul, and of stupidity of the body."" Evil appertains to man of course. Neither is pain always to be avoided, nor pleasure always pursued.

'Tis a great advantage to the honour of ignorance that knowledge itself throws us into its arms, when she finds herself puzzled to fortify us against the weight of evil; she is constrained to come to this composition, to give us the reins, and permit us to fly into the lap of the other, and to shelter ourselves under her protection from the strokes and injuries of fortune. For what else is her meaning when she instructs us to divert our thoughts from the ills that press upon us, and entertain them with the meditation of pleasures past and gone; to comfort ourselves in present afflictions with the remembrance of fled delights, and to call to our succour a vanished satisfaction, to oppose it to the discomfort that lies heavy upon us? Levationes gritudinum in avocatione a cogitand molesti, et revocation ad contemplandas voluptates, ponit; ""He directs us to alleviate our grief and pains by rejecting unpleasant thoughts, and recalling agreeable ideas;"" if it be not that where her power fails she would supply it with policy, and make use of sleight of hand where force of limbs will not serve her turn? For not only to a philosopher, but to any man in his right wits, when he has upon him the thirst of a burning fever, what satisfaction can it be to him to remember the pleasure he took in drinking Greek wine a month ago? It would rather only make matters worse to him:—

          Che ricordarsi il ben doppia la noia.

           ""The thinking of pleasure doubles trouble.""
Of the same stamp is this other counsel that philosophy gives, only to remember the happiness that is past, and to forget the misadventures we have undergone; as if we had the science of oblivion in our own power, and counsel, wherein we are yet no more to seek.

           Suavis laborum est prteritorum rmoria.

           ""Sweet is the memory of by-gone pain.""
How does philosophy, that should arm me to contend with fortune, and steel my courage to trample all human adversities under foot, arrive to this degree of cowardice to make me hide my head at this rate, and save myself by these pitiful and ridiculous shifts? For the memory represents to us not what we choose, but what she pleases; nay, there is nothing that so much imprints any thing in our memory as a desire to forget it. And 'tis a good way to retain and keep any thing safe in the soul to solicit her to lose it. And this is false: Est situm in nobis, ut et adversa quasi perpetua oblivione obruamus, et secunda jucunde et suaviter meminerimus; ""it is in our power to bury, as it were, in a perpetual oblivion, all adverse accidents, and to retain a pleasant and delightful memory of our successes;"" and this is true: Memini etiam quo nolo; oblivisci non possum quo volo. ""I do also remember what I would not; but I cannot forget what I would."" And whose counsel is this? His, qui se unies sapiervtem profiteri sit ausus; ""who alone durst profess himself a wise man.""

                Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit, et omnes
          Prstinxit stellas, exortus uti thereus Sol.

                ""Who from mankind the prize of knowledge won,
         And put the stars out like the rising sun.""
To empty and disfurnish the memory, is not this the true way to ignorance?

         Iners malorum remedium ignorantia est.

         ""Ignorance is but a dull remedy for evils.""
We find several other like precepts, whereby we are permitted to borrow frivolous appearances from the vulgar, where we find the strongest reason will not answer the purpose, provided they administer satisfaction and comfort Where they cannot cure the wound, they are content to palliate and benumb it I believe they will not deny this, that if they could add order and constancy in a state of life that could maintain itself in ease and pleasure by some debility of judgment, they would accept it:—

                Potare, et spargere flores
          Incipiam, patiarque vel inconsultus haberi.

               ""Give me to drink, and, crown'd with flowers, despise
          The grave disgrace of being thought unwise.""
There would be a great many philosophers of Lycas's mind this man, being otherwise of very regular manners, living quietly and contentedly in his family, and not failing in any office of his duty, either towards his own or strangers, and very carefully preserving himself from hurtful things, became, nevertheless, by some distemper in his brain, possessed with a conceit that he was perpetually in the theatre, a spectator of the finest sights and the best comedies in the world; and being cured by the physicians of his frenzy, was hardly prevented from endeavouring by suit to compel them to restore him again to his pleasing imagination:—

                Pol I me occidistis, amici,
           Non servastis, ait; cui sic extorta voluptas,
           Et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error;

                ""By heaven! you've killed me, friends, outright,
          And not preserved me; since my dear delight
         And pleasing error, by my better sense
          Unhappily return'd, is banished hence;""
with a madness like that of Thrasylaus the son of Pythodorus, who made himself believe that all the ships that weighed anchor from the port of Pirus, and that came into the haven, only made their voyages for his profit; congratulating them upon their successful navigation, and receiving them with the greatest joy; and when his brother Crito caused him to be restored to his better understanding, he infinitely regretted that sort of condition wherein he had lived with so much delight and free from all anxiety of mind. 'Tis according to the old Greek verse, that ""there is a great deal of convenience in not being over-wise.""

And Ecclesiastes, ""In much wisdom there is much sorrow;"" and ""Who gets wisdom gets labour and trouble.""

Even that to which philosophy consents in general, that last remedy which she applies to all sorts of necessities, to put an end to the life we are not able to endure. Placet?—Pare. Non placet?—Qucumque vis, exi. Pungit dolor?—Vel fodiat sane. Si nudus es, da jugulum; sin tectus armis Vulcaniis, id est fortitudine, rsist; ""Does it please?—Obey it. Not please?—Go where thou wilt. Does grief prick thee,—nay, stab thee?—If thou art naked, present thy throat; if covered with the arms of Vulcan, that is, fortitude, resist it."" And this word, so used in the Greek festivals, aut bibat, aut abeat, ""either drink or go,"" which sounds better upon the tongue of a Gascon, who naturally changes the h into v, than on that of Cicero:—

               Vivere si recte nescis, decede peritis.
         Lusisti satis, edisti satis, atque bibisti;
         Tempus abire tibi est, ne potum largius quo
           Rideat et pulset lasciva decentius tas.

               ""If to live well and right thou dost not know,
         Give way, and leave thy place to those that do.
          Thou'st eaten, drunk, and play'd to thy content,
          'Tis time to make thy parting compliment,
          Lest youth, more decent in their follies, scoff
         The nauseous scene, and hiss thee reeling off;""
What is it other than a confession of his impotency, and a sending back not only to ignorance, to be there in safety, but even to stupidity, insensibility, and nonentity?

               Democritum postquam matura vetustas
          Admonuit memorem motus languescere mentis;
          Sponte sua letho caput obvius obtulit ipse.

              ""Soon as, through age, Democritus did find
           A manifest decadence in his mind,
           He thought he now surviv'd to his own wrong,
         And went to meet his death, that stay'd too long.""
'Tis what Antisthenes said, ""That a man should either make provision of sense to understand, or of a halter to hang himself;"" and what Chrysippus alleged upon this saying of the poet Tyrtus:—

         ""Or to arrive at virtue or at death;""
and Crates said, ""That love would be cured by hunger, if not by time; and whoever disliked these two remedies, by a rope."" That Sextius, of whom both Seneca and Plutarch speak with so high an encomium, having applied himself, all other things set aside, to the study of philosophy, resolved to throw himself into the sea, seeing the progress of his studies too tedious and slow. He ran to find death, since he could not overtake knowledge. These are the words of the law upon the subject: ""If peradventure some great inconvenience happen, for which there is no remedy, the haven is near, and a man may save himself by swimming out of his body as out of a leaky skiff; for 'tis the fear of dying, and not the love of life, that ties the fool to his body.""

As life renders itself by simplicity more pleasant, so more innocent and better, also it renders it as I was saying before: ""The simple and ignorant,"" says St. Paul, ""raise themselves up to heaven and take possession of it; and we, with all our knowledge, plunge ourselves into the infernal abyss."" I am neither swayed by Valentinian, a professed enemy to all learning and letters, nor by Licinius, both Roman emperors, who called them the poison and pest of all political government; nor by Mahomet, who, as 'tis said, interdicted all manner of learning to his followers; but the example of the great Lycurgus, and his authority, with the reverence of the divine Lacedemonian policy, so great, so admirable, and so long flourishing in virtue and happiness, without any institution or practice of letters, ought certainly to be of very great weight. Such as return from the new world discovered by the Spaniards in our fathers' days, testify to us how much more honestly and regularly those nations live, without magistrate and without law, than ours do, where there are more officers and lawyers than there are of other sorts of men and business:—

                   Di cittatorie piene, e di libelli,
           D'esamine, e di carte di procure,
           Hanno le mani e il seno, e gran fastelli
          Di chioge, di consigli, et di letture:
          Per cui le faculta de* poverelli
           Non sono mai nelle citt sicure;
            Hanno dietro e dinanzi, e d'ambi i lati,
            Notai, procuratori, ed avvocati.

                    ""Their bags were full of writs, and of citations,
            Of process, and of actions and arrests,
            Of bills, of answers, and of replications,
            In courts of delegates, and of requests,
            To grieve the simple sort with great vexations;
            They had resorting to them as their guests,
            Attending on their circuit, and their journeys,
           Scriv'ners, and clerks, and lawyers, and attorneys.""
It was what a Roman senator of the latter ages said, that their predecessors' breath stunk of garlic, but their stomachs were perfumed with a good conscience; and that, on the contrary, those of his time were all sweet odour without, but stunk within of all sorts of vices; that is to say, as I interpret it, that they abounded with learning and eloquence, but were very defective in moral honesty. Incivility, ignorance, simplicity, roughness, are the natural companions of innocence; curiosity, subtlety, knowledge, bring malice in their train; humility, fear, obedience, and affability, which are the principal things that support and maintain human society, require an empty and docile soul, and little presuming upon itself.

Christians have a particular knowledge, how natural and original an evil curiosity is in man; the thirst of knowledge, and the desire to become more wise, was the first ruin of man, and the way by which he precipitated himself into eternal damnation. Pride was his ruin and corruption. 'Tis pride that diverts him from the common path, and makes him embrace novelties, and rather choose to be head of a troop, lost and wandering in the path of error; to be a master and a teacher of lies, than to be a disciple in the school of truth, suffering himself to be led and guided by the hand of another, in the right and beaten road. 'Tis, peradventure, the meaning of this old Greek saying, that superstition follows pride, and obeys it as if it were a father: [—Greek—] Ah, presumption, how much dost thou hinder us?

After that Socrates was told that the god of wisdom had assigned to him the title of sage, he was astonished at it, and, searching and examining himself throughout, could find no foundation for this divine judgment. He knew others as just, temperate, valiant, and learned, as himself; and more eloquent, more handsome, and more profitable to their country than he. At last he concluded that he was not distinguished from others, nor wise, but only because he did not think himself so; and that his God considered the opinion of knowledge and wisdom as a singular absurdity in man; and that his best doctrine was the doctrine of ignorance, and simplicity his best wisdom. The sacred word declares those miserable among us who have an opinion of themselves: ""Dust and ashes,"" says it to such, ""what hast thou wherein to glorify thyself?"" And, in another place, ""God has made man like unto a shadow,"" of whom who can judge, when by removing the light it shall be vanished! Man is a thing of nothing.

Our force is so far from being able to comprehend the divine height, that, of the works of our Creator, those best bear his mark, and are with better title his, which we the least understand. To meet with an incredible thing is an occasion to Christians to believe; and it is so much the more according to reason, by how much it is against human reason. If it were according to reason, it would be no more a miracle; and if it were according to example, it would be no longer a singular thing. Melius scitur Deus nesdendo: ""God is better known by not knowing him,"" says St. Austin: and Tacitus, Sanctius est ac reverentius de actis Deorum credere, quam scire; ""it is more holy and reverent to believe the works of God than to know them;"" and Plato thinks there is something of impiety in inquiring too curiously into God, the world, and the first causes of things: Atque illum quidem parentem hujus universitaiis invenire, difficile; et, quum jam inveneris, indicare in vulgtis, nefas: ""to find out the parent of the world is very difficult; and when found out, to reveal him to the vulgar is sin,"" says Cicero. We talk indeed of power, truth, justice; which are words that signify some great thing; but that thing we neither see nor conceive at all. We say that God fears, that God is angry, that God loves,

           Immortalia mortali sermone notantes:

          ""Giving to things immortal mortal names.""
These are all agitations and emotions that cannot be in God, according to our form, nor can we imagine them, according to his. It only belongs to God to know himself, and to interpret his own works; and he does it in our language, going out of himself, to stoop to us who grovel upon the earth. How can prudence, which is the choice between good and evil, be properly attributed to him whom no evil can touch? How can reason and intelligence, which we make use of, to arrive by obscure at apparent things; seeing that nothing is obscure to him? How justice, which distributes to every one what appertains to him, a thing begot by the society and community of men, how is that in God? How temperance, which is the moderation of corporal pleasures, that have no place in the Divinity? Fortitude to support pain, labour, and dangers, as little appertains to him as the rest; these three things have no access to him. For which reason Aristotle holds him equally exempt from virtue and vice: Neque gratia, neque ira teneri potest; quod quo talia essent, imbecilla essent omnia? ""He can neither be affected with favour nor indignation, because both these are the effects of frailty.""

The participation we have in the knowledge of truth, such as it is, is not acquired by our own force: God has sufficiently given us to understand that, by the witnesses he has chosen out of the common people, simple and ignorant men, that he has been pleased to employ to instruct us in his admirable secrets. Our faith is not of our own acquiring; 'tis purely the gift of another's bounty: 'tis not by meditation, or by virtue of our own understanding, that we have acquired our religion, but by foreign authority and command wherein the imbecility of our own judgment does more assist us than any force of it; and our blindness more than our clearness of sight: 'tis more by__ the mediation of our ignorance than of our knowledge that we know any thing of the divine wisdom. 'Tis no wonder if our natural and earthly parts cannot conceive that supernatural and heavenly knowledge: let us bring nothing of our own, but obedience and subjection; for, as it is written, ""I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.""

Finally, should I examine whether it be in the power of man to find out that which he seeks and if that quest, wherein he has busied himself so many ages, has enriched him with any new force, or any solid truth; I believe he will confess, if he speaks from his conscience, that all he has got by so long inquiry is only to have learned to know his own weakness. We have only by a long study confirmed and verified the natural ignorance we were in before. The same has fallen out to men truly wise, which befalls the ears of corn; they shoot and raise their heads high and pert, whilst empty; but when full and swelled with grain in maturity, begin to flag and droop. So men, having tried and sounded all things, and having found in that mass of knowledge, and provision of so many various things, nothing solid and firm, and nothing but vanity, have quitted their presumption, and acknowledged their natural condition. 'Tis what Velleius reproaches Cotta withal and Cicero, ""that they had learned of Philo, that they had learned nothing."" Pherecydes, one of the seven sages, writing to Thales upon his death-bed; ""I have,"" said he, ""given order to my people, after my interment, to carry my writings to thee. If they please thee and the other sages, publish; if not, suppress them. They contain no certainty with which I myself am satisfied. Neither do I pretend to know the truth, or to attain to it. I rather open than discover things."" The wisest man that ever was, being asked what he knew, made answer, ""He knew this, that he knew nothing."" By which he verified what has been said, that the greatest part of what we know is the least of what we do not; that is to say, that even what we think we know is but a piece, and a very little one, of our ignorance. We know things in dreams, says Plato, and are ignorant of them in truth. Ormes pene veteres nihil cognosci, nihil percipi, nihil sciri posse dixerunt; angustos sensus, imbecilles animos, brevia curricula vito. ""Almost all the ancients have declared that there is nothing to be known, nothing to be perceived or understood; the senses are too limited, men's minds too weak, and the course of life too short."" And of Cicero himself, who stood indebted to his learning for all he was worth, Valerius says, ""That he began to disrelish letters in his old age; and when at his studies, it was with great independency upon any one party; following what he thought probable, now in one sect, and then in another, evermore wavering under the doubts of the academy."" Dicendum est, sed ita ut nihil affirment, quceram omnia, dubitans plerumque, et mihi diffidens. ""Something I must say, but so as to affirm nothing; I inquire into all things, but for the most part in doubt and distrust of myself.""

I should have too fair a game should I consider man in his common way of living and in gross; yet I might do it by his own rule, who judges truth not by weight, but by the number of votes. Let us set the people aside,

              Qui vigilans stertit,....
           Mortua cui vita est prope jam vivo atque videnti;

                ""Half of his life by lazy sleep's possess'd,
          And when awake his soul but nods at best;""
who neither feel nor judge, and let most of their natural faculties lie idle; I will take man in his highest ground. Let us consider him in that little number of men, excellent and culled out from the rest, who, having been endowed with a remarkable and particular natural force, have moreover hardened and whetted it by care, study, and art, and raised it to the highest pitch of wisdom to which it can possibly arrive. They have adjusted their souls to all ways and all biases; have propped and supported them with all foreign helps proper for them, and enriched and adorned them with all they could borrow for their advantage, both within and without the world; 'tis in these is placed the utmost and most supreme height to which human nature can attain. They have regulated the world with policies and laws. They have instructed it with arts and sciences, and by the example of their admirable manners. I shall make account of none but such men as these, their testimony and experience. Let us examine how far they have proceeded, and where they stopped. The errors and defects that we shall find amongst these men the world may boldly avow as their own.

Whoever goes in search of any thing must come to this, either to say that he has found it, or that it is not to be found, or that he is yet upon the search. All philosophy is divided into these three kinds; her design is to seek out truth, knowledge, and certainty. The Peripatetics, Epicureans, Stoics, and others, have thought they have found it. These established the sciences we have, and have treated of them as of certain knowledge. Clitomachus, Carneades, and the Academics, have despaired in their search, and concluded that truth could not be conceived by our understandings. The result of these is weakness and human ignorance. This sect has had the most and the most noble followers. Pyrrho, and other skeptics or epechists, whose dogmas are held by many of the ancients to be taken from Homer, the seven sages, and from Archilochus and Euripides, and to whose number these are added, Zeno, Democritus, and Xenophanes, say that they are yet upon the inquiry after truth. These conclude that the others, who think they have found it out, are infinitely deceived; and that it is too daring a vanity in the second sort to determine that human reason is not able to attain unto it; for this establishing a standard of our power, to know and judge the difficulty of things, is a great and extreme knowledge, of which they doubt whether man is capable:—

                 Nil sciri quisquis putat, id quoque nescit,
           An sciri possit; quam se nil scire fatetur.

               ""He that says nothing can be known, o'erthrows
           His own opinion, for he nothing knows,
          So knows not that.""
The ignorance that knows itself, judges and condemns itself, is not an absolute ignorance; to be such, it must be ignorant of itself; so that the profession of the Pyrrhonians is to waver, doubt, and inquire, not to make themselves sure of, or responsible to themselves for any thing. Of the three actions of the soul, imaginative, appetitive, and consentive, they receive the two first; the last they kept ambiguous, without inclination or approbation, either of one thing or another, so light as it is. Zeno represented the motion of his imagination upon these divisions of the faculties of the soul thus: ""An open and expanded hand signified appearance; a hand half shut, and the fingers a little bending, consent; a clenched fist, comprehension; when with the left he yet thrust the right fist closer, knowledge."" Now this situation of their judgment upright and inflexible, receiving all objects without application or consent, leads them to their ataraxy, which is a peaceable condition of life, temperate, and exempt from the agitations we receive by the impression of opinion and knowledge that we think we have of things; whence spring fear, avarice, envy, immoderate desires, ambition, pride, superstition, love of novelty, rebellion, disobedience, obstinacy, and the greatest part of bodily ills; nay, and by that they are exempt from the jealousy of their discipline; for they debate after a very gentle manner; they fear no requital in their disputes; when they affirm that heavy things descend they would be sorry to be believed, and love tobe contradicted, to engender doubt and suspense of judgment, which is their end. They only put forward their propositions to contend with those they think we have in our belief. If you take their arguments, they will as readily maintain the contrary; 'tis all one to them, they have no choice. If you maintain that snow is black, they will argue on the contrary that it is white; if you say it is neither the one nor the other, they will maintain that it is both. If you hold, of certain judgment, that you know nothing, they will maintain that you do. Yea, and if by an affirmative axiom you assure them that you doubt, they will argue against you that you doubt not; or that you cannot judge and determine that you doubt. And by this extremity of doubt, which jostles itself, they separate and divide themselves from many opinions, even of those they have several ways maintained, both concerning doubt and ignorance. ""Why shall not they be allowed to doubt,"" say they, ""as well as the dogmatists, one of whom says green, another yellow? Can any thing be proposed to us to grant, or deny, which it shall not be permitted to consider as ambiguous?"" And where others are carried away, either by the custom of their country, or by the instruction of parents, or by accident, as by a tempest, without judgment and without choice, nay, and for the most part before the age of discretion, to such and such an opinion, to the sect whether Stoic or Epicurean, with which they are prepossessed, enslaved, and fast bound, as to a thing they cannot forsake: Ad quamcumque disciplinant, velut tempestate, delati, ad earn, tanquam ad saxum, adhorescunt; ""every one cleaves to the doctrine he has happened upon, as to a rock against which he has been thrown by tempest;"" why shall not these likewise be permitted to maintain their liberty, and consider things without obligation or slavery? hoc liberiores et solutiores, quod integra illis est judicandi potestas: ""in this more unconstrained and free, because they have the greater power of judging."" Is it not of some advantage to be disengaged from the necessity that curbs others? Is it not better to remain in suspense than to entangle one's self in the innumerable errors that human fancy has produced? Is it not much better to suspend one's persuasion than to intermeddle with these wrangling and seditious divisions: ""What shall I choose?"" ""What you please, provided you will choose."" A very foolish answer; but such a one, nevertheless, as all dogmatism seems to point at, and by which we are not permitted to be ignorant of what we are ignorant of.

Take the most eminent side, that of the greatest reputation; it will never be so sure that you shall not be forced to attack and contend with a hundred and a hundred adversaries to defend it. Is it not better to keep out of this hurly-burly? You are permitted to embrace Aristotle's opinions of the immortality of the soul with as much zeal as your honour and life, and to give the lie to Plato thereupon, and shall they be interdicted to doubt him? If it be lawful for Pantius to maintain his opinion about augury, dreams, oracles, vaticinations, of which the Stoics made no doubt at all; why may not a wise man dare to do the same in all things that he dared to do in those he had learned of his masters, established by the common consent of the school, whereof he is a professor and a member? If it be a child that judges, he knows not what it is; if a wise man, he is prepossessed. They have reserved for themselves a marvellous advantage in battle, having eased themselves of the care of defence. If you strike them, they care not, provided they strike too, and they turn every thing to their own use. If they overcome, your argument is lame; if you, theirs; if they fall short, they verify ignorance; if you fall short, you do it; if they prove that nothing is known, 'tis well; if they cannot prove it, 'tis also well: Ut quurn in eadem re paria contrariis in partibus momenta inveniuntur, facilius ab utraque parte assertio sustineatur: ""That when like sentiments happen pro and con in the same thing, the assent may on both sides be more easily suspended."" And they make account to find out, with much greater facility, why a thing is false, than why 'tis true; that which is not, than that which is; and what they do not believe, than what they do. Their way of speaking is: ""I assert nothing; it is no more so than so, or than neither one nor t'other; I understand it not. Appearances are everywhere equal; the law of speaking, pro or con, is the same. Nothing seems true, that may not seem false."" Their sacramental word is that is to say, ""I hold, I stir not."" This is the burden of their song, and others of like stuff. The effect of which is a pure, entire, perfect, and absolute suspension of judgment. They make use of their reason to inquire and debate, but not to fix and determine. Whoever shall imagine a perpetual confession of ignorance, a judgment without bias, propension, or inclination, upon any occasion whatever, conceives a true idea of Pyrrhonism. I express this fancy as well as I can, by reason that many find it hard to conceive, and the authors themselves represent it a little variously and obscurely.

As to what concerns the actions of life, they are in this of the common fashion. They yield and give up themselves to their natural inclinations, to the power and impulse of passions, to the constitution of laws and customs, and to the tradition of arts; Non enim nos Deus ista scire, sed tantummodo uti, voluit. ""For God would not have us know, but only use those things."" They suffer their ordinary actions to be guided by those things, without any dispute or judgment. For which reason I cannot consent to what is said of Pyrrho, by those who represent him heavy and immovable, leading a kind of savage and unsociable life, standing the jostle of carts, going upon the edge of precipices, and refusing to accommodate himself to the laws. This is to enhance upon his discipline; he would never make himself a stock or a stone, he would show himself a living man, discoursing, reasoning, enjoying all reasonable conveniences and pleasures, employing and making use of all his corporal and spiritual faculties in rule and reason. The fantastic, imaginary, and false privileges that man had usurped of lording it, ordaining, and establishing, he has utterly quitted and renounced. Yet there is no sect but is constrained to permit her sage to follow several things not comprehended, perceived, or consented to, if he means to live. And if he goes to sea, he follows that design, not knowing whether his voyage shall be successful or no; and only insists upon the tightness of the vessel, the experience of the pilot, and the convenience of the season, and such probable circumstances; after which he is bound to go, and suffer himself to be governed by appearances, provided there be no express and manifest contrariety in them. He has a body, he has a soul; the senses push them, the mind spurs them on. And although he does not find in himself this proper and singular sign of judging, and that he perceives that he ought not to engage his consent, considering that there may be some false, equal to these true appearances, yet does he not, for all that, fail of carrying on the offices of his life with great liberty and convenience. How many arts are there that profess to consist more in conjecture than knowledge; that decide not on true and false, and only follow that which seems so! There are, say they, true and false, and we have in us wherewith to seek it; but not to make it stay when we touch it. We are much more prudent, in letting ourselves be regulated by the order of the world, without inquiry. A soul clear from prejudice has a marvellous advance towards tranquillity and repose. Men that judge and control their judges, do never duly submit to them.

How much more docile and easy to be governed, both by the laws of religion and civil polity, are simple and incurious minds, than those over-vigilant wits, that will still be prating of divine and human causes! There is nothing in human invention that carries so great a show of likelihood and utility as this; this presents man, naked and empty, confessing his natural weakness, fit to receive some foreign force from above, unfurnished of human, and therefore more apt to receive into him the divine knowledge, making nought of his own judgment, to give more room to faith; neither disbelieving nor establishing any dogma against common observances; humble, obedient, disciplinable, and studious; a sworn enemy of heresy; and consequently freeing himself from vain and irreligious opinions, introduced by false sects. 'Tis a blank paper prepared to receive such forms from the finger of God as he shall please to write upon it. The more we resign and commit ourselves to God, and the more we renounce ourselves, of the greater value we are. ""Take in good part,"" says Ecclesiastes, ""the things that present themselves to thee, as they seem and taste from hand to mouth; the rest is out of thy knowledge."" Dominus novit cogitationes hominum, quoniam van sunt: ""The Lord knoweth the hearts of men, that they are but vanity.""

Thus we see that of the three general sects of philosophy, two make open profession of doubt and ignorance; and in that of the Dogmatists, which is the third, it is easy to discover that the greatest part of them only assume this face of confidence and assurance that they may produce the better effect; they have not so much thought to establish any certainty for us, as to show us how far they have proceeded in their search of truth: Quam docti jingunt magis quam nrunt: ""Which the learned rather feign than know."" Timus, being to instruct Socrates in what he knew of the gods, the world, and men, proposes to speak to him as a man to a man; and that it is sufficient, if his reasons are probable as those of another; for that exact reasons were neither in his nor any other mortal hand; which one of his followers has thus imitated: Ut potero, explicabo: nec tamen, ut Pythius Apollo, certa ut sint et fixa qu dixero; sed, ut homunculus, probabilia conjectur sequens: ""I will, as well as I am able, explain; affirming, yet not as the Pythian oracle, that what I say is fixed and certain, but like a mere man, that follows probabilities by conjecture."" And this, upon the natural and common subject of the contempt of death; he has elsewhere translated from the very words of Plato: Si forte, de Deorum natur ortuque mundi disserentes, minus id quod habemiis in animo consequi-mur, haud erit mirum; oquum est enim meminisse, et me, qui disseram, hominem esse, et vos, qui judicetis, ut, si probabilia dicentur, nihil ultra requiratis? ""If perchance, when we discourse of the nature of God, and the world's original, we cannot do it as we desire, it will be no great wonder. For it is just you should remember that both I who speak and you who are to judge, are men; so that if probable things are delivered, you shall require and expect no more."" Aristotle ordinarily heaps up a great number of other men's opinions and beliefs, to compare them with his own, and to let us see how much he has gone beyond them, and how much nearer he approaches to the likelihood of truth; for truth is not to be judged by the authority and testimony of others; which made Epicurus religiously avoid quoting them in his writings. This is the prince of all dogmatists, and yet we are told by him that the more we know the more we have room for doubt. In earnest, we sometimes see him shroud and muffle up himself in so thick and so inextricable an obscurity that we know not what to make of his advice; it is, in effect, a Pyrrhonism under a resolutive form. Hear Cicero's protestation, who expounds to us another's fancy by his own: Qui requirunt quid de quque re ipsi sentiamus, curiosius id faciunt quam necesse est,... Hoc in philosophi ratio, contra omnia disserendi, nuttamque rem aperte judicandi, profecta a Socrate, repetita ab Arcesila, conjirmata a Gameade, usqu ad nostram viget cetatem..........Hi sumus, qui omnibus veris falsa quodam adjuncta esse dicamus, tanta similitudine, ut in iis nulla insit certe judicandi et assentiendi nota. ""They who desire to know what we think of every thing are therein more inquisitive than is necessary. This practice in philosophy of disputing against every thing, and of absolutely concluding nothing, begun by Socrates, repeated by Arcesilaus, and confirmed by Cameades, has continued in use even to our own times. We are they who declare that there is so great a mixture of things false amongst all that are true, and they so resemble one another, that there can be in them no certain mark to direct us either to judge or assent."" Why hath not Aristotle only, but most of the philosophers, affected difficulty, if not to set a greater value upon the vanity of the subject, and amuse the curiosity of our minds by giving them this hollow and fleshless bone to pick? Clitomachus affirmed ""That he could never discover by Carneades's writings what opinion he was of."" This was it that made Epicurus affect to be abstruse, and that procured Heraclitus the epithet of [—Greek—] Difficulty is a coin the learned make use of, like jugglers, to conceal the vanity of their art, and which human sottishness easily takes for current pay.

                 Claras, ob obscuram linguam, magis inter manes...
         Omnia enim stolidi magis admirantur amantque
          Inversis qu sub verbis latitantia cemunt.

                ""Bombast and riddle best do puppies please,
         For fools admire and love such things as these;
         And a dull quibble, wrapt in dubious phrase,
          Up to the height doth their wise wonder raise.""
Cicero reprehends some of his friends for giving more of their time to the study of astrology, logic, and geometry, than they were really worth; saying that they were by these diverted from the duties of life, and more profitable and proper studies. The Cyrenaick philosophers, in like manner, despised physics and logic. Zeno, in the very beginning of the books of the commonwealth, declared all the liberal arts of no use. Chrysippus said ""That what Plato and Aristotle had writ, concerning logic, they had only done in sport, and by way of exercise;"" and could not believe that they spoke in earnest of so vain a thing. Plutarch says the same of metaphysics. And Epicurus would have said as much of rhetoric, grammar, poetry, mathematics, and, natural philosophy excepted, of all the sciences; and Socrates of them all, excepting that which treats of manners and of life. Whatever any one required to be instructed in, by him, he would ever, in the first place, demand an account of the conditions of his life present and past, which he examined and judged, esteeming all other learning subsequent to that and supernumerary: Parum mihi placeant e littero quo ad virtutem doctoribus nihil pro-fuerunt. ""That learning is in small repute with me which nothing profited the teachers themselves to virtue."" Most of the arts have been in like manner decried by the same knowledge; but they did not consider that it was from the purpose to exercise their wits in those very matters wherein there was no solid advantage.

As to the rest, some have looked upon Plato as a dogmatist, others as a doubter, others in some things the one, and in other things the other. Socrates, the conductor of his dialogues, is eternally upon questions and stirring up disputes, never determining, never satisfying, and professes to have no other science but that of opposing himself. Homer, their author, has equally laid the foundations of all the sects of philosophy, to show how indifferent it was which way we should choose. 'Tis said that ten several sects sprung from Plato; yet, in my opinion, never did any instruction halt and stumble, if his does not.

Socrates said that midwives, in taking upon them the trade of helping others to bring forth, left the trade of bringing forth themselves; and that by the title of a wise man or sage, which the gods had conferred upon him, he was disabled, in his virile and mental love, of the faculty of bringing forth, contenting himself to help and assist those that could; to open their nature, anoint the passes, and facilitate their birth; to judge of the infant, baptize, nourish, fortify, swath, and circumcise it, exercising and employing his understanding in the perils and fortunes of others.

It is so with the most part of this third sort of authors, as the ancients have observed in the writings of Anaxagoras, Democritus, Parmenides, Xenophanes, and others. They have a way of writing, doubtful in substance and design, rather inquiring than teaching, though they mix their style with some dogmatical periods. Is not the same thing seen in Seneca and Plutarch? How many contradictions are there to be found if a man pry narrowly into them! So many that the reconciling lawyers ought first to reconcile them every one to themselves. Plato seems to have affected this method of philosophizing in dialogues; to the end that he might with greater decency, from several mouths, deliver the diversity and variety of his own fancies. It is as well to treat variously of things as to treat of them conformably, and better, that is to say, more copiously and with greater profit. Let us take example from ourselves: judgments are the utmost point of all dogmatical and determinative speaking; and yet those arrets that our parliaments give the people, the most exemplary of them, and those most proper to nourish in them the reverence due to that dignity, principally through the sufficiency of the persons acting, derive their beauty not so much from the conclusion, which with them is quotidian and common to every judge, as from the dispute and heat of divers and contrary arguments that the matter of law and equity will permit And the largest field for reprehension that some philosophers have against others is drawn from the diversities and contradictions wherein every one of them finds himself perplexed, either on purpose to show the vacillation of the human mind concerning every thing, or ignorantly compelled by the volubility and incomprehensibility of all matter; which is the meaning of the maxim—""In a slippery and sliding place let us suspend our belief;"" for, as Euripides says,—

         ""God's various works perplex the thoughts of men.""
Like that which Empedocles, as if transported with a divine fury, and compelled by truth, often strewed here and there in his writings: ""No, no, we feel nothing, we see nothing; all things are concealed from us; there is not one thing of which we can positively say what it is;"" according to the divine saying: Cogitationes mortalium timid, et incert adinventiones nostro et providentice. ""For the thoughts of mortal men are doubtful; and our devices are but uncertain."" It is not to be thought strange if men, despairing to overtake what they hunt after, have not however lost the pleasure of the chase; study being of itself so pleasant an employment; and so pleasant that amongst the pleasures, the Stoics forbid that also which proceeds from the exercise of the mind, will have it curbed, and find a kind of intemperance in too much knowledge.

Democritus having eaten figs at his table that tasted of honey, fell presently to considering with himself whence they should derive this unusual sweetness; and to be satisfied in it, was about to rise from the table to see the place whence the figs had been gathered; which his maid observing, and having understood the cause, smilingly told him that ""he need not trouble himself about that, for she had put them into a vessel in which there had been honey."" He was vexed at this discovery, and that she had deprived him of the occasion of this inquiry, and robbed his curiosity of matter to work upon: ""Go thy way,"" said he, ""thou hast done me an injury; but, for all that, I will seek out the cause as if it were natural;"" and would willingly have found out some true reason for a false and imaginary effect. This story of a famous and great philosopher very clearly represents to us that studious passion that puts us upon the pursuit of things, of the acquisition of which we despair. Plutarch gives a like example of some one who would not be satisfied in that whereof he was in doubt, that he might not lose the pleasure of inquiring into it; like the other who would not that his physician should allay the thirst of his fever, that he might not lose the pleasure of quenching it by drinking. Satius est supervacua discere, quam nihil. ""'Tis better to learn more than necessary than nothing at all."" As in all sorts of feeding, the pleasure of eating is very often single and alone, and that what we take, which is acceptable to the palate, is not always nourishing or wholesome; so that which our minds extract from science does not cease to be pleasant, though there be nothing in it either nutritive or healthful. Thus they say: ""The consideration of nature is a diet proper for our minds, it raises and elevates us, makes us disdain low and terrestrial things, by comparing them with those that are celestial and high. The mere inquisition into great and occult things is very pleasant, even to those who acquire no other benefit than the reverence and fear of judging it."" This is what they profess. The vain image of this sickly curiosity is yet more manifest in this other example which they so often urge. ""Eudoxus wished and begged of the gods that he might once see the sun near at hand, to comprehend the form, greatness, and beauty of it; even though he should thereby be immediately burned."" He would at the price of his life purchase a knowledge, of which the use and possession should at the same time be taken from him; and for this sudden and vanishing knowledge lose all the other knowledge he had in present, or might afterwards have acquired.

I cannot easily persuade myself that Epicurus, Plato, and Pytagoras, have given us their atom, idea and numbers, for current pay. They were too wise to establish their articles of faith upon things so disputable and uncertain. But in that obscurity and ignorance in which the world then was, every one of these great men endeavoured to present some kind of image or reflection of light, and worked their brains for inventions that might have a pleasant and subtle appearance; provided that, though false, they might make good their ground against those that would oppose them. Unicuique ista pro ingenio finguntur, non ex scienti vi. ""These things every one fancies according to his wit, and not by any power of knowledge.""

One of the ancients, who was reproached, ""That he professed philosophy, of which he nevertheless in his own judgment made no great account,"" made answer, ""That this was truly to philosophize.""

They wished to consider all, to balance every thing, and found that an employment well suited to our natural curiosity. Some things they wrote for the benefit of public society, as their religions; and for that consideration it was but reasonable that they should not examine public opinions to the quick, that they might not disturb the common obedience to the laws and customs of their country.

Plato treats of this mystery with a raillery manifest enough; for where he writes according to his own method he gives no certain rule. When he plays the legislator he borrows a magisterial and positive style, and boldly there foists in his most fantastic inventions, as fit to persuade the vulgar, as impossible to be believed by himself; knowing very well how fit we are to receive all sorts of impressions, especially the most immoderate and preposterous; and yet, in his Laws, he takes singular care that nothing be sung in public but poetry, of which the fiction and fabulous relations tend to some advantageous end; it being so easy to imprint all sorts of phantasms in human minds, that it were injustice not to feed them rather with profitable untruths than with untruths that are unprofitable and hurtful. He says very roundly, in his Republic, ""That it is often necessary, for the benefit of men, to deceive them."" It is very easy to distinguish that some of the sects have more followed truth, and the others utility, by which the last have gained their reputation. 'Tis the misery of our condition that often that which presents itself to our imagination for the truest does not appear the most useful to life. The boldest sects, as the Epicurean, Pyrrhonian, and the new Academic, are yet constrained to submit to the civil law at the end of the account.

There are other subjects that they have tumbled and tossed about, some to the right and others to the left, every one endeavouring, right or wrong, to give them some kind of colour; for, having found nothing so abstruse that they would not venture to speak of, they are very often forced to forge weak and ridiculous conjectures; not that they themselves looked upon them as any foundation, or establishing any certain truth, but merely for exercise. Non tam id sensisse quod dicerent, quam exercere ingnia materio difficultate videntur voluisse. ""They seem not so much themselves to have believed what they said, as to have had a mind to exercise their wits in the difficulty of the matter."" And if we did not take it thus, how should we palliate so great inconstancy, variety, and vanity of opinions, as we see have been produced by those excellent and admirable men? As, for example, what can be more vain than to imagine, to guess at God, by our analogies and conjectures? To direct and govern him and the world by our capacities and our laws? And to serve ourselves, at the expense of the divinity, with what small portion of capacity he has been pleased to impart to our natural condition; and because we cannot extend our sight to his glorious throne, to have brought him down to our corruption and our miseries?

Of all human and ancient opinions concerning religion, that seems to me the most likely and most excusable, that acknowledged God as an incomprehensible power, the original and preserver of all things, all goodness, all perfection, receiving and taking in good part the honour and reverence that man paid him, under what method, name, or ceremonies soever—

               Jupiter omnipotens, rerum, regumque, demque,
            Progenitor, genitrixque.

                ""Jove, the almighty, author of all things,
         The father, mother, of both gods and kings.""
This zeal has universally been looked upon from heaven with a gracious eye. All governments have reaped fruit from their devotion; impious men and actions have everywhere had suitable events. Pagan histories acknowledge dignity, order, justice, prodigies, and oracles, employed for their profit and instruction in their fabulous religions; God, through his mercy, vouchsafing, by these temporal benefits, to cherish the tender principles of a kind of brutish knowledge that natural reason gave them of him, through the deceiving images of their dreams. Not only deceiving and false, but impious also and injurious, are those that man has forged from his own invention: and of all the religions that St. Paul found in repute at Athens, that which they had dedicated ""to the unknown God"" seemed to him the most to be excused.

Pythagoras shadowed the truth a little more closely, judging that the knowledge of this first cause and being of beings ought to be indefinite, without limitation, without declaration; that it was nothing else than the extreme effort of our imagination towards perfection, every one amplifying the idea according to the talent of his capacity. But if Numa attempted to conform the devotion of his people to this project; to attach them to a religion purely mental, without any prefixed object and material mixture, he undertook a thing of no use; the human mind could never support itself floating in such an infinity of inform thoughts; there is required some certain image to be presented according to its own model. The divine majesty has thus, in some sort, suffered himself to be circumscribed in corporal limits for our advantage. His supernatural and celestial sacraments have signs of our earthly condition; his adoration is by sensible offices and words; for 'tis man that believes and prays. I shall omit the other arguments upon this subject; but a man would have much ado to make me believe that the sight of our crucifixes, that the picture of our Saviour's passion, that the ornaments and ceremonious motions of our churches, that the voices accommodated to the devotion of our thoughts, and that emotion of the senses, do not warm the souls of the people with a religious passion of very advantageous effect.

Of those to whom they have given a body, as necessity required in that universal blindness, I should, I fancy, most incline to those who adored the sun:—

               La Lumire commune,
          L'oil du monde; et si Dieu au chef porte des yeux,
           Les rayons du soleil sont ses yeulx radieux,
            Qui donnent vie  touts, nous maintiennent et gardent,
           Et les faictsdes humains en ce monde regardent:
          Ce beau, ce grand soleil qui nous faict les saisons,
         Selon qu'il entre ou sort de ses douze maisons;
         Qui remplit l'univers de ses vertus cognues;
          Qui d'un traict de ses yeulx nous dissipe les nues;
           L'esprit, l'ame du monde, ardent et flamboyant,
           En la course d'un jour tout le Ciel tournoyant;
           Plein d'immense grandeur, rond, vagabond, et ferme;
            Lequel tient dessoubs luy tout le monde pour terme:
          En repos, sans repos; oysif, et sans sjour;
         Fils aisn de nature, et le pre du jour:

                ""The common light that equal shines on all,
           Diffused around the whole terrestrial ball;
           And, if the almighty Ruler of the skies
          Has eyes, the sunbeams are his radiant eyes,
           That life and safety give to young and old,
            And all men's actions upon earth behold.
           This great, this beautiful, the glorious sun,
           Who makes their course the varied seasons run;
         That with his virtues fills the universe,
           And with one glance can sullen clouds disperse;
          Earth's life and soul, that, flaming in his sphere,
          Surrounds the heavens in one day's career;
         Immensely great, moving yet firm and round,
         Who the whole world below has made his bound;
         At rest, without rest, idle without stay,
         Nature's first son, and father of the day:""
forasmuch as, beside this grandeur and beauty of his, 'tis the only piece of this machine that we discover at the remotest distance from us; and by that means so little known that they were pardonable for entering into so great admiration and reverence of it.

Thales, who first inquired into this sort of matter, believed God to be a Spirit that made all things of water; Anaximander, that the gods were always dying and entering into life again; and that there were an infinite number of worlds; Anaximines, that the air was God, that he was procreate and immense, always moving. Anaxagoras the first, was of opinion that the description and manner of all things were conducted by the power and reason of an infinite spirit. Alcmon gave divinity to the sun, moon, and stars, and to the soul. Pythagoras made God a spirit, spread over the nature of all things, whence our souls are extracted; Parmenides, a circle surrounding the heaven, and supporting the world by the ardour of light. Empedocles pronounced the four elements, of which all things are composed, to be gods; Protagoras had nothing to say, whether they were or were not, or what they were; Democritus was one while of opinion that the images and their circuitions were gods; another while, the nature that darts out those images; and then, our science and intelligence. Plato divides his belief into several opinions; he says, in his Timus, that the Father of the World cannot be named; in his Laws, that men are not to inquire into his being; and elsewhere, in the very same books, he makes the world, the heavens, the stars, the earth, and our souls, gods; admitting, moreover, those which have been received by ancient institution in every republic.

Xenophon reports a like perplexity in Socrates's doctrine; one while that men are not to inquire into the form of God, and presently makes him maintain that the sun is God, and the soul God; that there is but one God, and then that there are many. Speusippus, the nephew of Plato, makes God a certain power governing all things, and that he has a soul. Aristotle one while says it is the spirit, and another the world; one while he gives the world another master, and another while makes God the heat of heaven. Zenocrates makes eight, five named amongst the planets; the sixth composed of all the fixed stars, as of so many members; the seventh and eighth, the sun and moon. Heraclides Ponticus does nothing but float in his opinion, and finally deprives God of sense, and makes him shift from one form to another, and at last says that it is heaven and earth. Theophrastus wanders in the same irresolution amongst his fancies, attributing the superintendency of the world one while to the understanding, another while to heaven, and then to the stars. Strato says that 'tis nature, she having the power of generation, augmentation, and diminution, without form and sentiment Zeno says 'tis the law of nature, commanding good and prohibiting evil; which law is an animal; and takes away the accustomed gods, Jupiter, Juno, and Vesta. Diogenes Apolloniates, that 'tis air. Zenophanes makes God round, seeing and hearing, not breathing, and having nothing in common with human nature. Aristo thinks the form of God to be incomprehensible, deprives him of sense, and knows not whether he be an animal or something else; Cleanthes, one while supposes it to be reason, another while the world, another the soul of nature, and then the supreme heat rolling about, and environing all. Perseus, Zeno's disciple, was of opinion that men have given the title of gods to such as have been useful, and have added any notable advantage to human life, and even to profitable things themselves. Chrysippus made a confused heap of all the preceding theories, and reckons, amongst a thousand forms of gods that he makes, the men also that have been deified. Diagoras and Theodoras flatly denied that there were any gods at all. Epicurus makes the gods shining, transparent, and perflable, lodged as betwixt two forts, betwixt two worlds, secure from blows, clothed in a human figure, and with such members as we have; which members are to them of no use:—

              Ego Deum genus esse semper duxi, et dicam colitum;
         Sed eos non curare opinor quid agat humanum genus.

              ""I ever thought that gods above there were,
         But do not think they care what men do here.""

Trust to your philosophy, my masters; and brag that you have found the bean in the cake when you see what a rattle is here with so many philosophical heads! The perplexity of so many worldly forms has gained this over me, that manners and opinions contrary to mine do not so much displease as instruct me; nor so much make me proud as they humble me, in comparing them. And all other choice than what comes from the express and immediate hand of God seems to me a choice of very little privilege. The policies of the world are no less opposite upon this subject than the schools, by which we may understand that fortune itself is not more variable and inconstant, nor more blind and inconsiderate, than our reason. The things that are most unknown are most proper to be deified; wherefore to make gods of ourselves, as the ancients did, exceeds the extremest weakness of understanding. I would much rather have gone along with those who adored the serpent, the dog, or the ox; forasmuch as their nature and being is less known to us, and that we have more room to imagine what we please of those beasts, and to attribute to them extraordinary faculties. But to have made gods of our own condition, of whom we ought to know the imperfections; and to have attributed to them desire, anger, revenge, marriages, generation, alliances, love, jealousy, our members and bones, our fevers and pleasures, our death and obsequies; this must needs have proceeded from a marvellous inebriety of the human understanding;

              Qu procul usque adeo divino ab numine distant,
          Inque Dem numro qu sint indigna videri;

              ""From divine natures these so distant are,
         They are unworthy of that character.""
Formo, otates, vestitus, omatus noti sunt; genera, conjugia, cognationes, omniaque traducta ad similitudinem imbellitar tis humano: nam et perturbatis animis inducuntur; accipimus enim deorurn cupiditates, cegritudines, iracundias; ""Their forms, ages, clothes, and ornaments are known: their descents, marriages, and kindred, and all adapted to the similitude of human weakness; for they are represented to us with anxious minds, and we read of the lusts, sickness, and anger of the gods;"" as having attributed divinity not only to faith, virtue, honour, concord, liberty, victory, and piety; but also to voluptuousness, fraud, death, envy, old age, misery; to fear, fever, ill fortune, and other injuries of our frail and transitory life:—

              Quid juvat hoc, templis nostros inducere mores?
         O curv in terris anim et colestium inanes!

               ""O earth-born souls! by earth-born passions led,
         To every spark of heav'nly influence dead!
         Think ye that what man values will inspire
         In minds celestial the same base desire?""
The Egyptians, with an impudent prudence, interdicted, upon pain of hanging, that any one should say that their gods, Serapis and Isis, had formerly been men; and yet no one was ignorant that they had been such; and their effigies, represented with the finger upon the mouth, signified, says Varro, that mysterious decree to their priests, to conceal their mortal original, as it must by necessary consequence cancel all the veneration paid to them. Seeing that man so much desired to equal himself to God, he had done better, says Cicero, to have attracted those divine conditions to himself, and drawn them down hither below, than to send his corruption and misery up on high; but, to take it right, he has several ways done both the one and the other, with like vanity of opinion.

When philosophers search narrowly into the hierarchy of their gods, and make a great bustle about distinguishing their alliances, offices, and power, I cannot believe they speak as they think. When Plato describes Pluto's orchard to us, and the bodily conveniences or pains that attend us after the ruin and annihilation of our bodies, and accommodates them to the feeling we have in this life:—

                Secreti celant calles, et myrtea circum
         Sylva tegit; cur non ips in morte relinquunt;

              ""In secret vales and myrtle groves they lie,
         Nor do cares leave them even when they die.""
when Mahomet promises his followers a Paradise hung with tapestry, gilded and enamelled with gold and precious stones, furnished with wenches of excelling beauty, rare wines, and delicate dishes; it is easily discerned that these are deceivers that accommodate their promises to our sensuality, to attract and allure us by hopes and opinions suitable to our mortal appetites. And yet some amongst us are fallen into the like error, promising to themselves after the resurrection a terrestrial and temporal life, accompanied with all sorts of worldly conveniences and pleasures. Can we believe that Plato, he who had such heavenly conceptions, and was so well acquainted with the Divinity as thence to derive the name of the Divine Plato, ever thought that the poor creature, man, had any thing in him applicable to that incomprehensible power? and that he believed that the weak holds we are able to take were capable, or the force of our understanding sufficient, to participate of beatitude or eternal pains? We should then tell him from human reason: ""If the pleasures thou dost promise us in the other life are of the same kind that I have enjoyed here below, this has nothing in common with infinity; though all my five natural senses should be even loaded with pleasure, and my soul full of all the contentment it could hope or desire, we know what all this amounts to, all this would be nothing; if there be any thing of mine there, there is nothing divine; if this be no more than what may belong to our present condition, it cannot be of any value. All contentment of mortals is mortal. Even the knowledge of our parents, children, and friends, if that can affect and delight us in the other world, if that still continues a satisfaction to us there, we still remain in earthly and finite conveniences. We cannot as we ought conceive the greatness of these high and divine promises, if we could in any sort conceive them; to have a worthy imagination of them we must imagine them unimaginable, inexplicable, and incomprehensible, and absolutely another thing than those of our miserable experience."" ""Eye hath not seen,"" saith St. Paul, ""nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man, the things that God hath prepared for them that love him."" And if, to render us capable, our being were reformed and changed (as thou, Plato, sayest, by thy purifications), it ought to be so extreme and total a change, that by physical doctrine it be no more us;—

                Hector erat tunc cum bello certabat; at ille
          Tractus ab monio non erat Hector eqao;

               He Hector was whilst he could fight, but when
          Dragg'd by Achilles' steeds, no Hector then;
it must be something else that must receive these recompenses:—

              Quod mutatur... dissolvitur; interit ergo;
         Trajiciuntur enim partes, atque ordine migrant.

             ""Things changed dissolved are, and therefore die;
         Their parts are mix'd, and from their order fly.""
For in Pythagoras's metempsychosis, and the change of habitation that he imagined in souls, can we believe that the lion, in whom the soul of Csar is enclosed, does espouse Csar's passions, or that the lion is he? For if it was still Csar, they would be in the right who, controverting this opinion with Plato, reproach him that the son might be seen to ride his mother transformed into a mule, and the like absurdities. And can we believe that in the mutations that are made of the bodies of animals into others of the same kind, the new comers are not other than their predecessors? From the ashes of a phoenix, a worm, they say, is engendered, and from that another phoenix; who can imagine that this second phoenix is no other than the first? We see our silk-worms, as it were, die and wither; and from this withered body a butterfly is produced; and from that another worm; how ridiculous would it be to imagine that this was still the first! That which once has ceased to be is no more:—

              Nec, si materiam nostram collegerit tas
         Post obitum, rursumque redegerit, ut sita nunc est,
         Atque iterum nobis fuerint data lumina vit,
         Pertineat quidquam tamen ad nos id quoque factum,
         Interrupta semel cum sit repetentia nostra.

              ""Neither tho' time should gather and restore
         Our matter to the form it was before,
         And give again new light to see withal,
         Would that new figure us concern at all;
         Or we again ever the same be seen,
         Our being having interrupted been.""
And, Plato, when thou sayest in another place that it shall be the spiritual part of man that will be concerned in the fruition of the recompense of another life, thou tellest us a thing wherein there is as little appearance of truth:—

              Scilicet, avolsis radicibus, ut nequit ullam
          Dispicere ipsa oculus rem, seorsum corpore toto;

              ""No more than eyes once from their optics torn,
         Can ever after any thing discern;""
for, by this account, it would no more be man, nor consequently us, who would be concerned in this enjoyment; for we are composed of two principal essential parts, the separation of which is the death and ruin of our being:—

              Inter enim jecta est vital pausa, vageque
         Deerrarunt passim motus ab sensibus omnes;

              ""When once that pause of life is come between,
           'Tis just the same as we had never been;""
we cannot say that the man suffers when the worms feed upon his members, and that the earth consumes them:—

              Et nihil hoc ad nos, qui coltu conjugioque
         Corporis atque anim consistimus uniter apti.

             ""What's that to us? for we are only we,
         While soul and body in one frame agree.""
Moreover, upon what foundation of their justice can the gods take notice of or reward man after his death and virtuous actions, since it was themselves that put them in the way and mind to do them? And why should they be offended at or punish him for wicked ones, since themselves have created in him so frail a condition, and when, with one glance of their will, they might prevent him from falling? Might not Epicurus, with great colour of human reason, object this to Plato, did he not often save himself with this sentence: ""That it is impossible to establish any thing certain of the immortal nature by the mortal?"" She does nothing but err throughout, but especially when she meddles with divine things. Who does more evidently perceive this than we? For although we have given her certain and infallible principles; and though we have enlightened her steps with the sacred lamp of truth that it has pleased God to communicate to us; we daily see, nevertheless, that if she swerve never so little from the ordinary path; and that she stray from, or wander out of the way set out and beaten by the church, how soon she loses, confounds and fetters herself, tumbling and floating in this vast, turbulent, and waving sea of human opinions, without restraint, and without any determinate end; so soon as she loses that great and common road, she enters into a labyrinth of a thousand several paths.

Man cannot be any thing but what he is, nor imagine beyond the reach of his capacity. ""Tis a greater presumption,"" says Plutarch, ""in them who are but men to attempt to speak and discourse of the gods and demi-gods than it is in a man utterly ignorant of music to give an opinion of singing; or in a man who never saw a camp to dispute about arms and martial affairs, presuming by some light conjecture to understand the effects of an art he is totally a stranger to."" Antiquity, I believe, thought to put a compliment upon, and to add something to, the divine grandeur in assimilating it to man, investing it with his faculties, and adorning it with his ugly humours and most shameful necessities; offering it our aliments to eat, presenting it with our dances, mummeries, and farces, to divert it; with our vestments to cover it, and our houses to inhabit, coaxing it with the odour of incense and the sounds of music, with festoons and nosegays; and to accommodate it to our vicious passions, flattering its justice with inhuman vengeance, and with the ruin and dissipation of things by it created and preserved as Tiberius Sempronius, who burnt the rich spoils and arms he had gained from the enemy in Sardinia for a sacrifice to Vulcan; and Paulus milius, those of Macedonia, to Mars and Minerva; and Alexander, arriving at the Indian Ocean, threw several great vessels of gold into the sea, in honour of Thetes; and moreover loading her altars with a slaughter not of innocent beasts only, but of men also, as several nations, and ours among the rest, were commonly used to do; and I believe there is no nation under the sun that has not done the same:—

               Sulmone creatos
         Quatuor hc juvenes, totidem quos educat Ufens,
         Viventes rapit, inferias quos immolet umbris.

              ""Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred,
          He took in flight, and living victims led,
         To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire
         In sacrifice before his fun'ral pyre.""
The Get hold themselves to be immortal, and that their death is nothing but a journey to their god Zamolxis. Every five years they dispatch some one among them to him, to entreat of him such necessaries as they stand in need of. This envoy is chosen by lot, and the form of dispatching him, after he has been instructed by word of mouth what he is to deliver, is that of the assistants, three hold up as many javelins, upon which the rest throw his body with all their force. If he happen to be wounded in a mortal part, and that he immediately dies, 'tis held a certain argument of divine favour; but if he escapes, he is looked upon as a wicked and execrable wretch, and another is dismissed after the same manner in his stead. Amestris, the mother of Xerxes, being grown old, caused at once fourteen young men, of the best families of Persia, to be buried alive, according to the religion of the country, to gratify some infernal deity. And even to this day the idols of Themixtitan are cemented with the blood of little children, and they delight in no sacrifice but of these pure and infantine souls; a justice thirsty of innocent blood:—

              Tantum religio potuit suadere maloram.

         ""Such impious use was of religion made,
         So many demon acts it could persuade.""
The Carthaginians immolated their own children to Saturn; and those who had none of their own bought of others, the father and mother being in the mean time obliged to assist at the ceremony with a gay and contented countenance.

It was a strange fancy to think to gratify the divine bounty with our afflictions; like the Lacedemonians, who regaled their Diana with the tormenting of young boys, whom they caused to be whipped for her sake, very often to death. It was a savage humour to imagine to gratify the architect by the subversion of his building, and to think to take away the punishment due to the guilty by punishing the innocent; and that poor Iphigenia, at the port of Aulis, should by her death and immolation acquit, towards God, the whole army of the Greeks from all the crimes they had committed;

               Et casta inceste, nubendi tempore in ipso,
         Hostia concideret mactatu mosta parentis;

              ""That the chaste virgin in her nuptial band
         Should die by an unnat'ral father's hand;""
and that the two noble and generous souls of the two Decii, the father and the son, to incline the favour of the gods to be propitious to the affairs of Rome, should throw themselves headlong into the thickest of the enemy: Quo fuit tanta deorum iniquitas, ut placari populo Romano non possent, nisi tales viri occidissent? ""How great an injustice in the gods was it that they could not be reconciled to the people of Rome unless such men perished!"" To which may be added, that it is not for the criminal to cause himself to be scourged according to his own measure nor at his own time, but that it purely belongs to the judge, who considers nothing as chastisements but the penalty that he appoints, and cannot call that punishment which proceeds from the consent of him that suffers. The divine vengeance presupposes an absolute dissent in us, both for its justice and for our own penalty. And therefore it was a ridiculous humour of Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, who, to interrupt the continued course of his good fortune, and to balance it, went and threw the dearest and most precious jewel he had into the sea, believing that by this voluntary and antedated mishap he bribed and satisfied the revolution and vicissitude of fortune; and she, to mock his folly, ordered it so that the same jewel came again into his hands, found in the belly of a fish. And then to what end were those tearings and dismemberments of the Corybantes, the Menades, and, in our times, of the Mahometans, who slash their faces, bosoms, and limbs, to gratify their prophet; seeing that the offence lies in the will, not in the breast, eyes, genitals, roundness of form, the shoulders, or the throat? Tantus est perturbto mentis, et sedibus suis pilso, furor, ut sic dii placentur, quemadmodum ne homines quidem soviunt. ""So great is the fury and madness of troubled minds when once displaced from the seat of reason, as if the gods should be appeased with what even men are not so cruel as to approve."" The use of this natural contexture has not only respect to us, but also to the service of God and other men; 'tis as unjust for us voluntarily to wound or hurt it as to kill ourselves upon any pretence whatever; it seems to be great cowardice and treason to exercise cruelty upon, and to destroy, the functions of the body that are stupid and servile, to spare the soul the solicitude of governing them according to reason: Ubi iratos deos timent, qui sic propitios habere merentur? In regi libidinis voluptatem castrati sunt quidam; sed nemo sibi, ne vir esset, jubente domino, mantis intulit. ""Where are they so afraid of the anger of the gods as to merit their favour at that rate? Some, indeed, have been made eunuchs for the lust of princes: but no man at his master's command has put his own hand to unman himself."" So did they fill their religion with several ill effects:—

         Spius olim Religio peperit scelerosa atque impia facta.

         ""In elder times Religion did commit most fearful crimes.""
Now nothing of ours can in any sort be compared or likened unto the divine nature, which will not blemish and stain it with much imperfection.

How can that infinite beauty, power, and goodness, admit of any correspondence or similitude to such abject things as we are, without extreme wrong and manifest dishonour to his divine greatness? Infirmum dei fortius est hominibs; et stultum dei sapientius est hominibus. ""For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."" Stilpo, the philosopher, being asked, ""Whether the gods were delighted with our adorations and sacrifices?""—""You are indiscreet,"" answered he; ""let us withdraw apart, if you would talk of such things."" Nevertheless, we prescribe him bounds, we keep his power besieged by our reasons (I call our ravings and dreams reason, with the dispensation of philosophy, which says, ""That the wicked man, and even the fool, go mad by reason, but a particular form of reason""), we would subject him to the vain and feeble appearances of our understandings,—him who has made both us and our knowledge. Because that nothing is made of nothing, God therefore could not make the world without matter. What! has God put into our hands the keys and most secret springs of his power? Is he obliged not to exceed the limits of our knowledge? Put the case, O man! that thou hast been able here to mark some footsteps of his effects; dost thou therefore think that he has employed all he can, and has crowded all his forms and ideas in this work? Thou seest nothing but the order and revolution of this little cave in which thou art lodged, if, indeed, thou dost see so much; whereas his divinity has an infinite jurisdiction beyond. This part is nothing in comparison of the whole:—

                Omnia cum colo, terrque, manque,
           Nil sunt ad summam summal totius omnem.

               ""The earth, the sea, and skies, from pole to pole,
           Are small, nay, nothing to the mighty whole.""
'Tis a municipal law that thou allegest, thou knowest not what is universal Tie thyself to that to which thou art subject, but not him; he is not of thy brotherhood, thy fellow-citizen, or companion. If he has in some sort communicated himself unto thee, 'tis not to debase himself unto thy littleness, nor to make thee comptroller of his power; the human body cannot fly to the clouds; rules are for thee. The sun runs every day his ordinary course; the bounds of the sea and the earth cannot be confounded; the water is unstable and without firmness; a wall, unless it be broken, is impenetrable to a solid body; a man cannot preserve his life in the flames; he cannot be both in heaven and upon earth, and corporally in a thousand places at once. 'Tis for thee that he has made these rules; 'tis thee that they concern; he has manifested to Christians that he has enfranchised himself from them all when it pleased him. And, in truth, why, almighty as he is, should he have limited his power within any certain bounds? In favour of whom should he have renounced his privilege? Thy reason has in no other thing more of likelihood and foundation than in that wherein it persuades thee that there is a plurality of worlds:—

                 Terramque et solem, lunam, mare, estera quo rant,
           Non esse unica, sed numro magis innumerali.

                  ""That earth, sun, moon, sea, and the rest that are,
           Not single, but innumerable were.""
The most eminent minds of elder times believed it; and some of this age of ours, compelled by the appearances of human reason, do the same; forasmuch as in this fabric that we behold there is nothing single and one,

          Cum in summ res nulla sit una,
           Unica quo gignatur, et unica solaque crescat;

                ""Since nothing's single in this mighty place,
           That can alone beget, alone increase;""
and that all the kinds are multiplied in some number; by which it seems not to be likely that God should have made this work only without a companion; and that the matter of this form should have been totally drained in this individual.

               Quare etiam atque etiam tales fateare necesse est
           Esse alios alibi congressus materiali;
          Qualis hic est, avido complexu quem tenet ther.

               ""Wherefore 'tis necessary to confess
          That there must elsewhere be the like congress
          Of the like matter, which the airy space
          Holds fast within its infinite embrace.""
Especially if it be a living creature, which its motions render so credible that Plato affirms it, and that many of our people do either confirm, or dare not deny it; no more than that ancient opinion that the heavens, the stars, and other members of the world, are creatures composed of body and soul, mortal in respect of their composition, but immortal by the determination of the Creator. Now if there be many worlds, as Democritus, Epicurus, and almost all philosophy has believed, what do we know that the principles and rules of this of ours in like manner concern the rest? They may peradventure have another form and another polity. Epicurus supposes them either like or unlike. We see in this world an infinite difference and variety, only by distance of places; neither com, wine, nor any of our animals are to be seen in that new comer of the world discovered by our fathers; 'tis all there another thing; and in times past, do but consider in how many parts of the world they had no knowledge either of Bacchus or Ceres. If Pliny and Herodotus are to be believed, there are in certain places kinds of men very little resembling us, mongrel and ambiguous forms, betwixt the human and brutal natures; there are countries where men are bom without heads, having their mouth and eyes in their breast; where they are all hermaphrodites; where they go on all four; where they have but one eye in the forehead, and a head more like a dog than like ours; where they are half fish the lower part, and live in the water; where the women bear at five years old, and live but eight; where the head and the skin of the forehead is so hard that a sword will not touch it, but rebounds again; where men have no beards; nations that know not the use of fire; others that eject seed of a black colour. What shall we say of those that naturally change themselves into wolves, colts, and then into men again? And if it be true, as Plutarch says, that in some place of the Indies there are men without mouths, who nourish themselves with the smell of certain odours, how many of our descriptions are false? He is no longer risible, nor, perhaps, capable of reason and society. The disposition and cause of our internal composition would then for the most part be to no purpose, and of no use.

Moreover, how many things are there in our own knowledge that oppose those fine rules we have cut out for and prescribe to nature? And yet we must undertake to circumscribe thereto God himself! How many things do we call miraculous, and contrary to nature? This is done by every nation and by every man, according to the proportion of his ignorance. How many occult properties and quintessences do we daily discover? For, for us to go ""according to nature,"" is no more but to go ""according to our understanding,"" as far as that is able to follow, and as far as we are able to see into it; all beyond that is, forsooth, monstrous and irregular. Now, by this account, all things shall be monstrous to the wisest and most understanding men; for human reason has persuaded them that there was no manner of ground nor foundation, not so much as to be assured that snow is white, and Anaxagoras affirmed it to be black; if there be any thing, or if there be nothing; if there be knowledge or ignorance, which Metrodorus of Chios denied that man was able to determine; or whether we live, as Euripides doubts whether the life we live is life, or whether that we call death be not life, [—Greek—] and not without some appearance. For why do we derive the title of being from this instant, which is but a flash in the infinite course of an eternal night, and so short an interruption of our perpetual and natural condition, death possessing all the before and after this moment, and also a good part of the moment itself. Others swear there is no motion at all, as followers of Melissus, and that nothing stirs. For if there be but one, neither can that spherical motion be of any use to him, nor motion from one place to another, as Plato proves: ""That there is neither generation nor corruption in nature."" Protagoras says that there is nothing in nature but doubt; that a man may equally dispute of all things; and even of this, whether a man can equally dispute of all things; Nausiphanes, that of things which seem to be, nothing is more than it is not; that there is nothing certain but uncertainty; Parmenides, that of that which seems, there is no one thing in general; that there is but one thing; Zeno, that one same is not, and that there is nothing; if there were one thing, it would either be in another or in itself; if it be in another, they are two; if it be in itself, they are yet two; the comprehending, and the comprehended. According to these doctrines the nature of things is no other than a shadow, either false or vain.

This way of speaking in a Christian man has ever seemed to me very indiscreet and irreverent. ""God cannot die; God cannot contradict himself; God cannot do this or that."" I do not like to have the divine power so limited by the laws of men's mouths; and the idea which presents itself to us in those propositions ought to be more religiously and reverently expressed.

Our speaking has its failings and defects, as well as all the rest. Most of the occasions of disturbance in the world are grammatical ones; our suits only spring from disputes as to the interpretation of laws; and most wars proceed from the inability of ministers clearly to express the conventions and treaties of amity of princes. How many quarrels, and of how great importance, has the doubt of the meaning of this syllable, hoc,* created in the world? Let us take the clearest conclusion that logic itself

            * Montaigne here refers to the controversies between
              the Catholics and Protestants about transubstantiation.
presents us withal; if you say, ""It is fine weather,"" and that you say true, it is then fine weather. Is not this a very certain form of speaking? And yet it will deceive us; that it will do so, let us follow the example: If you say, ""I lie,"" if you say true, you do lie. The art, the reason, and force of the conclusion of this, are the same with the other, and yet we are gravelled. The Pyrrhonian philosophers, I see, cannot express their general conception in any kind of speaking; for they would require a new language on purpose; ours is all formed of affirmative propositions, which are totally antarctic to them; insomuch that when they say ""I doubt,"" they are presently taken by the throat, to make them confess that at least they know and are assured that they do doubt. By which means they have been compelled to shelter themselves under this medical comparison, without which their humour would be inexplicable: when they pronounce, ""I know not,"" or, ""I doubt,"" they say that this proposition carries off itself with the rest, no more nor less than rhubarb, that drives out the ill humours, and carries itself off with them. This fancy will be more certainly understood by interrogation: ""What do I know?"" as I bear it with the emblem of a balance.

See what use they make of this irreverent way of speaking; in the present disputes about our religion, if you press its adversaries too hard, they will roundly tell you, ""that it is not in the power of God to make it so, that his body should be in paradise and upon earth, and in several places at once."" And see, too, what advantage the old scoffer made of this. ""At least,"" says he, ""it is no little consolation to man to see that God cannot do all things; for he cannot kill himself, though he would; which is the greatest privilege we have in our condition; he cannot make mortal immortal, nor revive the dead; nor make it so, that he who has lived has not; nor that he who has had honours has not had them; having no other right to the past than that of oblivion."" And that the comparison of man to God may yet be made out by jocose examples: ""He cannot order it so,"" says he, ""that twice ten shall not be twenty."" This is what he says, and what a Christian ought to take heed shall not escape his lips. Whereas, on the contrary, it seems as if men studied this foolish daring of language, to reduce God to their own measure:—

                Cras vel atr Nube polum, Pater, occupato,
          Vel sole puro; non tamen irritum
          Quodcumque retro est efficiet, neque
           Diffinget infectumque reddet
            Quod fugiens semel hora vexit.

               ""To-morrow, let it shine or rain,
           Yet cannot this the past make vain:
           Nor uncreate and render void
           That which was yesterday enjoyed.""
When we say that the infinity of ages, as well past as to come, are but one instant with God; that his goodness, wisdom, and power are the same with his essence; our mouths speak it, but our understandings apprehend it not; and yet, such is our vain opinion of ourselves, that we must make the Divinity to pass through our sieve; and thence proceed all the dreams and errors with which the world abounds, whilst we reduce and weigh in our balance a thing so far above our poise. Mirum quo procdat improbitas cordis humani, parvulo aliquo intritata successu. ""'Tis wonderful to what the wickedness of man's heart will proceed, if elevated with the least success."" How magisterially and insolently does Epicurus reprove the Stoics, for maintaining that the truly good and happy being appertained only to God, and that the wise man had nothing but a shadow and resemblance of it! How temerariously have they bound God to destiny (a thing which, by my consent, none that bears the name of a Christian shall ever do again)! and Thales, Plato, and Pythagoras have enslaved him to necessity. This arrogance of attempting to discover God with our eyes has been the cause that an eminent person among us has attributed to the Divinity a corporal form; and is the reason of what happens to us every day, of attributing to God important events, by a particular assignment. Because they weigh with us, they conclude that they also weigh with him, and that he has a more intent and vigilant regard to them than to others of less moment to us or of ordinary course: Magna Dii curant, parva negligunt: ""The gods are concerned at great matters, but slight the small."" Listen to him; he will clear this to you by his reason: Nec in regnis quidem reges omnia minima curant: ""Neither indeed do kings in their administration take notice of all the least concerns."" As if to that King of kings it were more or less to subvert a kingdom, or to move the leaf of a tree; or as if his providence acted after another manner in inclining the event of a battle than in the leap of a flea. The hand of his government is laid upon every thing after the same manner, with the same power and order; our interest does nothing towards it; our inclinations and measures sway nothing with him. Deus ita artifex magnus in magnis, ut minor non sit in parvis: ""God is so great an artificer in great things, that he is no less in the least"" Our arrogancy sets this blasphemous comparison ever before us. Because our employments are a burden to us, Strato has courteously been pleased to exempt the gods from all offices, as their priests are; he makes nature produce and support all things; and with her weights and motions make up the several parts of the world, discharging human nature from the awe of divine judgments: Quod beatum terumque sit, id nec habere negotii quicquam, nec exhibere alteri: ""What is blessed and eternal has neither any business itself nor gives any to another."" Nature will that in like things there should be a like relation. The infinite number of mortals, therefore, concludes a like number of immortals; the infinite things that kill and destroy presupposes as many that preserve and profit. As the souls of the gods, without tongue, eye, or ear, do every one of them feel amongst themselves what the other feels, and judge our thoughts; so the souls of men, when at liberty and loosed from the body, either by sleep or some ecstacy, divine, foretell, and see things, which, whilst joined to the body, they could not see. ""Men,"" says St. Paul, ""professing themselves to be wise, they become fools; and change the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man."" Do but take notice of the juggling in the ancient deifications. After the great and stately pomp of the funeral, so soon as the fire began to mount to the top of the pyramid, and to catch hold of the couch where the body lay, they at the same time turned out an eagle, which flying upward, signified that the soul went into Paradise. We have a thousand medals, and particularly of the worthy Faustina, where this eagle is represented carrying these deified souls to heaven with their heels upwards. 'Tis pity that we should fool ourselves with our own fopperies and inventions,

          Quod finxere, timent,

          ""They fear their own inventions,""
like children who are frighted with the same face of their playfellow, that they themselves have smeared and smutted. Quasi quicquam infelicius sit homine, cui sua figmenta dominantur:

""As if any thing could be more unhappy than man, who is insulted over by his own imagination."" 'Tis far from honouring him who made us, to honour him that we have made. Augustus had more temples than Jupiter, served with as much religion and belief of miracles. The Thracians, in return of the benefits they had received from Agesilaus, came to bring him word that they had canonized him: ""Has your nation,"" said he to them, ""the power to make gods of whom they please? Pray first deify some one amongst yourselves, and when I shall see what advantage he has by it, I will thank you for your offer."" Man is certainly stark mad; he cannot make a worm, and yet he will be making gods by dozens. Hear Trismegistus in praise of our sufficiency: ""Of all the wonderful things, it surmounts all wonder that man could find out the divine nature and make it."" And take here the arguments of the school of philosophy itself:—

               Nosse cui divos et coli munina soli,
          Aut soli nescire, datum.

               ""To whom to know the deities of heaven,
          Or know he knows them not, alone 'tis given.""
""If there is a God, he is a living creature; if he be a living creature, he has sense; and if he has sense, he is subject to corruption. If he be without a body he is without a soul, and consequently without action; and if he has a body, it is perishable."" Is not here a triumph? we are incapable of having made the world; there must then be some more excellent nature that has put a hand to the work. It were a foolish and ridiculous arrogance to esteem ourselves the most perfect thing of the universe. There must then be something that is better, and that must be God. When you see a stately and stupendous edifice, though you do not know who is the owner of it, you would yet conclude it was not built for rats. And this divine structure, that we behold of the celestial palace, have we not reason to believe that it is the residence of some possessor, who is much greater than we? Is not the most supreme always the most worthy? but we are in the lowest form. Nothing without a soul and without reason can produce a living creature capable of reason. The world produces us, the world then has soul and reason. Every part of us is less than we. We are part of the world, the world therefore is endued with wisdom and reason, and that more abundantly than we. 'Tis a fine thing to have a great government; the government of the world then appertains to some happy nature. The stars do us no harm; they are then full of goodness. We have need of nourishment; then so have the gods also, and feed upon the vapours of the earth. Worldly goods are not goods to God; therefore they are not goods to us; offending and being offended are equally testimonies of imbecility; 'tis therefore folly to fear God. God is good by his nature; man by his industry, which is more. The divine and human wisdom have no other distinction, but that the first is eternal; but duration is no accession to wisdom, therefore we are companions. We have life, reason, and liberty; we esteem goodness, charity, and justice; these qualities are then in him. In conclusion, building and destroying, the conditions of the Divinity, are forged by man, according as they relate to himself. What a pattern, and what a model! let us stretch, let us raise and swell human qualities as much as we please; puff up thyself, poor man, yet more and more, and more:—

           Non, si tu ruperis, inquit.

          ""Not if thou burst,"" said he.
Profecto non Deum, quern cogitare non possunt, sed semetip pro illo cogitantes, non ilium, sed seipsos, non illi, sed sibi comparant? ""Certainly they do not imagine God, whom they cannot imagine; but they imagine themselves in his stead; they do not compare him, but themselves, not to him, but to themselves."" In natural things the effects do but half relate to their causes. What's this to the purpose? His condition is above the order of nature, too elevated, too remote, and too mighty, to permit itself to be bound and fettered by our conclusions. 'Tis not through ourselves that we arrive at that place; our ways lie too low. We are no nearer heaven on the top of Mount Cenis than at the bottom of the sea; take the distance with your astrolabe. They debase God even to the carnal knowledge of women, to so many times, and so many generations. Paulina, the wife of Satuminus, a matron of great reputation at Rome, thinking she lay with the god Serapis, found herself in the arms of an amoroso of hers, through the panderism of the priests of his temple. Varro, the most subtle and most learned of all the Latin authors, in his book of theology, writes, that the sexton of Hercules's temple, throwing dice with one hand for himself, and with the other for Hercules, played after that manner with him for a supper and a wench; if he won, at the expense of the offerings; if he lost, at his own. The sexton lost, and paid the supper and the wench. Her name was Laurentina, who saw by night this god in her arms, who moreover told her, that the first she met the next day, should give her a heavenly reward; which proved to be Taruncius, a rich young man, who took her home to his house, and in time left her his inheritrix. She, in her turn, thinking to do a thing that would be pleasing to the god, left the people of Rome heirs to her; and therefore had divine honours attributed to her. As if it had not been sufficient that Plato was originally descended from the gods by a double line, and that he had Neptune for the common father of his race, it was certainly believed at Athens, that Aristo, having a mind to enjoy the fair Perictione, could not, and was warned by the god Apollo, in a dream, to leave her unpolluted and untouched, till she should first be brought to bed. These were the father and mother of Plato. How many ridiculous stories are there of like cuckoldings, committed by the gods against poor mortal men! And how many husbands injuriously scandaled in favour of the children! In the Mahometan religion there are Merlins enough found by the belief of the people; that is to say, children without fathers, spiritual, divinely conceived in the wombs of virgins, and carry names that signify so much in their language.

We are to observe that to every thing nothing is more dear and estimable than its being (the lion, the eagle the dolphin, prize nothing above their own kind); and that every thing assimilates the qualities of all other things to its own proper qualities, which we may indeed extend or contract, but that's all; for beyond that relation and principle our imagination cannot go, can guess at nothing else, nor possibly go out thence, nor stretch beyond it; whence spring these ancient conclusions: of all forms the most beautiful is that of man; therefore God must be of that form. No one can be happy without virtue, nor virtue be without reason, and reason cannot inhabit anywhere but in a human shape; God is therefore clothed in a human figure. Ita est informatum et anticipatum mentibus nostris, ut homini, quum de Deo cogitet, forma occurrat hu-mana. ""It is so imprinted in our minds, and the fancy is so prepossessed with it, that when a man thinks of God, a human figure ever presents itself to the imagination."" Therefore it was that Xenophanes pleasantly said, ""That if beasts frame any gods to themselves, as 'tis likely they do, they make them certainly such as themselves are, and glorify themselves in it, as we do. For why may not a goose say thus; ""All the parts of the universe I have an interest in; the earth serves me to walk upon; the sun to light me; the stars have their influence upon me; I have such an advantage by the winds and such by the waters; there is nothing that yon heavenly roof looks upon so favourably as me; I am the darling of nature! Is it not man that keeps, lodges, and serves me? 'Tis for me that he both sows and grinds; if he eats me he does the same by his fellow-men, and so do I the worms that kill and devour him."" As much might be said by a crane, and with greater confidence, upon the account of the liberty of his flight, and the possession of that high and beautiful region. Tam blanda conciliatrix, et tam sui est lena ipsa natura. ""So flattering and wheedling a bawd is nature to herself.""

Now by the same consequence, the destinies are then for us; for us the world; it shines it thunders for us; creator and creatures, all are for us; ''tis the mark and point to which the universality of things aims. Look into the records that philosophy has kept for two thousand years and more, of the affairs of heaven; the gods all that while have neither acted nor spoken but for man. She does not allow them any other consultation or occupation. See them here against us in war:—

               Domitosque Hercule manu
          Telluris juvenes, unde periculum
          Fulgens contre mu it domus
          Saturai veteris.

          ""The brawny sons of earth, subdu'd by hand
          Of Hercules on the Phlegran strand,
          Where the rude shock did such an uproar make,
          As made old Saturn's sparkling palace shake.""
And here you shall see them participate of our troubles, to make a return for our having so often shared in theirs:—

          Neptunus muros, magnoque emota tridenti
          Fundamenta quatit, totamque  sedibus urbem
          Emit: hie Juno Scas svissima portas Prima tenet.

               ""Amidst that smother Neptune holds his place,
          Below the walls' foundation drives his mace,
          And heaves the city from its solid base.
          See where in arms the cruel Juno stands,
           Full in the Scan gate.""
The Caunians, jealous of the authority of their own proper gods, armed themselves on the days of their devotion, and through the whole of their precincts ran cutting and slashing the air with their swords, by that means to drive away and banish all foreign gods out of their territory. Their powers are limited according that the plague, that the scurf, that the phthisic; one cures one sort of itch, another another: Adeo minimis etiam rebus prava religio inserit Deos? ""At such a rate does false religion create gods for the most contemptible uses."" This one makes grapes grow, that onions; this has the presidence over lechery, that over merchandise; for every sort of artisan a god; this has his province and reputation in the east; that his in the west:—

               ""Here lay her armour, here her chariot stood.""

               O sancte Apollo, qui umbilicum certum terrarum obtines!

                 ""O sacred Phoebus, who with glorious ray,
           From the earth's centre, dost thy light display.""

          Pallada Cecropid, Minola Creta Dianam,
           Vulcanum tellus Hypsipylea colit,
          Junonem Sparte, Pelopeladesque Mycen;
          Pinigerum Fauni Mnalis ora caput;
          Mars Latio venerandus.

               ""Th' Athenians Pallas, Cynthia Crete adore,
           Vulcan is worshipped on the Lemnian shore.
           Proud Juno's altars are by Spartans fed,
          Th' Arcadians worship Faunus, and 'tis said
          To Mars, by Italy, is homage paid.""
to our necessity; this cures horses, that men,

          Hic illius arma, Hic currus fuit.
This has only one town or family in his possession; that lives alone; that in company, either voluntary or upon necessity:—

               Junctaque sunt magno templa nepotis avo.

                ""And temples to the nephew joined are,
          To those were reared to the great-grandfather.""
In here are some so wretched and mean (for the number amounts to six and thirty thousand) that they must pack five or six together, to produce one ear of corn, and thence take their several names; three to a door—that of the plank, that of the hinge, and that of the threshold. Four to a child—protectors of his swathing-clouts, his drink, meat, and sucking. Some certain, some uncertain and doubtful, and some that are not yet entered Paradise:—

               Quos, quoniam coli nondum dignamur honore,
          Quas dedimus cert terras habitare sinanras:

               ""Whom, since we yet not worthy think of heaven,
          We suffer to possess the earth we've given.""
There are amongst them physicians, poets, and civilians. Some of a mean betwixt the divine and human nature; mediators betwixt God and us, adorned with a certain second and diminutive sort of adoration; infinite in titles and offices; some good; others ill; some old and decrepit, and some that are mortal. For Chrysippus was of opinion that in the last conflagration of the world all the gods were to die but Jupiter. Man makes a thousand pretty societies betwixt God and him; is he not his countryman?

          Jovis incunabula Creten.

          ""Crete, the cradle of Jupiter.""
And this is the excuse that, upon consideration of this subject, Scvola, a high priest, and Varro, a great theologian in their times, make us: ""That it is necessary that the people should be ignorant of many things that are true, and believe many things that are false."" Quum veritatem qua liberetur inquirat credatur ei expedire quod fallitur. ""Seeing he inquires into the truth, by which he would be made free, 'tis fit he should be deceived."" Human eyes cannot perceive things but by the forms they know; and we do not remember what a leap miserable Phton took for attempting to guide his father's horses with a mortal hand. The mind of man falls into as great a depth, and is after the same manner bruised and shattered by his own rashness. If you ask of philosophy of what matter the heavens and the sun are? what answer will she return, if not that it is iron, or, with Anaxagoras, stone, or some other matter that she makes use of? If a man inquire of Zeno what nature is? ""A fire,"" says he, ""an artisan, proper for generation, and regularly proceeding."" Archimedes, master of that science which attributes to itself the precedency before all others for truth and certainty; ""the sun,"" says he, ""is a god of red-hot iron."" Was not this a fine imagination, extracted from the inevitable necessity of geometrical demonstrations? Yet not so inevitable and useful but that Socrates thought it was enough to know so much of geometry only as to measure the land a man bought or sold; and that Polynus, who had been a great and famous doctor in it, despised it, as full of falsity and manifest vanity, after he had once tasted the delicate fruits of the lozelly gardens of Epicurus. Socrates in Xenophon, concerning this affair, says of Anaxagoras, reputed by antiquity learned above all others in celestial and divine matters, ""That he had cracked his brain, as all other men do who too immoderately search into knowledges which nothing belong to them:"" when he made the sun to be a burning stone, he did not consider that a stone does not shine in the fire; and, which is worse, that it will there consume; and in making the sun and fire one, that fire does not turn the complexions black in shining upon them; that we are able to look fixedly upon fire; and that fire kills herbs and plants. 'Tis Socrates's opinion, and mine too, that the best judging of heaven is not to judge of it at all. Plato having occasion, in his Timous, to speak of the demons, ""This undertaking,"" says he, ""exceeds my ability."" We are therefore to believe those ancients who said they were begotten by them; 'tis against all reason to refuse a man's faith to the children of the gods, though what they say should not be proved by any necessary or probable reasons; seeing they engage to speak of domestic and familiar things.

Let us see if we have a little more light in the knowledge of human and natural things. Is it not a ridiculous attempt for us to forge for those to whom, by our own confession, our knowledge is not able to attain, another body, and to lend a false form of our own invention; as is manifest in this motion of the planets; to which, seeing our wits cannot possibly arrive, nor conceive their natural conduct, we lend them material, heavy, and substantial springs of our own by which to move:—

                Temo aureus, aurea summ
            Curvatura rot, radiorum argenteus ordo.

                ""Gold was the axle, and the beam was gold;
           The wheels with silver spokes on golden circles roll'd.""
You would say that we had had coachmakers, carpenters, and painters, that went up on high to make engines of various motions, and to range the wheelwork and interfacings of the heavenly bodies of differing colours about the axis of necessity, according to Plato:—

               Mundus domus est maxima rerum,
          Quam quinque altiton fragmine zon
          Cingunt, per quam limbus pictus bis sex signis
          Stellimicantibus, altus in obliquo there, lun
          Bigas acceptat.

               ""The world's a mansion that doth all things hold,
          Which thundering zones, in number five, enfold,
          Through which a girdle, painted with twelve signs,
          And that with sparkling constellations, shines,
          In heaven's arch marks the diurnal course
          For the sun's chariot and his fiery horse.""
These are all dreams and fanatic follies. Why will not nature please for once to lay open her bosom to us, and plainly discover to us the means and conduct of her movements, and prepare our eyes to see them? Good God, what abuse, what mistakes should we discover in our poor science! I am mistaken if that weak knowledge of ours holds any one thing as it really is, and I shall depart hence more ignorant of all other things than my own ignorance.

Have I not read in Plato this divine saying, that ""nature is nothing but enigmatic poesy!"" As if a man might perhaps see a veiled and shady picture, breaking out here and there with an infinite variety of false lights to puzzle our conjectures: Latent ista omnia crassis occullata et circumfusa tenebris; ut nulla acies humani ingenii tanta sit, qu penetrare in coelum, terram intrare, possit. ""All those things lie concealed and involved in so dark an obscurity that no point of human wit can be so sharp as to pierce heaven or penetrate the earth."" And certainly philosophy is no other than sophisticated poetry. Whence do the ancient writers extract their authorities but from the poets? and the first of them were poets themselves, and writ accordingly. Plato is but a poet unripped. Timon calls him, insultingly, ""a monstrous forger of miracles."" All superhuman sciences make use of the poetic style. Just as women make use of teeth of ivory where the natural are wanting, and instead of their true complexion make one of some artificial matter; as they stuff themselves out with cotton to appear plump, and in the sight of every one do paint, patch, and trick up themselves with a false and borrowed beauty; so does science (and even our law itself has, they say, legitimate fictions, whereon it builds the truth of its justice); she gives us in presupposition, and for current pay, things which she herself informs us were invented; for these epicycles, eccentrics, and concentrics, which astrology makes use of to carry on the motions of the stars, she gives us for the best she could invent upon that subject; as also, in all the rest, philosophy presents us not that which really is, or what she really believes, but what she has contrived with the greatest and most plausible likelihood of truth, and the quaintest invention. Plato, upon the discourse of the state of human bodies and those of beasts, says, ""I should know that what I have said is truth, had I the confirmation of an oracle; but this I will affirm, that what I have said is the most likely to be true of any thing I could say.""

'Tis not to heaven only that art sends her ropes, engines, and wheels; let us consider a little what she says of us ourselves, and of our contexture.

There is not more retrogradation, trepidation, accession, recession, and astonishment, in the stars and celestial bodies, than they have found out in this poor little human body. In earnest, they have good reason, upon that very account, to call it the little world, so many tools and parts have they employed to erect and build it. To assist the motions they see in man, and the various functions that we find in ourselves, in how many parts have they divided the soul, in how many places lodged it? in how many orders have they divided, and to how many stories have they raised this poor creature, man, besides those that are natural and to be perceived? And how many offices and vocations have they assigned him? They make it an imaginary public thing. 'Tis a subject that they hold and handle; and they have full power granted to them to rip, place, displace, piece, and stuff it, every one according to his own fancy, and yet they possess it not They cannot, not in reality only, but even in dreams, so govern it that there will not be some cadence or sound that will escape their architecture, as enormous as it is, and botched with a thousand false and fantastic patches. And it is not reason to excuse them; for though we are satisfied with painters when they paint heaven, earth, seas, mountains, and remote islands, that they give us some slight mark of them, and, as of things unknown, are content with a faint and obscure description; yet when they come and draw us after life, or any other creature which is known and familiar to us, we then require of them a perfect and exact representation of lineaments and colours, and despise them if they fail in it.

I am very well pleased with the Milesian girl, who observing the philosopher Thales to be always contemplating the celestial arch, and to have his eyes ever gazing upward, laid something in his way that he might stumble over, to put him in mind that it would be time to take up his thoughts about things that are in the clouds when he had provided for those that were under his feet. Doubtless she advised him well, rather to look to himself than to gaze at heaven; for, as Democritus says, by the mouth of Cicero,—

             Quod est ante pedes, nemo spectat: coeli scrutantur plagas.

                  ""No man regards what is under his feet;
             They are always prying towards heaven.""
But our condition will have it so, that the knowledge of what we have in hand is as remote from us, and as much above the clouds, as that of the stars. As Socrates says, in Plato, ""That whoever meddles with philosophy may be reproached as Thales was by the woman, that he sees nothing of that which is before him. For every philosopher is ignorant of what his neighbour does; aye, and of what he does himself, and is ignorant of what they both are, whether beasts or men.""

Those people, who find Sebond's arguments too weak, that are ignorant of nothing, that govern the world, that know all,—

                Qu mare compescant caus; quid temperet annum;
           Stell sponte su, jussve, vagentur et errent;
          Quid premat obscurum lun, quid profrt orbem;
          Quid velit et posait rerum concordia discors;

                ""What governs ocean's tides,
          And through the various year the seasons guides;
          Whether the stars by their own proper force,
           Or foreign power, pursue their wand'ring course;
          Why shadows darken the pale queen of night;
           Whence she renews her orb and spreads her light;—
          What nature's jarring sympathy can mean;""
have they not sometimes in their writings sounded the difficulties they have met with of knowing their own being? We see very well that the finger moves, that the foot moves, that some parts assume a voluntary motion of themselves without our consent, and that others work by our direction; that one sort of apprehension occasions blushing; another paleness; such an imagination works upon the spleen only, another upon the brain; one occasions laughter, another tears; another stupefies and astonishes all our senses, and arrests the motion of all our members; at one object the stomach will rise, at another a member that lies something lower; but how a spiritual impression should make such a breach into a massy and solid subject, and the nature of the connection and contexture of these admirable springs and movements, never yet man knew: Omnia incerta ratione, et in natur majestate abdita. ""All uncertain in reason, and concealed in the majesty of nature,"" says Pliny. And St Augustin, Modus quo corporibus adhorent spiritus.... omnino minis est, nec comprehendi ab homine potest; et hoc ipse homo est, ""The manner whereby souls adhere to bodies is altogether wonderful, and cannot be conceived by man, and yet this is man."" And yet it is not so much as doubted; for the opinions of men are received according to the ancient belief, by authority and upon trust, as if it were religion and law. 'Tis received as gibberish which is commonly spoken; this truth, with all its clutter of arguments and proofs, is admitted as a firm and solid body, that is no more to be shaken, no more to be judged of; on the contrary, every one, according to the best of his talent, corroborates and fortifies this received belief with the utmost power of his reason, which is a supple utensil, pliable, and to be accommodated to any figure; and thus the world comes to be filled with lies and fopperies. The reason that men doubt of divers things is that they never examine common impressions; they do not dig to the root, where the faults and defects lie; they only debate upon the branches; they do not examine whether such and such a thing be true, but if it has been so and so understood; it is not inquired into whether Galen has said any thing to purpose, but whether he has said so or so. In truth it was very good reason that this curb to the liberty of our judgments and that tyranny over our opinions, should be extended to the schools and arts. The god of scholastic knowledge is Aristotle; 'tis irreligion to question any of his decrees, as it was those of Lucurgus at Sparta; his doctrine is a magisterial law, which, peradventure, is as false as another. I do not know why I should not as willingly embrace either the ideas of Plato, or the atoms of Epicurus, or the plenum or vacuum of Leucippus and Democritus, or the water of Thales, or the infinity of nature of Anaximander, or the air of Diogenes, or the numbers and symmetry of Pythagoras, or the infinity of Parmenides, or the One of Musus, or the water and fire of Apollodorus, or the similar parts of Anaxagoras, or the discord and friendship of Empedocles, or the fire of Heraclitus, or any other opinion of that infinite confusion of opinions and determinations, which this fine human reason produces by its certitude and clearsightedness in every thing it meddles withal, as I should the opinion of Aristotle upon this subject of the principles of natural things; which principles he builds of three pieces—matter, form, and privation. And what can be more vain than to make inanity itself the cause of the production of things? Privation is a negative; of what humour could he then make the cause and original of things that are? And yet that were not to be controverted but for the exercise of logic; there is nothing disputed therein to bring it into doubt, but to defend the author of the school from foreign objections; his authority is the non-ultra, beyond which it is not permitted to inquire.

It is very easy, upon approved foundations, to build whatever we please; for, according to the law and ordering of this beginning, the other parts of the structure are easily carried on without any failure. By this way we find our reason well-grounded, and discourse at a venture; for our masters prepossess and gain beforehand as much room in our belief as is necessary towards concluding afterwards what they please, as geometricians do by their granted demands, the consent and approbation we allow them giving them wherewith to draw us to the right and left, and to whirl us about at their pleasure. Whatever springs from these presuppositions is our master and our God; he will take the level of his foundations so ample and so easy that by them he may mount us up to the clouds, if he so please. In this practice and negotiation of science we have taken the saying of Pythagoras, ""That every expert person ought to be believed in his own art"" for current pay. The logician refers the signification of words to the grammarians; the rhetorician borrows the state of arguments from the logician; the poet his measure from the musician: the geometrician his proportions from the arithmetician, and the metaphysicians take physical conjectures for their foundations; for every science has its principle presupposed, by which human judgment is everywhere kept in check. If you come to rush against the bar where the principal error lies, they have presently this sentence in their mouths, ""That there is no disputing with persons who deny principles."" Now men can have no principles if not revealed to them by the divinity; of all the rest the beginning, the middle, and the end, is nothing but dream and vapour. To those that contend upon presupposition we must, on the contrary, presuppose to them the same axiom upon which the dispute is. For every human presupposition and declaration has as much authority one as another, if reason do not make the difference. Wherefore they are all to be put into the balance, and first the generals and those that tyrannize over us. The persuasion of certainty is a certain testimony of folly and extreme incertainty; and there are not a more foolish sort of men, nor that are less philosophers, than the Philodoxes of Plato; we must inquire whether fire be hot? whether snow be white? if there be any such things as hard or soft within our knowledge?

And as to those answers of which they make old stories, as he that doubted if there was any such thing as heat, whom they bid throw himself into the fire; and he that denied the coldness of ice, whom they bid to put ice into his bosom;—they are pitiful things, unworthy of the profession of philosophy. If they had let us alone in our natural being, to receive the appearance of things without us, according as they present themselves to us by our senses, and had permitted us to follow our own natural appetites, governed by the condition of our birth, they might then have reason to talk at that rate; but 'tis from them we have learned to make ourselves judges of the world; 'tis from them that we derive this fancy, ""That human reason is controller-general of all that is without and within the roof of heaven; that comprehends every thing, that can do every thing; by the means of which every thing is known and understood."" This answer would be good among the cannibals, who enjoy the happiness of a long, quiet, and peaceable life, without Aristotle's precepts, and without the knowledge of the name of physics; this answer would perhaps be of more value and greater force than all those they borrow from their reason and invention; of this all animals, and all where the power of the law of nature is yet pure and simple, would be as capable as we, but as for them they have renounced it. They need not tell us, ""It is true, for you see and feel it to be so;"" they must tell me whether I really feel what I think I do; and if I do feel it, they must then tell me why I feel it, and how, and what; let them tell me the name, original, the parts and junctures of heat and cold, the qualities of the agent and patient; or let them give up their profession, which is not to admit or approve of any thing but by the way of reason; that is their test in all sorts of essays; but, certainly, 'tis a test full of falsity, error, weakness, and defect.

Which way can we better prove it than by itself? If we are not to believe her when speaking of herself, she can hardly be thought fit to judge of foreign things; if she know any thing, it must at least be her own being and abode; she is in the soul, and either a part or an effect of it; for true and essential reason, from which we by a false colour borrow the name, is lodged in the bosom of the Almighty; there is her habitation and recess; 'tis thence that she imparts her rays, when God is pleased to impart any beam of it to mankind, as Balias issued from her father's head, to communicate herself to the world.

Now let us see what human reason tells us of herself and of the soul, not of the soul in general, of which almost all philosophy makes the celestial and first bodies participants; nor of that which Thales attributed to things which themselves are reputed inanimate, lead thereto by the consideration of the loadstone; but of that which appertains to us, and that we ought the best to know:—

                    Ignoratur enim, qu sit natura animai;
             Nata sit; an, contra, nascentibus insinuetur;
             Et simnl intereat nobiscum morte dirempta;
            An tenebras Orci visat, vastasque lacunas,
            An pecudes alias divinitns insinuet se.

                ""For none the nature of the soul doth know,
            Whether that it be born with us, or no;
           Or be infused into us at our birth,
           And dies with us when we return to earth,
           Or then descends to the black shades below,
           Or into other animals does go.""
Crates and Dicarchus were of opinion that there was no soul at all, but that the body thus stirs by a natural motion; Plato, that it was a substance moving of itself; Thales, a nature without repose; Aedepiades, an exercising of the senses; Hesiod and Anaximander, a thing composed of earth and water; Parmenides, of earth and fire; Empedocles, of blood:—

          Sanguineam vomit ille animam;

          ""He vomits up his bloody soul.""
Posidonius, Cleanthes, and Galen, that it was heat or a hot complexion—

          Igneus est ollis vigor, et colestis origo;

           ""Their vigour of fire and of heavenly race.""
Hippocrates, a spirit diffused all over the body; Varro, that it was an air received at the mouth, heated in the lungs, moistened in the heart, and diffused throughout the whole body; Zeno, the quintessence of the four elements; Heraclides Ponticus, that it was the light; Zenocrates and the Egyptians, a mobile number; the Chaldeans, a virtue without any determinate form:—

               Habitum quemdam vitalem corporis esse,
          Harmoniam Grci quam dicunt.

               ""A certain vital habit in man's frame,
          Which harmony the Grecian sages name.""
Let us not forget Aristotle, who held the soul to be that which naturally causes the body to move, which he calls entelechia, with as cold an invention as any of the rest; for he neither speaks of the essence, nor of the original, nor of the nature of the soul, but only takes notice of the effect Lactantius, Seneca, and most of the Dogmatists, have confessed that it was a thing they did not understand; after all this enumeration of opinions, Harum sententiarum quo vera sit, Deus aliquis viderit: ""Of these opinions which is the true, let some god determine,"" says Cicero. ""I know by myself,"" says St Bernard, ""how incomprehensible God is, seeing I cannot comprehend the parts of my own being.""

Heraclitus, who was of opinion that every being was full of souls and demons, did nevertheless maintain that no one could advance so far towards the knowledge of the soul as ever to arrive at it; so profound was the essence of it.

Neither is there less controversy and debate about seating of it. Hippocrates and Hierophilus place it in the ventricle of the brain; Democritus and Aristotle throughout the whole body;—


               Ut bona spe valetudo cum dicitur esse
           Corporis, et non est tamen hc pars ulla ralentis;

                ""As when the body's health they do it call,
          When of a sound man, that's no part at all.""
Epicurus in the stomach;

               Hic exsultat enim pavor ac metus;
          Hc loca circum Ltiti mulcent.

               ""For this the seat of horror is and fear,
          And joys in turn do likewise triumph here.""
The Stoics, about and within the heart; Erasistratus, adjoining the membrane of the epicranium; Empedocles, in the blood; as also Moses, which was the reason why he interdicted eating the blood of beasts, because the soul is there seated; Galen thought that every part of the body had its soul; Strato has placed it betwixt the eyebrows; Qu facie quidem sit animus, aut ubi habitet, ne quorendum quidem est: ""What figure the soul is of, or what part it inhabits, is not to be inquired into,"" says Cicero. I very willingly deliver this author to you in his own words; for should I alter eloquence itself? Besides, it were but a poor prize to steal the matter of his inventions; they are neither very frequent, nor of any great weight, and sufficiently known. But the reason why Chrysippus argues it to be about the heart, as all the rest of that sect do, is not to be omitted; ""It is,"" says he, ""because when we would affirm any things we lay our hand upon our breasts; and when we would pronounce y, which signifies I, we let the lower jaw fall towards the stomach."" This place ought not to be passed over without a remark upon the vanity of so great a man; for besides that these considerations are infinitely light in themselves, the last is only a proof to the Greeks that they have their souls lodged in that part. No human judgment is so sprightly and vigilant that it does not sometimes sleep. Why do we fear to say? The Stoics, the fathers of human prudence, think that the soul of a man, crushed under a ruin, long labours and strives to get out, like a mouse caught in a trap, before it can disengage itself from the burden. Some hold that the world was made to give bodies, by way of punishment, to the spirits fallen, by their own fault, from the purity wherein they had been created, the first creation having been incorporeal; and that, according as they are more or less depraved from their spirituality, so are they more or less jocundly or dully incorporated; and that thence proceeds all the variety of so much created matter. But the spirit that for his punishment was invested with the body of the sun must certainly have a very rare and particular measure of change.

The extremities of our perquisition do all fall into astonishment and blindness; as Plutarch says of the testimony of histories, that, according to charts and maps, the utmost bounds of known r countries are taken up with marshes, impenetrable forests, deserts, and uninhabitable places; this is the reason why the most gross and childish ravings were most found in those authors who treat of the most elevated subjects, and proceed the furthest in them, losing themselves in their own curiosity and presumption. The beginning and end of knowledge are equally foolish; observe to what a pitch Plato flies in his poetic clouds; do but take notice there of the gibberish of the gods; but what did he dream of when he defined a man to be ""a two-legged animal without feathers: giving those who had a mind to deride him a pleasant occasion; for, having pulled a capon alive, they went about calling it the man of Plato.""

And what did the Epicureans think of, out of what simplicity did they first imagine that their atoms that they said were bodies having some weight, and a natural motion downwards, had made the world; till they were put in mind, by their adversaries, that, according to this description, it was impossible they should unite and join to one another, their fall being so direct and perpendicular, and making so many parallel lines throughout? Wherefore there was a necessity that they should since add a fortuitous and sideways motion, and that they should moreover accoutre their atoms with hooked tails, by which they might unite and cling to one another. And even then do not those that attack them upon this second consideration put them hardly to it? ""If the atoms have by chance formed so many sorts of figures, why did it never fall out that they made a house or a shoe? Why at the same rate should we not believe that an infinite number of Greek letters, strewed all over a certain place, might fall into the contexture of the Iliad?""—""Whatever is capable of reason,"" says Zeno, ""is better than that which is not capable; there is nothing better than the world; the world is therefore capable of reason."" Cotta, by this way of argumentation, makes the world a mathematician; 'and tis also made a musician and an organist by this other argumentation of Zeno: ""The whole is more than a part; we are capable of wisdom, and are part of the world; therefore the world is wise."" There are infinite like examples, not only of arguments that are false in themselves, but silly ones, that do not hold in themselves, and that accuse their authors not so much of ignorance as imprudence, in the reproaches the philosophers dash one another in the teeth withal, upon their dissensions in their sects and opinions.

Whoever should bundle up a lusty faggot of the fooleries of human wisdom would produce wonders. I willingly muster up these few for a pattern, by a certain meaning not less profitable to consider than the most sound and moderate instructions. Let us judge by these what opinion we are to have of man, of his sense and reason, when in these great persons that have raised human knowledge so high, so many gross mistakes and manifest errors are to be found.

For my part, I am apt to believe that they have treated of knowledge casually, and like a toy, with both hands; and have contended about reason as of a vain and frivolous instrument, setting on foot all sorts of fancies and inventions, sometimes more sinewy, and sometimes weaker. This same Plato, who defines man as if he were a cock, says elsewhere, after Socrates, ""That he does not, in truth, know what man is, and that he is a member of the world the hardest to understand."" By this variety and instability of opinions, they tacitly lead us, as it were by the hand, to this resolution of their irresolution. They profess not always to deliver their opinions barefaced and apparent to us; they have one while disguised them in the fabulous shadows of poetry, and at another in some other vizor; for our imperfection carries this also along with it, that crude meat is not always proper for our stomachs; we must dry, alter, and mix it; they do the same; they sometimes conceal their real opinions and judgments, and falsify them to accommodate themselves to the public use. They will not make an open profession of ignorance, and of the imbecility of human reason, that they may not fright children; but they sufficiently discover it to us under the appearance of a troubled and inconstant science.

I advised a person in Italy, who had a great mind to speak Italian, that provided he only had a desire to make himself understood, without being ambitious in any other respect to excel, that he should only make use of the first word that came to the tongue's end, whether Latin, French, Spanish, or Gascon, and that, by adding the Italian termination, he could not fail of hitting upon some idiom of the country, either Tuscan, Roman, Venetian, Piedmontese, or Neapolitan, and so fall in with some one of those many forms. I say the same of Philosophy; she has so many faces, so much variety, and has said so many things, that all our dreams and ravings are there to be found. Human fancy can conceive nothing good or bad that is not there: Nihil tam absurde did potest, quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosophorum. ""Nothing can be said so absurd, that has not been said before by some of the philosophers."" And I am the more willing to expose my whimsies to the public; forasmuch as, though they are spun out of myself, and without any pattern, I know they will be found related to some ancient humour, and some will not stick to say, ""See whence he took it!"" My manners are natural, I have not called in the assistance of any discipline to erect them; but, weak as they are, when it came into my head to lay them open to the world's view, and that to expose them to the light in a little more decent garb I went to adorn them with reasons and examples, it was a wonder to myself accidentally to find them conformable to so many philosophical discourses and examples. I never knew what regimen my life was of till it was near worn out and spent; a new figure—an unpremeditated and accidental philosopher.

But to return to the soul. Inasmuch as Plato has placed reason in the brain, anger in the heart, and concupiscence in the liver; 'tis likely that it was rather an interpretation of the movements of the soul, than that he intended a division and separation of it, as of a body, into several members. And the most likely of their opinions is that 'tis always a soul, that by its faculty, reasons, remembers, comprehends, judges, desires, and exercises all its other operations by divers instruments of the body; as the pilot guides his ship according to his experience, one while straining or slacking the cordage, one while hoisting the mainyard, or removing the rudder, by one and the same power carrying on several effects; and that it is lodged in the brain; which appears in that the wounds and accidents that touch that part do immediately offend the faculties of the soul; and 'tis not incongruous that it should thence diffuse itself through the other parts of the body

                Medium non deserit unquam
          Coeli Phoebus iter; radiis tamen omnia lustrt.

                ""Phoebus ne'er deviates from the zodiac's way;
          Yet all things doth illustrate with his ray.""
As the sun sheds from heaven its light and influence, and fills the world with them:—

               Ctera pars animas, per totum dissita corpus,
           Paret, et ad numen mentis momenque movetur.

               ""The other part o' th' soul diffus'd all o'er
          The body, does obey the reason's lore.""
Some have said that there was a general soul, as it were a great body, whence all the particular souls were extracted, and thither again return, always restoring themselves to that universal matter:—

               Deum namque ire per omnes
          Terrasque, tractusque maris, columque profundum;
          Hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum,
          Quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas:
          Scilicet hue reddi deinde, ac resoluta referri
          Omnia; nec morti esse locum:

               ""For God goes forth, and spreads throughout the whole
          Heaven, earth, and sea, the universal soul;
          Each at its birth, from him all beings share,
          Both man and brute, the breath of vital air;
          To him return, and, loos'd from earthly chain,
          Fly whence they sprung, and rest in God again,
           Spurn at the grave, and, fearless of decay,
           Dwell in high heaven, and star th' ethereal way.""
Others, that they only rejoined and reunited themselves to it; others, that they were produced from the divine substance; others, by the angels of fire and air; others, that they were from all antiquity; and some that they were created at the very point of time the bodies wanted them; others make them to descend from the orb of the moon, and return thither; the generality of the ancients believed that they were begotten from father to son, after a like manner, and produced with all other natural things; taking their argument from the likeness of children to their fathers;

               Instillata patris virtus tibi;
          Fortes creantur fortibus, et bonis;

               ""Thou hast thy father's virtues with his blood:
          For still the brave spring from the brave and good;""
and that we see descend from fathers to their children not only bodily marks, but moreover a resemblance of humours, complexions, and inclinations of the soul:—

                Denique cur acris violentia triste leonum
          Seminium sequitur? dolus vulpibus, et fuga, cervis
          A patribus datur, et patrius pavor incitt artus?
          Si non certa suo quia semine seminioque
          Vis animi pariter crescit cum corpore toto.

               ""For why should rage from the fierce lion's seed,
          Or from the subtle fox's craft, proceed;
          Or why the tim'rous and flying hart
          His fear and trembling to his race impart;
          But that a certain force of mind does grow,
           And still increases as the bodies do?""
That thereupon the divine justice is grounded, punishing in the children the faults of their fathers; forasmuch as the contagion of paternal vices is in some sort imprinted in the soul of children, and that the ill government of their will extends to them; moreover, that if souls had any other derivation than a natural consequence, and that they had been some other thins out of the body, they would retain some memory of their first being, the natural faculties that are proper to them of discoursing, reasoning, and remembering, being considered:—

               Si in corpus nascentibus insinuatur,
          Cur super anteactam tatem meminisse nequimus,
          Nec vestigia gestarum rerum ulla tenemus?

               ""For at our birth if it infused be,
          Why do we then retain no memory
          Of our foregoing life, and why no more
          Remember any thing we did before?""
for, to make the condition of our souls such as we would have it to be, we must suppose them all-knowing, even in their natural simplicity and purity; by these means they had been such, being free from the prison of the body, as well before they entered into it, as we hope they shall be after they are gone out of it; and from this knowledge it should follow that they should remember, being got in the body, as Plato said, ""That what we learn is no other than a remembrance of what we knew before;"" a thing which every one by experience may maintain to be false. Forasmuch, in the first place, as that we do not justly remember any thing but what we have been taught, and that if the memory did purely perform its office it would at least suggest to us something more than what we have learned. Secondly, that which she knew being in her purity, was a true knowledge, knowing things as they are by her divine intelligence; whereas here we make her receive falsehood and vice when we instruct her; wherein she cannot employ her reminiscence, that image and conception having never been planted in her. To say that the corporal prison does in such sort suffocate her natural faculties, that they are there utterly extinct, is first contrary to this other belief of acknowledging her power to be so great, and the operations of it that men sensibly perceive in this life so admirable, as to have thereby concluded that divinity and eternity past, and the immortality to come:—

               Nam si tantopere est anirai mutata potestas,
          Omnia ut actarum exciderit retinentia rerum,
          Non, ut opinor, ea ab letho jam longior errat.

               ""For if the mind be changed to that degree
          As of past things to lose all memory,
          So great a change as that, I must confess,
          Appears to me than death but little less.""
Furthermore, 'tis here with us, and not elsewhere, that the force and effects of the soul ought to be considered; all the rest of her perfections are vain and useless to her; 'tis by her present condition that all her immortality is to be rewarded and paid, and of the life of man only that she is to render an account It had been injustice to have stripped her of her means and powers; to have disarmed her in order, in the time of her captivity and imprisonment in the flesh, of her weakness and infirmity in the time wherein she was forced and compelled, to pass an infinite and perpetual sentence and condemnation, and to insist upon the consideration of so short a time, peradventure but an hour or two, or at the most but a century, which has no more proportion with infinity than an instant; in this momentary interval to ordain and definitively to determine of her whole being; it were an unreasonable disproportion, too, to assign an eternal recompense in consequence of so short a life. Plato, to defend himself from this inconvenience, will have future payments limited to the term of a hundred years, relatively to human duration; and of us ourselves there are enough who have given them temporal limits. By this they judged that the generation of the soul followed the common condition of human things, as also her life, according to the opinion of Epicurus and Democritus, which has been the most received; in consequence of these fine appearances that they saw it bom, and that, according as the body grew more capable, they saw it increase in vigour as the other did; that its feebleness in infancy was very manifest, and in time its better strength and maturity, and after that its declension and old age, and at last its decrepitude:—

               Gigni pariter cum corpore, et una
          Crescere sentimus, pariterque senescere mentem.

               ""Souls with the bodies to be born we may
          Discern, with them t' increase, with them decay.""
They perceived it to be capable of divers passions, and agitated with divers painful motions, whence it fell into lassitude and uneasiness; capable of alteration and change, of cheerfulness, of stupidity and languor, and subject to diseases and injuries, as the stomach or the foot;

               Mentem sanari, corpus ut grum,
            Ceraimus, et flecti medicin posse videmus;

                ""Sick minds, as well as bodies, we do see
           By Med'cine's virtue oft restored to be;""
dazzled and intoxicated with the fumes of wine, jostled from her seat by the vapours of a burning fever, laid asleep by the application of some medicaments, and roused by others,—

               Corpoream naturam animi esse necesse est,
           Corporeis quoniam telis ictuque laborat;

               ""There must be of necessity, we find,
          A nature that's corporeal of the mind,
          Because we evidently see it smarts
            And wounded is with shafts the body darts;""
they saw it astonished and overthrown in all its faculties through the mere bite of a mad dog, and in that condition to have no stability of reason, no sufficiency, no virtue, no philosophical resolution, no resistance that could exempt it from the subjection of such accidents; the slaver of a contemptible cur shed upon the hand of Socrates, to shake all his wisdom and all his great and regulated imaginations, and so to annihilate them, ad that there remained no trace of his former knowledge,—

               Vis.... animal Conturbatur, et.... divisa seorsum
          Disjectatur, eodem illo distracta veneno;

               ""The power of the soul's disturbed; and when
          That once is but sequestered from her, then
           By the same poison 'tis dispersed abroad;""
and this poison to find no more resistance in that great soul than in an infant of four years old; a poison sufficient to make all philosophy, if it were incarnate, become furious and mad; insomuch that Cato, who ever disdained death and fortune, could not endure the sight of a looking-glass, or of water, overwhelmed with horror and affright at the thought of falling, by the contagion of a mad dog, into the disease called by physicians hydrophobia:—

              Vis morbi distracta per artus
          Turbat agens animam, spumantes quore salso
         Ventorum ut validis fervescunt viribus und.

              ""Throughout the limbs diffused, the fierce disease
         Disturbs the soul, as in the briny seas,
         The foaming waves to swell and boil we see,
          Stirred by the wind's impetuosity.""
Now, as to this particular, philosophy has sufficiently armed man to encounter all other accidents either with patience, or, if the search of that costs too dear, by an infallible defeat, in totally depriving himself of all sentiment; but these are expedients that are only of use to a soul being itself, and in its full power, capable of reason and deliberation; but not at all proper for this inconvenience, where, in a philosopher, the soul becomes the soul of a madman, troubled, overturned, and lost; which many occasions may produce, as a too vehement agitation that any violent passion of the soul may beget in itself; or a wound in a certain part of the person, or vapours from the stomach, any of which may stupefy the understanding and turn the brain.

                Morbis in corporis avius errat
          Spe animus; dementit enim, deliraque fatur;
          Interdumque gravi lethargo fertur in altum
         ternumque soporem, oculis mi tuque cadenti:

         ""For when the body's sick, and ill at ease,
         The mind doth often share in the disease;
          Wonders, grows wild, and raves, and sometimes by
         A heavy and a stupid lethargy,
         Is overcome and cast into a deep,
         A most profound and everlasting sleep.""
The philosophers, methinks, have not much touched this string, no more than another of equal importance; they have this dilemma continually in their mouths, to console our mortal condition: ""The soul is either mortal or immortal; if mortal, it will suffer no pain; if immortal, it will change for the better.""—They never touch the other branch, ""What if she change for the worse?"" and leave to the poets the menaces of future torments. But thereby they make themselves a good game. These are two omissions that I often meet with in their discourses. I return to the first.

This soul loses the use of the sovereign stoical good, so constant and so firm. Our fine human wisdom must here yield, and give up her arms. As to the rest, they also considered, by the vanity of human reason, that the mixture and association of two so contrary things as the mortal and the immortal, was unimaginable:—

              Quippe etenim mortale terao jungere, et una
         Consentire putare, et fungi mutua posse,
         Desipere est. Quid enim diversius esse putandum est,
         Aut magis inter se disjunctum discrepitansque,
         Quam, mortale quod est, immortali atque perenni
          Junctum, in concilio, svas tolerare procellas?

               ""The mortal and th' eternal, then, to blend,
         And think they can pursue one common end,
         Is madness: for what things more diff'rent are.
         Distinct in nature, and disposed to jar?
         How can it then be thought that these should bear,
         When thus conjoined, of harms an equal share?""
Moreover, they perceived the soul tending towards death as well as the body:—

         Simul ovo fessa fatiscit:

         ""Fatigued together with the weight of years:""
which, according to Zeno, the image of sleep does sufficiently demonstrate to us; for he looks upon it ""as a fainting and fall of the soul, as well as of the body:"" Contrahi animum et quasi labi putat atque decidere: and, what they perceived in some, that the soul maintained its force and vigour to the last gasp of life, they attributed to the variety of diseases, as it is observable in men at the last extremity, that some retain one sense, and some another; one the hearing, and another the smell, without any manner of defect or alteration; and that there is not so universal a deprivation that some parts do not remain vigorous and entire:—

              Non alio pacto, quam si, pes cum dolet gri,
         In nullo caput interea sit forte dolore.

              ""So, often of the gout a man complains,
         Whose head is, at the same time, free from pains.""
The sight of our judgment is, to truth, the same that the owl's eyes are to the splendour of the sun, says Aristotle. By what can we better convince him, than by so gross blindness in so apparent a light? For the contrary opinion of the immortality of the soul, which, Cicero says, was first introduced, according to the testimony of books at least, by Pherecydes

Syrius, in the time of King Tullus (though some attribute it to Thales, and others to others), 'tis the part of human science that is treated of with the greatest doubt and

reservation. The most positive dogmatists are fain, in this point principally, to fly to the refuge of the Academy. No one doubts what Aristotle has established upon this subject, no more than all the ancients in general, who handle it with a wavering belief: Rem gratissimam promittentium magis quam probantium: ""A thing more acceptable in the promisors than the provers."" He conceals himself in clouds of words of difficult, unintelligible sense, and has left to those of his sect as great a dispute about his judgment as about the matter itself.

Two things rendered this opinion plausible to them; one, that, without the immortality of souls, there would be nothing whereon to ground the vain hopes of glory, which is a consideration of wonderful

repute in the world; the other, that it is a very profitable impression, as Plato says, that vices, when they escape the discovery and cognizance of human justice, are still within the reach of the divine, which will pursue them even after the death of the guilty. Man is excessively solicitous to prolong his being, and has to the utmost of his power provided for it; there are monuments for the conservation of the body, and glory to preserve the name. He has employed all his wit and opinion to the rebuilding of himself, impatient of his fortune, and to prop himself by his inventions. The soul, by reason of its anxiety and impotence, being unable to stand by itself, wanders up and down to seek out consolations, hopes, and foundations, and alien circumstances, to which she adheres and fixes; and how light or fantastic soever invention delivers them to her, relies more willingly, and with greater assurance, upon them than upon herself. But 'tis wonderful to observe how the most constant and obstinate maintainers of this just and clear persuasion of the immortality of the soul fall short, and how weak their arguments are, when they go about to prove it by human reason: Somnia sunt non docentis, sed optantis: ""They are dreams, not of the teacher, but wisher,"" says one of the ancients. By which testimony man may know that he owes the truth he himself finds out to fortune and accident; since that even then, when it is fallen into his hand, he has not wherewith to hold and maintain it, and that his reason has not force to make use of it. All things produced by our own meditation and understanding, whether true or false, are subject to incertitude and controversy. 'Twas for the chastisement of our pride, and for the instruction of our miserable condition and incapacity, that God wrought the perplexity and confusion of the tower of Babel. Whatever we undertake without his assistance, whatever we see without the lamp of his grace, is but vanity and folly. We corrupt the very essence of truth, which is uniform and constant, by our weakness, when fortune puts it into our possession. What course soever man takes of himself, God still permits it to come to the same confusion, the image whereof he so lively represents to us in the just chastisement wherewith he crushed Nimrod's presumption, and frustrated the vain attempt of his proud structure; Perdam sapientiam sapientium, et prudentiam prudentium reprobabo. ""I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."" The diversity of idioms and tongues, with which he disturbed this work, what are they other than this infinite and perpetual alteration and discordance of opinions and reasons, which accompany and confound the vain building of human wisdom, and to very good effect too; for what would hold us, if we had but the least grain of knowledge? This saint has very much obliged me: Ipsa veritatis occultatio ant humili-tatis exercitatio est, aut elationis attritio ""The very concealment of the truth is either an exercise of humility or a quelling of presumption."" To what a pitch of presumption and insolence do we raise our blindness and folly!

But to return to my subject. It was truly very good reason that we should be beholden to God only, and to the favour of his grace, for the truth of so noble a belief, since from his sole bounty we receive the fruit of immortality, which consists in the enjoyment of eternal beatitude. Let us ingenuously confess that God alone has dictated it to us, and faith; for 'tis no lesson of nature and our own reason. And whoever will inquire into his own being and power, both within and without, without this divine privilege; whoever shall consider man impartially, and without flattery, will see in him no efficacy or faculty that relishes of any thing but death and earth. The more we give and confess to owe and render to God, we do it with the greater Christianity. That which this Stoic philosopher says he holds from the fortuitous consent of the popular voice; had it not been better that he had held it from God? Cum de animarum otemitate disserimus, non leve momentum apud nos habet consensus hominum aut timentium inferos, aut colentium. Utor hc public persuasione. ""When we discourse of the immortality of souls, the consent of men that either fear or adore the infernal powers, is of no small advantage. I make use of this public persuasion."" Now the weakness of human arguments upon this subject is particularly manifested by the fabulous circumstances they have superadded as consequences of this opinion, to find out of what condition this immortality of ours was. Let us omit the Stoics, (usuram nobis largiuntur tanquam cornicibus; diu mansuros aiunt animos; semper, negant. ""They give us a long life, as also they do to crows; they say our soul shall continue long, but that it shall continue always they deny,"") who give to souls a life after this, but finite. The most universal and received fancy, and that continues down to our times in various places, is that of which they make Pythagoras the author; not that he was the original inventor, but because it received a great deal of weight and repute by the authority of his approbation: ""That souls, at their departure out of us, did nothing but shift from one body to another, from a lion to a horse, from a horse to a king, continually travelling at this rate from habitation to habitation;"" and he himself said that he remembered he had been tha-lides, since that Euphorbus, afterwards Hermotimus, and, finally, from Pyrrhus was passed into Pythagoras; having a memory of himself of two hundred and six years. And some have added that these very souls sometimes mount up to heaven, and come down again:—

              O pater, aime aliquas ad colum hinc ire putandum est
         Sublimes animas, iterumque ad tarda reverti
          Corpora? Qu lucis miseris tam dira cupido?

                ""O, father, is it then to be conceiv'd
         That any of these spirits, so sublime,
         Should hence to the celestial regions climb,
          And thence return to earth to reassume
          Their sluggish bodies rotting in a tomb?
          For wretched life whence does such fondness come?""
Origen makes them eternally to go and come from a better to a worse estate. The opinion that Varro mentions is that, after four hundred and forty years' revolution, they should be reunited to their first bodies; Chrysippus held that this would happen after a certain space of time unknown and unlimited. Plato, who professes to have embraced this belief from Pindar and the ancient poets, that we are to undergo infinite vicissitudes of mutation, for which the soul is prepared, having neither punishment nor reward in the other world but what is temporal, as its life here is but temporal, concludes that it has a singular knowledge of the affairs of heaven, of hell, of the world, through all which it has passed, repassed, and made stay in several voyages, are matters for her memory. Observe her progress elsewhere: ""The soul that has lived well is reunited to the stars to which it is assigned; that which has lived ill removes into a woman, and if it do not there reform, is again removed into a beast of condition suitable to its vicious manners, and shall see no end of its punishments till it be returned to its natural constitution, and that it has, by the force of reason, purged itself from those gross, stupid, and elementary qualities it was polluted with."" But I will not omit the objection the Epicureans make against this transmigration from one body to another; 'tis a pleasant one; they ask what expedient would be found out if the number of the dying should chance to be greater than that of those who are coming into the world. For the souls, turned out of their old habitation, would scuffle and crowd which should first get possession of their new lodging; and they further demand how they shall pass away their time, whilst waiting till new quarters are made ready for them? Or, on the contrary, if more animals should be born than die, the body, they say, would be but in an ill condition whilst waiting for a soul to be infused into it; and it would fall out that some bodies would die before they had been alive.

              Denique comrabia ad Veneris, partusque ferarum
         Esse animas prsto, deridiculum esse videtur;
         Et spectare immortales mortalia membra
         Innumero numro, certareque prproperanter
          Inter se, qu prima potissimaq insinueter.

              ""Absurd to think that whilst wild beasts beget,
         Or bear their young, a thousand souls do wait,
         Expect the falling body, fight and strive
         Which first shall enter in and make it live.""
Others have arrested the soul in the body of the deceased, with it to animate serpents, worms, and other beasts, which are said to be bred out of the corruption of our members, and even out of our ashes; others divide them into two parts, the one mortal, the other immortal; others make it corporeal, and nevertheless immortal. Some make it immortal, without
sense or knowledge. There are others, even among ourselves, who have believed that devils were made of the souls of the damned; as Plutarch thinks that gods were made of those that were saved; for there are few things which that author is so positive in as he is in this; maintaining elsewhere a doubtful and ambiguous way of expression. ""We are told,"" says he, ""and steadfastly should believe, that the souls of virtuous men, both according to nature and the divine justice, become saints, and from saints demigods, and from demigods, after they are perfectly, as in sacrifices of purgation, cleansed and purified, being delivered from all passibility and all mortality, they become, not by any civil decree, but in real truth, and according to all probability of reason, entire and perfect gods, in receiving a most happy and glorious end."" But who desires to see him—him, who is yet the most sober and moderate of the whole gang of philosophers, lay about him with greater boldness, and relate his miracles upon this subject, I refer him to his treatise of the Moon, and of the Demon of Socrates, where he may, as evidently as in any other place whatever, satisfy himself that the mysteries of philosophy have many strange things in common with those of poetry; human understanding losing itself in attempting to sound and search all things to the bottom; even as we, tired and worn out with a long course of life, return to infancy and dotage. See here the fine and certain instructions which we extract from human knowledge concerning the soul.

Neither is there less temerity in what they teach us touching our corporal parts. Let us choose out one or two examples; for otherwise we should lose ourselves in this vast and troubled ocean of medical errors. Let us first know whether, at least, they agree about the matter whereof men produce one another; for as to their first production it is no wonder if, in a thing so high and so long since past, human understanding finds itself puzzled and perplexed. Archelaus, the physician, whose disciple and favourite Socrates was, according to Aristoxenus, said that both men and beasts were made of a lacteous slime, expressed by the heat of the earth; Pythagoras says that our seed is the foam or cream of our better blood; Plato, that it is the distillation of the marrow of the backbone; raising his argument from this, that that part is first sensible of being weary of the work; Alcmeon, that it is part of the substance of the brain, and that it is so, says he, is proved by the weakness of the eyes in those who are immoderate in that exercise; Democritus, that it is a substance extracted from the whole mass of the body; Epicurus, an extract from soul and body; Aristotle, an excrement drawn from the aliment of the blood, the last which is diffused over our members; others, that it is a blood concocted and digested by the heat of the genitals, which they judge, by reason that in excessive endeavours a man voids pure blood; wherein there seems to be more likelihood, could a man extract any appearance from so infinite a confusion. Now, to bring this seed to do its work, how many contrary opinions do they set on foot? Aristotle and Democritus are of opinion that women have no sperm, and that 'tis nothing but a sweat that they distil in the heat of pleasure and motion, and that contributes nothing at all to generation. Galen, on the contrary, and his followers, believe that without the concurrence of seeds there can be no generation. Here are the physicians, the philosophers, the lawyers, and divines, by the ears with our wives about the dispute, ""For what term women carry their fruit?"" and I, for my part, by the example of myself, stick with those that maintain a woman goes eleven months with child. The world is built upon this experience; there is no so commonplace a woman that cannot give her judgment in all these controversies; and yet we cannot agree.

Here is enough to verify that man is no better instructed in the knowledge of himself, in his corporal than in his spiritual part We have proposed himself to himself, and his reason to his reason, to see what she could say. I think I have sufficiently demonstrated how little she understands herself in herself; and who understands not himself in himself, in what can he? Quasi vero mensuram ullius rei possit agere, qui sui nesciat. ""As if he could understand the measure of any other thing, that knows not his own."" In earnest, Protagoras told us a pretty flam in making man the measure of all things, that never knew so much as his own; and if it be not he, his dignity will not permit that any other creature should have this advantage; now he being so contrary in himself, and one judgment so incessantly subverting another, this favourable proposition was but a mockery, which induced us necessarily to conclude the nullity of the compass and the compasser. When Thales reputes the knowledge of man very difficult for man to comprehend, he at the same time gives him to understand that all other knowledge is impossible.

You,* for whom I have taken the pains, contrary to my custom, to write so long a discourse, will not refuse to support your Sebond by the ordinary forms of arguing, wherewith you are every day instructed, and in this will exercise both your wit and learning; for this last fencing trick is never to be made use of but as an extreme remedy; 'tis a desperate thrust, wherein you are to quit your own arms to make your adversary abandon his; and a secret sleight, which must be very rarely, and then very reservedly, put in practice. 'Tis great temerity to lose yourself that you may destroy another; you must not die to be revenged, as Gobrias did; for, being closely grappled in combat with a lord of Persia, Darius coming in sword in hand, and fearing to strike lest he should kill Gobrias, he called out to him boldly to fall on,

         * The author, as we have already mentioned, is addressing
          Margaret de Valois.
though he should run them both through at once. I have known desperate weapons, and conditions of single combat, and wherein he that offered them put himself and his adversary upon terms of inevitable death to them both, censured for unjust. The Portuguese, in the Indian Sea, took certain Turks prisoners, who, impatient of their captivity, resolved, and it succeeded, by striking the nails of the ship one against another, and making a spark to fall into the barrels of powder that were set in the place where they were guarded, to blow up and reduce themselves, their masters, and the vessel to ashes. We here touch the out-plate and utmost limits of sciences, wherein the extremity is vicious, as in virtue. Keep yourselves in the common road; it is not good to be so subtle and cunning. Remember the Tuscan proverb:—

          Chi troppo s'assottiglia, si scavezza.

         ""Who makes himself too wise, becomes a fool.""
I advise you that, in all your opinions and discourses, as well as in your manners and all other things, you keep yourself moderate and temperate, and avoid novelty; I am an enemy to all extravagant ways. You, who by the authority of your grandeur, and yet more by the advantages which those qualities give you that are more your own, may with the twinkle of an eye command whom you please, ought to have given this charge to some one who made profession of letters, who might after a better manner have proved and illustrated these things to you. But here is as much as you will stand in need of.

Epicurus said of the laws, ""That the worst were so necessary for us that without them men would devour one another."" And Plato affirms, ""That without laws we should live like beasts."" Our wit is a wandering, dangerous, and temerarious utensil; it is hard to couple any order or measure to it; in those of our own time, who are endued with any rare excellence above others, or any extraordinary vivacity of understanding, we see them almost all lash out into licentiousness of opinions and manners; and 'tis almost a miracle to find one temperate and sociable. 'Tis all the reason in the world to limit human wit within the strictest limits imaginable; in study, as in all the rest, we ought to have its steps and advances numbered and fixed, and that the limits of its inquisition be bounded by art. It is curbed and fettered by religions, laws, customs, sciences, precepts, mortal and immortal penalties. And yet we see that it escapes from all these bonds by its volubility and dissolution; *tis a vain body which has nothing to lay hold on or to seize; a various and difform body, incapable of being either bound or held. In earnest, there are few souls so regular, firm, and well descended, as are to be trusted with their own conduct, and that can with moderation, and without temerity, sail in the liberty of their own judgments, beyond the common and received opinions; *tis more expedient to put them under pupilage. Wit is a dangerous weapon, even to the possessor, if he knows not how to use it discreetly; and there is not a beast to whom a headboard is more justly to be given, to keep his looks down and before his feet, and to hinder him from wandering here and there out of the tracks which custom and the laws have laid before him. And therefore it will be better for you to keep yourself in the beaten path, let it be what it will, than to fly out at a venture with this unbridled liberty. But if any of these new doctors will pretend to be ingenious in your presence, at the expense both of your soul and his own, to avoid this dangerous plague, which is every day laid in your way to infect you, this preservative, in the extremest necessity, will prevent the danger and hinder the contagion of this poison from offending either you or your company.

The liberty, then, and frolic forwardness of these ancient wits produced in philosophy and human sciences several sects of different opinions, every one undertaking to judge and make choice of what he would stick to and maintain. But now that men go all one way, Qui certis quibusdam destinatisque sententiis addicti et consecrati sunt, ut etiam, qu non probant, cogantur defendere, ""Who are so tied and obliged to certain opinions that they are bound to defend even those they do not approve,"" and that we receive the arts by civil authority and decree, so that the schools have but one pattern, and a like circumscribed institution and discipline, we no more take notice what the coin weighs, and is really worth, but every one receives it according to the estimate that common approbation and use puts upon it; the alloy is not questioned, but how much it is current for. In like manner all things pass; we take physic as we do geometry; and tricks of hocus-pocus, enchantments, and love-spells, the correspondence of the souls of the dead, prognostications, domifications, and even this ridiculous pursuit of the philosophers' stone, all things pass for current pay, without any manner of scruple or contradiction. We need to know no more but that Mars' house is in the middle of the triangle of the hand, that of Venus in the thumb, and that of Mercury in the little finger; that when the table-line cuts the tubercle of the forefinger 'tis a sign of cruelty, that when it falls short of the middle finger, and that the natural median-line makes an angle with the vital in the same side, 'tis a sign of a miserable death; that if in a woman the natural line be open, and does not close the angle with the vital, this denotes that she shall not be very chaste. I leave you to judge whether a man qualified with such knowledge may not pass with reputation and esteem in all companies.

Theophrastus said that human knowledge, guided by the senses, might judge of the causes of things to a certain degree; but that being arrived to first and extreme causes, it must stop short and retire, by reason either of its own infirmity or the difficulty of things. 'Tis a moderate and gentle opinion, that our own understandings may conduct us to the knowledge of some things, and that it has certain measures of power, beyond which 'tis temerity to employ it; this opinion is plausible, and introduced by men of well composed minds, but 'tis hard to limit our wit, which is curious and greedy, and will no more stop at a thousand than at fifty paces; having experimentally found that, wherein one has failed, the other has hit, and that what was unknown to one age, the age following has explained; and that arts and sciences are not cast in a mould, but are formed and perfected by degrees, by often handling and polishing, as bears leisurely lick their cubs into form; what my force cannot discover, I do not yet desist to sound and to try; and by handling and kneading this new matter over and over again, by turning and heating it, I lay open to him that shall succeed me, a kind of facility to enjoy it more at his ease, and make it more maniable and supple for him,

               Ut hymettia sole
         Cera remollescit, tractataque poll ice multas
          Vertitur in facies, ipsoque fit utilis usu;

              ""As wax doth softer in the sun become,
          And, tempered 'twixt the finger and the thumb,
         Will varions forms, and several shapes admit,
         Till for the present use 'tis rendered fit;""
as much will the second do for the third; which is the cause that the difficulty ought not to make me despair, and my own incapacity as little; for 'tis nothing but my own.

Man is as capable of all things as of some; and if he confesses, as Theophrastus says, the ignorance of first causes, let him at once surrender all the rest of his knowledge; if he is defective in foundation, his reason is aground; disputation and inquiry have no other aim nor stop but principles; if this aim do not stop his career, he runs into an infinite irresolution. Non potest aliud alio magis minusve comprehendi, quoniam omnium rerum una est dejinitio comprehendendi:

""One thing can no more or less be comprehended than another, because the definition of comprehending all things is the same."" Now 'tis very likely that, if the soul knew any thing, it would in the first place know itself; and if it knew any thing out of itself, it would be its own body and case, before any thing else. If we see the gods of physic to this very day debating about our anatomy,

         Mulciber in Trojam, pro Troj stabat Apollo;

         ""Vulcan against, for Troy Apollo stood;""
when are we to expect that they will be agreed? We are nearer neighbours to ourselves than whiteness to snow, or weight to stones. If man do not know himself, how should he know his force and functions? It is not, perhaps, that we have not some real knowledge in us; but 'tis by chance; forasmuch as errors are received into our soul by the same way, after the same manner, and by the same conduct, it has not wherewithal to distinguish them, nor wherewithal to choose the truth from falsehood.

The Academics admitted a certain partiality of judgment, and thought it too crude to say that it was not more likely to say that snow was white than black; and that we were no more assured of the motion of a stone, thrown by the hand, than of that of the eighth sphere. And to avoid this difficulty and strangeness, that can in truth hardly lodge in our imagination, though they concluded that we were in no sort capable of knowledge, and that truth is engulfed in so profound an abyss as is not to be penetrated by human sight; yet they acknowledged some things to be more likely than others, and received into their judgment this faculty, that they had a power to incline to one appearance more than another, they allowed him this propension, interdicting all resolution. The Pyrrhonian opinion is more bold, and also somewhat more likely; for this academic inclination, and this propension to one proposition rather than another, what is it other than a recognition of some more apparent truth in this than in that? If our understanding be capable of the form, lineaments, port, and face of truth, it might as well see it entire as by halves, springing and imperfect This appearance of likelihood, which makes them rather take the left hand than the right, augments it; multiply this ounce of verisimilitude that turns the scales to a hundred, to a thousand, ounces; it will happen in the end that the balance will itself end the controversy, and determine one choice, one entire truth. But why do they suffer themselves to incline to and be swayed by verisimilitude, if they know not the truth? How should they know the similitude of that whereof they do not know the essence? Either we can absolutely judge, or absolutely we cannot If our intellectual and sensible faculties are without foot or foundation, if they only pull and drive, 'tis to no purpose that we suffer our judgments to be carried away with any part of their operation, what appearance soever they may seem to present us; and the surest and most happy seat of our understanding would be that where it kept itself temperate, upright, and inflexible, without tottering, or without agitation: Inter visa, vera aut falsa, ad animi assensum, nihil interest: ""Amongst things that seem, whether true or false, it signifies nothing to the assent of the mind."" That things do not lodge in us in their form and essence, and do not there make their entry by their own force and authority, we sufficiently see; because, if it were so, we should receive them after the same manner; wine would have the same relish with the sick as with the healthful; he who has his finger chapt or benumbed would find the same hardness in wood or iron that he handles that another does; foreign subjects then surrender themselves to our mercy, and are seated in us as we please. Now if on our part we received any thing without alteration, if human grasp were capable and strong enough to seize on truth by our own means, these means being common to all men, this truth would be conveyed from hand to hand, from one to another; and at least there would be some one thing to be found in the world, amongst so many as there are, that would be believed by men with an universal consent; but this, that there is no one proposition that is not debated and controverted amongst us, or that may not be, makes it very manifest that our natural judgment does not very clearly discern what it embraces; for my judgment cannot make my companions approve of what it approves; which is a sign that I seized it by some other means than by a natural power that is in me and in all other men.

Let us lay aside this infinite confusion of opinions, which we see even amongst the philosophers themselves, and this perpetual and universal dispute about the knowledge of things; for this is truly presupposed, that men, I mean the most knowing, the best bom, and of the best parts, are not agreed about any one thing, not that heaven is over our heads; for they that doubt of every thing, do also doubt of that; and they who deny that we are able to comprehend any thing, say that we have not comprehended that the heaven is over our heads, and these two opinions are, without comparison, the stronger in number.

Besides this infinite diversity and division, through the trouble that our judgment gives ourselves, and the incertainty that every one is sensible of in himself, 'tis easy to perceive that its seat is very unstable and insecure. How variously do we judge of things?—How often do we alter our opinions? What I hold and believe to-day I hold and believe with my whole belief; all my instruments and engines seize and take hold of this opinion, and become responsible to me for it, at least as much as in them lies; I could not embrace nor conserve any truth with greater confidence and assurance than I do this; I am wholly and entirely possessed with it; but has it not befallen me, not only once, but a hundred, a thousand times, every day, to have embraced some other thing with all the same instruments, and in the same condition, which I have since judged to be false? A man must at least become wise at his own expense; if I have often found myself betrayed under this colour; if my touch proves commonly false, and my balance unequal and unjust, what assurance can I now have more than at other times? Is it not stupidity and madness to suffer myself to be so often deceived by my guide? Nevertheless, let fortune remove and shift us five hundred times from place to place, let her do nothing but incessantly empty and fill into our belief, as into a vessel, other and other opinions; yet still the present and the last is the certain and infallible one; for this we must abandon goods, honour, life, health, and all.

Whatever is preached to us, and whatever we learn, we should still remember that it is man that gives and man that receives; 'tis a mortal hand that presents it to us; 'tis a mortal hand that accepts it The things that come to us from heaven have the sole right and authority of persuasion, the sole mark of truth; which also we do not see with our own eyes, nor receive by our own means; that great and sacred image could not abide in so wretched a habitation if God for this end did not prepare it, if God did not by his particular and supernatural grace and favour fortify and reform it. At least our frail and defective condition ought to make us behave ourselves with more reservedness and moderation in our innovations and changes; we ought to remember that, whatever we receive into the understanding, we often receive things that are false, and that it is by the same instruments that so often give themselves the lie and are so often deceived.

Now it is no wonder they should so often contradict themselves, being so easy to be turned and swayed by very light occurrences. It is certain that our apprehensions, our judgment, and the faculties of the soul in general, suffer according to the movements and alterations of the body, which alterations are continual. Are not our minds more sprightly, ou memories more prompt and quick, and our thoughts more lively, in health than in sickness? Do not joy and gayety make us receive subjects that present themselves to our souls quite otherwise than care and melancholy? Do you believe that Catullus's verses, or those of Sappho, please an old doting miser as they do a vigorous, amorous young man? Cleomenes, the son of Anexandridas, being sick, his friends reproached him that he had humours and whimsies that were new and unaccustomed; ""I believe it,"" said he; ""neither am I the same man now as when I am in health; being now another person, my opinions and fancies are also other than they were before."" In our courts of justice this word is much in use, which is spoken of criminals when they find the judges in a good humour, gentle, and mild, Gaudeat de bon fortun ; ""Let him rejoice in his good fortune;"" for it is most certain that men's judgments are sometimes more prone to condemnation, more sharp and severe, and at others more facile, easy, and inclined to excuse; he that carries with him from his house the pain of the gout, jealousy, or theft by his man, having his whole soul possessed with anger, it is not to be doubted but that his judgment will lean this way. That venerable senate of the Areopagites used to hear and determine by night, for fear lest the sight of the parties might corrupt their justice. The very air itself, and the serenity of heaven, will cause some mutation in us, according to these verses in Cicero:—

              Tales sunt hominnm mentes, quali pater ipse
         Jupiter auctifer lustravit lampade terras.

              ""Men's minds are influenc'd by th' external air,
         Dark or serene, as days are foul or fair.""
'Tis not only fevers, debauches, and great accidents, that overthrow our judgments,—the least things in the world will do it; and we are not to doubt, though we may not be sensible of it, that if a continued fever can overwhelm the soul, a tertian will in some proportionate measure alter it; if an apoplexy can stupefy and totally extinguish the sight of our understanding, we are not to doubt but that a great cold will dazzle it; and consequently there is hardly one single hour in a man's whole life wherein our judgment is in its due place and right condition, our bodies being subject to so many continual mutations, and stuffed with so many several sorts of springs, that I believe the physicians, that it is hard but that there must be always some one or other out of order.

As to what remains, this malady does not very easily discover itself, unless it be extreme and past remedy; forasmuch as reason goes always lame, halting, and that too as well with falsehood as with truth; and therefore 'tis hard to discover her deviations and mistakes. I always call that appearance of meditation which every one forges in himself reason; this reason, of the condition of which there may be a hundred contrary ones about one and the same subject, is an instrument of lead and of wax, ductile, pliable, and accommodate to all sorts of biases, and to all measures; so that nothing remains but the art and skill how to turn and mould it. How uprightly soever a judge may mean, if he does not look well to himself, which few care to do, his inclination to friendship, to relationship, to beauty or revenge, and not only things of that weight, but even the fortuitous instinct that makes us favour one thing more than another, and that, without reason's permission, puts the choice upon us in two equal subjects, or some shadow of like vanity, may insensibly insinuate into his judgment the recommendation or disfavour of a cause, and make the balance dip.

I, that watch myself as narrowly as I can, and that have my eyes continually bent upon myself, like one that has no great business to do elsewhere,

              Quis sub Arcto Rex gelid metuatur or,
         Quid Tyridatem terreat, unice Securus,

              ""I care not whom the northern clime reveres,
         Or what's the king that Tyridates fears,""
dare hardly tell the vanity and weakness I find in myself My foot is so unstable and unsteady, I find myself so apt to totter and reel, and my sight so disordered, that, fasting, I am quite another man than when full; if health and a fair day smile upon me, I am a very affable, good-natured man; if a corn trouble my toe, I am sullen, out of humour, and not to be seen. The same pace of a horse seems to me one while hard, and another easy; and the same way one while shorter, and another longer; and the same form one while more, another less agreeable: I am one while for doing every thing, and another for doing nothing at all; and what pleases me now would be a trouble to me at another time. I have a thousand senseless and casual actions within myself; either I am possessed by melancholy or swayed by choler; now by its own private authority sadness predominates in me, and by and by, I am as merry as a cricket. When I take a book in hand I have then discovered admirable graces in such and such passages, and such as have struck my soul; let me light upon them at another time, I may turn and toss, tumble and rattle the leaves to no purpose; 'tis then to me an inform and undiscovered mass. Even in my own writings I do not always find the air of my first fancy; I know not what I would have said, and am often put to it to correct and pump for a new sense, because I have lost the first that was better. I do nothing but go and come; my judgment does not always advance—it floats and roams:—

              Velut minuta magno
         Deprensa navis in mari vesaniente vento.

             ""Like a small bark that's tost upon the main.
         When winds tempestuous heave the liquid plain.""
Very often, as I am apt to do, having for exercise taken to maintain an opinion contrary to my own, my mind, bending and applying itself that way, does so engage me that way that I no more discern the reason of my former belief, and forsake it I am, as it were, misled by the side to which I incline, be it what it will, and carried away by my own weight. Every one almost would say the same of himself, if he considered himself as I do. Preachers very well know that the emotions which steal upon them in speaking animate them towards belief; and that in passion we are more warm in the defence of our proposition, take ourselves a deeper impression of it, and embrace it with greater vehemence and approbation than we do in our colder and more temperate state. You only give your counsel a simple brief of your cause; he returns you a dubious and uncertain answer, by which you find him indifferent which side he takes. Have you feed him well that he may relish it the better, does he begin to be really concerned, and do you find him interested and zealous in your quarrel? his reason and learning will by degrees grow hot in your cause; behold an apparent and undoubted truth presents itself to his understanding; he discovers a new light in your business, and does in good earnest believe and persuade himself that it is so. Nay, I do not know whether the ardour that springs from spite and obstinacy, against the power and violence of the magistrate and danger, or the interest of reputation, may not have made some men, even at the stake, maintain the opinion for which, at liberty, and amongst friends, they would not have burned a finger. The shocks and jostles that the soul receives from the body's passions can do much in it, but its own can do a great deal more; to which it is so subjected that perhaps it may be made good that it has no other pace and motion but from the breath of those winds, without the agitation of which it would be becalmed and without action, like a ship in the middle of the sea, to which the winds hare denied their assistance. And whoever should maintain this, siding with the Peripatetics, would do us no great wrong, seeing it is very well known that the greatest and most noble actions of the soul proceed from, and stand in need of, this impulse of the passions. Valour, they say, cannot be perfect without the assistance of anger; Semper Ajax fortis, fortissimus tamen in furore; ""Ajax was always brave, but most when in a fury:"" neither do we encounter the wicked and the enemy vigorously enough if we be not angry; nay, the advocate, it is said, is to inspire the judges with indignation, to obtain justice.

Irregular desires moved Themistocles, and Demosthenes, and have pushed on the philosophers to watching, fasting, and pilgrimages; and lead us to honour, learning, and health, which are all very useful ends. And this meanness of soul, in suffering anxiety and trouble, serves to breed remorse and repentance in the conscience, and to make us sensible of the scourge of God, and politic correction for the chastisement of our offences; compassion is a spur to clemency; and the prudence of preserving and governing ourselves is roused by our fear; and how many brave actions by ambition! how many by presumption! In short, there is no brave and spiritual virtue without some irregular agitation. May not this be one of the reasons that moved the Epicureans to discharge God from all care and solicitude of our affairs; because even the effects of his goodness could not be exercised in our behalf without disturbing its repose, by the means of passions which are so many spurs and instruments pricking on the soul to virtuous actions; or have they thought otherwise, and taken them for tempests, that shamefully hurry the soul from her tranquillity? Ut maris tranquillitas intettigitur, null, ne minima quidem, aura fluctus commovente: Sic animi quietus et placatus status cemitur, quum perturbatis nulla est, qua moveri queat.. ""As it is understood to be a calm sea when there is not the least breath of air stirring; so the state of the soul is discerned to be quiet and appeased when there is no perturbation to move it.""

What varieties of sense and reason, what contrariety of imaginations does the diversity of our passions inspire us with! What assurance then can we take of a thing so mobile and unstable, subject by its condition to the dominion of trouble, and never going other than a forced and borrowed pace? If our judgment be in the power even of sickness and perturbation; if it be from folly and rashness that it is to receive the impression of things, what security can we expect from it?

Is it not a great boldness in philosophy to believe that men perform the greatest actions, and nearest approaching the Divinity, when they are furious, mad, and beside themselves? We better ourselves by the privation of our reason, and drilling it. The two natural ways to enter into the cabinet of the gods, and there to foresee the course of destiny, are fury and sleep.

This is pleasant to consider; by the dislocation that passions cause in our reason, we become virtuous; by its extirpation, occasioned by madness or the image of death, we become diviners and prophets. I was never so willing to believe philosophy in any thing as this. 'Tis a pure enthusiasm wherewith sacred truth has inspired the spirit of philosophy, which makes it confess, contrary to its own proposition, that the most calm, composed, and healthful estate ef the soul that philosophy can seat it in is not its best condition; our waking is more a sleep than sleep itself, our wisdom less wise than folly; our dreams are worth more than our meditation; and the worst place we can take is in ourselves. But does not philosophy think that we are wise enough to consider that the voice that the spirit utters, when dismissed from man, so clear-sighted, so great, and so perfect, and whilst it is in man so terrestrial, ignorant, and dark, is a voice proceeding from the spirit of dark, terrestrial, and ignorant man, and for this reason a voice not to be trusted and believed?

I, being of a soft and heavy complexion, have no great experience of these vehement agitations, the most of which surprise the soul on a sudden, without giving it leisure to recollect itself. But the passion that is said to be produced by idleness in the hearts of young men, though it proceed leisurely, and with a measured progress, does evidently manifest, to those who have tried to oppose its power, the violence our judgment suffers in this alteration and conversion. I have formerly attempted to withstand and repel it; for I am so far from being one of those that invite vices, that I do not so much as follow them, if they do not haul me along; I perceived it to spring, grow, and increase, in spite of my resistance; and at last, living and seeing as I was, wholly to seize and possess me. So that, as if rousing from drunkenness, the images of things began to appear to me quite other than they used to be; I evidently saw the advantages of the object I desired, grow, and increase, and expand by the influence of my imagination, and the difficulties of my attempt to grow more easy and smooth; and both my reason and conscience to be laid aside; but this fire being evaporated in an instant, as from a flash of lightning, I was aware that my soul resumed another kind of sight, another state, and another judgment; the difficulties of retreat appeared great and invincible, and the same things had quite another taste and aspect than the heat of desire had presented them to me; which of the two most truly? Pyrrho knows nothing about it. We are never without sickness. Agues have their hot and cold fits; from the effects of an ardent passion we fall again to shivering; as much as I had advanced, so much I retired:—

              Qualis ubi alterno procurrens gurgite pontus,
         Nunc ruit ad terras, scopulosque superjacit undam
         Spumeus, extremamque sinu perfundit arenam;
         Nunc rapidus retro, atque stu revoluta resorbens
         Saxa, fugit, littusque vado labente relihquit.

              ""So swelling surges, with a thundering roar,
         Driv'n on each others' backs, insult the shore,
         Bound o'er the rocks, encroach upon the land,
         And far upon the beach heave up the sand;
         Then backward rapidly they take their way,
         Repulsed from upper ground, and seek the sea.""
Now, from the knowledge of this volubility of mine, I have accidentally begot in myself a certain constancy of opinions, and have not much altered those that were first and natural in me; for what appearance soever there may be in novelty, I do not easily change, for fear of losing by the bargain; and, as I am not capable of choosing, I take other men's choice, and keep myself in the station wherein God has placed me; I could not otherwise keep myself from perpetual rolling. Thus have I, by the grace of God, preserved myself entire, without anxiety or trouble of conscience, in the ancient faith of our religion, amidst so many sects and divisions as our age has produced. The writings of the ancients, the best authors I mean, being full and solid, tempt and carry me which way almost they will; he that I am reading seems always to have the most force; and I find that every one in his turn is in the right, though they contradict one another. The facility that good wits have of rendering every thing likely they would recommend, and that nothing is so strange to which they do not undertake to give colour enough to deceive such simplicity as mine, this evidently shows the weakness of their testimony. The heavens and the stars have been three thousand years in motion; all the world were of that belief till Cleanthes the Samian, or, according to Theophrastus, Nicetas of Syracuse, took it into his head to maintain that it was the earth that moved, turning about its axis by the oblique circle of the zodiac. And Copernicus has in our times so grounded this doctrine that it very regularly serves to all astrological consequences; what use can we make of this, if not that we ought not much to care which is the true opinion? And who knows but that a third, a thousand years hence, may over throw the two former.

              Sic volvenda tas commutt tempora rerum:
         Quod fuit in pretio, fit nullo denique honore;
         Porro aliud succedit, et e contemptibus exit,
         Inque dies magis appetitur, floretque repertum
         Laudibus, et miro est mortales inter honore.

               ""Thus ev'ry thing is changed in course of time,
          What now is valued passes soon its prime;
         To which some other thing, despised before,
          Succeeds, and grows in vogue still more and more;
         And once received, too faint all praises seem,
         So highly it is rais'd in men's esteem.""
So that when any new doctrine presents itself to us, we have great reason to mistrust, and to consider that, before that was set on foot, the contrary had been generally received; and that, as that has been overthrown by this, a third invention, in time to come, may start up which may damn the second. Before the principles that Aristotle introduced were in reputation, other principles contented human reason, as these satisfy us now. What patent have these people, what particular privilege, that the career of our invention must be stopped by them, and that the possession of our whole future belief should belong to them? They are no more exempt from being thrust out of doors than their predecessors were. When any one presses me with a new argument, I ought to believe that what I cannot answer another can; for to believe all likelihoods that a man cannot confute is great simplicity; it would by that means come to pass that all the vulgar (and we are all of the vulgar) would have their belief as tumable as a weathercock; for their souls, being so easy to be imposed upon, and without any resistance, must of force incessantly receive other and other impressions, the last still effacing all footsteps of that which went before. He that finds himself weak ought to answer, according to practice, that he will speak with his counsel, or refer himself to the wiser, from whom he received his instruction. How long is it that physic has been practised in the world? 'Tis said that a new comer, called Paracelsus, changes and overthrows the whole order of ancient rules, and maintains that, till now, it has been of no other use but to kill men. I believe he will easily make this good, but I do not think it were wisdom to venture my life in making trial of his own experience. We are not to believe every one, says the precept, because every one can say all things. A man of this profession of novelties and physical reformations not long since told me that all the ancients were notoriously mistaken in the nature and motions of the winds, which he would evidently demonstrate to me if I would give him the hearing. After I had with some patience heard his arguments, which were all full of likelihood of truth: ""What, then,"" said I, ""did those that sailed according to Theophrastus make way westward, when they had the prow towards the east? did they go sideward or backward?"" ""That's fortune,"" answered he, ""but so it is that they were mistaken."" I replied that I had rather follow effects than reason. Now these are things that often interfere with one another, and I have been told that in geometry (which pretends to have gained the highest point of certainty of all science) there are inevitable demonstrations found which subvert the truth of all experience; as Jacques Pelletier told me, at my own house, that he had found out two lines stretching themselves one towards the other to meet, which nevertheless he affirmed, though extended to infinity, could never arrive to touch one another. And the Pyrrhonians make no other use of their arguments and their reason than to ruin the appearance of experience; and 'tis a wonder how far the suppleness of our reason has followed them in this design of controverting the evidence of effects; for they affirm that we do not move, that we do not speak, and that there is neither weight nor heat, with the same force of argument that we affirm the most likely things. Ptolemy, who was a great man, had established the bounds of this world of ours; all the ancient philosophers thought they had the measure of it, excepting some remote isles that might escape their knowledge; it had been Pyrrhonism, a thousand years ago, to doubt the science of cosmography, and the opinions that every one had received from it; it was heresy to admit the antipodes; and behold, in this age of ours, there is an infinite extent of terra firma discovered, not an island or single country, but a division of the world, nearly equal in greatness to that we knew before. The geographers of our time stick not to assure us that now all is found; all is seen:—

         Nam quod adest prosto, placet, et pollere videtur;

         ""What's present pleases, and appears the best;""
but it remains to be seen whether, as Ptolemy was therein formerly deceived upon the foundation of his reason, it were not very foolish to trust now in what these people say? And whether it is not more likely that this great body, which we call the world, is not quite another thing than what we imagine.

Plato says that it changes countenance in all respects; that the heavens, the stars, and the sun, have all of them sometimes motions retrograde to what we see, changing east into west The Egyptian priests told Herodotus that from the time of their first king, which was eleven thousand and odd years since (and they showed him the effigies of all their kings in statues taken from the life), the sun had four times altered his course; that the sea and the earth did alternately change into one another; that the beginning of the world is undetermined; Aristotle and Cicero both say the same; and some amongst us are of opinion that it has been from all eternity, is mortal, and renewed again by several vicissitudes; calling Solomon and Isaiah to witness; to evade those oppositions, that God has once been a creator without a creature; that he has had nothing to do, that he got rid of that idleness by putting his hand to this work; and that consequently he is subject to change. In the most famous of the Greek schools the world is taken for a god, made by another god greater than he, and composed of a body, and a soul fixed in his centre, and dilating himself by musical numbers to his circumference; divine, infinitely happy, and infinitely great, infinitely wise and eternal; in him are other gods, the sea, the earth, the stars, who entertain one another with an harmonious and perpetual agitation and divine dance, sometimes meeting, sometimes retiring from one another; concealing and discovering themselves; changing their order, one while before, and another behind. Heraclitus was positive that the world was composed of fire; and, by the order of destiny, was one day to be enflamed and consumed in fire, and then to be again renewed. And Apuleius says of men: Sigillatim mortales, cunctim perpetui. ""That they are mortal in particular, and immortal in general."" Alexander writ to his mother the narration of an Egyptian priest, drawn from their monuments, testifying the antiquity of that nation to be infinite, and comprising the birth and progress of other countries. Cicero and Diodorus say that in their time the Chaldees kept a register of four hundred thousand and odd years, Aristotle, Pliny, and others, that Zoroaster flourished six thousand years before Plato's time. Plato says that they of the city of Sais have records in writing of eight thousand years; and that the city of Athens was built a thousand years before the said city of Sais; Epicurus, that at the same time things are here in the posture we see, they are alike and in the same manner in several other worlds; which he would have delivered with greater assurance, had he seen the similitude and concordance of the new discovered world of the West Indies with ours, present and past, in so many strange examples.

In earnest, considering what is come to our knowledge from the course of this terrestrial polity, I have often wondered to see in so vast a distance of places and times such a concurrence of so great a number of popular and wild opinions, and of savage manners and beliefs, which by no means seem to proceed from our natural meditation. The human mind is a great worker of miracles! But this relation has, moreover, I know not what of extraordinary in it; 'tis found to be in names, also, and a thousand other things; for they found nations there (that, for aught we know, never heard of us) where circumcision was in use; where there were states and great civil governments maintained by women only, without men; where our fasts and Lent were represented, to which was added abstinence from women; where our crosses were several ways in repute; here they were made use of to honour and adorn their sepultures, there they were erected, and particularly that of St Andrew, to protect themselves from nocturnal visions, and to lay upon the cradles of infants against enchantments; elsewhere there was found one of wood, of very great height, which was adored for the god of rain, and this a great way in the interior; there was seen an express image of our penance priests, the use of mitres, the celibacy of priests, the art of divination by the entrails of sacrificed beasts, abstinence from all sorts of flesh and fish in their diet, the manner of priests officiating in a particular and not a vulgar language; and this fancy, that the first god was driven away by a second, his younger brother; that they were created with all sorts of necessaries and conveniences, which have since been in a degree taken from them for their sins, their territory changed, and their natural condition made worse; that they were of old overwhelmed by the inundation of water from heaven; that but few families escaped, who retired into caves on high mountains, the mouths of which they stopped so that the waters could not get in, having shut up, together with themselves, several sorts of animals; that when they perceived the rain to cease they sent out dogs, which returning clean and wet, they judged that the water was not much abated; afterwards sending out others, and seeing them return dirty, they issued out to repeople the world, which they found only full of serpents. In one place we met with the belief of a day of judgment; insomuch that they were marvellously displeased at the Spaniards for discomposing the bones of the dead, in rifling the sepultures for riches, saying that those bones so disordered could not easily rejoin; the traffic by exchange, and no other way; fairs and markets for that end; dwarfs and deformed people for the ornament of the tables of princes; the use of falconry, according to the nature of their hawks; tyrannical subsidies; nicety in gardens; dancing, tumbling tricks, music of instruments, coats of arms, tennis-courts, dice and lotteries, wherein they are sometimes so eager and hot as to stake themselves and their liberty; physic, no otherwise than by charms; the way of writing in cypher; the belief of only one first man, the father of all nations; the adoration of one God, who formerly lived a man in perfect virginity, fasting, and penitence, preaching the laws of nature, and the ceremonies of religion, and that vanished from the world without a natural death; the theory of giants; the custom of making themselves drunk with their beverages, and drinking to the utmost; religious ornaments painted with bones and dead men's skulls; surplices, holy water sprinkled; wives and servants, who present themselves with emulation, burnt and interred with the dead husband or master; a law by which the eldest succeeds to all the estate, no part being left for the younger but obedience; the custom that, upon promotion to a certain office of great authority, the promoted is to take upon him a new name, and to leave that which he had before; another to strew lime upon the knee of the new-born child, with these words:

""From dust thou earnest, and to dust thou must return;"" as also the art of augury. The vain shadows of our religion, which are observable in some of these examples, are testimonies of its dignity and divinity. It is not only in some sort insinuated into all the infidel nations on this side of the world, by a certain imitation, but in these barbarians also, as by a common and supernatural inspiration; for we find there the belief of purgatory, but of a new form; that which we give to the fire they give to the cold, and imagine that souls are purged and punished by the rigour of an excessive coldness. And this example puts me in mind of another pleasant diversity; for as there were there some people who delighted to unmuffle the ends of their instruments, and clipped off the prepuce after the Mahometan and Jewish manner; there were others who made so great conscience of laying it bare, that they carefully pursed it up with little strings to keep that end from peeping into the air; and of this other diversity, that whereas we, to honour kings and festivals, put on the best clothes we have; in some regions, to express their disparity and submission to their king, his subjects present themselves before him in their vilest habits, and entering his palace, throw some old tattered garment over their better apparel, to the end that all the lustre and ornament may solely be in him. But to proceed:—

If nature enclose within the bounds of her ordinary progress the beliefs, judgments, and opinions of men, as well as all other things; if they have their revolution, their season, their birth and death, like cabbage plants; if the heavens agitate and rule them at their pleasure, what magisterial and permanent authority do we attribute to them? If we experimentally see that the form of our beings depends upon the air, upon the climate, and upon the soil, where we are bom, and not only the colour, the stature, the complexion, and the countenances, but moreover the very faculties of the soul itself: Et plaga codi non solum ad robor corporum, sed etiam anirum facit: ""The climate is of great efficacy, not only to the strength of bodies, but to that of souls also,"" says Vegetius; and that the goddess who founded the city of Athens chose to situate it in a temperature of air fit to make men prudent, as the Egyptian priests told Solon: Athenis tenue colum; ex quo etiam acutiores putantur Attici; crassum Thebis; itaque pingues Thebani, et valentes: ""The air of Athens is subtle and thin; whence also the Athenians are reputed to be more acute; and at Thebes more gross and thick; wherefore the Thebans are looked upon as more heavy-witted and more strong."" In such sort that, as fruits and animals grow different, men are also more or less warlike, just, temperate, and docile; here given to wine, elsewhere to theft or uncleanness; here inclined to superstition, elsewhere to unbelief; in one place to liberty, in another to servitude; capable of one science or of one art, dull or ingenious, obedient or mutinous, good or bad, according as the place where they are seated inclines them; and assume a new complexion, if removed, like trees, which was the reason why Cyrus would not grant the Persians leave to quit their rough and craggy country to remove to another more pleasant and even, saying, that fertile and tender soils made men effeminate and soft. If we see one while one art and one belief flourish, and another while another, through some celestial influence; such an age to produce such natures, and to incline mankind to such and such a propension, the spirits of men one while gay and another gray, like our fields, what becomes of all those fine prerogatives we so soothe ourselves withal? Seeing that a wise man may be mistaken, and a hundred men and a hundred nations, nay, that even human nature itself, as we believe, is many ages wide in one thing or another, what assurances have we that she should cease to be mistaken, or that in this very age of ours she is not so?

Methinks that amongst other testimonies of our imbecility, this ought not to be forgotten, that man cannot, by his own wish and desire, find out what he wants; that not in fruition only, but in imagination and wish, we cannot agree about what we would have to satisfy and content us. Let us leave it to our own thought to cut out and make up at pleasure; it cannot so much as covet what is proper for it, and satisfy itself:—

              Quid enim ratione timemus,
          Aut cupimus? Quid tain dextro pede concipis, ut te
         Conatus non poniteat, votique peracti?

              ""For what, with reason, do we speak or shun,
         What plan, how happily soe'r begun,
         That, when achieved, we do not wish undone?""
And therefore it was that Socrates only begged of the gods that they would give him what they knew to be best for him; and the private and public prayer of the Lacedemonians was simply for good and useful things, referring the choice and election of them to the discretion of the Supreme Power:—

              Conjugium petimus, partumqu uxoris; at illis
         Notum, qui pueri, qualisque futura sit uxor:

              ""We ask for Wives and children; they above
         Know only, when we have them, what they'll prove;""
and Christians pray to God, ""Thy will be done,"" that they may not fall into the inconvenience the poet feigns of King Midas. He prayed to the gods that all he touched might be turned into gold; his prayer was heard; his wine was gold, his bread was gold, the feathers of his bed, his shirt, his clothes, were all gold, so that he found himself overwhelmed with the fruition of his desire, and endowed with an intolerable benefit, and was fain to unpray his prayers.

              Attonitus novitate mali, divesque, miserque,
         Effugere optt opes, et, qu modo voverat, odit.

              ""Astonished at the strangeness of the ill,
         To be so rich, yet miserable still;
         He wishes now he could his wealth evade,
         And hates the thing for which before he prayed.""
To instance in myself: being young, I desired of fortune, above all things, the order of St. Michael, which was then the utmost distinction of honour amongst the French nobles, and very rare. She pleasantly gratified my longing; instead of raising me, and lifting me up from my own place to attain to it, she was much kinder to me; for she brought it so low, and made it so cheap, that it stooped down to my shoulders, and lower. Cleobis and Bito, Trophonius and Agamedes, having requested, the first of their goddess, the last of their god, a recompense worthy of their piety, had death for a reward; so differing from ours are heavenly opinions concerning what is fit for us. God might grant us riches, honours, life, and even health, to our own hurt; for every thing that is pleasing to us is not always good for us. If he sends us death, or an increase of sickness, instead of a cure, Vvrga tua et baculus, tuus ipsa me consolata sunt. ""Thy rod and thy staff have comforted me,"" he does it by the rule of his providence, which better and more certainly discerns what is proper for us than we can do; and we ought to take it in good part, as coming from a wise and most friendly hand

              Si consilium vis:
         Permittee ipsis expendere numinibus, quid
         Conveniat nobis, rebusque sit utile nostris...
         Carior est illis homo quam sibi;

              ""If thou'lt be rul'd, to th' gods thy fortunes trust,
         Their thoughts are wise, their dispensations just.
         What best may profit or delight they know,
         And real good, for fancied bliss, bestow;
         With eyes of pity, they our frailties scan,
         More dear to them, than to himself, is man;""
for to require of him honours and commands, is to require 'that he may throw you into a battle, set you upon a cast at dice, or something of the like nature, whereof the issue is to you unknown, and the fruit doubtful.

There is no dispute so sharp and violent amongst the philosophers, as about the question of the sovereign good of man; whence, by the calculation of Varro, rose two hundred and eighty-eight sects. Qui autem de summo bono dissentit, de tot philosophies ratione disputt. ""For whoever enters into controversy concerning the supreme good, disputes upon the whole matter of philosophy.""

              Trs mihi conviv prope dissentire videntur,
         Poscentes vario mul turn divers a palato;
         Quid dem? Quid non dem? Renuis tu quod jubet alter;
         Quod petis, id sane est invisum acidumque duobus;

              ""I have three guests invited to a feast,
         And all appear to have a different taste;
         What shall I give them? What shall I refuse?
         What one dislikes the other two shall choose;
         And e'en the very dish you like the best
         Is acid or insipid to the rest:""
nature should say the same to their contests and debates. Some say that our well-being lies in virtue, others in pleasure, others in submitting to nature; one in knowledge, another in being exempt from pain, another in not suffering ourselves to be carried away by appearances; and this fancy seems to have some relation to that of the ancient Pythagoras,

              Nil admirari, prope res est una, Numici,
         Solaque, qu possit facere et servare beatum:

              ""Not to admire's the only art I know
         Can make us happy, and can keep us so;""
which is the drift of the Pyrrhonian sect; Aristotle attributes the admiring nothing to magnanimity; and Arcesilaus said, that constancy and a right inflexible state of judgment were the true good, and consent and application the sin and evil; and there, it is true, in being thus positive, and establishing a certain axiom, he quitted Pyrrhonism; for the' Pyrrhonians, when they say that ataraxy, which is the immobility of judgment, is the sovereign good, do not design to speak it affirmatively; but that the same motion of soul which makes them avoid precipices, and take shelter from the cold, presents them such a fancy, and makes them refuse another.

How much do I wish that, whilst I live, either some other or Justus Lipsius, the most learned man now living, of a most polite and judicious understanding, truly resembling my Turnebus, had both the will and health, and leisure sufficient, carefully and conscientiously to collect into a register, according to their divisions and classes, as many as are to be found, of the opinions of the ancient philosophers, about the subject of our being and manners, their controversies, the succession and reputation of sects; with the application of the lives of the authors and their disciples to their own precepts, in memorable accidents, and upon exemplary occasions. What a beautiful and useful work that would be!

As to what remains, if it be from ourselves that we are to extract the rules of our manners, upon what a confusion do we throw ourselves! For that which our reason advises us to, as the most likely, is generally for every one to obey the laws of his country, as was the advice of Socrates, inspired, as he says, by a divine counsel; and by that, what would it say, but that our duty has no other rule but what is accidental? Truth ought to have a like and universal visage; if man could know equity and justice that had a body and a true being, he would not fetter it to the conditions of this country or that; it would not be from the whimsies of the Persians or Indians that virtue would receive its form. There is nothing more subject to perpetual agitation than the laws; since I was born, I have known those of the English, our neighbours, three or four times changed, not only in matters of civil regimen, which is the only thing wherein constancy may be dispensed with, but in the most important subject that can be, namely, religion, at which I am the more troubled and ashamed, because it is a nation with whom those of my province have formerly had so great familiarity and acquaintance, that there yet remains in my house some footsteps of our ancient kindred; and here with us at home, I have known a thing that was capital to become lawful; and we that hold of others are likewise, according to the chance of war, in a possibility of being one day found guilty of high-treason, both divine and human, should the justice of our arms fall into the power of injustice, and, after a few years' possession, take a quite contrary being. How could that ancient god more clearly accuse the ignorance of human knowledge concerning the divine Being, and give men to understand that their religion was but a thing of their own contrivance, useful as a bond to their society, than declaring as he did to those who came to his tripod for instruction, that every one's true worship was that which he found in use in the place where he chanced to be? O God, what infinite obligation have we to the bounty of our sovereign Creator, for having disabused our belief from these wandering and arbitrary devotions, and for having seated it upon the eternal foundation of his holy word? But what then will philosophers say to us in this necessity? ""That we follow the laws of our country;"" that is to say, this floating sea of the opinions of a republic, or a prince, that will paint out justice for me in as many colours, and form it as many ways as there are changes of passions in themselves; I cannot suffer my judgment to be so flexible. What kind of virtue is that which I see one day in repute, and that to-morrow shall be in none, and which the crossing of a river makes a crime? What sort of truth can that be, which these mountains limit to us, and make a lie to all the world beyond them?

But they are pleasant, when, to give some certainty to the laws, they say, that there are some firm, perpetual, and immovable, which they call natural, that are imprinted in human kind by the condition of their own proper being; and of these some reckon three, some four, some more, some less; a sign that it is a mark as doubtful as the rest Now they are so unfortunate, (for what can I call it else but misfortune that, of so infinite a number of laws, there should not be found one at least that fortune and the temerity of chance has suffered to be universally received by the consent of all nations?) they are, I say, so miserable, that of these three or four select laws, there is not so much as one that is not contradicted and disowned, not only by one nation, but by many. Now, the only likely sign, by which they can argue or infer some natural laws, is the universality of approbation; for we should, without doubt, follow with a common consent that which nature had truly ordained us; and not only every nation, but every private man, would resent the force and violence that any one should do him who would tempt him to any thing contrary to this law. But let them produce me one of this condition. Proctagoras and Aristo gave no other essence to the justice of laws than the authority and opinion of the legislator; and that, these laid aside, the honest and the good lost their qualities, and remained empty names of indifferent things; Thrasymachus, in Plato, is of opinion that there is no other right but the convenience of the superior. There is not any thing wherein the world is so various as in laws and customs; such a thing is abominable here which is elsewhere in esteem, as in Lacedemon dexterity in stealing; marriages between near relations, are capitally interdicted amongst us; they are elsewhere in honour:—

              Gentes esse ferantur,
         In quibus et nato genitrix, et nata parenti
         Jungitur, et pietas geminato crescit amore;

              ""There are some nations in the world, 'tis said,
         Where fathers daughters, sons their mothers wed;
         And their affections thereby higher rise,
         More firm and constant by these double ties;""
the murder of infants, the murder of fathers, the community of wives, traffic of robberies, license in all sorts of voluptuousness; in short, there is nothing so extreme that is not allowed by the custom of some nation or other.

It is credible that there are natural laws for us, as we see them in other creatures; but they are lost in us, this fine human reason everywhere so insinuating itself to govern and command, as to shuffle and confound the face of things, according to its own vanity and inconstancy: Nihil itaque amplius nostrum est; quod nostrum dico, artis est: ""Therefore nothing is any more truly ours; what we call ours belongs to art."" Subjects have divers lustres and divers considerations, and thence the diversity of opinions principally proceeds; one nation considers a subject in one aspect, and stops there: another takes it in a different point of view.

There is nothing of greater horror to be imagined than for a man to eat his father; and yet the people, whose ancient custom it was so to do, looked upon it as a testimony of piety and affection, seeking thereby to give their progenitors the most worthy and honourable sepulture; storing up in themselves, and as it were in their own marrow, the bodies and relics of their fathers; and in some sort regenerating them by transmutation into their living flesh, by means of nourishment and digestion. It is easy to consider what a cruelty and abomination it must have appeared to men possessed and imbued with this snperstition to throw their fathers' remains to the corruption of the earth, and the nourishment of beasts and worms.

Lycurgus considered in theft the vivacity, diligence, boldness, and dexterity of purloining any thing from our neighbours, and the benefit that redounded to the public that every one should look more narrowly to the conservation of what was his own; and believed that, from this double institution of assaulting and defending, advantage was to be made for military discipline (which was the principal science and virtue to which he would inure that nation), of greater consideration than the disorder and injustice of taking another man's goods.

Dionysius, the tyrant, offered Plato a robe of the Persian fashion, long, damasked, and perfumed; Plato refused it, saying, ""That being born a man, he would not willingly dress himself in women's clothes;"" but Aristippus accepted it with this answer, ""That no accoutrement could corrupt a chaste courage."" His friends reproaching him with meanness of spirit, for laying it no more to heart that Dionysius had spit in his face, ""Fishermen,"" said he, ""suffer themselves to be drenched with the waves of the sea from head to foot to catch a gudgeon."" Diogenes was washing cabbages, and seeing him pass by, ""If thou couldst live on cabbage,"" said he, ""thou wouldst not fawn upon a tyrant;"" to whom Aristippus replied, ""And if thou knewest how to live amongst men, thou wouldst not be washing cabbages."" Thus reason finds appearances for divers effects; 'tis a pot with two ears that a man may take by the right or left:—

              Bellum, o terra hospita, portas:
         Bello armantur eqni; bellum hc armenta minantur.
         Sed tamen idem olim curru succedere sueti
         Quadrupedes, et frena jugo concordia ferre;
         Spes est pacis.

         ""War, war is threatened from this foreign ground
               (My father cried), where warlike steeds are found.
         Yet, since reclaimed, to chariots they submit,
         And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,
         Peace may succeed to war.""
Solon, being lectured by his friends not to shed powerless and unprofitable tears for the death of his son, ""It is for that reason that I the more justly shed them,"" said he, ""because they are powerless and unprofitable."" Socrates's wife exasperated her grief by this circumstance: ""Oh, how unjustly do these wicked judges put him to death!"" ""Why,"" replied he, ""hadst thou rather they should execute me justly?"" We have our ears bored; the Greeks looked upon that as a mark of slavery. We retire in private to enjoy our wives; the Indians do it in public. The Scythians immolated strangers in their temples; elsewhere temples were a refuge:—

               Inde furor vulgi, quod numina vicinorum
         Odit quisque locus, cum solos credat habendos
         Esse deos, quos ipse colit.

              ""Thus 'tis the popular fury that creates
         That all their neighbours' gods each nation hates;
         Each thinks its own the genuine; in a word,
         The only deities to be adored.""
I have heard of a judge who, coming upon a sharp conflict betwixt Bartolus and Aldus, and some point controverted with many contrarieties, writ in the margin of his book, ""a question for a friend;"" that is to say, that truth was there so controverted and disputed that in a like cause he might favour which of the parties he thought fit 'Twas only for want of wit that he did not write ""a question for a friend"" throughout. The advocates and judges of our times find bias enough in all causes to accommodate them to what they themselves think fit. In so infinite a science, depending upon the authority of so many opinions, and so arbitrary a subject, it cannot be but that of necessity an extreme confusion of judgments must arise; there is hardly any suit so clear wherein opinions do not very much differ; what one court has determined one way another determines quite contrary, and itself contrary to that at another time. Of which we see very frequent examples, owing to that practice admitted amongst us, and which is a marvellous blemish to the ceremonious authority and lustre of our justice, of not abiding by one sentence, but running from judge to judge, and court to court, to decide one and the same cause.

As to the liberty of philosophical opinions concerning vice and virtue, 'tis not necessary to be insisted upon; therein are found many opinions that are better concealed than published to weak minds. Arcesilaus said, ""That in venery it was no matter where, or with whom, it was committed:"" Et obsccenas voluptates, si natura requirit, non genere, aut loco, aut ordine, sed forma, otate, jigur, metiendas Epicurus putat.... ne amores quidem sanctos a sapiente alienos esse arbitrantur.... Queeramus, ad quam usque otatem juvenes amandi sint. ""And obscene pleasures, if nature requires them,"" Epicurus thinks, ""are not to be measured either by race, kind, place, or rank, but by age, shape, and beauty.... Neither are sacred loves thought to be foreign to wise men;... we are to inquire till what age young men are to be loved."" These last two stoical quotations, and the reproach that Dicarchus threw into the teeth of Plato himself, upon this account, show how much the soundest philosophy indulges licenses and excesses very remote from common custom.

Laws derive their authority from possession and custom. 'Tis dangerous to trace them back to their beginning; they grow great, and ennoble themselves, like our rivers, by running on; but follow them upward to their source, 'tis but a little spring, scarce discernable,

that swells thus, and thus fortifies itself by growing old. Do but consult the ancient considerations that gave the first motion to this famous torrent, so full of dignity, awe, and reverence, you will find them so light and weak that it is no wonder if these people, who weigh and reduce every thing to reason, and who admit nothing by authority, or upon trust, have their judgments often very remote, and differing from those of the public. It is no wonder if people, who take their pattern from the first image of nature, should in most of their opinions swerve from the common path; as, for example, few amongst them would have approved of the strict conditions of our marriages, and most of them have been for having wives in common, and without obligation; they would refuse our ceremonies. Chrysippus said, ""That a philosopher would make a dozen somersaults, aye, and without his breeches, for a dozen of olives.""
That philosopher would hardly have advised Clisthenes to have refused Hippoclides the fair Agarista his daughter, for having seen him stand on his head upon a table. Metrocles somewhat indiscreetly broke wind backwards while in disputation, in the presence of a great auditory in his school, and kept himself hid in his own house for shame, till Crates coming to visit him, and adding to his consolations and reasons the example of his own liberty, by falling to try with him who should sound most, cured him of that scruple, and withal drew him to his own stoical sect, more free than that more reserved one of the Peripatetics, of which he had been till then. That which we call decency, not to dare to do that in public which is decent enough to do in private, the Stoics call foppery; and to mince it, and to be so modest as to conceal and disown what nature, custom, and our desires publish and proclaim of our actions, they reputed a vice. The other thought it was to undervalue the mysteries of Venus to draw them out of the private oratory, to expose them to the view of the people; and that to bring them out from behind the curtain was to debase them. Modesty is a thing of weight; secrecy, reservation, and circumspection, are parts of esteem. Pleasure did very ingeniously when, under the mask of virtue, she sued not to be prostituted in the open streets, trodden under foot, and exposed to the public view, wanting the dignity and convenience of her private cabinets. Hence some say that to put down public stews is not only to disperse fornication into all places, that was confined to one, but moreover, by the difficulty, to incite wild and idle people to this vice:—

              Mochus es Aufidi, qui vir,
         Scvine, fuisti:
         Rivalis fuerat qui tuus, ille vir est.
          Cur alina placet tibi, qu tua non placet uxor?
         Numquid securus non potes arrigere?
This experience diversifies itself in a thousand examples:—

              Nullus in urbe fuit tot, qui tangere vellet
         Uxorem gratis, Cciliane, tuam,
         Dum licuit: sed nunc, positis custodibus, ingens
         Turba fututorum est. Ingeniosus homo es.
A philosopher being taken in the very act, and asked what he was doing, coldly replied, ""I am planting man;"" no more blushing to be so caught than if they had found him planting garlic.

It is, I suppose, out of tenderness and respect to the natural modesty of mankind that a great and religious author is of opinion that this act is so necessarily obliged to privacy and shame that he cannot persuade himself there could be any absolute performance in those impudent embraces of the Cynics, but that they contented themselves to represent lascivious gestures only, to maintain the impudence of their school's profession; and that, to eject what shame had withheld and restrained, it was afterward necessary for them to withdraw into the shade. But he had not thoroughly examined their debauches; for Diogenes, playing the beast with himself in public, wished, in the presence of all that saw him, that he could fill his belly by that exercise. To those who asked him why he did not find out a more commodious place to eat in than in the open street, he made answer, ""Because I am hungry in the open street."" The women philosophers who mixed with their sect, mixed also with their persons, in all places, without reservation; and Hipparchia was not received into Crates's society, but upon condition that she should, in all things, follow the practice and customs of his rule. These philosophers set a great price upon virtue, and renounce all other discipline but the moral; and yet, in all their actions, they attributed the sovereign authority to the election of their sage, and above the laws; and gave no other curb to voluptuousness but moderation only, and the conservation of the liberty of others.

Heraclitus and Protagoras, forasmuch as wine seemed bitter to the sick, and pleasant to the sound, the rudder crooked in the water, and straight when out, and such like contrary appearances as are found in subjects, argued thence that all subjects had, in themselves, the causes of these appearances; and there was some bitterness in the wine which had some sympathy with the sick man's taste, and the rudder some bending quality sympathizing with him that looks upon it in the water; and so of all the rest; which is to say, that all is in all things, and, consequently, nothing in any one; for, where all is, there is nothing.

This opinion put me in mind of the experience we have that there is no sense or aspect of any thing, whether bitter or sweet, straight or crooked, that the human mind does not find out in the writings it undertakes to tumble over. Into the cleanest, purest, and most perfect words that can possibly be, how many lies and falsities have we suggested! What heresy has not there found ground and testimony sufficient to make itself embraced and defended! 'Tis for this that the authors of such errors will never depart from proof of the testimony of the interpretation of words. A person of dignity, who would approve to me, by authority, the search of the philosopher's stone, wherein he was head over ears engaged, lately alleged to me at least five or six passages of the Bible upon which, he said, he first founded his attempt, for the discharge of his conscience (for he is a divine); and, in truth, the idea was not only pleasant, but, moreover, very well accommodated to the defence of this fine science.

By this way the reputation of divining fables is acquired. There is no fortune-teller, if we have this authority, but, if a man will take the pains to tumble and toss, and narrowly to peep into all the folds and glosses of his words, he may make him, like the Sibyls, say what he will. There are so many ways of interpretation that it will be hard but that, either obliquely or in a direct line, an ingenious wit will find out, in every subject, some air that will serve for his purpose; therefore we find a cloudy and ambiguous style in so frequent and ancient use. Let the author but make himself master of that, to busy posterity about his predictions, which not only his own parts, but the accidental favour of the matter itself, may do for him; and, as to the rest, express himself, whether after a foolish or a subtle manner, somewhat obscurely or contradictorily, 'tis no matter;—a number of wits, shaking and sifting him, will bring out a great many several forms, either according to his meaning, or collateral, or contrary, to it, which will all redound to his honour; he will see himself enriched by the means of his disciples, like the regents of colleges by their pupils yearly presents. This it is which has given reputation to many things of no worth at all; that has brought several writings in vogue, and given them the fame of containing all sorts of matter can be desired; one and the same thing receiving a thousand and a thousand images and various considerations; nay, as many as we please.

Is it possible that Homer could design to say all that we make him say, and that he designed so many and so various figures, as that the divines, law-givers, captains, philosophers, and all sorts of men who treat of sciences, how variously and opposite soever, should indifferently quote him, and support their arguments by his authority, as the sovereign lord and master of all offices, works, and artisans, and counsellor-general of all enterprises? Whoever has had occasion for oracles and predictions has there found sufficient to serve his turn. 'Tis a wonder how many and how admirable concurrences an intelligent person, and a particular friend of mine, has there found out in favour of our religion; and cannot easily be put out of the conceit that it was Homer's design; and yet he is as well acquainted with this author as any man whatever of his time. And what he has found in favour of our religion there, very many anciently have found in favour of theirs. Do but observe how Plato is tumbled and tossed about; every one ennobling his own opinions by applying him to himself, and making him take what side they please. They draw him in, and engage him in all the new opinions the world receives; and make him, according to the different course of things, differ from himself; every one makes him disavow, according to his own sense, the manners and customs lawful in his age, because they are unlawful in ours; and all this with vivacity and power, according to the force and sprightliness of the wit of the interpreter. From the same foundation that Heraclitus and this sentence of his had, ""that all things had in them those forms that we discern,"" Democritus drew quite a contrary conclusion,—""that objects have in them nothing that we discern in them;"" and because honey is sweet to one and bitter to another, he thence argued that it was neither sweet nor bitter. The Pyrrhonians would say that they knew not whether it is sweet or bitter, or whether the one or the other, or both; for these always gained the highest point of dubitation. The Cyrenaics held that nothing was perceptible from without, and that that only was perceptible that inwardly touched us, as pain and pleasure; acknowledging neither sound nor colour, but certain affections only that we receive from them; and that man's judgment had no other seat Protagoras believed that ""what seems true to every one, is true to every one."" The Epicureans lodged all judgment in the senses, and in the knowledge of things, and in pleasure. Plato would have the judgment of truth, and truth itself, derived from opinions and the senses, to belong to the wit and cogitation.

This discourse has put me upon the consideration of the senses, in which lies the greatest foundation and Prof of our ignorance. Whatsoever is known, is doubtless known by the faculty of the knower; for, seeing the judgment proceeds from the operation of him that judges, 'tis reason that this operation be performed by his means and will, not by the constraint of another; as it would happen if we knew things by the power, and according to the law of their essence. Now all knowledge is conveyed to us by the senses; they are our masters:—

                Via qua munita fidei
          Proxima fert humanum in pectus, templaque mentis;

              ""It is the surest path that faith can find
         By which to enter human heart and mind.""
Science begins by them, and is resolved into them. After all, we should know no more than a stone if we did not know there is sound, odour, light, taste, measure, weight, softness, hardness, sharpness, colour, smoothness, breadth, and depth; these are the platforms and principles of the structure of all our knowledge; and, according to some, science is nothing else but sense. He that could make me contradict the senses, would have me by the throat; he could not make me go further back. The senses are the beginning and the end of human knowledge:—

               Invenies primis ab sensibns esse creatam
          Notitiam veil; neque sensus posse refelli....
           Quid majore fide porro, quam sensus, haberi Debet?

              ""Of truth, whate'er discoveries are made,
          Are by the senses to us first conveyed;
         Nor will one sense be baffled; for on what
         Can we rely more safely than on that?""
Let us attribute to them the least we can, we must, however, of necessity grant them this, that it is by their means and mediation that all our instruction is directed. Cicero says, that Chrysippus having attempted to extenuate the force and virtue of the senses, presented to himself arguments and so vehement oppositions to the contrary that he could not satisfy himself therein; whereupon Cameades, who maintained the contrary side, boasted that he would make use of the very words and arguments of Chrysippus to controvert and confute him, and therefore thus cried out against him: ""O miserable! thy force has destroyed thee."" There can be nothing absurd to a greater degree than to maintain that fire does not warm, that light does not shine, and that there is no weight nor solidity in iron, which are things conveyed to us by the senses; neither is there belief nor knowledge in man that can be compared to that for certainty.

The first consideration I have upon the subject of the senses is that I make a doubt whether or no man be furnished with all natural senses. I see several animals who live an entire and perfect life, some without sight, others without hearing; who knows whether to us also one, two, three, or many other senses may not be wanting? For if any one be wanting, our examination cannot discover the defect. 'Tis the privilege of the senses to be the utmost limit of our discovery; there is nothing beyond them that can assist us in exploration, not so much as one sense in the discovery of another:—

                 An poterunt oculos aures reprehendere? an aures
            Tactus an hunc porro tactum sapor argnet oris?
          An confutabunt nares, oculive revincent?

                ""Can ears the eyes, the touch the ears, correct?
           Or is that touch by tasting to be check'd?
          Or th' other senses, shall the nose or eyes
           Confute in their peculiar faculties?""
They all make the extremest limits of our ability:—

               Seorsum cuique potestas Divisa est, sua vis cuique est,

              ""Each has its power distinctly and alone,
         And every sense's power is its own.""
It is impossible to make a man naturally blind conceive that he does not see; impossible to make him desire sight, or to regret his defect; for which reason we ought not to derive any assurance from the soul's being contented and satisfied with those we have; considering that it cannot be sensible herein of its infirmity and imperfection, if there be any such thing. It is impossible to say any thing to this blind man, either by reasoning, argument, or similitude, that can possess his imagination with any apprehension of light, colour, or sight; there's nothing remains behind that can push on the senses to evidence. Those that are born blind, whom we hear wish they could see, it is not that they understand what they desire; they have learned from us that they want something; that there is something to be desired that we have, which they can name indeed and speak of its effect and consequences; but yet they know not what it is, nor apprehend it at all.

I have seen a gentleman of a good family who was born blind, or at least blind from such an age that he knows not what sight is; who is so little sensible of his defect that he makes use as we do of words proper for seeing, and applies them after a manner wholly particular and his own. They brought him a child to which he was god-father, which, having taken into his arms, ""Good God,"" said he, ""what a fine child! How beautiful to look upon! what a pretty face it has!"" He will say, like one of us, ""This room has a very fine prospect;—it is clear weather;—the sun shines bright."" And moreover, being that hunting, tennis, and butts are our exercises, and he has heard so, he has taken a liking to them, will ride a-hunting, and believes he has as good share of the sport as we have; and will express himself as angry or pleased as the best of us all, and yet knows nothing of it but by the ear. One cries out to him, ""Here's a hare!"" when he is upon some even plain where he may safely ride; and afterwards, when they tell him, ""The hare is killed,"" he will be as overjoyed and proud of it as he hears others say they are. He will take a tennis-ball in his left hand and strike it away with the racket; he will shoot with a harquebuss at random, and is contented with what his people tell him, that he is over, or wide.

Who knows whether all human kind commit not the like absurdity, for want of some sense, and that through this default the greatest part of the face of things is concealed from us? What do we know but that the difficulties which we find in several works of nature proceed hence; and that several effects of animals, which exceed our capacity, are not produced by faculty of some sense that we are defective in? and whether some of them have not by this means a life more full and entire than ours? We seize an apple with all our senses; we there find redness, smoothness, odour, and sweetness; but it may have other virtues besides these, as to heat or binding, which no sense of ours can have any reference unto. Is it not likely that there are sensitive faculties in nature that are fit to judge of and to discern those which we call the occult properties in several things, as for the loadstone to attract iron; and that the want of such faculties is the cause that we are ignorant of the true essence of such things? 'Tis perhaps some particular sense that gives cocks to understand what hour it is at midnight, and when it grows to be towards day, and that makes them crow accordingly; that teaches chickens, before they have any experience of the matter, to fear a sparrow-hawk, and not a goose or a peacock, though birds of a much larger size; that cautions them against the hostile quality the cat has against them, and makes them not to fear a dog; to arm themselves against the mewing, a kind of flattering voice, of the one, and not against the barking, a shrill and threatening voice, of the other; that teaches wasps, ants, and rats, to fall upon the best pear and the best cheese before they have tasted them, and inspires the stag, elephant, and serpent, with the knowledge of a certain herb proper for their cure. There is no sense that has not a mighty dominion, and that does not by its power introduce an infinite number of knowledges. If we were defective in the intelligence of sounds, of harmony, and of the voice, it would cause an unimaginable confusion in all the rest of our science; for, besides what belongs to the proper effect of every sense, how many arguments, consequences, and conclusions do we draw to other things, by comparing one sense with another? Let an understanding man imagine human nature originally produced without the sense of seeing, and consider what ignorance and trouble such a defect would bring upon him, what a darkness and blindness in the soul; he will then see by that of how great importance to the knowledge of truth the privation of such another sense, or of two or three, should we be so deprived, would be. We have formed a truth by the consultation and concurrence of our five senses; but perhaps we should have the consent and contribution of eight or ten to make a certain discovery of it in its essence.

The sects that controvert the knowledge of man do it principally by the uncertainty and weakness of our senses; for since all knowledge is by their means and mediation conveyed unto us, if they fail in their report, if they corrupt or alter what they bring us from without, if the light which by them creeps into the soul be obscured in the passage, we have nothing else to hold by. From this extreme difficulty all these fancies proceed: ""That every subject has in itself all we there find. That it has nothing in it of what we think we there find;"" and that of the Epicureans, ""That the sun is no bigger than 'tis judged by our sight to be:—""

                Quidquid id est, nihilo fertur majore figura,
         Quam nostris oculis quam cemimus, esse videtur:

              ""But be it what it will in our esteems,
         It is no bigger than to us it seems:""
that the appearances which represent a body great to him that is near, and less to him that is more remote, are both true:—

              Nee tamen hic oculos falli concedimus hilum....
         Proinde animi vitium hoc oculis adfingere noli:

              ""Yet that the eye's deluded we deny;
         Charge not the mind's faults, therefore, on the eye:""
""and, resolutely, that there is no deceit in the senses; that we are to lie at their mercy, and seek elsewhere reasons to excuse the difference and contradictions we there find, even to the inventing of lies and other flams, if it come to that, rather than accuse the senses."" Timagoras vowed that, by pressing or turning his eye, he could never perceive the light of the candle to double, and that the seeming so proceeded from the vice of opinion, and not from the instrument. The most absurd of all absurdities, with the Epicureans, is to deny the force and effect of the senses:—

                  Proinde, quod in quoquo est his visum tempore, verum est
            Et, si non potuit ratio dissolvere causam,
            Cur ea, qu fuerint juxtim quadrata, procul sint
            Visa rotunda; tamen prstat rationis egentem
            Beddere mendose causas utriusque figur,
           Quam manibus manifesta suis emittere ququam,
            Et violare fidem primam, et convellere tota
            Fundamenta, quibus nixatur vita salusque:
            Non modo enim ratio ruat omnis, vita quoque ipsa
           Concidat extemplo, nisi credere sensibus ausis,
            Procipitesque locos vitare, et ctera, qu sint
           In genere hoc fugienda.

                ""That what we see exists I will maintain,
          And if our feeble reason can't explain
            Why things seem square when they are very near,
            And at a greater distance round appear;
           'Tis better yet, for him that's at a pause,
          'T' assign to either figure a false cause,
          Than shock his faith, and the foundations rend
         On which our safety and our life depend:
         For reason not alone, but life and all,
         Together will with sudden ruin fall;
         Unless we trust our senses, nor despise
         To shun the various dangers that arise.""
This so desperate and unphilosophical advice expresses only this,—that human knowledge cannot support itself but by reason unreasonable, foolish, and mad; but that it is yet better that man, to set a greater value upon himself, make use of any other remedy, how fantastic soever, than to confess his necessary ignorance—a truth so disadvantageous to him. He cannot avoid owning that the senses are the sovereign lords of his knowledge; but they are uncertain, and falsifiable in all circumstances; 'tis there that he is to fight it out to the last; and if his just forces fail him, as they do, to supply that defect with obstinacy, temerity, and impudence. In case what the Epicureans say be true, viz: ""that we have no knowledge if the senses' appearances be false;"" and if that also be true which the Stoics say, ""that the appearances of the senses are so false that they can furnish us with no manner of knowledge,"" we shall conclude, to the disadvantage of these two great dogmatical sects, that there is no science at all.

As to the error and uncertainty of the operation of the senses, every one may furnish himself with as many examples as he pleases; so ordinary are the faults and tricks they put upon us. In the echo of a valley the sound of a trumpet seems to meet us, which comes from a place behind:—

              Exstantesque procul medio de gurgite montes,
         Classibus inter qnos liber patet exitus, idem
         Apparent, et longe divolsi licet, ingens
         Insula conjunctis tamen ex his ana videtur...
         Et fugere ad puppim colies campique videntur,
         Qnos agimns proter navim, velisque volamus....
         Ubi in medio nobis equus acer obhsit
         Flamine, equi corpus transversum ferre videtur
         Vis, et in adversum flumen contrudere raptim.

               ""And rocks i' th' seas that proudly raise their head,
         Though far disjoined, though royal navies spread,
         Their sails between; yet if from distance shown,
         They seem an island all combin'd in one.
         Thus ships, though driven by a prosperous gale,
         Seem fix'd to sailors; those seem under sail
         That ride at anchor safe; and all admire,
         As they row by, to see the rocks retire.
         Thus, when in rapid streams my horse hath stood,
         And I look'd downward on the rolling flood;
         Though he stood still, I thought he did divide
         The headlong streams, and strive against the tide,
         And all things seem'd to move on every side.""
Take a musket-ball under the forefinger, the middle finger being lapped over it, it feels so like two that a man will have much ado to persuade himself there is but one; the end of the two fingers feeling each of them one at the same time; for that the senses are very often masters of our reason, and constrain it to receive impressions which it judges and knows to be false, is frequently seen. I set aside the sense of feeling, that has its functions nearer, more lively, and substantial, that so often, by the effects of the pains it helps the body to, subverts and overthrows all those fine Stoical resolutions, and compels him to cry out of his belly, who has resolutely established this doctrine in his soul—""That the colic, and all other pains and diseases, are indifferent things, not having the power to abate any thing of the sovereign felicity wherein the wise man is seated by his virtue."" There is no heart so effeminate that the rattle and sound of our drums and trumpets will not inflame with courage; nor so sullen that the harmony of our music will not rouse and cheer; nor so stubborn a soul that will not feel itself struck with some reverence in considering the gloomy vastness of our churches, the variety of ornaments, and order of our ceremonies; and in hearing the solemn music of our organs, and the grace and devout harmony of our voices. Even those that come in with contempt feel a certain shivering in their hearts, and something of dread that makes them begin to doubt their opinions. For my part I do not think myself strong enough to hear an ode of Horace or Catullus sung by a beautiful young mouth without emotion; and Zeno had reason to say ""that the voice was the flower of beauty."" One would once make me believe that a certain person, whom all we Frenchmen know, had imposed upon me in repeating some verses that he had made; that they were not the same upon paper that they were in the air; and that my eyes would make a contrary judgment to my ears; so great a power has pronunciation to give fashion and value to works that are left to the efficacy and modulation of the voice. And therefore Philoxenus was not so much to blame, hearing one giving an ill accent to some composition of his, in spurning and breaking certain earthen vessels of his, saying, ""I break what is thine, because thou corruptest what is mine."" To what end did those men who have, with a firm resolution, destroyed themselves, turn away their faces that they might not see the blow that was by themselves appointed? And that those who, for their health, desire and command incisions to be made, and cauteries to be applied to them, cannot endure the sight of the preparations, instruments, and operations of the surgeon, being that the sight is not in any way to participate in the pain? Are not these proper examples to verify the authority the senses have over the imagination? 'Tis to much purpose that we know these tresses were borrowed from a page or a lackey; that this rouge came from Spain, and this pearl-powder from the Ocean Sea. Our sight will, nevertheless, compel us to confess their subject more agreeable and more lovely against all reason; for in this there is nothing of its own:—

               Auferinrar cultu; gemmis, auroque teguntur
         Crimina; pars minima est ipsa puella sni.
         Spe, ubi sit quod ames, inter tarn multa requiras:
         Decipit hac oculos gide dives Amor.

               ""By dress we're won; gold, gems, and rich brocades
          Make up the pageant that your heart invades;
          In all that glittering figure which you see,
         The far least part of her own self is she;
         In vain for her you love amidst such cost
         You search, the mistress in such dress is lost.""
What a strange power do the poets attribute to the senses, that make Narcissus so desperately in love with his own shadow,

              Cunctaque miratur, quibus est mirabilis ipse;
         Se cupit imprudens, et, qui probat, ipse probatur;
         Dumque petit, petitur; pariterque accendit, et ardet:

              ""Admireth all; for which to be admired;
         And inconsiderately himself desir'd.
         The praises which he gives his beauty claim'd,
         Who seeks is sought, th' inflamer is inflam'd:""
and Pygmalion's judgment so troubled by the impression of the sight of his ivory statue that he loves and adores it as if it were a living woman!

              Oscnla dat, reddique putat: sequi turque, tenetque,
         Et credit tactis digitos insidere membris;
         Et metuit, pressos veniat ne livor in artus.

              ""He kisses, and believes he's kissed again;
         Seizes, and 'twixt his arms his love doth strain,
         And thinks the polish'd ivory thus held
         Doth to his fingers amorous pressure yield,
         And has a timorous fear, lest black and blue
          Should in the parts with ardour press'd ensue.""
Put a philosopher into a cage of small thin set bars of iron, hang him on the top of the high tower of Notre Dame at Paris; he will see, by manifest reason, that he cannot possibly fall, and yet he will find (unless he has been used to the plumber's trade) that he cannot help but the sight of the excessive height will fright and astound him; for we have enough to do to assure ourselves in the galleries of our steeples, if they are made with open work, although they are of stone; and some there are that cannot endure so much as to think of it. Let there be a beam thrown over betwixt these two towers, of breadth sufficient to walk upon, there is no philosophical wisdom so firm that can give us the courage to walk over it as we should do upon the ground. I have often tried this upon our mountains in these parts; and though I am one who am not the most subject to be afraid, I was not able to endure to look into that infinite depth without horror and trembling, though I stood above my length from the edge of the precipice, and could not have fallen unless I would. Where I also observed that, what height soever the precipice was, provided there were some tree, or some jutting out of a rock, a little to support and divide the sight, it a little eases our fears, and gives greater assurance; as if they were things by which in falling we might have some relief; but that direct precipices we are not to look upon without being giddy; Ut despici vine vertigine timid ocvlorum animique non possit: ""'To that one cannot look without dizziness;"" which is a manifest imposture of the sight. And therefore it was that that fine philosopher put out his own eyes, to free the soul from being diverted by them, and that he might philosophize at greater liberty; but, by the same rule, he should have dammed up his ears, that Theophrastus says are the most dangerous instruments about us for receiving violent impressions to alter and disturb us; and, finally, should have deprived himself of all his other senses, that is to say, of his life and being; for they have all the power to command our soul and reason: Fit etiam sope specie qudam, sope vocum gravitate et cantibus, ut pettantur animi vehementius; sope etiam cura et timor, ""For it often falls out that the minds are more vehemently struck by some sight, by the quality and sound of the voice, or by singing; and ofttimes also by grief and fear."" Physicians hold that there are certain complexions that are agitated by the same sounds and instruments even to fury. I have seen some who could not hear a bone gnawed under the table without impatience; and there is scarce any man who is not disturbed at the sharp and shrill noise that the file makes in grating upon the iron; as also to hear chewing near them, or to hear any one speak who has an impediment in the throat or nose, will move some people even to anger and hatred. Of what use was that piping prompter of Gracchus, who softened, raised, and moved his master's voice whilst he declaimed at Rome, if the movements and quality of the sound had not the power to move and alter the judgments of the auditory? In earnest, there is wonderful reason to keep such a clutter about the firmness of this fine piece, that suffers itself to be turned and twined by the motion and accidents of so light a wind.

The same cheat that the senses put upon our understanding they have in turn put upon them; the soul also some times has its revenge; they lie and contend which should most deceive one another. What we see and hear when we are transported with passion, we neither see nor hear as it is:—

               Et solem geminum, et duplices se ostendere Thebas.

              ""Thebes seems two cities, and the sun two suns.""
The object that we love appears to us more beautiful than it really is;

              Multimodis igitur pravas turpesque videmus
         Esse in deliciis, summoque in honore vigere;

              ""Hence 'tis that ugly things in fancied dress
         Seem gay, look fair to lovers' eyes, and please;""
and that we hate more ugly; to a discontented and afflicted man the light of the day seems dark and overcast. Our senses are not only depraved, but very often stupefied by the passions of the soul; how many things do we see that we do not take notice of, if the mind be occupied with other thoughts?

               In rebus quoque apertis noscere possis,
         Si non advertas animum, proinde esse quasi omni
         Tempore semot fuerint, longeque remot:

               ""Nay, even in plainest things, unless the mind
         Take heed, unless she sets herself to find,
         The thing no more is seen, no more belov'd,
         Than if the most obscure and most remov'd:""
it would appear that the soul retires within, and amuses the powers of the senses. And so both the inside and the outside of man is full of infirmity and falsehood.

They who have compared our lives to a dream were, perhaps, more in the right than they were aware of. When we dream, the soul lives, works, and exercises all its faculties, neither more nor less than when awake; but more largely and obscurely, yet not so much, neither, that the difference should be as great as betwixt night and the meridian brightness of the sun, but as betwixt night and shade; there she sleeps, here she slumbers; but, whether more or less, 'tis still dark, and Cimmerian darkness. We wake sleeping, and sleep waking. I do not see so clearly in my sleep; but as to my being awake, I never found it clear enough and free from clouds; moreover, sleep, when it is profound, sometimes rocks even dreams themselves asleep; but our waking is never so sprightly that it rightly purges and dissipates those whimsies, which are waking dreams, and worse than dreams. Our reason and soul receiving those fancies and opinions that come in dreams, and authorizing the actions of our dreams with the like approbation that they do those of the day, wherefore do we not doubt whether our thought, our action, is not another sort of dreaming, and our waking a certain kind of sleep?

If the senses be our first judges, it is not ours that we are alone to consult; for, in this faculty, beasts have as great, or greater, than we; it is certain that some of them have the sense of hearing more quick than man; others that of seeing, others that of feeling, others that of touch and taste. Democritus said, that the gods and brutes had the sensitive faculties more perfect than man. But betwixt the effects of their senses and ours the difference is extreme. Our spittle cleanses and dries up our wounds; it kills the serpent:—

              Tantaque in his rebas distantia differitasque est,
          Ut quod aliis cibus est, aliis fuat acre venenum.
         Spe etenim serpens, hominis contacta saliv,
         Disperit, ac sese mandendo conficit ipsa:

               ""And in those things the difference is so great
         That what's one's poison is another's meat;
         For serpents often have been seen, 'tis said,
         When touch'd with human spittle, to go mad,
         And bite themselves to death:""
what quality shall we attribute to our spittle? as it affects ourselves, or as it affects the serpent? By which of the two senses shall we prove the true essence that we seek for?

Pliny says there are certain sea-hares in the Indies that are poison to us, and we to them; insomuch that, with the least touch, we kill them. Which shall be truly poison, the man or the fish? Which shall we believe, the fish of the man, or the man of the fish? One quality of the air infects a man, that does the ox no harm; some other infects the ox, but hurts not the man. Which of the two shall, in truth and nature, be the pestilent quality? To them who have the jaundice, all things seem yellow and paler than to us:—

              Lurida prterea fiunt, qucunque tuentur Arquati.

               ""Besides, whatever jaundic'd eyes do view
         Looks pale as well as those, and yellow too.""
They who are troubled with the disease that the physicians call hyposphagma—which is a suffusion of blood under the skin—see all things red and bloody. What do we know but that these humours, which thus alter the operations of sight, predominate in beasts, and are usual with them? for we see some whose eyes are yellow, like us who have the jaundice; and others of a bloody colour; 'tis likely that the colours of objects seem other to them than to us. Which of the two shall make a right judgment? for it is not said that the essence of things has a relation to man only; hardness, whiteness, depth, and sharpness, have reference to the service and knowledge of animals as well as to us, and nature has equally designed them for their use. When we press down the eye, the body that we look upon we perceive to be longer and more extended;—many beasts have their eyes so pressed down; this length, therefore, is perhaps the true form of that body, and not that which our eyes give it in the usual state. If we close the lower part of the eye things appear double to us:—

               Bina lucemarum fiorentia lumina flammis...
         Et duplices hominum facis, et corpora bina.

              ""One lamp seems double, and the men appear
         Each on two bodies double heads to bear.""
If our ears be hindered, or the passage stopped with any thing, we receive the sound quite otherwise than we usually do; animals, likewise, who have either the ears hairy, or but a very little hole instead of an ear, do not, consequently, hear as we do, but receive another kind of sound. We see at festivals and theatres that, opposing a painted glass of a certain colour to the light of the flambeaux, all things in the place appear to us green, yellow, or violet:—

              Et vulgo faciunt id lutea russaque vela,
         Et ferrugina, cum, magnis intenta theatris,
         Per malos vulgata trabesque, trementia pendent;
         Namque ibi consessum caveai subter, et omnem
         Scenai speciem, patrum, matrumque, deorumque
         Inficiunt, coguntque suo volitare colore:

              ""Thus when pale curtains, or the deeper red,
         O'er all the spacious theatre are spread,
         Which mighty masts and sturdy pillars bear,
         And the loose curtains wanton in the air;
         Whole streams of colours from the summit flow,
         The rays divide them in their passage through,
         And stain the scenes, and men, and gods below:""
'tis likely that the eyes of animals, which we see to be of divers colours, produce the appearance of bodies the same with their eyes.

We should, therefore, to make a right judgment of the oppositions of the senses, be first agreed with beasts, and secondly amongst ourselves; which we by no means are, but enter into dispute every time that one hears, sees, or tastes something otherwise than another does, and contests, as much as upon any other thing, about the diversity of the images that the senses represent to us. A child, by the ordinary rule of nature, hears, sees, and talks otherwise than a man of thirty years old; and he than one of threescore. The senses are, in some, more obscure and dusky, and more open and quick in others. We receive things variously, according as we are, and according as they appear to us. Those rings which are cut out in the form of feathers, which are called endless feathers, no eye can discern their size, or can keep itself from the deception that on one side they enlarge, and on the other contract, and come So a point, even when the ring is being turned round the finger; yet, when you feel them, they seem all of an equal size. Now, our perception being so uncertain and so controverted, it is no more a wonder if we are told that we may declare that snow appears white to us; but that to affirm that it is in its own essence really so is more than we are able to justify; and, this foundation being shaken, all the knowledge in the world must of necessity fall to ruin. What! do our senses themselves hinder one another? A picture seems raised and embossed to the sight; in the handling it seems flat to the touch. Shall we say that musk, which delights the smell, and is offensive to the taste, is agreeable or no? There are herbs and unguents proper for one part o the body, that are hurtful to another; honey is pleasant to the taste, but offensive to the sight. They who, to assist their lust, used in ancient times to make use of magnifying-glasses to represent the members they were to employ bigger, by that ocular tumidity to please themselves the more; to which of their senses did they give the prize,—whether to the sight, that represented the members as large and great as they would desire, or to the feeling, which represented them little and contemptible? Are they our senses that supply the subject with these different conditions, and have the subjects themselves, nevertheless, but one? As we see in the bread we eat, it is nothing but bread, but, by being eaten, it becomes bones, blood, flesh, hair; and nails:—

                Ut cibus in membra atque artus cum diditur omnes,
        Disperit,, atque aliam naturam sufficit ex se;

                ""As meats, diffus'd through all the members, lose
        Their former state, and different things compose;""
the humidity sucked up by the root of a tree becomes trunk, leaf, and fruit; and the air, being but one, is modulated, in a trumpet, to a thousand sorts of sounds; are they our senses, I would fain know, that, in like manner, form these subjects into so many divers qualities, or have they them really such in themselves? And upon this doubt what can we determine of their true essence? Moreover, since the accidents of disease, of raving, or sleep, make things appear otherwise to us than they do to the healthful, the wise, and those that are awake, is it not likely that our right posture of health and understanding, and our natural humours, have, also, wherewith to give a being to things that have a relation to their own condition, and accommodate them to themselves, as well as when they are disordered;—that health is as capable of giving them an aspect as sickness? Why has not the temperate a certain form of objects relative to it, as well as the intemperate? and why may it not as well stamp it with its own character as the other? He whose mouth is out of taste, says the wine is flat; the healthful man commends its flavour, and the thirsty its briskness. Now, our condition always accommodating things to itself, and transforming them according to its own posture, we cannot know what things truly are in themselves, seeing that nothing comes to us but what is falsified and altered by the senses. Where the compass, the square, and the rule, are crooked, all propositions drawn thence, and all buildings erected by those guides, must, of necessity, be also defective; the uncertainty of our senses renders every thing uncertain that they produce:—

                 Denique ut in fabric, si prava est rgula prima,
         Normaque si fallax rectis regionibus exit,
         Et libella aliqu si ex parte claudicat hilum;
        Omnia mendose fieri, atque obstipa necessum est,
        Prava, cubantia, prona, supina, atque absona tecta;
        Jam ruere ut qudam videantux'velle, ruantque
        Prodita judiciis fallacibus omnia primis;
        Sic igitur ratio tibi reram prava necesse est,
        Falsaque sit, falsis qucunque ab sensibus orta est.

                ""But lastly, as in building, if the line
        Be not exact and straight, the rule decline,
        Or level false, how vain is the design!
        Uneven, an ill-shap'd and tottering wall
        Must rise; this part must sink, that part must fall,
        Because the rules were false that fashion'd all;
        Thus reason's rules are false if all commence
        And rise from failing and from erring sense.""
As to what remains, who can be fit to judge of and to determine those differences? As we say in controversies of religion that we must have a judge neither inclining to the one side nor the other, free from all choice and affection, which cannot be amongst Christians, just so it falls out in this; for if he be old he cannot judge of the sense of old age, being himself a party in the case; if young, there is the same exception; if healthful, sick, asleep, or awake, he is still the same incompetent judge. We must have some one exempt from all these propositions, as of things indifferent to him; and by this rule we must have a judge that never was.

To judge of the appearances that we receive of subjects, we ought t have a deciding instrument; to verify this instrument we must have demonstration; to verify this demonstration an instrument; and here we are round again upon the wheel, and no further advanced. Seeing the senses cannot determine our dispute, being full of uncertainty themselves, it must then be reason that must do it; but no reason can be erected upon any other foundation than that of another reason; and so we run back to all infinity. Our fancy does not apply itself to things that are strange, but is conceived by the mediation of the senses; and the senses do not comprehend a foreign subject, but only their own passions; by which means fancy and appearance are no part of the subject, but only of the passion and sufferance of sense; which passion and subject are different things; wherefore whoever judges by appearances judges by another thing than the subject. And to say that the passions of the senses convey to the soul the quality of foreign subjects by resemblance, how can the soul and understanding be assured of this resemblance, having of itself no commerce with foreign subjects? As they who never knew Socrates cannot, when they see his picture, say it is like him. Now, whoever would, notwithstanding, judge by appearances, if it be by all, it is impossible, because they hinder one another by their contrarieties and discrepancies, as we by experience see: shall some select appearances govern the rest? you must verify this select by another select, the second by a third, and thus there will never be any end to it. Finally, there is no constant existence, neither of the objects' being nor our own; both we, and our judgments, and all mortal things, are evermore incessantly running and rolling; and consequently nothing certain can be established from the one to the other, both the judging and the judged being in a continual motion and mutation.

We have no communication with being, by reason that all human nature is always in the middle, betwixt being bom and dying, giving but an obscure appearance and shadow, a weak and uncertain opinion of itself; and if, perhaps, you fix your thought to apprehend your being, it would be but like grasping water; for the more you clutch your hand to squeeze and hold what is in its own nature flowing, so much more you lose of what you would grasp and hold. So, seeing that all things are subject to pass from one change to another, reason, that there looks for a real substance, finds itself deceived, not being able to apprehend any thing that is subsistent and permanent, because that every thing is either entering into being, and is not yet arrived at it, or begins to die before it is bom. Plato said, that bodies had never any existence, but only birth; conceiving that Homer had made the Ocean and Thetis father and mother of the gods, to show us that all things are in a perpetual fluctuation, motion, and variation; the opinion of all the philosophers, as he says, before his time, Parmenides only excepted, who would not allow things to have motion, on the power whereof he sets a mighty value. Pythagoras was of opinion that all matter was flowing and unstable; the Stoics, that there is no time present, and that what we call so is nothing but the juncture and meeting of the future and the past; Heraclitus, that never any man entered twice into the same river; Epichar-mus, that he who borrowed money but an hour ago does not owe it now; and that he who was invited over-night to come the next day to dinner comes nevertheless uninvited, considering that they are no more the same men, but are become others; and that there could not a mortal substance be found twice in the same condition; for, by the suddenness and quickness of the change, it one while disperses, and another reunites; it comes and goes after such a manner that what begins to be born never arrives to the perfection of being, forasmuch as that birth is never finished and never stays, as being at an end, but from the seed is evermore changing and shifting one to another; as human seed is first in the mother's womb made a formless embryo, after delivered thence a sucking infant, afterwards it becomes a boy, then a youth, then a man, and at last a decrepit old man; so that age and subsequent generation is always destroying and spoiling that which went before:—

             Mutt enira mundi naturam totius tas,
        Ex alioque alius status excipere omnia debet;
        Nec manet ulla sui similis res; omnia migrant,
        Omnia commutt natura, et vertere cogit.

            ""For time the nature of the world translates,
        And from preceding gives all things new states;
        Nought like itself remains, but all do range,
        And nature forces every thing to change.""
""And yet we foolishly fear one kind of death, whereas we have already passed, and do daily pass, so many others; for not only, as Heraclitus said, the death of fire is generation of air, and the death of air generation of water; but, moreover, we may more manifestly discern it in ourselves; manhood dies, and passes away when age comes on; and youth is terminated in the flower of age of a full-grown man, infancy in youth, and the first age dies in infancy; yesterday died in to-day, and to-day will die in to-morrow; and there is nothing that remains in the same state, or that is always the same thing. And that it is so let this be the proof; if we are always one and the same, how comes it to pass that we are now pleased with one thing, and by and by with another? How comes it to pass that we love or hate contrary things, that we praise or condemn them? How comes it to pass that we have different affections, and no more retain the same sentiment in the same thought? For it is not likely that without mutation we should assume other passions; and, that which suffers mutation does not remain the same, and if it be not the same it is not at all; but the same that the being is does, like it, unknowingly change and alter; becoming evermore another from another thing; and consequently the natural senses abuse and deceive themselves, taking that which seems for that which is, for want of well knowing what that which is, is. But what is it then that truly is? That which is eternal; that is to say, that never had beginning, nor never shall have ending, and to which time can bring no mutation. For time is a mobile thine, and that appears as in a shadow, with a matter evermore flowing and running, without ever remaining stable and permanent; and to which belong those words, before and after, has been, or shall be: which at the first sight, evidently show that it is not a thing that is; for it were a great folly, and a manifest falsity, to say that that is which is not et being, or that has already ceased to be. And as to these words, present, instant, and now, by which it seems that we principally support and found the intelligence of time, reason, discovering, does presently destroy it; for it immediately divides and splits it into the future and past, being of necessity to consider it divided in two. The same happens to nature, that is measured, as to time that measures it; for she has nothing more subsisting and permanent than the other, but all things are either born, bearing, or dying. So that it were sinful to say of God, who is he only who is, that he was, or that he shall be ; for those are terms of declension, transmutation, and vicissitude, of what cannot continue or remain in being; wherefore we are to conclude that God alone is, not according to any measure of time, but according to an immutable and an immovable eternity, not measured by time, nor subject to any declension; before whom nothing was, and after whom nothing shall be, either more new or more recent, but a real being, that with one sole now fills the for ever, and that there is nothing that truly is but he alone; without our being able to say, he has been, or shall be; without beginning, and without end."" To this so religious conclusion of a pagan I shall only add this testimony of one of the same condition, for the close of this long and tedious discourse, which would furnish me with endless matter: ""What a vile and abject thing,"" says he, ""is man, if he do not raise himself above humanity!"" 'Tis a good word and a profitable desire, but withal absurd; for to make the handle bigger than the hand, the cubic longer than the arm, and to hope to stride further than our legs can reach, is both impossible and monstrous; or that man should rise above himself and humanity; for he cannot see but with his eyes, nor seize but with his hold. He shall be exalted, if God will lend him an extraordinary hand; he shall exalt himself, by abandoning and renouncing his own proper means, and by suffering himself to be raised and elevated by means purely celestial. It belongs to our Christian faith, and not to the stoical virtue, to pretend to that divine and miraculous metamorphosis.",[],0,Michel de Montaigne,A'me Lorain,1990,"[94, 79, 56, 39, 19, 9, 10, 13, 13, 15, 23, 26, 33, 36, 39, 50, 58, 67, 72, 79]",20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0

Wandering around and you feel lost

We're at a cross road..
I get your point
We're better friends than lovers
Okay, I get it, I got it, I guess that we're moving on
And if I had a chance, I'd do it all over
Okay, I get it, I got it, I guess that we're moving on
You got in my heart, you got in my head
And I believe everything that you said
We're at a cross road..(x3)
I guess that we're moving on..
You and me, we disagree
I'm growing young and you're maturing
You see things in black and white
It's not my fault you're colorblind
You finally followed through with the things you told me you'd do
You're leaving me in Dallas, headed off to somewhere new
Just like you..
No matter what you do
I'll still feel the same about you..
We're at a cross road..
I get your point
We're better friends than lovers
Okay, I get it, I got it, I guess that we're moving on

[Ya Kid K]
(Verse 1)
Dope, def, any term is alright
When your DJ plays the K
You will listen to what the Kid has to say
Cause you know it's too damn straight
Can't wait
Gotta get on down before it's too late
And even if so it would be
My friend, just tell 'em to play it again
See, once it starts to beat your eardrum
It goes way up to your head
Bounces down your belly and back
If you hunger, you'll be fed
It's all up to the individual
This reaction is typical
Somehow you get to catch up with that beat
Snap them fingers, stomp your feet

Refrain: Ya Kid K
For real legit, you feel it
I'm talking 'bout the real deal
I'm a make ya feel
Yo DJ
Spin that wheel

[Ya Kid K] Spin that wheel

(Verse 2)
Hi Tek 3 know what's up
They're hip and they're hot, so turn it up (Come on)
All you long for wrapped up in one pack
When it stops, you're gon' put it back
On this trip, I'm your hostess
Providin' anything you request
Startin' from your hair to your toenails
I know how to treat a guest
Take it from me, it's a must
Come to the kid so I can bust this
Like it should be done
Ya Kid K is the one

Hook: Ya Kid K
Turn it up, let it spin
Turn it over, let it spin
Turn it up, let it spin
Turn it over, let it spin

Still nervous like a school boy

What's going on down on the planet
What's going on inside your pretty head
What's life without a Mercedes
And the need to feel adrenaline rush

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it better than moonlight on water
Is it better than sex on the beach
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us it's not out of reach

[Chorus]
I'm here for you (Moonlight on water)
No matter where you go no matter what you do
I'm here for you (Moonlight on water)
When there's a lonely night who can you hold on to
I'm here for you
Want you in my arms uncomplicated
I am for you, I am

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna be the competition?
Who's next in line for promotion, baby?
Everyday the real world is fading
Spinning out on the wheel of fortune but

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it better than moonlight on water?
Is it better than sex on the beach?
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us it's not out of reach, babe

No matter where you go no matter what you do
I'm here for you (Moonlight on water)
When there's a lonely night who can you hold on to
I'm here for you
Want you in my arms uncomplicated
I am for you, I am

[Bridge]
You've been working so hard
Don't you know it, baby?
You don't understand what I want from you
Instead of dreamin' 'bout all that money
We got such simpler things to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Like moonlight on water
Like sex on the beach
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us it's not out of reach, babe

[Chorus]
I'm here for you (Moonlight on water)
No matter where you go no matter what you do
I'm here for you (Moonlight on water)
When there's a lonely night who can you hold on to
I'm here for you
Want you in my arms uncomplicated
I am for you, (Moonlight on water) I am

You know I never meant to see you again
But I only passed by as a friend, yeah
All this time I stayed out of sight
I started wondering why

Ooh, yes I wish it would rain... rain down on me now
Ooh, now I wish it would rain down... down on me
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain on me

Oh, I guess you were right, yeah
Ooh, I never meant to cause you no pain
But it looks like I did it again

Ooh, yes I wish it would rain... rain down on me now
Ooh, but I wish it would rain down... down on me
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain on me

[Bridge]
Though your hurt is gone, mine's hanging on inside
And I know... it's eating me through, it's eating me through every night and day
I'm just waiting on your sign
'Cause I know, I know... I never meant to cause you no pain
And I realize I let you down
But I know in my heart of hearts
I know I'm never gonna hold you again

[Chorus]
Now I... now I know I wish it would rain down... down on me
Ooh, you know I wish it would rain... rain down on me now
Ooh, yes I wish it would rain down... down on me
Yes, you know I wish it would rain down.. rain down over me

You've got a right to speak your mind
You've gotta take a stand

No one has the right to say
This is right or that is wrong
It isn't just one way

Find common ground
Go in between
Things aren't always what they seem

Someday it'll be alright
Changes happen overnight

People, let's give each other room
If we're gonna work it out
We better make it soon

Love is, love is such a common word
When it's pride we mistake for love
Isn't that absurd

Why always take the upper hand
It's better to understand

Someday it'll be alright
Changes happen overnight

I believe in love but with no conditions

And giving in sometimes doesn't make it submission

Hate is so common It's almost tradition

After dreams of distant signs
You pour yourself over me
Like the sun through the blinds
You lift me up and get me out
Keep me walking but never shout
Hold the secret close, I hear you say
(Here we go)

You know the way, it throws about
It takes you in and spits you out
It spits you out when you desire
To conquer it, to feel you're higher
To follow it you must be clean
With mistakes that you do mean
Move the heart and switch the pace
Look for what seems out of place

On and on it goes
Calling like a distant wind
Oh, through the zero hour we'll walk
We'll cut the thick and break the thin
No sound to break, no moment clear
When all the doubts are crystal clear
Crashing hard into the secret wind

You know the way, it twists and turns
Changing colour, spinning yarns
You know the way, it leaves you dry
It cuts you up and takes you high
You know the way, it's painted gold
Is it honey? Is it cold?
You know the way, it throws about
It takes you in and spits you out

(Oh...) Cuts you up
(Oh...) Cuts you up

Look for what seems out of place

It's OK, it goes this way
The line it twists, it twists away
Cuts you up and spits you out

308,308,Opposites Attract,"Tale Of Kamar Al Zaman

That there was in times of yore and in ages long gone before a King called Shahrimán,[FN#220] who was lord of many troops and guards, and officers, and who reigned over certain islands, known as the Khálidán Islands,[FN#221] on the borders of the land of the Persians. But he was stricken in years and his bones were wasted, without having been blessed with a son, albeit he had four wives, daughters of Kings, and threescore concubines, with each of whom he was wont to lie one night in turn.[FN#222] This preyed upon his mind and disquieted him, so that he complained thereof to one of his Wazirs, saying, ""Verily I fear lest my kingdom be lost when I die, for that I have no son to succeed me."" The Minister answered, ""O King, peradventure Allah shall yet bring something to pass; so rely upon the Almighty and be instant in prayer. It is also my counsel that thou spread a banquet and invite to it the poor and needy, and let them eat of thy food; and supplicate the Lord to vouchsafe thee a son; for perchance there may be among thy guests a righteous soul whose prayers find acceptance; and thereby thou shalt win thy wish."" So the King rose, made the lesser ablution, and prayed a two-bow prayer,[FN#223] then he cried upon Allah with pure intention; after which he called his chief wife to bed and lay with her forthright. By grace of God she conceived and, when her months were accomplished, she bore a male child, like the moon on the night of fulness. The King named him Kamar al-Zamán,[FN#224] and rejoiced in him with extreme joy and bade the city be dressed out in his honour; so they decorated the streets seven days, whilst the drums beat and the messengers bore the glad tidings abroad. Then wet and dry nurses were provided for the boy and he was reared in splendour and delight, until he reached the age of fifteen. He grew up of surpassing beauty and seemlihead and symmetry, and his father loved him so dear that he could not brook to be parted from him day or night. One day he complained to a certain of his Ministers anent the excess of his love for his only child, saying, ""O thou the Wazir, of a truth I fear for my son, Kamar al-Zaman, the shifts and accidents which befal man and fain would I marry him in my life-time."" Answered the Wazir, ""O King, know thou that marriage is one of the most honourable of moral actions, and thou wouldst indeed do well and right to marry thy son in thy lifetime, ere thou make him Sultan."" On this quoth the King, ""Hither with my son Kamar al-Zaman;"" so he came and bowed his head to the ground in modesty before his sire. ""O Kamar al Zaman,"" said King Shahriman, ""of a truth I desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee during my lifetime."" Replied he, ""O my father, know that I have no lust to marry nor cloth my soul incline to women; for that concerning their craft and perfidy I have read many books and heard much talk, even as saith the poet,

'Now, an of women ask ye, I reply:—*
             In their affairs I'm versed a doctor rare!
When man's head grizzles and his money dwindles, *
             In their affections he hath naught for share.'

And another said:—

'Rebel against women and so shalt thou serve Allah the more; *
             The youth who gives women the rein must forfeit all hope to
             soar.
They'll baulk him when seeking the strange device, Excelsior, *
             Tho' waste he a thousand of years in the study of science
             and lore.' ""

And when he had ended his verses he continued, ""O my father, wedlock is a thing whereto I will never consent; no, not though I drink the cup of death."" When Sultan Shahriman heard these words from his son, light became darkness in his sight and he grieved thereat with great grief.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Seventy-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Shahriman heard these words from his son, the light became darkness in his sight and he grieved over his son's lack of obedience to his directions in the matter of marriage; yet, for the great love he bore him, he was unwilling to repeat his wishes and was not wroth with him, but caressed him and spake him fair and showed him all manner of kindness such as tendeth to induce affection. All this, and Kamar al-Zaman increased daily in beauty and loveliness and amorous grace; and the King bore with him for a whole year till he became perfect in eloquence and elegant wit. All men were ravished with his charms; and every breeze that blew bore the tidings of his gracious favour; his fair sight was a seduction to the loving and a garden of delight to the longing, for he was honey-sweet of speech and the sheen of his face shamed the full moon; he was a model of symmetry and blandishment and engaging ways; his shape was as the willow-wand or the rattan- cane and his cheeks might take the place of rose or red anemone. He was, in fine the pink of perfection, even as the poet hath said of him,

""He came and cried they, 'Now be Allah blest! *
             Praise Him that clad that soul in so fair vest!'
He's King of Beauty where the beauteous be; *
             All are his Ryots,[FN#225] all obey his hest:
His lip-dew's sweeter than the virgin honey; *
             His teeth are pearls in double row close press:
All charms are congregate in him alone, *
             And deals his loveliness to man unrest.
Beauty wrote on those cheeks for worlds to see *
             'I testify there is none good but He.'""[FN#226]

When the year came to an end, the King called his son to him and said, ""O my son, wilt thou not hearken to me?"" Whereupon Kamar al-Zaman fell down for respect and shame before his sire and replied, ""O my father, how should I not hearken to thee, seeing that Allah commandeth me to obey thee and not gain-say thee?"" Rejoined King Shahriman, ""O my son, know that I desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee whilst yet I live, and make thee King over my realm, before my death."" When the Prince heard his sire pronounce these words he bowed his head awhile, then raised it and said, ""O my father, this is a thing which I will never do; no, not though I drink the cup of death! I know of a surety that the Almighty hath made obedience to thee a duty in religion; but, Allah upon thee! press me not in this matter of marriage, nor fancy that I will ever marry my life long; for that I have read the books both of the ancients and the moderns, and have come to know all the mischiefs and miseries which have befallen them through women and their endless artifices. And how excellent is the saying of the poet,

'He whom the randy motts entrap *
             Shall never see deliverance!
Though build he forts a thousand-fold, *
             Whose mighty strength lead-plates enhance,[FN#227]
Their force shall be of no avail; *
             These fortresses have not a chance!
Women aye deal in treachery *
             To far and near o'er earth's expanse
With fingers dipt in Henna-blood *
             And locks in braids that mad the glance;
And eyelids painted o'er with Kohl *
          They gar us drink of dire mischance.'

And how excellently saith another,

'Women, for all the chastity they claim, *
             Are offal cast by kites where'er they list:
This night their talk and secret charms are shine, *
             That night another joyeth calf and wrist:
Like inn, whence after night thou far'st at dawn, *
             And lodges other wight thou hast not wist.'""[FN#228]

Now when King Shahriman heard these his son's words and learnt the import of his verses and poetical quotations, he made no answer, of his excessive love for him, but redoubled in graciousness and kindness to him. He at once broke up the audience and, as soon as the seance was over, he summoned his Minister and taking him apart, said to him, ""O thou the Wazir! tell me how I shall deal with my son in the matter of marriage.""- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted stay.
When it was the One Hundred and Seventy-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King summoned his Minister; and, taking him apart, said to him, ""O thou the Wazir, tell me what I shall do with my son in the matter of marriage. Of a truth I took counsel with thee thereon and thou didst counsel me to marry him, before making him King. I have spoken with him of wedlock time after time and he still gainsaid me; so do thou, O Wazir, forthright advise me what to do."" Answered the Minister, ""O King, wait another year and, if after that thou be minded to speak to him on the matter of marriage, speak not to him privily, but address him on a day of state, when all the Emirs and Wazirs are present with the whole of the army standing before thee. And when all are in crowd then send for thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and summon him; and, when he cometh, broach to him the matter of marriage before the Wazirs and Grandees and Officers of state and Captains; for he will surely be bashful and daunted by their presence and will not dare to oppose thy will."" Now when King Shahriman heard his Wazir's words, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, seeing success in the project, and bestowed on him a splendid robe of honour. Then he took patience with his son another year, whilst, with every day that passed over him, Kamar al-Zaman increased in beauty and loveliness, and elegance and perfect grace, till he was nigh twenty years old. Indeed Allah had clad him in the cloak of comeliness and had crowned him with the crown of completion: his eye-glance was more bewitching than Hárút and Marút[FN#229] and the play of his luring looks more misleading than Tághút;[FN#230] and his cheeks shone like the dawn rosy-red and his eyelashes stormed the keen-edged blade: the whiteness of his brow resembled the moon shining bright, and the blackness of his locks was as the murky night; and his waist was more slender than the gossamer[FN#231] and his back parts than two sand heaps bulkier, making a Babel of the heart with their softness; but his waist complained of the weight of his hips and loins; and his charms ravished all mankind, even as one of the poets saith in these couplets,
""By his eyelash tendril curled, by his slender waist I swear,
By the dart his witchery feathers, fatal hurtling through the
           air;
By the just roundness of his shape, by his glances bright and
           keen
By the swart limping of his locks, and his fair forehead shining
            sheen;
By his eyebrows which deny that she who looks on them should
            sleep,
Which now commanding, now forbidding, o'er me high dominion keep;
By the roses of his cheek, his face as fresh as myrtle wreath
His tulip lips, and those pure pearls that hold the places of his
             teeth;
By his noble form, which rises featly turned in even swell
To where upon his jutting chest two young pomegranates seem to
           dwell
By his supple moving hips, his taper waist, the silky skin,
By all he robbed Perfection of, and holds enchained his form
             within;
By his tongue of steadfastness, his nature true, and excellent,
By the greatness of his rank, his noble birth, and high descent,
Musk from my love her savour steals, who musk exhales from every
             limb
And all the airs ambergris breathes are but the Zephyr's blow
             o'er him.
The sun, methinks, the broad bright sun, as low before my love
             should quail
As would my love himself transcend the paltry paring of his
             nail!""[FN#232]

So King Shahriman, having accepted the counsel of his Wazir, waited for another year and a great festival,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Seventy-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shahriman having accepted the counsel of his Wazir, waited for another year and a great festival, a day of state when the audience hall was filled with his Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of his reign and Officers of State and Captains of might and main. Thereupon he sent for his son Kamar al-Zaman who came, and kissing the ground before him three times, stood in presence of his sire with his hands behind his back the right grasping the left.[FN#233] Then said the King to him, ""Know O my son, that I have not sent for thee on this occasion and summoned thee to appear before this assembly and all these officers of estate here awaiting our orders save and except that I may lay a commandment on thee, wherein do thou not disobey me; and my commandment is that thou marry, for I am minded to wed thee to a King's daughter and rejoice in thee ere I die."" When the Prince heard this much from his royal sire, he bowed his head groundwards awhile, then raising it towards his father and being moved thereto at that time by youthful folly and boyish ignorance, replied, ""But for myself I will never marry; no, not though I drink the cup of death! As for thee, thou art great in age and small of wit: hast thou not, twice ere this day and before this occasion, questioned me of the matter of marriage and I refused my consent? Indeed thou dotest and are not fit to govern a flock of sheep!"" So saying Kamar al-Zaman unclasped his hands from behind his back and tucked up his sleeves above his elbows before his father, being in a fit of fury; moreover, he added many words to his sire, knowing not what he said in the trouble of his spirits. The King was confounded and ashamed, for that this befel in the presence of his grandees and soldier-officers assembled on a high festival and a state occasion; but presently the majesty of Kingship took him, and he cried out at his son and made him tremble. Then he called to the guards standing before him and said, ""Seize him!' So they came forward and laid hands on him and, binding him, brought him before his sire, who bade them pinion his elbows behind his back and in this guise make him stand before the presence. And the Prince bowed down his head for fear and apprehension, and his brow and face were beaded and spangled with sweat; and shame and confusion troubled him sorely. Thereupon his father abused him and reviled him and cried, ""Woe to thee, thou son of adultery and nursling of abomination![FN#234] How durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers? But hitherto none hath chastised thee,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.


When it was the One Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Shahriman cried out to his son Kamar al-Zaman, ""How durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers? But hitherto none hath chastised thee. Knowest thou not that this deed thou hast done were a disgrace to him had it been done by the meanest of my subjects?"" And the King commanded his Mamelukes to loose his elbow bonds and imprison him in one of the bastions of the citadel. So they took the Prince and thrust him into an old tower, wherein there was a dilapidated saloon and in its middle a ruined well, after having first swept it and cleansed its floor-flags and set therein a couch on which they laid a mattress, a leathern rug and a cushion; and then they brought a great lanthorn and a wax candle, for that place was dark, even by day. And lastly the Mamelukes led Kamar al-Zaman thither, and stationed an eunuch at the door. And when all this was done, the Prince threw himself on the couch, sad-spirited, and heavy- hearted; blaming himself and repenting of his injurious conduct to his father, whenas repentance availed him naught, and saying, ""Allah curse marriage and marriageable and married women, the traitresses all! Would I had hearkened to my father and accepted a wife! Had I so done it had been better for me than this jail."" This is how it fared with him; but as regards King Shahri man, he remained seated on his throne all through the day until sundown; then he took the Minister apart and said to him ""Know thou, O Wazir, that thou and thou only west the cause of all this that hath come to pass between me and my son by the advice thou west pleased to devise; and so what dost thou counsel me to do now?"" Answered he, ""O King, leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days: then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed; and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir, said to King Shahriman, ""Leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days; then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed; and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again."" The King accepted the Wazir's opinion and lay down to sleep that night troubled at heart concerning his son; for he loved him with dearest love because he had no other child but this; and it was his wont every night not to sleep, save after placing his arm under his son's neck. So he passed that night in trouble and unease on the Prince 's account, tossing from side to side, as he were laid on coals of Artemisia-wood[FN#235]: for he was overcome with doubts and fears and sleep visited him not all that livelong night; but his eyes ran over with tears and he began repeating, ;

""While slanderers slumber, longsome is my night; *
             Suffice thee a heart so sad in parting-plight;
I say, while night in care slow moments by, *
             'What! no return for thee, fair morning light?'""

And the saying of another,

""When saw I Pleiad-stars his glance escape *
             And Pole star draught of sleep upon him pour;
And the Bier-daughters[FN#236] wend in mourning dight, *
             I knew that morning was for him no more!""

Such was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Kamar al- Zaman, when the night came upon him the eunuch set the lanthorn before him and lighting the wax-candle, placed it in the candlestick; then brought him somewhat of food. The Prince ate a little and continually reproached himself for his unseemly treatment of his father, saying to himself, ""O my soul, knowest thou not that a son of Adam is the hostage of his tongue, and that a man's tongue is what casteth him into deadly perils?"" Then his eyes ran over with tears and he bewailed that which he had done, from anguished vitals and aching heart, repenting him with exceeding repentance of the wrong wherewith he had wronged his father and repeating,

""Fair youth shall die by stumbling of the tongue: *
             Stumble of foot works not man's life such wrong:
The slip of lip shall oft smite off the head, *
             While slip of foot shall never harm one long.""

Now when he had made an end of eating, he asked for the wherewithal to wash his hands and when the Mameluke had washed them clean of the remnants of food, he arose and made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the prayers of sundown and nightfall, conjoining them in one; after which he sat down.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Prince Kamar al-Zaman had prayed (conjoining them in one) the prayers of sundown and nightfall, he sat down on the well and began reciting the Koran, and he repeated ""The Cow,"" the ""House of Imrán,"" and ""Y. S.;"" ""The Compassionate,"" ""Blessed be the King,"" ""Unity"" and ""The two Talismans''[FN#237]; and he ended with blessing and supplication and with saying, ""I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the stoned.""[FN#238] Then he lay down upon his couch which was covered with a mattress of satin from al- Ma'adin town, the same on both sides and stuffed with the raw silk of Irak; and under his head was a pillow filled with ostrich-down And when ready for sleep, he doffed his outer clothes and drew off his bag-trousers and lay down in a shirt of delicate stuff smooth as wax; and he donned a head-kerchief of azure Marázi[FN#239] cloth; and at such time and on this guise Kamar al-Zaman was like the full-orbed moon, when it riseth on its fourteenth night. Then, drawing over his head a coverlet of silk, he fell asleep with the lanthorn burning at his feet and the wax-candle over his head, and he ceased not sleeping through the first third of the night, not knowing what lurked for him in the womb of the Future, and what the Omniscient had decreed for him. Now, as Fate and Fortune would have it, both tower and saloon were old and had been many years deserted; and there was therein a Roman well inhabited by a Jinniyah of the seed of Iblis[FN#240] the Accursed, by name Maymúnah, daughter of Al- Dimiryát, a renowned King of the Jánn.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the name of the Jinniyah in question was Maymunah, daughter of Al-Dimiryat; a renowned King of the Jann. And as Kamar al-Zaman continued sleeping till the first third of the night, Maymunah came up out of the Roman well and made for the firmament, thinking to listen by stealth to the converse of the angels; but when she reached the mouth of the well, she saw a light shining in the tower, contrary to custom; and having dwelt there many years without seeing the like, she said to herself, ""Never have I witnessed aught like this""; and, marvelling much at the matter, determined that there must be some cause therefor. So she made for the light and found the eunuch sleeping within the door; and inside she saw a couch spread, whereon was a human form with the wax-candle burning at his head and the lanthorn at his feet, and she wondered to see the light and stole towards it little by little. Then she folded her wings and stood by the bed and, drawing back the coverlid, discovered Kamar al-Zaman's face. She was motionless for a full hour in admiration and wonderment; for the lustre of his visage outshone that of the candle; his face beamed like a pearl with light; his eyelids were languorous like those of the gazelle; the pupils of his eyes were intensely black and brilliant[FN#241]; his cheeks were rosy red; his eye-brows were arched like bows and his breath exhaled a scent of musk, even as saith of him the poet,

""I kissed him: darker grew those pupils,[FN#242] which *
             Seduce my soul, and cheeks flushed rosier hue;
O heart, if slanderers dare to deem there be *
             His like in chasms, Say 'Bring him hither, you!' ""

Now when Maymunah saw him, she pronounced the formula of praise,[FN#243] and said, ""Blessed be Allah, the best of Creators!""; for she was of the true-believing Jinn; and she stood awhile gazing on his face, exclaiming and envying the youth his beauty and loveliness. And she said in herself, ""By Allah! I will do no hurt to him nor let any harm him; nay, from all of evil will I ransom him, for this fair face deserveth not but that folk should gaze upon it and for it praise the Lord. Yet how could his family find it in their hearts to leave him in such desert place where, if one of our Márids came upon him at this hour, he would assuredly slay him."" Then the Ifritah Maymunah bent over him and kissed him between the eyes, and presently drew back the sheet over his face which she covered up; and after this she spread her wings and soaring into the air, flew upwards. And after rising high from the circle of the saloon she ceased not winging her way through air and ascending skywards till she drew near the heaven of this world, the lowest of the heavens. And behold, she heard the noisy flapping of wings cleaving the welkin and, directing herself by the sound, she found when she drew near it that the noise came from an Ifrit called Dahnash. So she swooped down on him like a sparrow-hawk and, when he was aware of her and knew her to be Maymunah, the daughter of the King of the Jinn, he feared her and his side-muscles quivered; and he implored her forbearance, saying, I conjure thee by the Most Great and August Name and by the most noble talisman graven upon the seal-ring of Solomon, entreat me kindly and harm me not!"" When she heard these words her heart inclined to him and she said, ""Verily, thou conjurest me, O accursed, with a mighty conjuration. Nevertheless, I will not let thee go, till thou tell me whence thou comest at this hour."" He replied, ""O Princess, Know that I come from the uttermost end of China-land and from among the Islands, and I will tell thee of a wonderful thing I have seen this night. If thou kind my words true, let me wend my way and write me a patent under thy hand and with thy sign manual that I am thy freedman, so none of the Jinn-hosts, whether of the upper who fly or of the lower who walk the earth or of those who dive beneath the waters, do me let or hindrance."" Rejoined Maymunah, ""And what is it thou hast seen this night, O liar, O accursed! Tell me without leasing and think not to escape from my hand with falses, for I swear to thee by the letters graven upon the bezel of the seal-ring of Solomon David son (on both of whom be peace!), except thy speech be true, I will pluck out thy feathers with mine own hand and strip off thy skin and break thy bones!"" Quoth the Ifrit Dahnash son of Shamhúrish[FN#244] the Flyer, ""I accept, O my lady, these conditions.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Seventy-eight Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash spoke thus to Maymunah, ""I accept, O my lady, these conditions."" Then he resumed, ""Know, O my mistress, that I come to-night from the Islands of the Inland Sea in the parts of China, which are the realms of King Ghayúr, lord of the Islands and the Seas and the Seven Palaces. There I saw a daughter of his, than whom Allah hath made none fairer in her time: I cannot picture her to thee, for my tongue would fail to describe her with her due of praise; but I will name to thee a somewhat of her charms by way of approach. Now her hair is like the nights of disunion and separation and her face like the days of union and delectation; and right well hath the poet said when picturing her,

'She dispread the locks from her head one night, *
             Showing four fold nights into one night run
And she turned her visage towards the moon, *
             And two moons showed at moment one.'

She hath a nose like the edge of the burnished blade and cheeks like purple wine or anemones blood-red: her lips as coral and carnelian shine and the water of her mouth is sweeter than old wine; its taste would quench Hell's fiery pain. Her tongue is moved by wit of high degree and ready repartee: her breast is a seduction to all that see it (glory be to Him who fashioned it and finished it!); and joined thereto are two upper arms smooth and rounded; even as saith of her the poet Al-Walahán,[FN#245]

'She hath wrists which, did her bangles not contain, *
             Would run from out her sleeves in silvern rain.'

She hath breasts like two globes of ivory, from whose brightness the moons borrow light, and a stomach with little waves as it were a figured cloth of the finest Egyptian linen made by the Copts, with creases like folded scrolls, ending in a waist slender past all power of imagination; based upon back parts like a hillock of blown sand, that force her to sit when she would fief stand, and awaken her, when she fain would sleep, even as saith of her and describeth her the poet,


'She hath those hips conjoined by thread of waist, *
             Hips that o'er me and her too tyrannise
My thoughts they daze whene'er I think of them, *
             And weigh her down whene'er she would uprise.'[FN#246]

And those back parts are upborne by thighs smooth and round and by a calf like a column of pearl, and all this reposeth upon two feet, narrow, slender and pointed like spear-blades,[FN#247] the handiwork of the Protector and Requiter, I wonder how, of their littleness, they can sustain what is above them. But I cut short my praises of her charms fearing lest I be tedious.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit Dahnash bin Shamhurish said to the Ifritah Maymunah, ""Of a truth I cut short my praises fearing lest I be tedious."" Now when Maymunah heard the description of that Princess and her beauty and loveliness, she stood silent in astonishment; whereupon Dahnash resumed, ""The father of this fair maiden is a mighty King, a fierce knight, immersed night and day in fray and fight; for whom death hath no fright and the escape of his foe no dread, for that he is a tyrant masterful and a conqueror irresistible, lord of troops and armies and continents and islands, and cities and villages, and his name is King Ghayur, Lord of the Islands and of the Seas and of the Seven Palaces. Now he loveth his daughter, the young maiden whom I have described to thee, with dearest love and, for affection of her, he hath heaped together the treasures of all the kings and built her therewith seven palaces, each of a different fashion; the first of crystal, the second of marble, the third of China steel, the fourth of precious stones and gems of price, the fifth of porcelain and many-hued onyxes and ring bezels, the sixth of silver and the seventh of gold. And he hath filled the seven palaces with all sorts of sumptuous furniture, rich silken carpets and hangings and vessels of gold and silver and all manner of gear that kings require; and hath bidden his daughter to abide in each by turns for a certain season of the year; and her name is the Princess Budur.[FN#248] Now when her beauty became known and her name and fame were bruited abroad in the neighbouring countries, all the kings sent to her father to demand her of him in marriage, and he consulted her on the matter, but she disliked the very word wedlock with a manner of abhorrence and said, O my father, I have no mind to marry; no, not at all; for I am a sovereign Lady and a Queen suzerain ruling over men, and I have no desire for a man who shall rule over me. And the more suits she refused, the more her suitors' eagerness increased and all the Royalties of the Inner Islands of China sent presents and rarities to her father with letters asking her in marriage. So he pressed her again and again with advice on the matter of espousals; but she ever opposed to him refusals, till at last she turned upon him angrily and cried, 'O my father, if thou name matrimony to me once more, I will go into my chamber and take a sword and, fixing its hilt in the ground, will set its point to my waist; then will I press upon it, till it come forth from my back, and so slay myself.' Now when the King heard these her words, the light became darkness in his sight and his heart burned for her as with a flame of fire, because he feared lest she should kill herself; and he was filled with perplexity concerning her affair and the kings her suitors. So he said to her 'If thou be determined not to marry and there be no help for it abstain from going and coming in and out.' Then he placed her in a house and shut her up in a chamber, appointing ten old women as duennas to guard her, and forbade her to go forth to the Seven Palaces; moreover, he made it appear that he was incensed against her, and sent letters to all the kings, giving them to know that she had been stricken with madness by the Jinns; and it is now a year since she hath thus been secluded."" Then continued the Ifrit Dahnash, addressing the Ifritah Maymunah, ""And I, O my lady go to her every night and take my fill of feeding my sight on her face and I kiss her between the eyes: yet, of my love to her, I do her no hurt neither mount her, for that her youth is fair and her grace surpassing: every one who seeth her jealouseth himself for her. I conjure thee, therefore, O my lady, to go back with me and look on her beauty and loveliness and stature and perfection of proportion; and after, if thou wilt, chastise me or enslave me; and win to thy will, for it is shine to bid and to forbid."" So saying, the Ifrit Dahnash bowed his head towards the earth and drooped his wings downward; but Maymunah laughed at his words and spat in his face and answered, ""What is this girl of whom thou pratest but a potsherd wherewith to wipe after making water?[FN#249] Faugh! Faugh! By Allah, O accursed, I thought thou hadst some wondrous tale to tell me or some marvellous news to give me. How would it be if thou were to sight my beloved? Verily, this night I have seen a young man, whom if thou saw though but in a dream, thou wouldst be palsied with admiration and spittle would flow from thy mouth."" Asked the Ifrit, ""And who and what is this youth?""; and she answered, ""Know, O Dahnash, that there hath befallen the young man the like of what thou tellest me befel thy mistress; for his father pressed him again and again to marry, but he refused, till at length his sire waxed wroth at being opposed and imprisoned him in the tower where I dwell: and I came up to-night and saw him."" Said Dahnash, ""O my lady, shew me this youth, that I may see if he be indeed handsomer than my mistress, the Princess Budur, or not; for I cannot believe that the like of her liveth in this our age."" Rejoined Maymunah, ""Thou liest, O accursed, O most ill-omened of Marids and vilest of Satans![FN#250] Sure am I that the like of my beloved is not in this world.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When It was the One Hundred and Eightieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifritah Maymunah spake thus to the Ifrit Dahnash, ""Sure am I that the like of my beloved is not in this world! Art thou mad to fellow thy beloved with my beloved?"" He said, ""Allah upon thee, O my lady, go back with me and look upon my mistress, and after I will with thee and look upon thy beloved."" She answered, ""It must needs be so, O accursed, for thou art a knavish devil; but I will not go with thee nor shalt thou come with me, save upon condition of a wager which is this. If the lover thou lovest and of whom thou boastest so bravely, prove handsomer than mine whom I mentioned and whom I love and of whom I boast, the bet shall be shine against me; but if my beloved prove the handsomer the bet shall be mine against thee."" Quoth Dahnash the Ifrit, ""O my lady, I accept this thy wager and am satisfied thereat; so come with me to the Islands."" Quoth Maymunah; ""No! for the abode of my beloved is nearer than the abode of shine: here it is under us; so come down with me to see my beloved and after we will go look upon thy mistress."" ""I hear and I obey,"" said Dahnash. So they descended to earth and alighted in the saloon which the tower contained; then Maymunah stationed Dahnash beside the bed and, putting out her hand, drew back the silken coverlet from Kamar al-Zaman's face, when it glittered and glistened and shimmered and shone like the rising sun. She gazed at him for a moment, then turning sharply round upon Dahnash said, ""Look, O accursed, and be not the basest of madmen; I am a maid, yet my heart he hath waylaid."" So Dahnash looked at the Prince and long continued gazing steadfastly on him then, shaking his head, said to Maymunah, ""By Allah, O my lady, thou art excusable; but there is yet another thing to be considered, and this is, that the estate female differeth from the male. By Allah's might, this thy beloved is the likest of all created things to my mistress in beauty and loveliness and grace and perfection; and it is as though they were both cast alike in the mould of seemlihead."" Now when Maymunah heard these words, the light became darkness in her sight and she dealt him with her wing so fierce a buffet on the head as well-nigh made an end of him. Then quoth she to him, ""I conjure thee, by the light of his glorious countenance, go at once, O accursed, and bring hither thy mistress whom thou lovest so fondly and foolishly, and return in haste that we may lay the twain together and look on them both as they lie asleep side by side; so shall it appear to us which be the goodlier and more beautiful of the two. Except thou obey me this very moment, O accursed, I will dart my sparks at thee with my fire and consume thee; yea, in pieces I will rend thee and into the deserts cast thee, that to stay at home and wayfarer an example thou be!"" Quoth Dahnash, ""O my lady, I will do thy behests, for I know forsure that my mistress is the fairer and the sweeter."" So saying the If rit flew away and Maymunah flew with him to guard him. They were absent awhile and presently returned, bearing the young lady, who was clad in a shift of fine Venetian silk, with a double edging of gold and purfled with the most exquisite of embroidery having these couplets worked upon the ends of the sleeves,

""Three matters hinder her from visiting us, in fear *
            Of hate-full, slandering envier and his hired spies:
The shining light of brow, the trinkets' tinkling voice, *
            And scent of essences that tell whene'er she tries:
Gi'en that she hide her brow with edge of sleeve, and leave *
             At home her trinketry, how shall her scent
             disguise?''[FN#251]

And Dahnash and Maymunah stinted not bearing that young lady till they had carried her into the saloon and had laid her beside the youth Kamar al-Zaman.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Eighty-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit Dahnash and the Ifritah Maymunah stinted not bearing Princess Budur till they descended and laid her on the couch beside Kamar al- Zaman. Then they uncovered both their faces, and they were the likest of all folk, each to other, as they were twins or an only brother and sister; and indeed they were a seduction to the pious, even as saith of them the poet Al-Mubín,

""O heart! be not thy love confined to one, *
Lest thou by doting or disdain be undone:
Love all the fair, and thou shalt find with them *
If this be lost, to thee that shall be won.""

And quoth another,

""Mine eyes beheld two lying on the ground; *
            Both had I loved if on these eyne they lay!""

So Dahnash and Maymunah gazed on them awhile, and he said, ""By Allah, O my lady, it is good! My mistress is assuredly the fairer."" She replied, ""Not so, my beloved is the fairer; woe to thee, O Dahnash! Art blind of eye and heart that lean from fat thou canst not depart? Wilt thou hide the truth? Dost thou not see his beauty and loveliness and fine stature and symmetry? Out on thee, hear what I purpose to say in praise of my beloved and, if thou be a lover true to her thou dost love, do thou the like for her thou Lovest."" Then she kissed Kamar al-Zaman again and again between the eyes and improvised this ode,

""How is this? Why should the blamer abuse thee in his pride?
What shall console my heart for thee, that art but slender bough?

A Nature Kohl'd[FN#252] eye thou hast that witcheth far and wide;
From pure platonic love[FN#253] of it deliverance none I trow!

Those glances, fell as plundering Turk, to heart such havoc deal
As never havocked scymitar made keenest at the curve.

On me thou layest load of love the heaviest while I feel
So feeble grown that under weight of chemisette I swerve.

My love for thee as wottest well is habit, and my lowe
Is nature; to all others false is all the love I tender:

Now were my heart but like to shine I never would say No;
Only my wasted form is like thy waist so gracious slender:

Out on him who in Beauty's robe for moon like charms hath fame,
And who is claimed by mouth of men as marvel of his tribe!

'Of man what manner may he be' (ask they who flyte and blame)
'For whom thy heart is so distressed?' I only cry 'Describe!'

Oh stone-entempered heart of him! learn of his yielding grace
And bending form to show me grace and yielding to consent.
Oh my Prince Beautiful, thou hast an Overseer in place[FN#254]
Who irketh me, and eke a Groom whose wrong cloth ne'er relent.

Indeed he lieth who hath said that all of loveliness
Was pent in Joseph: in thy charms there's many and many a Joe!

The Genii dread me when I stand and face to face address;
But meeting thee my fluttering heart its shame and terror show.

I take aversion semblance and I turn from thee in fright,
But more aversion I assume, more love from me dost claim;

That hair of jetty black! That brow e'er raying radiant light! Those eyne wherein white jostles black![FN#255] That dearling dainty frame!""

When Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in praise of her beloved, he joyed with exceeding joy and marvelled with excessive wonderment.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

When it was the One Hundred and Eighty-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Ifrit Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in praise of her beloved, he shook for exceeding joy and said, ""Thou hast celebrated thy beloved in song and thou hast indeed done well in praise of him whom thou lovest! And there is no help for it but that I also in my turn do my best to enfame my mistress, and recite somewhat in her honour."" Then the Ifrit went up to the Lady Budur; and' kissing her between the eyes, looked at Maymunah and at his beloved Princess and recited the following verses, albeit he had no skill in poesy,

""Love for my fair they chide in angry way; *
             Unjust for ignorance, yea unjustest they!
Ah lavish favours on the love mad, whom *
             Taste of thy wrath and parting woe shall slay:
In sooth for love I'm wet with railing tears, *
             That rail mine eyelids blood thou mightest say:
No marvel what I bear for love, 'tis marvel *
             That any know my ""me"" while thou'rt away:
Unlawful were our union did I doubt *
             Thy love, or heart incline to other May.""

And eke these words:—

""I feed eyes on their stead by the valley's side, *
             And I'm slain and my slaver[FN#256] aside hath tried:
Grief-wine have I drunken, and down my cheeks *
             Dance tears to the song of the camel-guide:
For union-blessing I strive though sure, *
             In Budur and Su'ad all my bliss shall bide:[FN#257]
Wot I not which of three gave me most to 'plain, *
             So hear them numbered ere thou decide:
Those Sworders her eyne, that Lancer her fig- *
             -ure, or ring-mail'd Locks which her forehead hide.
Quoth she (and I ask of her what so wights *
             Or abide in towns or in desert ride[FN#258] )
To me, 'In thy heart I dwell, look there!' *
             Quoth I, 'Where's my heart ah where? ah where?'""

When Maymunah heard these lines from the Ifrit, she said, ""Thou hast done well, O Dahnash! But say thou which of the two is the handsomer?"" And he answered, ""My mistress Budur is handsomer than thy beloved!"" Cried Maymunah, ""Thou liest, O accursed. Nay, my beloved is more beautiful than shine!"" But Dahnash persisted, ""Mine is the fairer."" And they ceased not to wrangle and challenge each other's words till Maymunah cried out at Dahnash and would have laid violent hands on him, but he humbled himself to her and, softening his speech, said, ""Let not the truth be a grief to thee, and cease we this talk, for all we say is to testify in favour of our lovers; rather let each of us withdraw the claim and seek we one who shall judge fairly between us which of the two be fairer; and by his sentence we will abide."" ""I agree to this,"" answered she and smote the earth with her foot, whereupon there came out of it an Ifrit blind of an eye, humpbacked and scurvy-skinned, with eye-orbits slit up and down his face.[FN#259] On his head were seven horns and four locks of hair fell to his heels; his hands were pitchfork-like and his legs mast-like and he had nails as the claws of a lion, and feet as the hoofs of the wild ass.[FN#260] When that If rit rose out of the earth and sighted Maymunah, he kissed the ground before her and, standing with his hands clasped behind him, said, ""What is thy will, O my mistress, O daughter of my King?""[FN#261] She replied, ""O Kashkash, I would have thee judge between me and this accursed Dahnash."" And she made known to him the matter, from first to last, whereupon the Ifrit Kashkash looked at the face of the youth and then at the face of the girl; and saw them lying asleep, embraced, each with an arm under the other's neck, alike in beauty and loveliness and equal in grace and goodliness. The Marid gazed long upon them, marvelling at their seemlihead; and, after carefully observing the twain, he turned to Maymunah and Dahnash, and reseated these couplets.

""Go, visit her thou lovest, and regard not
The words detractors utter, envious churls
Can never favour love. Oh! sure the Merciful
Ne'er made a thing more fair to look upon,
Than two fond lovers in each others' arms,
Speaking their passion in a mute embrace.
When heart has turned to heart, the fools would part them
Strike idly on cold steel. So when thou'st found
One purely, wholly shine, accept her true heart,
And live for her alone. Oh! thou that blamest
The love-struck for their love, give o'er thy talk,
How canst thou minister to a mind diseased?""[FN#262]

Then he turned again to Maymunah and Dahnash and said to them, ""By Allah, if you will have the truth, I tell you fairly the twain be equal in beauty, and loveliness and perfect grace and goodliness, nor can I make any difference between them on account of their being man and woman. But I have another thought which is that we wake each of them in turn, without the knowledge of the other, and whichever is the more enamoured shall be held inferior in seemlihead and comeliness."" Quoth Maymunah, ""Right is this recking,"" and quoth Dahnash, ""I consent to this."" Then Dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit Kamar al-Zaman, whereupon he started from sleep in a fright.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Eighty-third Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit Kamar al-Zaman who started from sleep in a fright and rubbed the bitten part, his neck, and scratched it hard because of the smart. Then turning sideways, he found lying by him something whose breath was sweeter than musk and whose skin was softer than cream. Hereat marvelled he with great marvel and he sat up and looked at what lay beside him; when he saw it to be a young lady like an union pearl, or a shining sun, or a dome seen from afar on a well built wall; for she was five feet tall, with a shape like the letter Alif[FN#263], bosomed high and rosy checked; even as saith of her the poet,

""Four things which ne'er conjoin, unless it be *
             To storm my vitals and to shed my blood:
Brow white as day and tresses black as night *
             Cheeks rosy red and lips which smiles o'erflood.""

And also quoth another,

""A Moon she rises, Willow wand she waves, *
             Breathes Ambergris, and gazes, a Gazelle:
Meseems that sorrow woes my heart and wins *
             And, when she wendeth hastes therein to dwell!""

And when Kamar al-Zaman saw the Lady Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, and her beauty and comeliness, she was sleeping clad in a shift of Venetian silk, without her petticoat-trousers, and wore on her head a kerchief embroidered with gold and set with stones of price: her ears were hung with twin earrings which shone like constellations and round her neck was a collar of union pearls, of size unique, past the competence of any King. When he saw this, his reason was confounded and natural heat began to stir in him; Allah awoke in him the desire of coition and he said to himself, ""Whatso Allah willeth, that shall be, and what He willeth not shall never be!"" So saying, he put out his hand and, turning her over, loosed the collar of her chemise; then arose before his sight her bosom, with its breasts like double globes of ivory; whereat his inclination for her redoubled and he desired her with exceeding hot desire, He would have awakened her but she would not awake, for Dahnash had made her sleep heavy; so he shook her and moved her, saying, ""O my beloved, awake and look on me; I am Kamar al-Zaman."" But she awoke not, neither moved her head; where-upon he considered her case for a long hour and said to himself, ""If I guess aright, this is the damsel to whom my father would have married me and these three years past I have refused her; but Inshallah!—God willing—as soon as it is dawn, I will say to him, 'Marry me to her, that I may enjoy her.'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to himself, ""By Allah, when I see dawn I will say to my sire, 'Marry me to her that I may enjoy her'; nor will I let half the day pass ere I possess her and take my fill of her beauty and loveliness."" Then he bent over Budur to buss her, whereat the Jinniyah Maymunah trembled and was abashed and Dahnash, the Ifrit, was like to fly for joy. But, as Kamar al- Zaman was about to kiss her upon the mouth, he was ashamed before Allah and turned away his head and averted his face, saying to his heart, ""Have patience."" Then he took thought awhile and said, ""I will be patient; haply my father when he was wroth with me and sent me to this jail, may have brought my young lady and made her lie by my side to try me with her, and may have charged her not to be readily awakened when I would arouse her, and may have said to her, 'Whatever thing Kamar al-Zaman do to thee, make me ware thereof'; or belike my sire standeth hidden in some stead whence (being himself unseen) he can see all I do with this young lady; and to morrow he will scold me and cry, 'How cometh it that thou sayest, I have no mind to marry; and yet thou didst kiss and embrace yonder damsel?' So I will withhold myself lest I be ashamed before my sire; and the right and proper thing to do is not to touch her at this present, nor even to look upon her, except to take from her somewhat which shall serve as a token to me and a memorial of her; that some sign endure between me and her."" Then Kamar al-Zaman raised the young lady's hand and took from her little finger a seal-ring worth an immense amount of money, for that its bezel was a precious jewel and around it were graven these couplets,

""Count not that I your promises forgot, *
             Despite the length of your delinquencies
Be generous, O my lord, to me inclining; *
             Haply your mouth and cheeks these lips may kiss:
By Allah, ne'er will I relinquish you *
             Albe you will transgress love's boundaries.""

Then Kamar al-Zaman took the seal-ring from the little finger of Queen Budur and set it on his own; then, turning his back to her, went to sleep.[FN#264] When Maymunah the Jinniyah saw this, she was glad and said to Dahnash and Kashkash, ""Saw ye how my beloved Kamar al-Zaman bore himself chastely towards this young lady? Verily, this was of the perfection of his good gifts; for observe you twain how he looked on her and noted her beauty and loveliness, and yet embraced her not neither kissed her nor put his hand to her, but turned his back and slept."" Answered they, ""Even so!"" Thereupon Maymunah changed herself into a flea and entering into the raiment of Budur, the loved of Dahnash, crept up her calf and came upon her thigh and, reaching a place some four carats[FN#265] below her navel, there bit her. Thereupon she opened her eyes and sitting up in bed, saw a youth lying beside her and breathing heavily in his sleep, the loveliest of Almighty Allah's creatures, with eyes that put to shame the fairest Houris of Heaven; and a mouth like Solomon's seal, whose water was sweeter to the taste and more efficacious than a theriack, and lips the colour of coral-stone, and cheeks like the blood red anemone, even as saith one, describing him in these couplets,

""My mind's withdrawn from Zaynab and Nawár[FN#266] *
             By rosy cheeks that growth of myrtle bear;
I love a fawn, a tunic-vested boy, *
             And leave the love of bracelet-wearing Fair:
My mate in hall and closet is unlike *
             Her that I play with, as at home we pair.
Oh thou, who blam'st my flight from Hind and Zaynab, *
             The cause is clear as dawn uplighting air!
Would'st have me fare[FN#267] a slave, the thrall of thrall, *
             Cribbed, pent, confined behind the bar and wall?""

Now when Princess Budur saw him, she was seized by a transport of passion and yearning and love-longing,—And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Budur saw Kamar al-Zaman she was forthwith seized with a transport of passion and yearning and love longing, and she said to herself, ""Alas, my shame! This is a strange youth and I know him not. How cometh he to be lying by my side on one bed?"" Then she looked at him a second time and, noting his beauty and loveliness, said, ""By Allah, he is indeed a comely youth and my heart[FN#268] is well-nigh torn in sunder with longing for him! But alas, how am I shamed by him! By the Almighty, had I known it was this youth who sought me in marriage of my father, I had not rejected him, but had wived with him and enjoyed his loveliness!"" Then she gazed in his face and said, ""O my lord and light of mine eyes, awake from sleep and take thy pleasure in my beauty and grace."" And she moved him with her hand; but Maymunah the Jinniyah let down sleep upon him as it were a curtain, and pressed heavily on his head with her wings so that Kamar al-Zaman awoke not. Then Princess Budur shook him with her hands and said, ""My life on thee, hearken to me; awake and up from thy sleep and look on the narcissus and the tender down thereon, and enjoy the sight of naked waist and navel; and touzle me and tumble me from this moment till break of day! Allah upon thee, O my lord, sit up and prop thee against the pillow and slumber not!"" Still Kamar al-Zaman made her no reply but breathed hard in his sleep. Continued she, ""Alas! Alas! thou art insolent in thy beauty and comeliness and grace and loving looks! But if thou art handsome, so am I handsome; what then is this thou dost? Have they taught thee to flout me or hath my father, the wretched old fellow,[FN#269] made thee swear not to speak to me to-night?"" But Kamar al-Zaman opened not his mouth neither awoke, whereat her passion for him redoubled and Allah inflamed her heart with love of him. She stole one glance of eyes that cost her a thousand sighs: her heart fluttered, and her vitals throbbed and her hands and feet quivered; and she said to Kamar al-Zaman ""Talk to me, O my lord! Speak to me, O my friend! Answer me, O my beloved, and tell me thy name, for indeed thou hast ravished my wit!"" And during all this time he abode drowned in sleep and answered her not a word, and Princess Budur sighed and said, ""Alas! Alas! why art thou so proud and self satisfied?"" Then she shook him and turning his hand over, saw her seal-ring on his little finger, whereat she cried a loud cry, and followed it with a sigh of passion and said, ""Alack! Alack! By Allah, thou art my beloved and thou lovest me! Yet thou seemest to turn thee away from me out of coquetry, for all, O my darling, thou camest to me, whilst I was asleep and knew not what thou didst with me, and tookest my seal-ring; and yet I will not pull it off thy finger."" So saying, she opened the bosom of his shirt and bent over him and kissed him and put forth her hand to him, seeking somewhat that she might take as a token, but found nothing. Then she thrust her hand into his breast and, because of the smoothness of his body, it slipped down to his waist and thence to his navel and thence to his yard, whereupon her heart ached and her vitals quivered and lust was sore upon her, for that the desire of women is fiercer than the desire of men,[FN#270] and she was ashamed of her own shamelessness. Then she plucked his seal-ring from his finger, and put it on her own instead of the ring he had taken, and bussed his inner lips and hands, nor did she leave any part of him unkissed; after which she took him to her breast and embraced him and, laying one of her hands under his neck and the other under his arm-pit, nestled close to him and fell asleep by his side.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Budur fell asleep by the side of Kamar al-Zaman, after doing that which she did, quoth Maymunah to Dahnash, Night thou, O accursed, how proudly and coquettishly my beloved bore himself, and how hotly and passionately thy mistress showed herself to my dearling? There can be no doubt that my beloved is handsomer than shine; nevertheless I pardon thee."" Then she wrote him a document of manumission and turned to Kashkash and said, ""Go, help Dahnash to take up his mistress and aid him to carry her back to her own place, for the night waneth apace and there is but little left of it."" ""I hear and I obey;"" answered Kashkash. So the two Ifrits went forward to Princess Budur and upraising her flew away with her; then, bearing her back to her own place, they laid her on her bed, whilst Maymunah abode alone with Kamar al-Zaman, gazing upon him as he slept, till the night was all but spent, when she went her way. As soon as morning morrowed, the Prince awoke from sleep and turned right and left, but found not the maiden by him and said in his mind, ""What is this business? It is as if my father would incline me to marriage with the damsel who was with me and have now taken her away by stealth, to the intent that my desire for wedlock may redouble."" Then he called out to the eunuch who slept at the door, saying, ""Woe to thee, O damned one, arise at once!"" So the eunuch rose, bemused with sleep, and brought him basin and ewer, whereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered the water closet and did his need;[FN#271] then, coming out made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the dawn-prayer, after which he sat telling on his beads the ninety-and-nine names of Almighty Allah. Then he looked up and, seeing the eunuch standing in service upon him, said, ""Out on thee, O Sawáb! Who was it came hither and took away the young lady from my side and I still sleeping?"" Asked the eunuch, 'O my lord, what manner of young lady?"" ""The young lady who lay with me last night,"" replied Kamar al-Zaman. The eunuch was startled at his words and said to him, ""By Allah, there hath been with thee neither young lady nor other! How should young lady have come in to thee, when I was sleeping in the doorway and the door was locked? By Allah, O my lord, neither male nor female hath come in to thee!"" Exclaimed the Prince, ""Thou liest, O pestilent slave!: is it of thy competence also to hoodwink me and refuse to tell me what is become of the young lady who lay with me last night and decline to inform me who took her away?"" Replied the eunuch (and he was affrighted at him), ""By Allah, O my lord, I have seen neither young lady nor young lord!"" His words only angered Kamar al-Zaman the more and he said to him, ""O accursed one, my father hath indeed taught thee deceit! Come hither."" So the eunuch came up to him, and the Prince took him by the collar and dashed him to the ground; whereupon he let fly a loud fart[FN#272] and Kamar al-Zaman, kneeling upon him, kicked him and throttled him till he fainted away. Then he dragged him forth and tied him to the well-rope, and let him down like a bucket into the well and plunged him into the water, then drew him up and lowered him down again. Now it was hard winter weather, and Kamar al-Zaman ceased not to plunge the eunuch into the water and pull him up again and douse him and haul him whilst he screamed and called for help; and the Prince kept on saying ""By Allah, O damned one, I will not draw thee up out of this well till thou tell me and fully acquaint me with the story of the young lady and who it was took her away, whilst I slept.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One and Eighty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to the eunuch, ""By Allah! I will not draw thee up out of this well until thou tell me the story of the young lady and who it was took her away whilst I slept."" Answered the eunuch, after he had seen death staring him in the face; ""O my lord, let me go and I will relate to thee the truth and the whole tale."" So Kamar al-Zaman pulled him up out of the well, all but dead for suffering, what with cold and the pain of dipping and dousing, drubbing and dread of drowning. He shook like cane in hurricane, his teeth were clenched as by cramp and his clothes were drenched and his body befouled and torn by the rough sides of the well: briefly he was in a sad pickle. Now when Kamar al-Zaman saw him in this sorry plight, he was concerned for him; but, as soon as the eunuch found himself on the floor, he said to him, ""O my lord, let me go and doff my clothes and wring them out and spread them in the sun to dry, and don others; after which I will return to thee forthwith and tell thee the truth of the matter."" Answered the Prince, ""O rascal slave! hadst thou not seen death face to face, never hadst thou confessed to fact nor told me a word; but go now and do thy will, and then come back to me at once and tell me the truth."" Thereupon the eunuch went out, hardly crediting his escape, and ceased not running, stumbling and rising in his haste, till he came in to King Shahriman, whom he found sitting at talk with his Wazir of Kamar al-Zaman's case. The King was saying to the Minister, ""I slept not last night, for anxiety concerning my son, Kamar al-Zaman and indeed I fear lest some harm befal him in that old tower. What good was there in imprisoning him?"" Answered the Wazir, ""Have no care for him. By Allah, no harm will befal him! None at all! Leave him in prison for a month till his temper yield and his spirit be broken and he return to his senses."" As the two spoke behold, up rushed the eunuch, in the aforesaid plight, making to the King who was troubled at sight of him; and he cried ""O our lord the Sultan! Verily, thy son's wits are fled and he hath gone mad, he hath dealt with me thus and thus, so that I am become as thou seest me, and he kept saying, 'A young lady lay with me this night and stole away secretly whilst I slept. Where is she?' And he insisteth on my letting him know where she is and on my telling him who took her away. But I have seen neither girl nor boy: the door was locked all through the night, for I slept before it with the key under my head, and I opened to him in the morning with my own hand. When King Shahriman heard this, he cried out, saying, ""Alas, my son!;"" and he was enraged with sore rage against the Wazir, who had been the cause of all this case and said to him, ""Go up, bring me news of my son and see what hath befallen his mind."" So the Wazir rose and, stumbling over his long skirts, in his fear of the King's wrath, hastened with the slave to the tower. Now the sun had risen and when the Minister came in to Kamar al-Zaman, he found him sitting on the couch reciting the Koran; so he saluted him and seated himself by his side, and said to him, ""O my lord, this wretched eunuch brought us tidings which troubled and alarmed us and which incensed the King."" Asked Kamar al-Zaman, ""And what hath he told you of me to trouble my father? In good sooth he hath troubled none but me."" Answered the Wazir, ""He came to us in fulsome state and told us of thee a thing which Heaven forfend; and the slave added a lie which it befitteth not to repeat, Allah preserve thy youth and sound sense and tongue of eloquence, and forbid to come from thee aught of offense!"" Quoth the Prince, ""O Wazir, and what thing did this pestilent slave say of me?"" The Minister replied, ""He told us that thy wits had taken leave of thee and thou wouldst have it that a young lady lay with thee last night, and thou west instant with him to tell thee whither she went and thou diddest torture him to that end."" But when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was enraged with sore rage and he said to the Wazir, ""'Tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her per misted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Eighty-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman heard the words of the Wazir he was enraged with sore rage and said to him, ""'Tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did and forbade him to tell me what became of the young lady who lay with me last night. But thou, O Wazir, art cleverer than the eunuch, so do thou tell me without stay or delay, whither went the young lady who slept on my bosom last night; for it was you who sent her and bade her steep in my embrace and we lay together till dawn; but, when I awoke, I found her not. So where is she now?"" Said the Wazir, ""O my lord Kamar al-Zaman, Allah's name encompass thee about! By the Almighty, we sent none to thee last night, but thou layest alone, with the door locked on thee and the eunuch sleeping behind it, nor did there come to thee young lady or any other. Regain thy reason, O my lord, and stablish thy senses and occupy not thy mind with vanities."" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman who was incensed at his words, ""O Wazir, the young lady in question is my beloved, the fair one with the black eyes and rosy cheeks, whom I held in my arms all last night."" So the Minister wondered at his words and asked him, ""Didst thou see this damsel last night with shine own eyes on wake or in sleep?"" Answered Kamar al-Zaman, ""O ill- omened old man, dost thou fancy I saw her with my ears? Indeed, I saw her with my very eyes and awake, and I touched her with my hand, and I watched by her full half the night, feeding my vision on her beauty and loveliness and grace and tempting looks. But you had schooled her and charged her to speak no word to me; so she feigned sleep and I lay by her side till dawn, when I awoke and found her gone."" Rejoined the Wazir, ""O my lord Kamar al- Zaman, haply thou sawest this in thy sleep; it must have been a delusion of dreams or a deception caused by eating various kinds of food, or a suggestion of the accursed devils."" Cried the Prince, ""O pestilent old man! wilt thou too make a mock of me and tell me this was haply a delusion of dreams, when that eunuch confessed to the young lady, saying, 'At once I will return to thee and tell thee all about her?'"" With these words, he sprang up and rushed at the Wazir and gripped hold of his beard (which was long[FN#273]) and, after gripping it, he twisted his hand in it and haling him off the couch, threw him on the floor. It seemed to the Minister as though his soul departed his body for the violent plucking at his beard; and Kamar al-Zaman ceased not kicking the Wazir and basting his breast and ribs and cuffing him with open hand on the nape of his neck till he had well-nigh beaten him to death. Then said the old man in his mind, ""Just as the eunuch-slave saved his life from this lunatic youth by telling him a lie, thus it is even fitter that I do likewise; else he will destroy me. So now for my lie to save myself, he being mad beyond a doubt."" Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said, ""O my lord, pardon me; for indeed thy father charged me to conceal from thee this affair of the young lady; but now I am weak and weary and wounded with funding; for I am an old man and lack strength and bottom to endure blows. Have, therefore, a little patience with me and I will tell thee all and acquaint thee with the story of the young woman."" When the Prince heard this, he left off drubbing him and said, ""Wherefore couldst thou not tell me the tale until after shame and blows? Rise now, unlucky old man that thou art, and tell me her story."" Quoth the Wazir, ""Say, dost thou ask of the young lady with the fair face and perfect form?"" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, ""Even so! Tell me, O Wazir, who it was that led her to me and laid her by my side, and who was it that took her away from me by night; and let me know forthright whither she is gone, that I myself may go to her at once. If my father did this deed to me that he might try me by means of that beautiful girl, with a view to our marriage, I consent to wed her and free myself of this trouble; for he did all these dealings with me only because I refused wedlock. But now I consent and I say again, I consent to matrimony: so tell this to my father, O Wazir, and advise him to marry me to that young lady; for I will have none other and my heart loveth none save her alone. Now rise up at once and haste thee to my father and counsel him to hurry on our wedding and bring me his answer within this very hour."" Rejoined the Wazir, ""'Tis well!"" and went forth from him, hardly believing himself out of his hands. Then he set off from the tower, walking and tripping up as he went, for excess of fright and agitation, and he ceased not hurrying till he came in to King Shahriman.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Eighty-nineth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir, fared forth from the tower, and ceased not running till he came in to King Shahriman, who said to him as he sighted him, ""O thou Wazir, what man hath brought thee to grief and whose mischief hath treated thee in way unlief; how happeneth it that I see thee dumb foundered and coming to me thus astounded?"" Replied the Wazir, ""O King! I bring thee good news."" ""And what is it?"" quoth Shahriman, and quoth the Wazir, ""Know that thy son Kamar al- Zaman's wits are clean gone and that he hath become stark mad."" Now when the King heard these words of the Minister, light became darkness in his sight and he said, ""O Wazir, make clear to me the nature of his madness."" Answered the Wazir, ""O my lord, I hear and I obey."" Then he told him that such and such had passed and acquainted him with all that his son had done; whereupon the King said to him, ""Hear, O Wazir, the good tidings which I give thee in return for this thy fair news of my son's insanity; and it shall be the cutting off of thy head and the forfeiture of my favour, O most ill-omened of Wazirs and foulest of Emirs! for I feel that thou hast caused my son's disorder by the wicked advice and the sinister counsel thou hast given me first and last. By Allah, if aught of mischief or madness have befallen my son I will most assuredly nail thee upon the palace dome and make thee drain the bitterest draught of death!'' Then he sprang up and, taking the Wazir, with him, fared straight for the tower and entered it. And when Kamar al-Zaman saw the two, he rose to his father in haste from the couch whereon he sat and kissing his hands drew back and hung down his head and stood before him with his arms behind him, and thus remained for a full hour. Then he raised his head towards his sire; the tears gushed from his eyes and streamed down his cheeks and he began repeating,

""Forgive the sin 'neath which my limbs are trembling,
For the slave seeks for mercy from his master;
I've done a fault, which calls for free confession,
Where shall it call for mercy, and forgiveness?''[FN#274]

When the King heard this, he arose and embraced his son, and kissing him between the eyes, made him sit by his side on the couch; then he turned to the Wazir, and, looking on him with eyes of wrath, said, ""O dog of Wazirs, how didst thou say of my son such and such things and make my heart quake for him?"" Then he turned to the Prince and said, ""O my son, what is to-day called?"" He answered, ""O my father, this day is the Sabbath, and to morrow is First day: then come Second day, Third, Fourth, Fifth day and lastly Friday.""[FN#275] Exclaimed the King, ""O my son, O Kamar al-Zaman, praised be Allah for the preservation of thy reason! What is the present month called in our Arabic?"" ""Zú'l Ka'adah,"" answered Kamar al-Zaman, ""and it is followed by Zú'l hijjah; then cometh Muharram, then Safar, then Rabí'a the First and Rabí'a the Second, the two Jamádás, Rajab, Sha'aban, Ramazán and Shawwál."" At this the King rejoiced exceedingly and spat in the Wazir's face, saying, ""O wicked old man, how canst thou say that my son is mad? And now none is mad but thou."" Hereupon the Minister shook his head and would have spoken, but bethought himself to wait awhile and see what might next befal. Then the King said to his child, ""O my son, what words be these thou saddest to the eunuch and the Wazir, declaring, 'I was sleeping with a fair damsel this night?'[FN#276] What damsel is this of whom thou speakest?"" Then Kamar al-Zaman laughed at his father's words and replied, ""O my father, know that I can bear no more jesting; so add me not another mock or even a single word on the matter, for my temper hath waxed short by that you have done with me. And know, O my father, with assured knowledge, that I consent to marry, but on condition that thou give me to wife her who lay by my side this night; for I am certain it was thou sentest her to me and madest me in love with her and then despatchedst a message to her before the dawn and tookest her away from beside me."" Rejoined the King, ""The name of Allah encompass thee about, O my son, and be thy wit preserved from witlessness!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Ninetieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth King Shahriman to his son Kamar al-Zaman, ""The name of Allah encompass thee about, O my son, and be thy wit preserved from witlessness! What thing be this young lady whom thou fanciest I sent to thee last night and then again that I sent to withdraw her from thee before dawn? By the Lord, O my son, I know nothing of this affair, and Allah upon thee, tell me if it be a delusion of dreaming or a deception caused by indisposition. For verily thou layest down to sleep last night with thy mind occupied anent marriage and troubled with the talk of it (Allah damn marriage and the hour when I spake of it and curse him who counselled it!); and without doubt or diffidence I can say that being moved in mind by the mention of wedlock thou dreamedst that a handsome young lady embraced thee and didst fancy thou sawest her when awake. But all this, O my son, is but an imbroglio of dreams."" Replied Kamar al-Zaman, ""Leave this talk and swear to me by Allah, the All creator, the Omniscient; the Humbler of the tyrant Caesars and the Destroyer of the Chosroes, that thou knowest naught of the young lady nor of her woning-place."" Quoth the King, ""By the Might of Allah Almighty, the God of Moses and Abraham, I know naught of all this and never even heard of it; it is assuredly a delusion of dreams thou hast seen in sleep.' Then the Prince replied to his sire, ""I will give thee a self evident proof that it happened to me when on wake.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Ninety-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al Zamar said to his sire, ""I will give thee a self-evident proof that this happened to me when on wake. Now let me ask thee, did it ever befal any man to dream that he was battling a sore battle and after to awake from sleep and find in his hand a sword-blade besmeared with blood? Answered the King, ""No, by Allah, O my son, this hath never been."" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman, ""I will tell thee what happened to me and it was this. Meseemed I awoke from sleep in the middle of the past night and found a girl lying by my side, whose form was like mine and whose favour was as mine. I embraced her and turned her about with my hand and took her seal- ring, which I put on my finger, and she pulled off my ring and put it on hers. Then I went to sleep by her side, but refrained from her for shame of thee, deeming that thou hadst sent her to me, intending to tempt me with her and incline me to marriage, and suspecting thee to be hidden somewhere whence thou couldst see what I did with her. And I was ashamed even to kiss her on the mouth for thy account, thinking over this temptation to wedlock; and, when I awoke at point of day, I found no trace of her, nor could I come at any news of her, and there befel me what thou knowest of with the eunuch and with the Wazir. How then can this case have been a dream and a delusion, when the ring is a reality? Save for her ring on my finger I should indeed have deemed it a dream; but here is the ring on my little finger: look at it, O King, and see what is its worth."" So saying he handed the ring to his father, who examined it and turned it over, then looked to his son and said, ""Verily, there is in this ring some mighty mystery and some strange secret. What befel thee last night with the girl is indeed a hard nut to crack, and I know not how intruded upon us this intruder. None is the cause of all this posher save the Wazir; but, Allah upon thee, O my son, take patience, so haply the Lord may turn to gladness this thy grief and to thy sadness bring complete relief: as quoth one of the poets,

'Haply shall Fortune draw her rein, and bring *
             Fair chance, for she is changeful, jealous, vain:
Still I may woo my want and wishes win, *
           And see on heels of care unfair, the fain.'

And now, O my son, I am certified at this hour that thou art not mad; but thy case is a strange one which none can clear up for thee save the Almighty."" Cried the Prince, ""By Allah, O my father, deal kindly with me and seek out this young lady and hasten her coming to me; else I shall die of woe and of my death shall no one know."" Then he betrayed the ardour of his passion; and turned towards his father and repeated these two couplets,

""If your promise of personal call prove untrue, *
             Deign in vision to grant me an interview:
Quoth they, 'How can phantom[FN#277] appear to the sight *
             Of a youth, whose sight is fordone, perdue?'""

Then, after ending his poetry, Kamar al-Zaman again turned to his father, with submission and despondency, and shedding tears in flood, began repeating these lines.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Ninety-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman had repeated to his father these verses, he wept and complained and groaned from a wounded heart; and added these lines,

""Beware that eye glance which hath magic might; *
            Wherever turn those orbs it bars our flight:
Nor be deceived by low sweet voice, that breeds *
            A fever festering in the heart and sprite:
So soft that silky skin, were rose to touch it *
             She'd cry and tear-drops rain for pain and fright:
Did Zephyr e'en in sleep pass o'er her land, *
             Scented he'd choose to dwell in scented site:
Her necklets vie with tinkling of her belt; *
             Her wrists strike either wristlet dumb with spite:
When would her bangles buss those rings in ear, *
             Upon the lover's eyne high mysteries 'light:
I'm blamed for love of her, nor pardon claim; *
             Eyes are not profiting which lack foresight:
Heaven strip thee, blamer mine! unjust art thou; *
             Before this fawn must every eye low bow.""[FN#278]

After which he said, ""By Allah, O my father, I cannot endure to be parted from her even for an hour."" The King smote hand upon hand and exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! No cunning contrivance can profit us in this affair."" Then he took his son by the hand and carried him to the palace, where Kamar al-Zaman lay down on the bed of languor and the King sat at his head, weeping and mourning over him and leaving him not, night or day, till at last the Wazir came in to him and said, ""O King of the age and the time, how long wilt thou remain shut up with thy son and hide thyself from thy troops. Haply, the order of thy realm may be deranged, by reason of shine absence from thy Grandees and Officers of State. It behoveth the man of understanding, if he have various wounds in his body, to apply him first to medicine the most dangerous; so it is my counsel to thee that thou remove thy son from this place to the pavilion which is in the palace overlooking the sea; and shut thyself up with him there, setting apart in every week two days, Thursday and Monday, for state receptions and progresses and reviews. On these days let shine Emirs and Wazirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and high Officials and Grandees of the realm and the rest of the levies and the lieges have access to thee and submit their affairs to thee; and do thou their needs and judge among them and give and take with them and bid and forbid. And the rest of the week thou shalt pass with thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and cease not thus doing till Allah shall vouchsafe relief to you twain. Think not, O King, that thou art safe from the shifts of Time and the strokes of Change which come like a traveller in the night; for the wise man is ever on his guard and how well saith the poet,

'Thou deemedst well of Time when days went well, *
             And fearedst not what ills might bring thee Fate:
The Nights so fair and restful cozened thee, *
             For peaceful Nights bring woes of heavy weight.
Oh children of mankind whom Time befriends, *
             Beware of Time's deceits or soon or late!'''[FN#279]

When the Sultan heard his Wazir's words he saw that they were right and deemed his counsel wise, and it had effect upon him for he feared lest the order of the state be deranged; so he rose at once and bade transport his son from his sick room to the pavilion in the palace overlooking the sea. Now this palace was girt round by the waters and was approached by a causeway twenty cubits wide. It had windows on all sides commanding an ocean- view; its floor was paved with parti-coloured marbles and its ceiling was painted in the richest pigments and figured with gold and lapis-lazuli. They furnished it for Kamar al-Zaman with splendid upholstery, embroidered rugs and carpets of the richest silk; and they clothed the walls with choice brocades and hung curtains bespangled with gems of price. In the midst they set him a couch of juniper[FN#280]-wood inlaid with pearls and jewels, and Kamar al-Zaman sat down thereon, but the excess of his concern and passion for the young lady had wasted his charms and emaciated his body; he could neither eat nor drink nor sleep; and he was like a man who had been sick twenty years of sore sickness. His father seated himself at his head, grieving for him with the deepest grief, and every Monday and Thursday he gave his Wazirs and Emirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and Lords of the realm and levies and the rest of his lieges leave to come up to him in that pavilion. So they entered and did their several service and duties and abode with him till the end of the day, when they went their ways and the King returned to his son in the pavilion whom he left not night nor day; and he ceased not doing on this wise for many days and nights. Such was the case with Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman; but as regards Princess Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seven Palaces, when the two Jinns bore her up and laid her on her bed, she slept till daybreak, when she awoke and sitting upright looked right and left, but saw not the youth who had lain in her bosom. At this her vitals fluttered, her reason fled and she shrieked a loud shriek which awoke all her slave girls and nurses and duennas. They flocked in to her; and the chief of them came forward and asked, ""What aileth thee, O my lady?"" Answered the Princess, ""O wretched old woman, where is my beloved, the handsome youth who lay last night in my bosom? Tell me whither he is gone."" Now when the duenna heard this, the light starkened in her sight and she feared from her mischief with sore affright, and said to her, ""O my Lady Budur, what unseemly words are these?"" Cried the Princess, ""Woe to thee pestilent crone that thou art! I ask thee again where is my beloved, the goodly youth with the shining face and the slender form, the jetty eyes and the joined eyebrows, who lay with me last night from supper-tide until near daybreak?"" She rejoined ""By Allah, O my lady, I have seen no young man nor any other. I conjure thee, carry not this unseemly jest too far lest we all lose our lives; for perhaps the joke may come to thy father's ears and who shall then deliver us from his hand?""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Ninety-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the duenna bespake the Lady Budur in these words, ""Allah upon thee, O my lady! carry not this unseemly jest too far; for perhaps it may come to thy father's ears, and who shall then deliver us from his hand?"" The Princess rejoined, ""In very sooth a youth lay with me last night, one of the fairest-faced of men."" Exclaimed the duenna, ""Heaven preserve thy reason! indeed no one lay with thee last night."" Thereupon the Princess looked at her hand and, finding Kamar al-Zaman's seal-ring on her finger in stead of her own, said to her, ""Woe to thee, thou accursed! thou traitress! wilt thou lie to me and tell me that none lay with me last night and swear to me a falsehood in the name of the Lord?"" Replied the duenna, ""By Allah, I do not lie to thee nor have I sworn falsely."" Then the Princess was incensed by her words and, drawing a sword she had by her, she smote the old woman with it and slew her;[FN#281] whereupon the eunuch and the waiting-women and the concubines cried out at her, and ran to her father and, without stay or delay, acquainted him with her case. So the King went to her, and asked her, ""O my daughter, what aileth thee?""; and she answered, ""O my father, where is the youth who lay with me last night?"" Then her reason fled from her head and she cast her eyes right and left and rent her raiment even to the skirt. When her sire saw this, he bade the women lay hands on her; so they seized her and manacled her, then putting a chain of iron about her neck, made her fast to one of the palace-windows and there left her.[FN#282] Thus far concerning Princess Budur; but as regards her father, King Ghayur, the world was straitened upon him when he saw what had befallen his daughter, for that he loved her and her case was not a little grievous to him. So he summoned on it the doctors and astrologers and men skilled in talisman- writing and said to them, ""Whoso healeth my daughter of what ill she hath, I will marry him to her and give him half of my kingdom; but whoso cometh to her and cureth her not, I will strike off his head and hang it over her palace-gate."" Accordingly, all who went in to her, but failed to heal her, he beheaded and hung their heads over the palace-gates, till he had beheaded on her account forty doctors and crucified forty astrologers; wherefor the general held aloof from her, all the physicians having failed to medicine her malady; and her case was a puzzle to the men of science and the adepts in cabalistic characters. And as her longing and passion redoubled and love and distraction were sore upon her, she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets,

""My fondness, O my moon, for thee my foeman is, *
             And to thy comradeship the nights my thought compel:
In gloom I bide with fire that flames below my ribs, *
             Whose lowe I make comparison with heat of Hell:
I'm plagued with sorest stress of pine and ecstasy; *
             Nor clearest noon tide can that horrid pain dispel.""

Then she sighed and repeated these also,

""Salams fro' me to friends in every stead; *
             Indeed to all dear friends do I incline:
Salams, but not salams that bid adieu; *
             Salams that growth of good for you design:
I love you dear, indeed, nor less your land, *
             But bide I far from every need of mine!""

And when the Lady Budur ceased repeating her poetry, she wept till her eyes waxed sore and her cheeks changed form and hue, and in this condition she continued three years. Now she had a foster-brother, by name Marzawán,[FN#283] who was travelling in far lands and absent from her the whole of this time. He loved her with an exceeding love, passing the love of brothers; so when he came back he went in to his mother and asked for his sister, the Princess Budur. She answered him, ""O my son, thy sister hath been smitten with madness and hath passed these three years with a chain of iron about her neck; and all the physicians and men of science have failed of healing her."" When Marzawan heard these words he said, ""I must needs go in to her; peradventure I may discover what she hath, and be able to medicine her;"" and his mother replied, ""Needs must thou visit her, but wait till to morrow, that I may contrive some thing to suit thy case."" Then she went a-foot to the palace of the Lady Budur and, accosting the eunuch in charge of the gates, made him a present and said to him, ""I have a daughter, who was brought up with thy mistress and since then I married her; and, when that befel the Princess which befel her, she became troubled and sore concerned, and I desire of thy favour that my daughter may go in to her for an hour and look on her; and then return whence she came, so shall none know of it."" Quoth the eunuch, ""This may not be except by night, after the King hath visited his child and gone away; then come thou and thy daughter."" So she kissed the eunuch's hand and, returning home, waited till the morrow at nightfall; and when it was time she arose and sought her son Marzawan and attired him in woman's apparel; then, taking his hand in hers, led him towards the palace, and ceased not walking with him till she came upon the eunuch after the Sultan had ended his visit to the Princess. Now when the eunuch saw her, he rose to her, and said, ""Enter, but do not prolong thy stay!"" So they went in and when Marzawan beheld the Lady Budur in the aforesaid plight, he saluted her, after his mother had doffed his woman's garb: then he took out of their satchel books he had brought with him; and, lighting a wax- candle, he began to recite certain conjurations Thereupon the Princess looked at him and recognising him, said, ""O my brother, thou hast been absent on thy travels' and thy news have been cut off from us."" He replied, ""True! but Allah hath brought me back safe and sound, I am now minded to set out again nor hath aught delayed me but the news I hear of thee; wherefore my heart burned for thee and I came to thee, so haply I may free thee of thy malady."" She rejoined, O my brother, thinkest thou it is madness aileth me?"" ""Yes."" answered he, and she said, ""Not so, by Allah! 'tis even as saith the poet,

'Quoth they 'Thou rav'st on him thou lov'st': quoth I, *
             'The sweets of love are only for th' insane!'
Love never maketh Time his friend befriend; *
             Only the Jinn-struck wight such boon can gain:
Well! yes, I'm mad: bring him who madded me *
             And, if he cure m: madness, blame restrain!'""

Then she let Marzawan know that she was love-daft and he said ""Tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee: haply there may be in my hand something which shall be a means of deliverance for thee.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of da, and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Marzawar thus addressed Princess Budur, ""Tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee: haply Allah may inspire me with a means of deliverance for thee."" Quoth she, ""O my brother, hear my story which is this. One night I awoke from sleep, in the last third of the night[FN#284] and, sitting up, saw by my side the handsomest of youths that be, and tongue faileth to describe him, for he was as a willow-wand or an Indian rattan-cane. So methought it was my father who had done on this wise in order thereby to try me, for that he had consulted me concerning wedlock, when the Kings sought me of him to wife, and I had refused. It was this though withheld me from arousing him, for I feared that, if I did aught of embraced him, he would peradventure inform my father of m, doings. But in the morning, I found on my finger his seal-ring, in place of my own which he had taken. And, O my brother, m, heart was seized with love of him at first sight; and, for the violence of my passion and longing, I have never savoured the taste of sleep and have no occupation save weeping alway and repeating verses night and day. And this, O my brother, is my story and the cause of my madness."" Then she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets,

""Now Love hast banished all that bred delight; *
             With that heart-nibbling fawn my joys took flight:
Lightest of trifles lover's blood to him *
             Who wastes the vitals of the hapless wight!
For him I'm jealous of my sight and thought; *
             My heart acts spy upon my thought and sight:
Those long-lashed eyelids rain on me their shafts *
             Guileful, destroying hearts where'er they light:
Now, while my portion in the world endures, *
             Shall I behold him ere I quit world-site?
What bear I for his sake I'd hide, but tears *
             Betray my feelings to the spy's despight.
When near, our union seemeth ever far; *
             When far, my thoughts to him aye nearest are.""

And presently she continued, ""See then, O my brother, how thou mayest aid me in mine affliction."" So Marzawan bowed his head ground-wards awhile, wondering and not knowing what to do, then he raised it and said to her, ""All thou hast spoken to me I hold to be true, though the case of the young man pass my understanding: but I will go round about all lands and will seek for what may heal thee; haply Allah shall appoint thy healing to be at my hand. Meanwhile, take patience and be not disquieted."" Thereupon Marzawan farewelled her, praying that she might be constant and left her repeating these couplets,

""Thine image ever companies my sprite, *
            For all thou'rt distant from the pilgrim's sight:
But my heart-wishes e'er attract thee near: *
            What is the lightning's speed to Thought's swift flight?
Then go not thou, my very light of eyes *
             Which, when thou'rt gone, lack all the Kohl of light.""

Then Marzawan returned to his mother's house, where he passed the night. And when the morrow dawned, having equipped himself for his journey, he fared forth and ceased not faring from city to city and from island to island for a whole month, till he came to a town named Al-Tayrab.[FN#285] Here he went about scenting news of the townsfolk, so haply he might light on a cure for the Princess's malady, for in every capital he entered or passed by, it was reported that Queen Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, had lost her wits. But arriving at Al-Tayrab city, he heard that Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman, was fallen sick and afflicted with melancholy madness. So Marzawan asked the name of the Prince's capital and they said to him, ""It is on the Islands of Khalidan and it lieth distant from our city a whole month's journey by sea, but by land it is six months' march."" So he went down to the sea in a ship which was bound for the Khalidan Isles, and she sailed with a favouring breeze for a whole month, till they came in sight of the capital; and there remained for them but to make the land when, behold, there came out on them a tempestuous wind which carried away the masts and rent the canvas, so that the sails fell into the sea and the ship capsized, with all on board,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the ship capsized with all on board, each sought his own safety; and as for Marzawan the set of the sea carried him under the King's palace, wherein was Kamar al-Zaman. And by the decree of destiny it so happened that this was the day on which King Shahriman gave audience to his Grandees and high officers, and he was sitting, with his son's head on his lap, whilst an eunuch fanned away the flies; and the Prince had not spoken neither had he eaten nor drunk for two days, and he was grown thinner than a spindle.[FN#286] Now the Wazir was standing respectfully a-foot near the latticed window giving on the sea and, raising his eyes, saw Marzawan being beaten by the billows and at his last gasp; whereupon his heart was moved to pity for him, so he drew near to the King and moving his head towards him said, ""I crave thy leave, O King, to go down to the court of the pavilion and open the water-gate that I may rescue a man who is at the point of drowning in the sea and bring him forth of danger into deliverance; peradventure, on this account Allah may free thy son from what he hath!"" The King replied, ""O thou Wazir, enough is that which hath befallen my son through thee and on shine account. Haply, if thou rescue this drowning man, he will come to know our affairs, and look on my son who is in this state and exult over me; but I swear by Allah, that if this half-drowned wretch come hither and learn our condition and look upon my son and then fare forth and speak of our secrets to any, I will assuredly strike off thy head before his; for thou, O my Minister art the cause of all that hath betided us, first and last. Now do as thou wilt."" Thereupon the Wazir sprang up and, opening the private pastern which gave upon the sea, descended to the causeway; then walked on twenty steps and came to the water where he saw Marzawan nigh unto death. So he put out his hand to him and, catching him by his hair, drew him ashore in a state of insensibility, with belly full of water and eyes half out of his head. The Wazir waited till he came to himself, when he pulled off his wet clothes and clad him in a fresh suit, covering his head with one of his servants' turbands; after which he said to him, Know that I have been the means of saving thee from drowning: do not thou requite me by causing my death and shine own.""ÄAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir did to Marzawan what he did, he thus addressed him Know that I have been the cause of saving thee from drowning so requite me not by causing my death and shine own."" Asked Marzawan, And how so?""; and the Wazir answered, ""Thou art at this hour about to go up and pass among Emirs and Wazirs all of them silent and none speaking, because of Kamar al-Zaman the son of the Sultan."" Now when Marzawan heard the name of Kamar al-Zaman, he knew that this was he whom he had heard spoken of in sundry cities and of whom he came in search, but he feigned ignorance and asked the Wazir, ""And who is Kamar al-Zaman? Answered the Minister, ""He is the son of Sultan Shahriman and he is sore sick and lieth strown on his couch restless alway, eating not nor drinking neither sleeping night or day; indeed he is nigh upon death and we have lost hope of his living and are certain that he is dying. Beware lest thou look too long on him, or thou look on any other than that where thou settest thy feet: else thou art a lost man, and I also."" He replied, ""Allah upon thee, O Wazir, I implore thee, of thy favour, acquaint me touching this youth thou describest, what is the cause of the condition in which he is."" The Wazir replied, ""I know none, save that, three years ago, his father required him to wed, but he refused; whereat the King was wroth and imprisoned him. And when he awoke on the morrow, he fancied that during the night he had been roused from sleep and had seen by his side a young lady of passing loveliness, whose charms tongue can never express; and he assured us that he had plucked off her seal-ring from her finger and had put it on his own and that she had done likewise; but we know not the secret of all this business. So by Allah, O my son, when thou comest up with me into the palace, look not on the Prince, but go thy way; for the Sultan's heart is full of wrath against me."" So said Marzawan to himself, ""By Allah; this is the one I sought!"" Then he followed the Wazir up to the palace, where the Minister seated himself at the Prince's feet; but Marzawan found forsooth nothing to do but go up to Kamar al-Zaman and stand before him at gaze. Upon this the Wazir, died of affright in his skin, and kept looking at Marzawan and signalling him to wend his way; but he feigned not to see him and gave not over gazing upon Kamar al- Zaman, till he was well assured that it was indeed he whom he was seeking,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Marzawan looked upon Kamar al-Zaman and knew that it was indeed he whom he was seeking, he cried, ""Exalted be Allah, Who hath made his shape even as her shape and his complexion as her complexion and his cheek as her cheek!'' Upon this Kamar al-Zaman opened his eyes and gave earnest ear to his speech; and, when Marzawan saw him inclining to hear, he repeated these couplets[FN#287],

""I see thee full of song and plaint and love's own ecstasy;
Delighting in describing all the charms of loveliness:

Art smit by stroke of Love or hath shaft-shot wounded thee?
None save the wounded ever show such signals of distress!
Ho thou! crown the wine cup and sing me singular
Praises to Sulaymá, Al-Rabáb, Tan'oum addrest;[FN#288]

Go round the grape-vine sun[FN#289] which for mansion hath a jar;
Whose East the cup boy is, and here my mouth that opes for West.

I'm jealous of the very clothes that dare her sides enroll
When she veils her dainty body of the delicatest grace:

I envy every goblet of her lips that taketh toll
When she sets the kissing cup on that sweetest kissing-place.

But deem not by the keen-edged scymitar I'm slain—
The hurts and harms I dree are from arrows of her eyes.

I found her finger tips, as I met her once again,
Deep-reddened with the juice of the wood that ruddy dyes;[FN#290]

And cried, 'Thy palms thou stainedst when far away was I
And this is how thou payest one distracted by his pine!'

Quoth she (enkindling in my heart a flame that burned high
Speaking as one who cannot hide of longing love the sign),

'By thy life, this is no dye used for dyeing; so forbear
Thy blame, nor in charging me with falsing Love persist!

But when upon our parting-day I saw thee haste to fare,

The while were bared my hand and my elbow and my wrist;

'I shed a flood of blood-red tears and with fingers brushed away; Hence blood-reddened were the tips and still blood-red they remain.'

Had I wept before she wept, to my longing-love a prey,
Before repentance came, I had quit my soul of pain;

But she wept before I wept and I wept to see her care
And I said, 'All the merit to precedent;'[FN#291]

Blame me not for loving her, now on self of Love I swear
For her sake, for her only, these pains my soul torment.

She hath all the lere of Lukmán[FN#292] and Yúsuf's beauty lief;
Sweet singer David's voice and Maryam's chastity:

While I've all Jacob's mourning and Jonah's prison-grief,
And the sufferings of Job and old Adam's history:

Yet kill her not, albeit of my love for her I die;
But ask her why my blood to her was lawful. ask her why?""

When Marzawan recited this ode, the words fell upon Kamar al- Zaman's heart as freshness after fever and returning health; and he sighed and, turning his tongue in his mouth, said to his sire, ""O my father, let this youth come and sit by my side.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to his sire, ""O my father, allow this youth to come and sit by my side."" Now when the King heard these words from his son, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, though at the first his heart had been set against Marzawan and he had determined that the stranger's head needs must be stricken off: but when he heard Kamar al-Zaman speak, his anger left him and he arose and drawing Marzawan to him, seated him by his son and turning to him said, ""Praised be Allah for thy safety!"" He replied, ""Allah preserve thee! and preserve thy son to thee!"" and called down blessings on the King. Then the King asked, ""From what country art thou?""; and he answered, ""From the Islands of the Inland Sea, the kingdom of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas and the Seven Palaces."" Quoth King Shahriman, ""Maybe thy coming shall be blessed to my son and Allah vouchsafe to heal what is in him."" Quoth Marzawan, ""Inshallah, naught shall be save what shall be well!"" Then turning to Kamar al-Zaman, he said to him in his ear unheard of the King and his court, 'O my lord! be of good cheer, and hearten thy heart and let shine eyes be cool and clear and, with respect to her for whose sake thou art thus, ask not of her case on shine account. But thou keptest thy secret and fellest sick, while she told her secret and they said she had gone mad; so she is now in prison, with an iron chain about her neck, in most piteous plight; but, Allah willing, the healing of both of you shall come from my hand."" Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, his life returned to him and he took heart and felt a thrill of joy and signed to his father to help him sit up; and the King was like to fly for gladness and rose hastily and lifted him up. Presently, of his fear for his son, he shook the kerchief of dismissal[FN#293]; and all the Emirs and Wazirs withdrew; then he set two pillows for his son to lean upon, after which he bade them perfume the palace with saffron and decorate the city, saying to Marzawan, ""By Allah, O my son, of a truth shine aspect be a lucky and a blessed!"" And he made as much of him as he might and called for food, and when they brought it, Marzawan came up to the Prince and said, ""Rise, eat with me."" So he obeyed him and ate with him, and all the while the King invoked blessings on Marzawan and said, ""How auspicious is thy coming, O my son!"" And when the father saw his boy eat, his joy and gladness redoubled, and he went out and told the Prince's mother and all the household. Then he spread throughout the palace the good news of the Prince's recovery and the King commanded the decoration of the city and it was a day of high festival. Marzawan passed that night with Kamar al-Zaman, and the King also slept with them in joy and delight for his son's recovery.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Shahriman also passed that night with them in the excess of his joy for his son's recovery. And when the next morning dawned, and the King had gone away and the two young men were left alone, Kamar al-Zaman told his story from beginning to end to Marzawan who said, ""In very sooth I know her with whom thou didst foregather; her name is the Princess Budur and she is daughter to King Ghayur."" Then he related to him all that had passed with the Princess from first to last and acquainted him with the excessive love she bore him, saying, ""All that befel thee with thy father hath befallen her with hers, and thou art without doubt her beloved, even as she is shine; so brace up thy resolution and take heart, for I will bring thee to her and unite you both anon and deal with you even as saith the poet,

""Albe to lover adverse be his love, *
             And show aversion howso may he care;
Yet will I manage that their persons[FN#294] meet, *
             E'en as the pivot of a scissor pair.""

And he ceased not to comfort and solace and encourage Kamar al- Zaman and urged him to eat and drink till he ate food and drank wine, and life returned to him and he was saved from his ill case; and Marzawan cheered him and diverted him with talk and songs and stories, and in good time he became free of his disorder and stood up and sought to go to the Hammam.[FN#295] So Marzawan took him by the hand and both went to the bath, where they washed their bodies and made them clean.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundredth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman, went to the Hammam, his father in his joy at this event freed the prisoners, and presented splendid dresses to his grandees and bestowed large alm-gifts upon the poor and bade decorate the city seven days. Then quoth Marzawan to Kamar al-Zaman, ""Know, O my lord, that I came not from the Lady Budur save for this purpose, and the object of my journey was to deliver her from her present case; and it remaineth for us only to devise how we may get to her, since thy father cannot brook the thought of parting from thee. So it is my counsel that to-morrow thou ask his leave to go abroad hunting. Then do thou take with thee a pair of saddle-bags full of money and mount a swift steed, and lead a spare horse, and I will do the like, and say to thy sire, 'I have a mind to divert myself with hunting the desert and to see the open country and there to pass one night.' Suffer not any servant to follow us, for as soon as we reach the open country, we will go our ways."" Kamar al- Zaman rejoiced in this plan with great joy and cried, ""It is good."" Then he stiffened his back and, going in to his father, sought his leave and spoke as he had been taught, and the King consented to his going forth a-hunting and said, ""O my son, blessed be the day that restoreth thee to health! I will not gainsay thee in this; but pass not more than one night in the desert and return to me on the morrow; for thou knowest that life is not good to me without thee, and indeed I can hardly believe thee to be wholly recovered from what thou hadst,[FN#296] because thou art to me as he of whom quoth the poet,

'Albe by me I had through day and night *
             Solomon's carpet and the Chosroes' might,
Both were in value less than wing of gnat, *
             Unless these eyne could hold thee aye in sight.'""[FN#297]

Then the King equipped his son Kamar al-Zaman and Marzawan for the excursion, bidding make ready for them four horses, together with a dromedary to carry the money and a camel to bear the water and belly timber; and Kamar al-Zaman forbade any of his attendants to follow him. His father farewelled him and pressed him to his breast and kissed him, saying, ""I ask thee in the name of Allah, be not absent from me more than one night, wherein sleep will be unlawful to me, for I am even as saith the poet,

'Thou present, in the Heaven of heavens I dwell; *
             Bearing shine absence is of hells my Hell:
Pledged be for thee my soul! If love for thee *
             Be crime, my crime is of the fellest fell.
Does love-lowe burn thy heart as burns it mine, *
             Doomed night and day Gehenna-fire to smell?'""

Answered Kamar al-Zaman, ""O my father, Inshallah, I will lie abroad but one night!"" Then he took leave of him, and he and Marzawan mounted and leading the spare horses, the dromedary with the money and the camel with the water and victual, turned their faces towards the open country;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawning day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and First Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman and Marzawan fared forth and turned their faces towards the open country; and they travelled from the first of the day till nightfall, when they halted and ate and drank and fed their beasts and rested awhile; after which they again took horse and ceased not journeying for three days, and on the fourth they came to a spacious tract wherein was a thicket. They alighted in it and Marzawan, taking the camel and one of the horses, slaughtered them and cut off their flesh and stripped their bones. Then he doffed from Kamar al-Zaman his shirt and trousers which he smeared with the horse's blood and he took the Prince's coat which he tore to shreds and befouled with gore; and he cast them down in the fork of the road. Then they ate and drank and mounting set forward again; and, when Kamar al- Zaman asked why this was done, and said, ""What is this O my brother, and how shall it profit us?""; Marzawan replied, ""Know that thy father, when we have outstayed the second night after the night for which we had his leave, and yet we return not, will mount and follow in our track till he come hither; and, when he happeneth upon this blood which I have spilt and he seeth thy shirt and trousers rent and gore-fouled, he will fancy that some accident befel thee from bandits or wild-beasts, so he will give up hope of thee and return to his city, and by this device we shall win our wishes."" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, ""By Allah, this be indeed a rare device! Thou hast done right well.''[FN#298] Then the two fared on days and nights and all that while Kamar al-Zaman did naught but complain when he found himself alone, and he ceased not weeping till they drew near their journeys end, when he rejoiced and repeated these verses,

""Wilt tyrant play with truest friend who thinks of thee each
             hour, * And after showing love-desire betray indifference?
May I forfeit every favour if in love I falsed thee, *
             If thee I left, abandon me by way of recompense:
But I've been guilty of no crime such harshness to deserve, *
             And if I aught offended thee I bring my penitence;
Of Fortune's wonders one it is thou hast abandoned me, *
             But Fortune never wearieth of showing wonderments.""

When he had made an end of his verses, Marzawan said to him, ""Look! these be King Ghayur's Islands;"" whereat Kamar al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done, and kissed him between the eyes and strained him—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Marzawan said ""Look! these be the Islands of King Ghayur;"" Kamar al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done and kissed him between the eyes and strained him to his bosom. And after reaching the Islands and entering the city they took up their lodging in a khan, where they rested three days from the fatigues of their wayfare; after which Marzawan carried Kamar al-Zaman to the bath and, clothing him in merchant's gear, provided him with a geomantic tablet of gold,[FN#299] with a set of astrological instruments and with an astrolabe of silver, plated with gold. Then he said to him, ""Arise, O my lord, and take thy stand under the walls of the King's palace and cry out, 'I am the ready Reckoner; I am the Scrivener; I am he who weeteth the Sought and the Seeker; I am the finished man of Science; I am the Astrologer accomplished in experience! Where then is he that seeketh?' As soon as the King heareth this, he will send after thee and carry thee in to his daughter the Princess Budur, thy lover; but when about going in to her do thou say to him, 'Grant me three days' delay, and if she recover, give her to me to wife; and if not, deal with me as thou dealest with those who forewent me.' He will assuredly agree to this, so as soon as thou art alone with her, discover thyself to her; and when she seeth thee, she will recover strength and her madness will cease from her and she will be made whole in one night. Then do thou give her to eat and drink. and her father, rejoicing in her recovery, will marry thee to her and share his kingdom with thee; for he hath imposed on himself this condition and so peace be upon thee."" Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words he exclaimed, ""May I never lack thy benefits!"", and, taking the set of instruments aforesaid, sallied forth from the caravanserai in the dress of his order. He walked on till he stood under the walls of King Ghayur's palace, where he began to cry out, saying, ""I am the Scribe, I am the ready Reckoner, I am he who knoweth the Sought and the Seeker; I am he who openeth the Volume and summeth up the Sums;[FN#300] who Dreams can expound whereby the sought is found! Where then is the seeker?"" Now when the city people heard this, they flocked to him, for it was long since they had seen Scribe or Astrologer, and they stood round him and, looking upon him, they saw one in the prime of beauty and grace and perfect elegance, and they marvelled at his loveliness, and his fine stature and symmetry. Presently one of them accosted him and said, ""Allah upon thee, O thou fair and young, with the eloquent tongue! incur not this affray; nor throw thy life away in thine ambition to marry the Princess Budur. Only cast shine eyes upon yonder heads hung up; all their owners have lost their lives in this same venture."" Yet Kamar al-Zaman paid no heed to them, but cried out at the top of his voice, saying, ""I am the Doctor, the Scrivener! I am the Astrologer, the Calculator!"" And all the townsfolk forbade him from this, but he regarded them not at all, saying in his mind, ""None knoweth desire save whoso suffereth it."" Then he began again to cry his loudest, shouting, ""I am the Scrivener, I am the Astrologer!""—And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman in no wise heeded the words of the citizens, but continued to cry out, ""I am the Calculator! I am the Astrologer!"" Thereupon all the townsfolk were wroth with him and said to him, ""Thou art nothing but an imbecile, silly, self-willed lad! Have pity on shine own youth and tender years and beauty and loveliness."" But he cried all the more, ""I am the Astrologer, I am the Calculator! Is there any one that seeketh?"" As he was thus crying and the people forbidding him, behold, King Ghayur heard his voice and the clamour of the lieges and said to his Wazir, ""Go down and bring me yon Astrologer."" So the Wazir, went down in haste, and taking Kamar al-Zaman from the midst of the crowd led him up to the King; and when in the presence he kissed the ground and began versifying,

""Eight glories meet, all, all conjoined in thee, *
             Whereby may Fortune aye thy servant be:
Lere, lordliness, grace, generosity; *
             Plain words, deep meaning, honour, victory!""

When the King looked upon him, he seated him by his side and said to him, ""By Allah, O my son, an thou be not an astrologer, venture not thy life nor comply with my condition; for I have bound myself that whoso goeth in to my daughter and healeth her not of that which hath befallen her I will strike off his head; but whoso healeth her him I will marry to her. So let not thy beauty and loveliness delude thee: for, by Allah! and again, by Allah! If thou cure her not, I will assuredly cut off thy head."" And Kamar al-Zaman replied, ""This is thy right; and I consent, for I wot of this ere came I hither."" Then King Ghayur took the Kazis to witness against him and delivered him to the eunuch, saying, ""Carry this one to the Lady Budur."" So the eunuch took him by the hand and led him along the passage; but Kamar al-Zaman outstripped him and pushed on before, whilst the eunuch ran after him, saying, ""Woe to thee! Hasten not to shine own ruin: never yet saw I astrologer so eager for his proper destruction; but thou weetest not what calamities are before thee."" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman turned away his face from the eunuch,—And Shah razed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the eunuch thus addressed Kamar al-Zaman, ""Patience, and no indecent hurry!""; the Prince turned away his face and began repeating these couplets,

""A Sage, I feel a fool before thy charms; *
             Distraught, I wot not what the words I say:
If say I 'Sun,' away thou dost not pass *
             From eyes of me, while suns go down with day:
Thou hast completed Beauty, in whose praise *
             Speech-makers fail, and talkers lose their way.""

Then the eunuch stationed Kamar al-Zaman behind the curtain of the Princess's door and the Prince said to him, ""Which of the two ways will please thee more, treat and cure thy lady from here or go in and heal her within the curtain?"" The eunuch marvelled at his words and answered, ""An thou heal her from here it were better proof of thy skill."" Upon this Kamar al-Zaman sat down behind the curtain and, taking out ink case, pen and paper, wrote the following: ""This is the writ of one whom passion swayeth,* and whom longing waylayeth * and wakeful misery slayeth * one who despaireth of living * and looketh for naught but dying * with whose mourning heart * nor comforter nor helper taketh part * One whose sleepless eyes * none succoureth from anxieties * whose day is passed in fire * and his night in torturing desire * whose body is wasted for much emaciation * and no messenger from his beloved bringeth him consolation."" And after this he indited the following couplets,

""I write with heart devoted to thy thought, *
             And eyelids chafed by tears of blood they bled;
And body clad, by loving pine and pain, *
             In shirt of leanness, and worn down to thread,
To thee complain I of Love's tormentry, *
             Which ousted hapless Patience from her stead:
A toi! show favour and some mercy deign, *
             For Passion's cruel hands my vitals shred.""

And beneath his lines he wrote these cadenced sentences, ""The heart's pain is removed * by union with the beloved * and whomso his lover paineth * only Allah assaineth! * If we or you have wrought deceit * may the deceiver win defeat! * There is naught goodlier than a lover who keeps faith * with the beloved who works him scathe."" Then, by way of subscription, he wrote, ""From the distracted and despairing man * whom love and longing trepan * from the lover under passion's ban * the prisoner of transport and distraction * from this Kamar al-Zaman * son of Shahriman * to the peerless one * of the fair Houris the pearl-union * to the Lady Budur * daughter of King Al Ghayur * Know thou that by night I am sleepless * and by day in distress * consumed with increasing wasting and pain * and longing and love unfain * abounding in sighs * with tear flooded eyes * by passion captive ta'en * of Desire the slain * with heart seared by the parting of us twain * the debtor of longing bane, of sickness cup-companion * I am the sleepless one, who never closeth eye * the slave of love, whose tears run never dry * for the fire of my heart is still burning * and never hidden is the flame of my yearning."" Then on the margin Kamar al-Zaman wrote this admired verse,

""Salem from graces hoarded by my Lord *
             To her, who holds my heart and soul in hoard!""

And also these,

""Pray'ee grant me some words from your lips, belike *
           Such mercy may comfort and cool these eyne:
From the stress of my love and my pine for you, *
             I make light of what makes me despised, indign:
Allah guard a folk whose abode was far, *
             And whose secret I kept in the holiest shrine:
Now Fortune in kindness hath favoured me *
             Thrown on threshold dust of this love o' mine:
By me bedded I looked on Budúr, whose sun *
             The moon of my fortunes hath made to shine.""

Then, having affixed his seal-ring to the missive, he wrote these couplets in the place of address,

""Ask of my writ what wrote my pen in dole, *
             And hear my tale of misery from this scroll;
My hand is writing while my tears down flow, *
             And to the paper 'plains my longing soul:
My tears cease not to roll upon this sheet, *
             And if they stopped I'd cause blood-gouts to roll.""

And at the end he added this other verse,

""I've sent the ring from off thy finger bore *
           I when we met, now deign my ring restore!""

Then Kamar al-Zaman set the Lady Budur's ring inside the letter and sealed it and gave it to the eunuch, who took it and went in with it to his mistress.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman, after setting the seal-ring inside the epistle, gave it to the eunuch who took it and went in with it to his mistress; and, when the Lady Budur opened it, she found therein her own very ring. Then she read the paper and when she understood its purport and knew that it was from her beloved, and that he in person stood behind the curtain, her reason began to fly and her breast swelled for joy and rose high; and she repeated these couplets,

""Long, long have I bewailed the sev'rance of our loves, *
             With tears that from my lids streamed down like burning
             rain;
And vowed that, if the days deign reunite us two, *
            My lips should never speak of severance again:
Joy hath o'erwhelmed me so that, for the very stress *
             Of that which gladdens me to weeping I am fain.
Tears are become to you a habit, O my eyes, *
             So that ye weep as well for gladness as for pain.''[FN#301]

And having finished her verse, the Lady Budur stood up forthwith and, firmly setting her feet to the wall, strained with all her might upon the collar of iron, till she brake it from her neck and snapped the chains. Then going forth from behind the curtain she threw herself on Kamar al-Zaman and kissed him on the mouth, like a pigeon feeding its young.[FN#302] And she embraced him with all the stress of her love and longing and said to him, ""O my lord do I wake or sleep and hath the Almighty indeed vouchsafe] us reunion after disunion? Laud be to Allah who hath our loves repaired, even after we despaired!"" Now when the eunuch saw her in this case, he went off running to King Ghayur and, kissing the ground before him, said, ""O my lord, know that this Astrologer is indeed the Shaykh of all astrologers, who are fools to him, all of them; for verily he hath cured thy daughter while standing behind the curtain and without going in to her."" Quoth the King, ""Look well to it, is this news true?"" Answered the eunuch, ""O my lord, rise and come and see for thyself how she hath found strength to break the iron chains and is come forth to the Astrologer, kissing and embracing him."" Thereupon the King arose and went in to his daughter who, when she saw him, stood up in haste and covered her head,[FN#303] and recited these two couplets,

""The toothstick love I not; for when I say, *
             'Siwák,'[FN#304] I miss thee, for it sounds 'Siwá-ka'.
The caper-tree I love; for when I say, *
             'Arák'[FN#305] it sounds I look on thee, 'Ará-ka.'""

Thereupon the King was so transported for joy at her recovery that he felt like to fly and kissed her between the eyes, for he loved her with dearest love; then, turning to Kamar al-Zaman, he asked him who he was, and said, ""What countryman art thou?"" So the Prince told him his name and rank, and informed him that he was the son of King Shahriman, and presently related to him the whole story from beginning to end; and acquainted him with what happened between himself and the Lady Budur; and how he had taken her seal-ring from her finger and had placed it on his own; whereat Ghayur marvelled and said, ""Verily your story deserveth in books to be chronicled, and when you are dead and gone age after age be read."" Then he summoned Kazis and witnesses forthright and married the Lady Budur to Prince Kamar al-Zaman; after which he bade decorate the city seven days long. So they spread the tables with all manner of meats, whilst the drums beat and the criers anounced the glad tidings, and all the troops donned their richest clothes; and they illuminated the city and held high festival. Then Kamar al-Zaman went in to the Lady Budur and the King rejoiced in her recovery and in her marriage; and praised Allah for that He had made her to fall in love with a goodly youth of the sons of Kings. So they unveiled her and displayed the bride before the bridegroom; and both were the living likeness of each other in beauty and comeliness and grace and love-allurement. Then Kamar al-Zaman lay with her that night and took his will of her, whilst she in like manner fulfilled her desire of him and enjoyed his charms and grace; and they slept in each other's arms till the morning. On the morrow, the King made a wedding-feast to which he gathered all comers from the Islands of the Inner and Outer Seas, and he spread the tables with choicest viands nor ceased the banquetting for a whole month. Now when Kamar al-Zaman had thus fulfilled his will and attained his inmost desire, and whenas he had tarried awhile with the Princess Budur, he bethought him of his father, King Shahriman, and saw him in a dream, saying, ""O my son, is it thus thou dealest with me?"" and recited in the vision these two couplets,

""Indeed to watch the darkness-moon he blighted me, *
             And to star-gaze through longsome night he plighted me:
Easy, my heart! for haply he'll unite with thee; *
             And patience, Sprite! with whatso ills he dight to thee.""

Now after seeing his father in the dream and hearing his re preaches, Kamar al-Zaman awoke in the morning, afflicted and troubled, whereupon the Lady Budur questioned him and he told her what he had seen.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman acquainted the Lady Budur with what he had seen in his dream, she and he went in to her sire and, telling him what had passed, besought his leave to travel. He gave the Prince the permission he sought; but the Princess said, ""O my father, I cannot bear to be parted from him."" Quoth Ghayur, her sire, ""Then go thou with him,"" and gave her leave to be absent a whole twelvemonth and afterwards to visit him in every year once; so she kissed his hand and Kamar al-Zaman did the like. Thereupon King Ghayur proceeded to equip his daughter and her bridegroom for the journey, and furnished them with outfit and appointments for the march; and brought out of his stables horses marked with his own brand, blood-dromedaries[FN#306] which can journey ten days without water, and prepared a litter for his daughter, besides loading mules and camels with victual; moreover, he gave them slaves and eunuchs to serve them and all manner of travellinggear; and on the day of departure, when King Ghayur took leave of Kamar al-Zaman, he bestowed on him ten splendid suits of cloth of gold embroidered with stones of price, together with ten riding horses and ten she-camels, and a treasury of money;[FN#307] and he charged him to love and cherish his daughter the Lady Budur. Then the King accompanied them to the farthest limits of his Islands where, going in to his daughter Budur in the litter, he kissed her and strained her to his bosom, weeping and repeating,

""O thou who wooest Severance, easy fare! *
             For love-embrace belongs to lover-friend:
Fare softly! Fortune's nature falsehood is, *
             And parting shall love's every meeting end.""

Then leaving his daughter, he went to her husband and bade him farewell and kissed him; after which he parted from them and, giving the order for the march he returned to his capital with his troops. The Prince and Princess and their suite fared on without stopping through the first day and the second and the third and the fourth, nor did they cease faring for a whole month till they came to a spacious champaign, abounding in pasturage, where they pitched their tents; and they ate and drank and rested, and the Princess Budur lay down to sleep. Presently, Kamar al-Zaman went in to her and found her lying asleep clad in a shift of apricot-coloured silk that showed all and everything; and on her head was a coif of gold-cloth embroidered with pearls and jewels. The breeze raised her shift which laid bare her navel and showed her breasts and displayed a stomach whiter than snow, each one of whose dimples would contain an ounce of benzoin- ointment.[FN#308] At this sight, his love and longing redoubled, and he began reating,

""An were it asked me when by hell-fire burnt, *
             When flames of heart my vitals hold and hem,
'Which wouldst thou chose, say wouldst thou rather them, *
             Or drink sweet cooling draught?' I'd answer, 'Them!' ""

Then he put his hand to the band of her petticoat-trousers and drew it and loosed it, for his soul lusted after her, when he saw a jewel, red as dye-wood, made fast to the band. He untied it and examined it and, seeing two lines of writing graven thereon, in a character not to be read, marvelled and said in his mind, ""Were not this bezel something to her very dear she had not bound it to her trousers-band nor hidden it in the most privy and precious place about her person, that she might not be parted from it. Would I knew what she cloth with this and what is the secret that is in it."" So saying, he took it and went outside the tent to look at it in the light,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he took the bezel to look at it in the light, the while he was holding it behold, a bird swooped down on him and, snatching the same from his hand, flew off with it and then lighted on the ground. There-upon Kamar al-Zaman fearing to lose the jewel, ran after the bird; but it flew on before him, keeping just out of his reach, and ceased not to draw him on from dale to dale and from hill to hill, till the night starkened and the firmament darkened, when it roosted on a high tree. So Kamar al-Zaman stopped under the tree confounded in thought and faint for famine and fatigue, and giving himself up for lost, would have turned back, but knew not the way whereby he came, for that darkness had overtaken him. Then he exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious the Great!""; and laying him down under the tree (whereon was the bird) slept till the morning, when he awoke and saw the bird also wake up and fly away. He arose and walked after it, and it flew on little by little before him, after the measure of his faring; at which he smiled and said, ""By Allah, a strange thing! Yesterday, this bird flew before me as fast as I could run, and to-day, knowing that I have awoke tired and cannot run, he flieth after the measure of my faring. By Allah, this is wonderful! But I must needs follow this bird whether it lead me to death or to life; and I will go wherever it goeth, for at all events it will not abide save in some inhabited land.[FN#309] So he continued to follow the bird which roosted every night upon a tree; and he ceased not pursuing it for a space of ten days, feeding on the fruits of the earth and drinking of its waters. At the end of this time, he came in sight of an inhabited city, whereupon the bird darted off like the glance of the eye and, entering the town, disappeared from Kamar al-Zaman, who knew not what it meant or whither it was gone; so he marvelled at this and exclaimed, ""Praise be to Allah who hath brought me in safety to this city!"" Then he sat down by a stream and washed his hands and feet and face and rested awhile; and, recalling his late easy and pleasant life of union with his beloved and contrasting it with his present plight of trouble and fatigue and distress and strangerhood and famine and severance, the tears streamed from his eyes and he began repeating these cinquains,

""Pain had I hid thy handwork, but it showed, *
             Changed sleep for wake, and wake with me abode:
When thou didst spurn my heart I cried aloud *
             Pate, hold thy hand and cease to gird and goad:
                          In dole and danger aye my sprite I spy!
An but the Lord of Love were just to me, *
             Sleep fro' my eyelids ne'er were forced to flee.
Pity, my lady, one for love o' thee *
             Prom his tribes darling brought to low degree:
                          Love came and doomed Wealth beggar-death to die.
The railers chide at thee: I ne'er gainsay, *
             But stop my ears and dumbly sign them Nay:
'Thou lov'st a slender may,' say they; I say, *
             'I've picked her out and cast the rest away:'
                          Enough; when Fate descends she blinds man's
                          eye!""[FN#310]

And as soon as he had finished his poetry and had taken his rest, he rose and walked on little by little, till he entered the city.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that as soon as Kamar al-Zaman had finished his poetry and had taken his rest, he arose and entered the city-gate[FN#311] not knowing whither he should wend. He crossed the city from end to end, entering by the land-gate, and ceased not faring on till he came out at the sea- gate, for the city stood on the sea-shore. Yet he met not a single one of its citizens. And after issuing from the land-gate he fared forwards and ceased not faring till he found himself among the orchards and gardens of the place; and, passing among the trees presently came to a garden and stopped before its door; where-upon the keeper came out to him and saluted him. The Prince returned his greeting and the gardener bade him welcome, saying, ""Praised be Allah that thou hast come off safe from the dwellers of this city! Quick, come into the garth, ere any of the townfolk see thee."" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered that garden, wondering in mind, and asked the keeper, ""What may be the history of the people of this city and who may they be?"" The other answered, ""Know that the people of this city are all Magians: but Allah upon thee, tell me how thou camest to this city and what caused thy coming to our capital."" Accordingly Kamar al-Zaman told the gardener all that had befallen him from beginning to end, whereat he marvelled with great marvel and said, ""Know, O my son, that the cities of Al-Islam lie far from us; and between us and them is a four months' voyage by sea and a whole twelve months' journey by land. We have a ship which saileth every year with merchandise to the nearest Moslem country and which entereth the seas of the Ebony Islands and thence maketh the Khalidan Islands, the dominions of King Shahriman."" Thereupon Kamar al- Zaman considered awhile and concluded that he could not do better than abide in the garden with the gardener and become his assistant, receiving for pay one fourth of the produce. So he said to him, ""Wilt thou take me into thy service, to help thee in this garden?"" Answered the gardener, ""To hear is to consent;"" and began teaching him to lead the water to the roots of the trees. So Kamar al-Zaman abode with him, watering the trees and hoeing up the weeds and wearing a short blue frock which reached to his knees. And he wept floods of tears; for he had no rest day or night, by reason of his strangerhood and he ceased not to repeat verses upon his beloved, amongst others the following couplets,


""Ye promised us and will ye not keep plight? *
             Ye said a say and shall not deed be dight?
We wake for passion while ye slumber and sleep; *
             Watchers and wakers claim not equal right:
We vowed to keep our loves in secrecy, *
             But spake the meddler and you spoke forthright:
O friend in pain and pleasure, joy and grief, *
             In all case you, you only, claim my sprite!
Mid folk is one who holds my prisoned heart; *
             Would he but show some ruth for me to sight.
Not every eye like mine is wounded sore, *
             Not every heart like mine love-pipings blight:
Ye wronged me saying, Love is wrongous aye *
             Yea! ye were right, events have proved that quite.
Forget they one love-thralled, whose faith the world *
             Robs not, though burn the fires in heart alight:
If an my foeman shall become my judge, *
             Whom shall I sue to remedy his despight?
Had not I need of love nor love had sought, *
             My heart forsure were not thus love-distraught.""

Such was the case with Kamar al-Zaman; but as regards his wife, the Lady Budur, when she awoke she sought her husband and found him not: then she saw her petticoat-trousers undone, for the band had been loosed and the bezel lost, whereupon she said to herself, ""By Allah, this is strange! Where is my husband? It would seem as if he had taken the talisman and gone away, knowing not the secret which is in it. Would to Heaven I knew whither can he have wended! But it must needs have been some extraordinary matter that drew him away, for he cannot brook to leave me a moment. Allah curse the stone and damn its hour!"" Then she considered awhile and said in her mind, ""If I go out and tell the varlets and let them learn that my husband is lost they will lust after me: there is no help for it but that I use stratagem. So she rose and donned some of her husband's clothes and riding- boots, and a turband like his, drawing one corner of it across her face for a mouth-veil.[FN#312] Then, setting a slave-girl in her litter, she went forth from the tent and called to the pages who brought her Kamar al-Zaman's steed; and she mounted and bade them load the beasts and resume the march. So they bound on the burdens and departed; and she concealed her trick, none doubting but she was Kamar al-Zaman, for she favoured him in face and form; nor did she cease journeying, she and her suite, days and nights, till they came in sight of a city overlooking the Salt Sea, where they pitched their tents without the walls and halted to rest. The Princess asked the name of the town and was told, ""It is called the City of Ebony; its King is named Armanús, and he hath a daughter Hayát al-Nufús[FN#313] hight,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Lady Budur halted within sight of the Ebony City to take her rest, King Armanus sent a messenger, to learn what King it was who had encamped without his capital; so the messenger, coming to the tents, made inquiry anent their King, and was told that she was a King's son who had lost the way being bound for the Khalidan Islands; whereupon he returned to King Armanus with the tidings; and, when the King heard them, he straightway rode out with the lords of his land to greet the stranger on arrival. As he drew near the tents the Lady Budur came to meet him on foot, whereupon the King alighted and they saluted each other. Then he took her to the city and, bringing her up to the palace, bade them spread the tables and trays of food and commanded them to transport her company and baggage to the guess house. So they abode there three days; at the end of which time the King came in to the Lady Budur. Now she had that day gone to the Hammam and her face shone as the moon at its full, a seduction to the world and a rending of the veil of shame to mankind; and Armanus found her clad in a -suit of silk, embroidered with gold and jewels; so he said to her, 'O my son, know that I am a very old man, decrepit withal, and Allah hath blessed me with no child save one daughter, who resembleth thee in beauty and grace; and I am now waxed unfit for the conduct of the state. She is shine, O my son; and, if this my land please thee and thou be willing to abide and make thy home here, I will marry thee to her and give thee my kingdom and so be at rest."" When Princess Budur heard this, she bowed her head and her forehead sweated for shame, and she said to herself. ""How shall I do, and I a woman? If I refuse and depart from him, I cannot be safe but that haply send after me troops to slay me; and if I consent, belike I shall be put to shame. I have lost my beloved Kamar al-Zaman and know not what is become of him; nor can I escape from this scrape save by holding my peace and consenting and abiding here, till Allah bring about what is to be."" So she raised her head and made submission to King Armanus, saying, ""Hearkening and obedience!""; whereat he rejoiced and bade the herald make proclamation throughout the Ebony Islands to hold high festival and decorate the houses. Then he assembled his Chamberlains and Nabobs, and Emirs and Wazirs and his officers of state and the Kazis of the city; and, formally abdicating his Sultanate, endowed Budur therewith and invested her in all the vestments of royalty. The Emirs and Grandees went in to her and did her homage, nothing doubting but that she was a young man, and all who looked on her bepissed their bag-trousers, for the excess of her beauty and loveliness. Then, after the Lady Budur had been made Sultan and the drums had been beaten in announcement of the glad event, and she had been ceremoniously enthroned, King Armanus proceeded to equip his daughter Hayat al-Nufus for marriage, and in a few days, they brought the Lady Budur in to her, when they seemed as it were two moons risen at one time or two suns in conjunction. So they entered the bridal-chamber and the doors were shut and the curtains let down upon them, after the attendants had lighted the wax-candles and spread for them the carpet-bed. When Budur found herself alone with the Princess Hayat al-Nufus, she called to mind her beloved Kamar al-Zaman and grief was sore upon her. So she wept for his absence, and estrangement and she began repeating,

""O ye who fled and left my heart in pain low li'en, *
             No breath of life if found within this frame of mine:
I have an eye which e'er complains of wake, but lo! *
             Tears occupy it would that wake content these eyne!
After ye marched forth the lover 'bode behind; *
             Question of him what pains your absence could design!
But for the foods of tears mine eyelids rail and rain, *
             My fires would flame on high and every land calcine.
To Allah make I moan of loved ones lost for aye, *
             Who for my pine and pain no more shall pain and pine:
I never wronged them save that over love I nurst: *
             But Love departs us lovers into blest and curst.""

And when she had finished her repeating, the Lady Budur sat down beside the Princess Hayat al-Nufus and kissed her on the mouth; after which rising abruptly, she made the minor ablution and betook herself to her devotions; nor did she leave praying till Hayat al-Nufus fell asleep, when she slips into bed and lay with her back to her till morning. And when day had broke the King and Queen came in to their daughter and asked her how she did. whereupon she told them what she had seen, and repeated to them the verses she had heard. Thus far concerning Hayat al-Nufus and her father; but as regards Queen Budur she went forth and seated herself upon the royal throne and all the Emirs and Captains and Officers of state came up to her and wished her joy of the kingship, kissing the earth before her and calling down blessings upon her. And she accosted them with smiling face and clad them in robes of honour, augmenting the fiefs of the high officials and giving largesse to the levies; wherefore all the people loved her and offered up prayers for the long endurance of her reign, doubting not but that she was a man. And she ceased not sitting all day in the hall of audience, bidding and forbidding; dispensing justice, releasing prisoners and remitting the customs-dues, till nightfall, when she withdrew to the apartment prepared for her. Here she found Hayat al-Nufus seated, so she sat down by her side and, clapping her on the back, coaxed and caressed her and kissed her between the eyes, and fell to versifying in these couplets,

""What secret kept I these my tears have told, *
             And my waste body must my love unfold:
Though hid my pine, my plight on parting day *
             To every envious eye my secret sold:
O ye who broke up camp, you've left behind *
            My spirit wearied and my heart a-cold:
In my hearts core ye dwell, and now these eyne *
             Roll blood-drops with the tears they whilome rolled:
The absent will I ransom with my soul; *
             All can my yearning for their sight behold:
I have an eye whose babe,[FN#314] for love of thee, *
             Rejected sleep nor hath its tears controlled.
The foeman bids me patient bear his loss, *
             Ne'er may mine ears accept the ruth he doled!
I tricks their deme of me, and won my wish *
             Of Kamar al-Zaman's joys manifold:
He joins all perfect gifts like none before, *
             Boasted such might and main no King of old:
Seeing his gifts, Bin Zá'idah's[FN#315] largesse *
             Forget we, and Mu'áwiyah mildest-soul'd:[FN#316]
Were verse not feeble and o'er short the time *
             I had in laud of him used all of rhyme.""

Then Queen Budur stood up and wiped away her tears and, making the lesser ablution,[FN#317] applied her to pray: nor did she give over praying till drowsiness overcame the Lady Hayat al- Nufus and she slept, whereupon the Lady Budur came and lay by her till the morning. At daybreak, she arose and prayed the dawn- prayer; and presently seated herself on the royal throne and passed the day in ordering and counter ordering and giving laws and administering justice. This is how it fared with her; but as regards King Armanus he went in to his daughter and asked her how she did; so she told him all that had befallen her and repeated to him the verses which Queen Budur had recited, adding, ""O my father, never saw I one more abounding in sound sense and modesty than my husband, save that he cloth nothing but weep and sigh."" He answered, ""O my daughter, have patience with him yet this third night, and if he go not in unto thee and do away thy maidenhead, we shall know how to proceed with him and oust him from the throne and banish him the country."" And on this wise he agreed with his daughter what course he would take.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Tenth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Armanus had agreed with his daughter on this wise and had determined what course he would take and night came on, Queen Budur arose from the throne of her kingdom and betaking herself to the palace, entered the apartment prepared for her. There she found the wax-candles lighted and the Princess Hayat al-Nufus seated and awaiting her; whereupon she bethought her of her husband and what had betided them both of sorrow and severance in so short a space; she wept and sighed and groaned groan upon groan, and began improvising these couplets,

""News of my love fill all the land, I swear, *
             As suns on Ghazá[FN#318]-wold rain heat and glare:
Speaketh his geste but hard its sense to say; *
             Thus never cease to grow my cark and care:
I hate fair Patience since I loved thee; *
             E'er sawest lover hate for love to bear?
A glance that dealt love-sickness dealt me death, *
             Glances are deadliest things with torments rare:
He shook his love locks down and bared his chin, *
             Whereby I spied his beauties dark and fair:
My care, my cure are in his hands; and he *
             Who caused their dolour can their dole repair:
His belt went daft for softness of his waist; *
             His hips, for envy, to uprise forbear:
His brow curl-diademed is murky night; *
             Unveil 't and lo! bright Morn shows brightest light.""

When she had finished her versifying, she would have risen to pray, but, lo and behold! Hayat al-Nufus caught her by the skirt and clung to her saying, ""O my lord, art thou not ashamed before my father, after all his favour, to neglect me at such a time as this?"" When Queen Budur heard her words, she sat down in the same place and said, ""O my beloved, what is this thou sayest?"" She replied, ""What I say is that I never saw any so proud of himself as thou. Is every fair one so disdainful? I say not this to incline thee to me; I say it only of my fear for thee from King Armanus; because he purposeth, unless thou go in unto me this very night, and do away my maidenhead, to strip thee of the kingship on the morrow and banish thee his kingdom; and peradventure his excessive anger may lead him to slay thee. But I, O my lord, have ruth on thee and give thee fair warning; and it is thy right to reck.""[FN#319] Now when Queen Budur heard her speak these words, she bowed her head ground-wards awhile in sore perplexity and said in herself, ""If I refuse I'm lost; and if I obey I'm shamed. But I am now Queen of all the Ebony Islands and they are under my rule, nor shall I ever again meet my Kamar al- Zaman save in this place; for there is no way for him to his native land but through the Ebony Islands. Verily, I know not what to do in my present case, but I commit my care to Allah who directeth all for the best, for I am no man that I should arise and open this virgin girl."" Then quoth Queen Budur to Hayat al- Nufus, ""O my beloved, that I have neglected thee and abstained from thee is in my own despite."" And she told her her whole story from beginning to end and showed her person to her, saying, ""I conjure thee by Allah to keep my counsel, for I have concealed my case only that Allah may reunite me with my beloved Kamar al- Zaman and then come what may.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Eleventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Lady Budur acquainted Hayat al-Nufus with her history and bade her keep it secret, the Princess heard her with extreme wonderment and was moved to pity and prayed Allah to reunite her with her beloved, saying, ""Fear nothing, O my sister; but have patience till Allah bring to pass that which must come to pass:"" and she began repeating,

""None but the men of worth a secret keep;
With worthy men a secret's hidden deep;
As in a room, so secrets lie with me,
Whose door is sealed, lock shot and lost the key.""[FN#320]

And when Hayat al-Nufus had ended her verses, she said, ""O my sister, verily the breasts of the noble and brave are of secrets the grave; and I will not discover shine."" Then they toyed and embraced and kissed and slept till near the Mu'ezzin's call to dawn prayer, when Hayat al-Nufus arose and took a pigeon-poult,[FN#321] and cut its throat over her smock and besmeared herself with its blood. Then she pulled off her petticoat-trousers and cried aloud, where-upon her people hastened to her and raised the usual lullilooing and outcries of joy and gladness. Presently her mother came in to her and asked her how she did and busied herself about her and abode with her till evening; whilst the Lady Budur arose with the dawn, and repaired to the bath and, after washing herself pure, proceeded to the hall of audience, where she sat down on her throne and dispensed justice among the folk. Now when King Armanus heard the loud cries of joy, he asked what was the matter and was informed of the consummation of his daughter's marriage; whereat he rejoiced and his breast swelled with gladness and he made a great marriage-feast whereof the merry-making lasted a long time. Such was their case: but as regards King Shahriman it was on this wise. After his son had fared forth to the chase accompanied by Marzawan, as before related, he tarried patiently awaiting their return at nightfall; but when his son did not appear he passed a sleepless night and the dark hours were longsome upon him; his restlessness was excessive, his excitement grew upon him and he thought the morning would never dawn. Anc when day broke he sat expecting his son and waited till noon, but he came not; whereat his heart forebode separation and was fired with fears for Kamar al-Zaman; and he cried, ""Alas! my son!"" and he wept till his clothes were drenched with tears, and repeated with a beating heart,


""Love's votaries I ceased not to oppose, *
             Till doomed to taste Love's bitter and Love's sweet:
I drained his rigour-cup to very dregs, *
             Self humbled at its slaves' and freemen's feet:
Fortune had sworn to part the loves of us; *
             She kept her word how truly, well I weet!""

And when he ended his verse, he wiped away his tears and bade his troops make ready for a march and prepare for a long expedition. So they all mounted and set forth, headed by the Sultan, whose heart burnt with grief and was fired with anxiety for his son Kamar al-Zaman; and they advanced by forced marches. Now the King divided his host into six divisions, a right wing and a left wing, a vanguard and a rear guard;[FN#322] and bade them rendezvous for the morrow at the cross-roads. Accordingly they separated and scoured the country all the rest of that day till night, and they marched through the night and at noon of the ensuing day they joined company at the place where four roads met. But they knew not which the Prince followed, till they saw the sign of torn clothes and sighted shreds of flesh and beheld blood still sprinkled by the way and they noted every piece of the clothes and fragment of mangled flesh scattered on all sides. Now when King Shahriman saw this, he cried from his heart-core a loud cry, saying, ""Alas, my son!""; and buffeted his face and plucks his beard and rent his raiment, doubting not but his son was dead. Then he gave himself up to excessive weeping and wailing, and the troops also wept for his weeping, all being assured that Prince Kamar al-Zaman had perished. They threw dust on their heads, and the night surprised them shedding tears and lamenting till they were like to die. Then the King with a heart on fire and with burning sighs spake these couplets,

""Chide not the mourner for bemourning woe; *
             Enough is yearning every Ill to show:
He weeps for stress of sorrow and of pain, *
             And these to thee best evidence his lowe:
Happy![FN#323] of whom Love sickness swore that ne'er *
             Should cease his eye lids loving tears to flow:
He mourns the loss of fairest, fullest Moon, *
             Shining o'er all his peers in glorious glow:
But death made drink a brimming cup, what day *
             He fared from natal country fain to go:
His home left he and went from us to grief; *
             Nor to his brethren could he say adieu:
Yea, his loss wounded me with parting pangs, *
             And separation cost me many a throe:
He fared farewelling, as he fared, our eyes; *
            Whenas his Lord vouch-safed him Paradise.""

And when King Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned with the troops to his capital,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Twelfth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned with the troops to his capital, giving up his son for lost, and deeming that wild beasts or banditti had set upon him and torn him to pieces; and made proclamation that all in the Khalidan Islands should don black in mourning for him. Moreover, he built, in his memory, a pavilion, naming it House of Lamentations; and on Mondays and Thursdays he devoted himself to the business of the state and ordering the affairs of his levies and lieges; and the rest of the week he was wont to spend in the House of Lamentations, mourning for his son and bewailing him with elegiac verses,[FN#324] of which the following are some:—

""My day of bliss is that when thou appearest; *
             My day of bale[FN#325] is that whereon thou farest:
Though through the night I quake in dread of death; *
            Union wi' thee is of all bliss the dearest.""

And again he said,

""My soul be sacrifice for one, whose going *
             Afflicted hearts with sufferings sore and dread:
Let joy her widowed term[FN#326] fulfil, for I *
             Divorced joy with the divorce thrice-said.""[FN#327]

Such was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Queen Budur daughter of King Ghayur, she abode as ruler in the Ebony Islands, whilst the folk would point to her with their fingers, and say, ""Yonder is the son-in-law of King Armanus."" And every night she lay with Hayat al-Nufus, to whom she lamented her desolate state and longing for her husband Kamar al-Zaman; weeping and describing to her his beauty and loveliness, and yearning to enjoy him though but in a dream: And at times she would repeat,

""Well Allah wots that since my severance from thee, *
             I wept till forced to borrow tears at usury:
'Patience!' my blamer cried, 'Heartsease right soon shalt see!' *
             Quoth I, 'Say, blamer, where may home of Patience be?'""

This is how it fared with Queen Budur; but as regards Kamar al- Zaman, he abode with the gardener in the garden for no short time, weeping night and day and repeating verses bewailing the past time of enjoyment and delight; whilst the gardener kept comforting him and assuring him that the ship would set sail for the land of the Moslems at the end of the year. And in this condition he continued till one day he saw the folk crowding together and wondered at this; but the gardener came in to him and said, ""O my son, give over work for this day nor lead water to the trees; for it is a festival day, whereon folk visit one another. So take thy rest and only keep shine eye on the garden, whilst I go look after the ship for thee; for yet but a little while and I send thee to the land of the Moslems."" Upon this, he went forth from the garden leaving to himself Kamar al-Zaman, who fell to musing upon his case till his heart was like to break and the tears streamed from his eyes. So he wept with excessive weeping till he swooned away and, when he recovered, he rose and walked about the garden, pondering what Time had done with him and bewailing the long endurance of his estrangement and separation from those he loved. As he was thus absorbed in melancholy thought, his foot stumbled and he fell on his face, his forehead striking against the projecting root of a tree; and the blow cut it open and his blood ran down and mingled with his tears Then he rose and, wiping away the blood, dried his tears and bound his brow with a piece of rag; then continued his walk about the garden engrossed by sad reverie. Presently, he looked up at a tree and saw two birds quarrelling thereon, and one of them rose up and smote the other with its beak on the neck and severed from its body its head, wherewith it flew away, whilst the slain bird fell to the ground before Kamar al-Zaman. As it lay, behold, two great birds swooped down upon it alighting, one at the head and the other at the tail, and both drooped their wings and bowed their bills over it and, extending their necks towards it, wept. Kamar al-Zaman also wept when seeing the birds thus bewail their mate, and called to mind his wife and father, And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Thirteenth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman wept and lamented his separation from spouse and sire, when he beheld those two birds weeping over their mate. Then he looked at the twain and saw them dig a grave and therein bury the slain bird; after which they flew away far into the firmament and disappeared for a while; but presently they returned with the murtherer-bird and, alighting on the grave of the murthered, stamped on the slayer till they had done him to death. Then they rent his belly and tearing out his entrails, poured the blood on the grave of the slain[FN#328]: moreover, they stripped off his skin and tare his flesh in pieces and, pulling out the rest of the bowels, scattered them hither and thither. All this while Kamar al-Zaman was watching them wonderingly; but presently, chancing to look at the place where the two birds had slain the third, he saw therein something gleaming. So he drew near to it and noted that it was the crop of the dead bird. Whereupon he took it and opened it and found the talisman which had been the cause of his separation from his wife. But when he saw it and knew it, he fell to the ground a-fainting for joy; and, when he revived, he said, ""Praised be Allah! This is a foretaste of good and a presage of reunion with my beloved."" Then he examined the jewel and passed it over his eyes[FN#329]; after which he bound it to his forearm, rejoicing in coming weal, and walked about till nightfall awaiting the gardener's return; and when he came not, he lay down and slept in his wonted place. At daybreak he rose to his work and, girding his middle with a cord of palm- fibre, took hatchet and basket and walked down the length of the garden, till he came to a carob-tree and struck the axe into its roots. The blow rang and resounded; so he cleared away the soil from the place and discovered a trap-door and raised it.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When It was the Two Hundred and Fourteenth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman raised the trap-door, he found a winding stair, which he descended and came to an ancient vault of the time of Ad and Thamúd,[FN#330] hewn out of the rock. Round the vault stood many brazen vessels of the bigness of a great oil-jar which he found full of gleaming red gold: whereupon he said to himself, ""Verily sorrow is gone and solace is come!"" Then he mounted from the souterrain to the garden and, replacing the trap-door as it was before, busied himself in conducting water to the trees till the last of the day, when the gardener came back and said to him, ""O my son, rejoice at the good tidings of a speedy return to thy native land: the merchants are ready equipped for the voyage and the ship in three days' time will set sail for the City of Ebony, which is the first of the cities of the Moslems, and after making it, thou must travel by land a six months' march till thou come to the Islands of Khalidan, the dominions of King Shahriman."" At this Kamar al-Zaman rejoiced and began repeating,

""Part not from one whose wont is not to part from you; *
             Nor with your cruel taunts an innocent mortify:
Another so long parted had ta'en heart from you, *
             And had his whole condition changed,—but not so I.""

Then he kissed the gardener's hand and said, ""O my father, even as thou hast brought me glad tidings, so I also have great good news for thee,' and told him anent his discovery of the vault; whereat the gardener rejoiced and said, ""O my son, fourscore years have I dwelt in this garden and have never hit on aught whilst thou, who hast not sojourned with me a year, hast discovered this thing; wherefore it is Heaven's gift to thee, which shall end thy crosses and aid thee to rejoin thy folk and foregather with her thou lovest."" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, ""There is no help but it must be shared between me and thee."" Then he carried him to the underground-chamber and showed him the gold, which was in twenty jars: he took ten and the gardener ten, and the old man said to him, ""O my son, fill thyself leather bottles[FN#331] with the sparrow-olives[FN#332] which grow in this garden, for they are not found except in our land; and the merchants carry them to all parts. Lay the gold in the bottles and strew it over with olives: then stop them and cover them and take them with thee in the ship."" So Kamar al-Zaman arose without stay or delay and took fifty leather bottles and stored in each somewhat of the gold, and closed each one after placing a layer of olives over the gold; and at the bottom of one of the bottles he laid the talisman. Then sat he down to talk with the gardener, confident of speedy reunion with his own people and saying to himself, ""When I come to the Ebony Islands I will journey thence to my father's country and enquire for my beloved Budur. Would to Heaven I knew whether she returned to her own land or journeyed on to my father's country or whether there befel her any accident by the way."" And he began versifying,

""Love in my breast they lit and fared away, *
           And far the land wherein my love is pent:
Far lies the camp and those who camp therein; *
            Par is her tent-shrine, where I ne'er shall tent.
Patience far deaf me when from me they fled; *
             Sleep failed mine eyes, endurance was forspent:
They left and with them left my every joy, *
             Wending with them, nor find I peace that went:
They made these eyes roll down love tears in flood, *
             And lacking them these eyne with tears are drent.
When my taste spins once again would see them, *
             When pine and expectation but augment,
In my heart's core their counterfeits I trace, *
             With love and yearning to behold their grace.""

Then, while he awaited the end of the term of days, he told the gardener the tale of the birds and what had passed between them; whereat the hearer wondered; and they both lay down and slept till the morning. The gardener awoke sick and abode thus two days; but on the third day, his sickness increased on him, till they despaired of his life and Kamar al-Zaman grieved with sore grief for him. Meanwhile behold, the Master and his crew came and enquired for the gardener; and, when Kamar al-Zaman told them that he was sick, they asked, ""Where be the youth who is minded to go with us to the Ebony Islands?"" ""He is your servent and he standeth before you!"" answered the Prince and bade them carry the bottles of olives to the ship; so they transported them, saying, ""Make haste, thou, for the wind is fair;"" and he replied, ""I hear and obey."" Then he carried his provaunt on board and, returning to bid the gardener farewell, found him in the agonies of death; so he sat down at his head and closed his eyes, and his soul departed his body; whereupon he laid him out and committed him to the earth unto the mercy of Allah Almighty. Then he made for the ship but found that she had already weighed anchor and set sail; nor did she cease to cleave the seas till she disappeared from his sight. So he went back to whence he came heavy-hearted with whirling head; and neither would he address a soul nor return a reply; and reaching the garden and sitting down in cark and care he threw dust on his head and buffeted his cheeks.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Fifteenth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the ship sped on her course, Kamar al-Zaman returned to the garden in cark and care; but- anon he rented the place of its owner and hired a man to help him in irrigating the trees. Moreover, he repaired the trap-door and he went to the underground chamber and bringing the rest of the gold to grass, stowed it in other fifty bottles which he filled up with a layer of olives. Then he enquired of the ship and they told him that it sailed but once a year, at which his trouble of mind redoubled and he cried sore for that which had betided him, above all for the loss of the Princess Budur's talisman, and spent his nights and days weeping and repealing verses. Such was his case; but as regards the ship she sailed with a favouring wind till she reached the Ebony Islands. Now by decree of destiny, Queen Budur was sitting at a lattice-window overlooking the sea and saw the galley cast anchor upon the strand. At this sight, her heart throbbed and she took horse with the Chamberlains and Nabobs and, riding down to the shore, halted by the ship, whilst the sailors broke bulk and bore the bales to the storehouses; after which she called the captain to her presence and asked what he had with him. He answered ""O King, I have with me in this ship aromatic drugs and cosmetics and healing powders and ointments and plasters and precious metals and rich stuffs and rugs of Yemen leather, not to be borne of mule or camel, and all manner of otters and spices and perfumes, civet and ambergris and camphor and Sumatra aloes-wood, and tamerinds[FN#333] and sparrow-olives to boot, such as are rare to find in this country."" When she heard talk of sparrow- olives her heart longed for them and she said to the ship-master, ""How much of olives hast thou?"" He replied, ""Fifty bottles full, but their owner is not with us, so the King shall take what he will of them."" Quoth she, ""Bring them ashore, that I may see them.'' Thereupon he called to the sailors, who brought her the fifty bottles; and she opened one and, looking at the olives, said to the captain, ""I will take the whole fifty and pay you their value, whatso it be."" He answered, ""By Allah, O my lord, they have no value in our country; moreover their shipper tarried behind us, and he is a poor man."" Asked she, ""And what are they worth here?"" and he answered ""A thousand dirhams."" ""I will take them at a thousand,"" she said and bade them carry the fifty bottles to the palace. When it was night, she called for a bottle of olives and opened it, there being none in the room but herself and the Princess Hayat al-Nufus. Then, placing a dish before her she turned into it the contents of the jar, when there fell out into the dish with the olives a heap of red gold; and she said to the Lady Hayat al-Nufus, ""This is naught but gold!"" So she sent for the rest of the bottles and found them all full of precious metal and scarce enough olives to fill a single jar. Moreover, she sought among the gold and found therein the talisman, which she took and examined and behold, it was that which Kamar al- Zaman had taken from off the band of her petticoat trousers. Thereupon she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Sixteenth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Budur saw the talisman she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon; and when she recovered she said to herself, ""Verily, this talisman was the cause of my separation from my beloved Kamar al-Zaman; but now it is an omen of good."" Then she showed it to Hayat al-Nufus and said to her, ""This was the cause of disunion and now, please Allah, it shall be the cause of reunion."" As soon as day dawned she seated herself on the royal throne and sent for the ship-master, who came into the presence and kissed the ground before her. Quoth she, ""Where didst thou leave the owner of these olives?"" Quoth he, ""O King of the age, we left him in the land of the Magians and he is a gardener there."" She rejoined, ""Except thou bring him to me, thou knowest not the harm which awaiteth thee and thy ship."" Then she bade them seal up the magazines of the merchants and said to them, ""Verily the owner of these olives hath borrowed of me and I have a claim upon him for debt and, unless ye bring him to me, I will without fail do you all die and seize your goods."" So they went to the captain and promised him the hire of the ship, if he would go and return a second time, saying, ""Deliver us from this masterful tyrant."" Accordingly the skipper embarked and set sail and Allah decreed him a prosperous voyage, till he came to the Island of the Magians and, landing by night, went up to the garden. Now the night was long upon Kamar al-Zaman, and he sat, bethinking him of his beloved, and bewailing what had befallen him and versifying,

""A night whose stars refused to run their course, *
             A night of those which never seem outworn:
Like Resurrection-day, of longsome length[FN#334] *
             To him that watched and waited for the morn.""

Now at this moment, the captain knocked at the garden-gate, and Kamar al-Zaman opened and went out to him, whereupon the crew seized him and went down with him on board the ship and set sail forthright; and they ceased not voyaging days and nights, whilst Kamar al-Zaman knew not why they dealt thus with him; but when he questioned them they replied, ""Thou hast offended against the Lord of the Ebony Islands, the son-in-law of King Armanus, and thou hast stolen his monies, miserable that thou art!"" Said he, ""By Allah! I never entered that country nor do I know where it is!"" However, they fared on with him, till they made the Ebony Islands and landing, carried him up to the Lady Budur, who knew him at sight and said, ""Leave him with the eunuchs, that they may take him to the bath."" Then she relieved the merchants of the embargo and gave the captain a robe of honour worth ten thousand pieces of gold; and, after returning to the palace, she went in that night to the Princess Hayat al-Nufus and told her what had passed, saying, ""Keep thou my counsel, till I accomplish my purpose, and do a deed which shall be recorded and shall be read by Kings and commoners after we be dead and gone."" And when she gave orders that they bear Kamar al-Zaman to the bath, they did so and clad him in a royal habit so that, when he came forth, he resembled a willow-bough or a star which shamed the greater and lesser light[FN#335] and its glow, and his life and soul returned to his frame. Then he repaired to the palace and went in to the Princess Budur; and when she saw him she schooled her heart to patience, till she should have accomplished her purpose; and she bestowed on him Mamelukes and eunuchs, camels and mules. Moreover, she gave him a treasury of money and she ceased not advancing him from dignity to dignity, till she made him Lord High Treasurer and committed to his charge all the treasures of the state; and she admitted him to familiar favour and acquainted the Emirs with his rank and dignity. And all loved him, for Queen Budur did not cease day by day to increase his allowances. As for Kamar al-Zaman, he was at a loss anent the reason of her thus honouring him; and he gave gifts and largesse out of the abundance of the wealth; and he devoted himself to the service of King Armanus; so that the King and all the Emirs and people, great and small, adored him and were wont to swear by his life. Nevertheless, he ever marvelled at the honour and favour shown him by Queen Budur and said to himself, ""By Allah, there needs must be a reason for this affection! Peradventure, this King favoureth me not with these immoderate favours save for some ill purpose and, therefore, there is no help but that I crave leave of him to depart his realm."" So he went in to Queen Budur and said to her, ""O King, thou hast overwhelmed me with favours, but it will fulfil the measure of thy bounties if thou take from me all thou hast been pleased to bestow upon me, and permit me to depart."" She smiled and asked, ""What maketh thee seek to depart and plunge into new perils, whenas thou art in the enjoyment of the highest favour and greatest prosperity?"" Answered Kamar al- Zaman, ""O King, verily this favour, if there be no reason for it, is indeed a wonder of wonders, more by token that thou hast advanced me to dignities such as befit men of age and experience, albeit I am as it were a young child."" And Queen Budur rejoined, ""The reason is that I love thee for shine exceeding loveliness and thy surpassing beauty; and if thou wilt but grant me my desire of thy body, I will advance thee yet farther in honour and favour and largesse; and I will make thee Wazir, for all thy tender age even as the folk made me Sultan over them and I no older than thou; so that nowadays there is nothing strange when children take the head and by Allah, he was a gifted man who said,

'It seems as though of Lot's tribe were our days, *
             And crave with love to advance the young in years.'""[FN#336]

When Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was abashed and his cheeks flushed till they seemed a-flame; and he said, ""I need not these favours which lead to the commission of sin; I will live poor in wealth but wealthy in virtue and honour."" Quoth she, ""I am not to be duped by thy scruples, arising from prudery and coquettish ways; and Allah bless him who saith,

'To him I spake of coupling, but he said to me, *
            How long this noyous long persistency?'
But when gold piece I showed him, he cried, *
           'Who from the Almighty Sovereign e'er shall flee?'""

Now when Kamar al-Zaman, heard these words and understood her verses and their import, he said, ""O King, I have not the habit of these doings, nor have I strength to bear these heavy burthens for which elder than I have proved unable; then how will it be with my tender age?"" But she smiled at his speech and retorted, ""Indeed, it is a matter right marvellous how error springeth from the disorder of man's intendiment!! Since thou art a boy, why standest thou in fear of sin or the doing of things forbidden, seeing that thou art not yet come to years of canonical responsibility; and the offences of a child incur neither punishment nor reproof? Verily, thou hast committed thyself to a quibble for the sake of contention, and it is thy duty to bow before a proposal of fruition, so henceforward cease from denial and coyness, for the commandment of Allah is a decree foreordained:[FN#337] indeed, I have more reason than thou to fear falling and by sin to be misled; and well inspired was he who said,

'My prickle is big and the little one said, *
             'Thrust boldly in vitals with lion-like stroke!
Then I, ' 'Tis a sin!; and he, 'No sin to me! *
           So I had him at once with a counterfeit poke.""[FN#338]

When Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, the light became darkness in his sight and he said, ""O King, thou hast in thy household fair women and female slaves, who have not their like in this age: shall not these suffice thee without me? Do thy will with them and let me go!"" She replied, ""Thou sayest sooth, but it is not with them that one who loveth thee can heal himself of torment and can abate his fever; for, when tastes and inclinations are corrupted by vice, they hear and obey other than good advice. So leave arguing and listen to what the poet saith,

'Seest not the bazar with its fruit in rows? *
             These men are for figs and for sycamore[FN#339] those!'

And what another saith,

'Many whose anklet rings are dumb have tinkling belts, *
             And this hath all content while that for want must wail:
Thou bidd'st me be a fool and quit thee for her charms; *
             Allah forfend I leave The Faith, turn Infidel!
Nay, by thy rights of side-beard mocking all her curls, *
             Nor mott nor maid[FN#340] from thee my heart shall spell.'

And yet another,

'O beauty's Union! love for thee's my creed, *
             Free choice of Faith and eke my best desire:
Women I have forsworn for thee; so may *
             Deem me all men this day a shaveling friar.'[FN#341]

And yet another,

'Even not beardless one with girl, nor heed *
             The spy who saith to thee ''Tis an amiss!'
Far different is the girl whose feet one kisses *
             And that gazelle whose feet the earth must kiss.'

And yet another,

'A boy of twice ten is fit for a King!'

And yet another,

'The penis smooth and round was made with anus best to match it, * Had it been made for cunnus' sake it had been formed like hatchet!'

And yet another said,

'My soul thy sacrifice! I chose thee out *
             Who art not menstruous nor oviparous:
Did I with woman mell, I should beget *
             Brats till the wide wide world grew strait for us.'

And yet another,

'She saith (sore hurt in sense the most acute *
             For she had proffered what did not besuit),
'Unless thou stroke as man should swive his wife *
             Blame not when horns thy brow shall incornùte!
Thy wand seems waxen, to a limpo grown, *
             And more I palm it, softer grows the brute!'

And yet another,

'Quoth she (for I to lie with her forbore), *
             'O folly-following fool, O fool to core:
If thou my coynte for Kiblah[FN#342] to thy coigne *
             Reject, we'll shall please thee more.'[FN#343]

And yet another,

'She proffered me a tender coynte *
             Quoth I 'I will not roger thee!'
She drew back, saying, 'From the Faith *
             He turns, who's turned by Heaven's decree![FN#344]
And front wise fluttering, in one day, *
             Is obsolete persistency!'
Then swung she round and shining rump *
             Like silvern lump she showed me!
I cried: 'Well done, O mistress mine! *
             No more am I in pain for thee;
O thou of all that Allah oped[FN#345] *
             Showest me fairest victory!'

And yet another,

'Men craving pardon will uplift their hands; *
             Women pray pardon with their legs on high:
Out on it for a pious, prayerful work! *
             The Lord shall raise it in the depths to lie.'""[FN#346]

When Kamar al-Zaman heard her quote this poetry, and was certified that there was no escaping compliance with what willed she, he said, ""O King of the age, if thou must needs have it so, make covenant with me that thou wilt do this thing with me but once, though it avail not to correct thy depraved appetite, and that thou wilt never again require this thing of me to the end of time; so perchance shall Allah purge me of the sin."" She replied ""I promise thee this thing, hoping that Allah of His favour will relent towards us and blot out our mortal offence; for the girdle of heaven's forgiveness is not indeed so strait, but it may compass us around and absolve us of the excess of our heinous sins and bring us to the light of salvation out of the darkness of error; and indeed excellently well saith the poet,

'Of evil thing the folk suspect us twain; *
             And to this thought their hearts and souls are bent:
Come, dear! let's justify and free their souls *
             That wrong us; one good bout and then—repent!'''[FN#347]

Thereupon she made him an agreement and a covenant and swore a solemn oath by Him who is Self-existent, that this thing should befal betwixt them but once and never again for all time, and that the desire of him was driving her to death and perdition. So he rose up with her, on this condition, and went with her to her own boudoir, that she might quench the lowe of her lust, saying, ""There is no Majesty, and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the fated decree of the All- powerful, the All-wise!""; and he doffed his bag-trousers, shamefull and abashed, with the tears running from his eyes for stress of affright. Thereat she smiled and making him mount upon a couch with her, said to him, ""After this night, thou shalt see naught that will offend thee."" Then she turned to him bussing and bosoming him and bending calf over calf, and said to him, ""Put thy hand between my thighs to the accustomed place; so haply it may stand up to prayer after prostration."" He wept and cried, ""I am not good at aught of this,"" but she said, ""By my life, an thou do as I bid thee, it shall profit thee!"" So he put out his hand, with vitals a-fire for confusion, and found her thighs cooler than cream and softer than silk. The touching of them pleasured him and he moved his hand hither and thither, till it came to a dome abounding in good gifts and movements and shifts, and said in himself, ""Perhaps this King is a hermaphrodite,[FN#348] neither man nor woman quite;"" so he said to her, ""O King, I cannot find that thou hast a tool like the tools of men; what then moved thee to do this deed?"" Then loudly laughed Queen Budur till she fell on her back,[FN#349] and said, ""O my dearling, how quickly thou hast forgotten the nights we have lain together!"" Then she made herself known to him, and he knew her for his wife, the Lady Budur, daughter of King al-Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas. So he embraced her and she embraced him, and he kissed her and she kissed him; then they lay down on the bed of pleasure voluptuous, repeating the words of the poet,

""When his softly bending shape bid him close to my embrace *
             Which clips him all about like the tendrils of the vine
And shed a flood of softness on the hardness of his heart, *
             He yielded though at first he was minded to decline;
And dreading lest the railer's eye should light upon his form, *
             Came armoured with caution to baffle his design:
His waist makes moan of hinder cheeks that weigh upon his feet *
             Like heavy load of merchandise upon young camel li'en;
Girt with his glances scymitar which seemed athirst for blood, *
             And clad in mail of dusky curls that show the sheeniest
             shine,
His fragrance wafted happy news of footstep coming nigh, *
             And to him like a bird uncaged I flew in straightest line:
I spread my cheek upon his path, beneath his sandal-shoon, *
             And lo! the stibium[FN#350] of their dust healed all my hurt
             of eyne.
With one embrace again I bound the banner of our loves[FN#351] *
            And loosed the knot of my delight that bound in bonds
            malign:
Then bade I make high festival, and straight came flocking in *
             Pure joys that know not grizzled age[FN#352] nor aught of
             pain and pine:
The full moon dotted with the stars the lips and pearly teeth *
             That dance right joyously upon the bubbling face of wine:
So in the prayer-niche of their joys I yielded me to what *
             Would make the humblest penitent of sinner most indign.
I swear by all the signs[FN#353] of those glories in his face *
             I'll ne'er forget the Chapter entituled Al-Ikhlas.""[FN#354]

Then Queen Budur told Kamar al-Zaman all that had befallen her from beginning to end and he did likewise; after which he began to upbraid her, saying, ""What moved thee to deal with me as thou hast done this night?"" She replied, ""Pardon me! for I did this by way of jest, and that pleasure and gladness might be increased."" And when dawned the morn and day arose with its sheen and shone, she sent to King Armanus, sire of the Lady Hayat al-Nufus, and acquainted him with the truth of the case and that she was wife to Kamar al-Zaman. Moreover, she told him their tale and the cause of their separation, and how his daughter was a virgin, pure as when she was born. He marvelled at their story with exceeding marvel and bade them chronicle it in letters of gold. Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said, ""O King's son, art thou minded to become my son-in-law by marrying my daughter?"" Replied he, ""I must consult the Queen Budur, as she hath a claim upon me for benefits without stint."" And when he took counsel with her, she said, ""Right is thy recking; marry her and I will be her handmaid; for I am her debtor for kindness and favour and good offices, and obligations manifold, especially as we are here in her place and as the King her father hath whelmed us with benefits.""[FN#355] Now when he saw that she inclined to this and was not jealous of Hayat al-Nufus, he agreed with her upon this matter.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Seventeenth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman agreed with his wife, Queen Budur, upon this matter and told King Armanus what she had said; whereat he rejoiced with great joy. Then he went out and, seating himself upon his chair of estate, assembled all the Wazirs, Emirs, Chamberlains and Grandees, to whom he related the whole story of Kamar al-Zaman and his wife, Queen Budur, from first to last; and acquainted them with his desire to marry his daughter Hayat al-Nufus to the Prince and make him King in the stead of Queen Budur. Whereupon said they all, ""Since he is the husband of Queen Budur, who hath been our King till now, whilst we deemed her son-in-law to King Armanus, we are all content to have him to Sultan over us; and we will be his servants, nor will we swerve from his allegiance."" So Armanus rejoiced hereat and, summoning Kazis and witnesses and the chief officers of state, bade draw up the contract of marriage between Kamar al-Zaman and his daughter, the Princess Hayat al-Nufus. Then he held high festival, giving sumptuous marriage-feasts and bestowing costly dresses of honour upon all the Emirs and Captains of the host; moreover he distributed alms to the poor and needy and set free all the prisoners. The whole world rejoiced in the coming of Kamar al-Zaman to the throne, blessing him and wishing him endurance of glory and prosperity, renown and felicity; and, as soon as he became King, he remitted the customs-dues and released all men who remained in gaol. Thus he abode a long while, ordering himself worthily towards his lieges; and he lived with his two wives in peace, happiness, constancy and content, lying the night with each of them in turn. He ceased not after this fashion during many years, for indeed all his troubles and afflictions were blotted out from him and he forgot his father King Shahriman and his former estate of honour and favour with him. After a while Almighty Allah blessed him with two boy children, as they were two shining moons, through his two wives; the elder whose name was Prince Amjad,[FN#356] by Queen Budur, and the younger whose name was Prince As'ad by Queen Hayat al-Nufus; and this one was comelier than his brother. They were reared in splendour and tender affection, in respectful bearing and in the perfection of training; and they were instructed in penmanship and science and the arts of government and horsemanship, till they attained the extreme accomplishments and the utmost limit of beauty and loveliness; both men and women being ravished by their charms. They grew up side by side till they reached the age of seventeen, eating and drinking together and sleeping in one bed, nor ever parting at any time or tide; wherefore all the people envied them. Now when they came to man's estate and were endowed with every perfection, their father was wont, as often as he went on a journey, to make them sit in his stead by turns in the hall of judgement; and each did justice among the folk one day at a time. But it came to pass, by confirmed fate and determined lot, that love for As'ad (son of Queen Hayat al-Nufus) rose in the heart of Queen Budur, and that affection for Amjad (son of Queen Budur) rose in the heart of Queen Hayat al-Nufus.[FN#357] Hence it was that each of the women used to sport and play with the son of her sister-wife, kissing him and straining him to her bosom, whilst each mother thought that the other's behaviour arose but from maternal affection. On this wise passion got the mastery of the two women's hearts and they became madly in love with the two youths, so that when the other's son came in to either of them, she would press him to her breast and long for him never to be parted from her; till, at last, when waiting grew longsome to them and they found no path to enjoyment, they refused meat and drink and banished the solace of sleep. Presently, the King fared forth to course and chase, bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead, each one day in turn as was their wont.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Eighteenth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King fared forth to sport and hunt, bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead, each one day by turn, as was their wont. Now Prince Amjad sat in judgement the first day, bidding and forbidding, appointing and deposing, giving and refusing; and Queen Hayat al-Nufus, mother of As'ad, wrote to him a letter suing for his favour and discovering to him her passion and devotion; altogether put tiny off the mask and giving him to know that she desired to enjoy him. So she took a scroll and thereon indited these cadences, ""From the love deranged * the sorrowful and estranged * whose torment is prolonged for the longing of thee! * Were I to recount to thee the extent of my care * and what of sadness I bear * the passion which my heart cloth tear * and all that I endure for weeping and unrest * and the rending of my sorrowful breast * my unremitting grief * and my woe without relief * and all my suffering for severance of thee * and sadness and love's ardency * no letter could contain it; nor calculation could compass it * Indeed earth and heaven upon me are strait; and I have no hope and no trust but what from thee I await * Upon death I am come nigh * and the horrors of dissolution I aby * Burning upon me is sore * with parting pangs and estrangement galore * Were I to set forth the yearnings that possess me more and more * no scrolls would suffice to hold such store * and of the excess of my pain and pine, I have made the following lines:- -

Were I to dwell on heart-consuming heat, *
             Unease and transports in my spins meet,
Nothing were left of ink and reeden pen *
             Nor aught of paper; no, not e'en a sheet.

Then Queen Hayat al-Nufus wrapped up her letter in a niece of costly silk scented with musk and ambergris; and folded it up with her silken hair-strings[FN#358] whose cost swallowed down treasures laid it in a handkerchief and gave it to a eunuch bidding him bear it to Prince Amjad.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Nineteenth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that she gave her missive to the eunuch in waiting and bade him bear it to Prince Amjad. And that eunuch went forth ignoring what the future hid for him (for the Omniscient ordereth events even as He willeth); and, going in to the Prince, kissed the ground between his hands and handed to him the letter. On receiving the kerchief he opened it and, reading the epistle and recognizing its gist he was ware that his father's wife was essentially an adulteress and a traitress at heart to her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman. So he waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and railed at women and their works, saying, ""Allah curse women, the traitresses, the imperfect in reason and religion!""[FN#359] Then he drew his sword and said to the eunuch, ""Out on thee, thou wicked slave! Dost thou carry messages of disloyalty for thy lord's wife? By Allah, there is no good in thee, O black of hue and heart, O foul of face and Nature's forming!"" So he smote him on the neck and severed his head from his body; then, folding the kerchief over its contents he thrust it into his breast pocket and went in to his own mother and told her what had passed, reviling and reproaching her, and saying, ""Each one of you is viler than the other; and, by Allah the Great and Glorious, did I not fear ill-manneredly to transgress against the rights of my father, Kamar al-Zaman, and my brother, Prince As'ad, I would assuredly go in to her and cut off her head, even as I cut off that of her eunuch!"" Then he went forth from his mother in a mighty rage; and when the news reached Queen Hayat al-Nufus of what he had done with her eunuch, she abused him[FN#360] and cursed him and plotted perfidy against him. He passed the night, sick with rage, wrath and concern; nor found he pleasure in meat, drink or sleep. And when the next morning dawned Prince As'ad fared forth in his turn to rule the folk in his father's stead, whilst his mother, Hayat al-Nufus, awoke in feeble plight because of what she had heard from Prince Amjad concerning the slaughter of her eunuch. So Prince As'ad sat in the audience-chamber that day, judging and administering justice, appointing and deposing, bidding and forbidding, giving and bestowing. And he ceased not thus till near the time of afternoon-prayer, when Queen Budur sent for a crafty old woman and, discovering to her what was in her heart, wrote a letter to Prince As'ad, complaining of the excess of her affection and desire for him in these cadenced lines, ""From her who perisheth for passion and love-forlorn * to him who in nature and culture is goodliest born * to him who is conceited of his own loveliness * and glories in his amorous grace * who from those that seek to enjoy him averteth his face * and refuseth to show favour unto the self abasing and base * him who is cruel and of disdainful mood * from the lover despairing of good * to Prince As'ad * with passing beauty endowed * and of excelling grace proud * of the face moon bright * and the brow flower-white * and dazzling splendid light * This is my letter to him whose love melteth my body * and rendeth my skin and bones! * Know that my patience faileth me quite * and I am perplexed in my plight * longing and restlessness weary me * and sleep and patience deny themselves to me * but mourning and watching stick fast to me * and desire and passion torment me * and the extremes of languor and sickness have sheet me * Yet may my life be a ransom for thee * albeit thy pleasure be to slay her who loveth thee * and Allah prolong the life of thee * and preserve thee from all infirmity!"" And after these cadences she wrote these couplets,

""Fate hath commanded I become thy fere, *
             O shining like full moon when clearest clear!
All beauty dost embrace, all eloquence; *
             Brighter than aught within our worldly sphere:
Content am I my torturer thou be: *
             Haply shalt alms me with one lovely leer!
Happy her death who dieth for thy love! *
             No good in her who holdeth thee unclear!""

And also the following couplets,

""Unto thee, As'ad! I of passion-pangs complain; *
             Have ruth on slave of love so burnt with flaming pain:
How long, I ask, shall hands of Love disport with me, *
             With longings, dolour, sleepliness and bale and bane?
Anon I 'plain of sea in heart, anon of fire *
             In vitals, O strange case, dear wish, my fairest fain!
O blamer, cease thy blame, and seek thyself to fly *
             From love, which makes these eyne a rill of tears to rain.
How oft I cry for absence and desire, Ah grief! *
             But all my crying naught of gain for me shall gain:
Thy rigours dealt me sickness passing power to bear, *
             Thou art my only leach, assain me an thou deign!
O chider, chide me not in caution, for I doubt *
             That plaguey Love to thee shall also deal a bout.""

Then Queen Budur perfumed the letter-paper with a profusion of odoriferous musk and, winding it in her hairstrings which were of Iraki silk, with pendants of oblong emeralds, set with pearls and stones of price, delivered it to the old woman, bidding her carry it to Prince As'ad.[FN#361] She did so in order to pleasure her, and going in to the Prince, straightway and without stay, found him in his own rooms and delivered to him the letter in privacy; after which she stood waiting an hour or so for the answer. When As'ad had read the paper and knew its purport, he wrapped it up again in the ribbons and put it in his bosom-pocket: then (for he was wrath beyond all measure of wrath) he cursed false women and sprang up and drawing his sword, smote the old trot on the neck and cut off her pate. Thereupon he went in to his mother, Queen Hayat al-Nufus, whom he found lying on her bed in feeble case, for that which had betided her with Prince Amjad, and railed at her and cursed her; after which he left her and fore-gathered with his brother, to whom he related all that had befallen him with Queen Budur, adding, ""By Allah, O my brother, but that I was ashamed before thee, I had gone in to her forthright and had smitten her head off her shoulders!"" Replied Prince Amjad, ""By Allah, O my brother, yesterday when I was sitting upon the seat of judgement, the like of what hath befallen thee this day befel me also with thy mother who sent me a letter of similar purport."" And he told him all that had passed, adding, ""By Allah, O my brother, naught but respect for thee withheld me from going in to her and dealing with her even as I dealt with the eunuch!"" They passed the rest of the night conversing and cursing womankind, and agreed to keep the matter secret, lest their father should hear of it and kill the two women. Yet they ceased not to suffer trouble and foresee affliction. And when the morrow dawned, the King returned with his suite from hunting and sat awhile in his chair of estate; after which he sent the Emirs about their business and went up to his palace, where he found his two wives lying a-bed and both exceeding sick and weak. Now they had made a plot against their two sons and concerted to do away their lives, for that they had exposed themselves before them and feared to be at their mercy and dependent upon their forbearance. When Kamar al-Zaman saw them on this wise, he said to them, ""What aileth you?"" Whereupon they rose to him and kissing his hands answered, perverting the case and saying ""Know, O King, that thy two sons, who have been reared in thy bounty, have played thee false and have dishonoured thee in the persons of thy wives."" Now when he heard this, the light became darkness in his sight, and he raged with such wrath that his reason fled: then said he to them, ""Explain me this matter."" Replied Queen Budur, ""O King of the age, know that these many days past thy son As'ad hath been in the persistent habit of sending me letters and messages to solicit me to lewdness and adultery while I still forbade him from this, but he would not be forbidden; and, when thou wentest forth to hunt, he rushed in on me, drunk and with a drawn sword in his hand, and smiting my eunuch, slew him. Then he mounted on my breast, still holding the sword, and I feared lest he should slay me, if I gainsaid him, even as he had slain my eunuch; so he took his wicked will of me by force. And now if thou do me not justice on him, O King, I will slay myself with my own hand, for I have no need of life in the world after this foul deed."" And Queen Hayat al-Nufus, choking with tears, told him respecting Prince Amjad a story like that of her sister-wife.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Twentieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Queen Hayat al-Nufus told her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman, a story like that of her sister in wedlock, Budur, and, quoth she, ""The same thing befel me with thy son Amjad;"" after which she took to weeping and wailing and said, ""Except thou do me justice on him I will tell my father, King Armanus."" Then both women wept with sore weeping before King Kamar al-Zaman who, when he saw their tears and heard their words, concluded that their story was true and, waxing wroth beyond measure of wrath, went forth thinking to fall upon his two sons and put them to death. On his way he met his father- in-law, King Armanus who, hearing of his return from the chase, had come to salute him at that very hour and, seeing him with naked brand in hand and blood dripping from his nostrils, for excess of rage, asked what ailed him. So Kamar al-Zaman told him all that his sons Amjad and As'ad had done and added, ""And here I am now going in to them to slay them in the foulest way and make of them the most shameful of examples."" Quoth King Armanus (and indeed he too was wroth with them), ""Thou dost well, O my son, and may Allah not bless them nor any sons that do such deed against their father's honour. But, O my son, the sayer of the old saw saith, 'Whoso looketh not to the end hath not Fortune to friend.' In any case, they are thy sons, and it befitteth not that thou kill them with shine own hand, lest thou drink of their death-agony,[FN#362] and anon repent of having slain them whenas repentance availeth thee naught. Rather do thou send them with one of thy Mamelukes into the desert and let him kill them there out of thy sight, for, as saith the adage, 'Out of sight of my friend is better and pleasanter.'[FN#363] And when Kamar al-Zaman heard his father-in-law's words, he knew them to be just; so he sheathed his sword and turning back, sat down upon the throne of his realm. There he summoned his treasurer, a very old man, versed in affairs and in fortune's vicissitudes, to whom he said, ""Go in to my sons, Amjad and As'ad; bind their hands behind them with strong bonds, lay them in two chests and load them upon a mule. Then take horse thou and carry them into mid desert, where do thou kill them both and fill two vials with their blood and bring the same to me in haste."" Replied the treasurer, ""I hear and I obey,"" and he rose up hurriedly and went out forthright to seek the Princes; and, on his road, he met them coming out of the palace-vestibule, for they had donned their best clothes and their richest; and they were on their way to salute their sire and give him joy of his safe return from his going forth to hunt. Now when he saw them, he laid hands on them, saying, ""Omy sons, know ye that I am but a slave commanded, and that your father hath laid a commandment on me; will ye obey his commandment?"" They said, ""Yes""; whereupon he went up to them and, after pinioning their arms, laid them in the chests which he loaded on the back of a mule he had taken from the city. And he ceased not carrying them into the open country till near noon, when he halted in a waste and desolate place and, dismounting from his mare, let down the two chests from the mule's back. Then he opened them and took out Amjad and As'ad; and when he looked upon them he wept sore for their beauty and loveliness; then drawing his sword he said to them, ""By Allah, O my lords, indeed it is hard for me to deal so evilly by you; but I am to be excused in this matter, being but a slave commanded, for that your father King Kamar al-Zaman hath bidden me strike off your heads."" They replied, ""O Emir, do the King's bidding, for we bear with patience that which Allah (to Whom be Honour, Might and Glory!) hath decreed to us; and thou art quit of our blood."" Then they embraced and bade each other farewell, and As'ad said to the treasurer, ""Allah upon thee, O uncle, spare me the sight of my brother's death-agony and make me not drink of his anguish, but kill me first, for that were the easier for me."" And Amjad said the like and entreated the treasurer to kill him before As'ad, saying, ""My brother is younger than I; so make me not taste of his anguish. And they both wept bitter tears whilst the treasurer wept for their weeping;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the treasurer wept for their weeping; then the two brothers embraced and bade farewell and one said to the other, ""All this cometh of the malice of those traitresses, my mother and thy mother; and this is the reward of my forbearance towards thy mother and of thy for bearance towards my mother! But there is no Might and there is no Majesty save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily, we are Allah's and unto Him we are returning.""[FN#364] And As'ad em braced his brother, sobbing and repeating these couplets,

""O Thou to whom sad trembling wights in fear complain! *
           O ever ready whatso cometh to sustain!
The sole resource for me is at Thy door to knock, *
           At whose door knock an Thou to open wilt not deign?
O Thou whose grace is treasured in the one word, Be![FN#365] *
            Favour me, I beseech, in Thee all weals contain.""

Now when Amjad heard his brother's weeping he wept also and pressing him to his bosom repeated these two couplets,

""O Thou whose boons to me are more than one! *
             Whose gifts and favours have nor count nor bound!
No stroke of all Fate's strokes e'er fell on me, *
             But Thee to take me by the hand I found.""
Then said Amjad to the treasurer, ""I conjure thee by the One, Omnipotent, the Lord of Mercy, the Beneficent! slay me before my brother As'ad, so haply shall the fire be quencht in my heart's core and in this life burn no more."" But As'ad wept and exclaimed, ""Not so: I will die first;"" whereupon quoth Amjad, ""It were best that I embrace thee and thou embrace me, so the sword may fall upon us and slay us both at a single stroke."" Thereupon they embraced, face to face and clung to each other straitly, whilst the treasurer tied up the twain and bound them fast with cords, weeping the while. Then he drew his blade and said to them, ""By Allah, O my lords, it is indeed hard to me to slay you! But have ye no last wishes that I may fulfil or charges which I may carry out, or message which I may deliver?"" Replied Amjad, ""We have no wish; and my only charge to thee is that thou set my brother below and me above him, that the blow may fall on me first, and when thou hast killed us and returnest to the King and he asketh thee, 'What heardest thou from them before their death?'; do thou answer, 'Verily thy sons salute thee and say to thee, Thou knewest not if we were innocent or guilty, yet hast thou put us to death and hast not certified thyself of our sin nor looked into our case.' Then do thou repeat to him these two couplets,

'Women are Satans made for woe o' men; *
             I fly to Allah from their devilish scathe:
Source of whatever bale befel our kind, *
            In wordly matters and in things of Faith.'""

Continued Amjad, ""We desire of thee naught but that thou repeat to our sire these two couplets.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was ad the Two Hundred and Twenty-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Amjad added, speaking to the treasurer, ""We desire of thee naught but that thou repeat to our sire these two couplets which thou hast just now heard; and I conjure thee by Allah to have patience with us, whilst I cite to my brother this other pair of couplets."" Then he wept with sore weeping and began,

""The Kings who fared before us showed *
            Of instances full many a show:
Of great and small and high and low *
             How many this one road have trod!""

Now when the treasurer heard these words from Amjad, he wept till his beard was wet, whilst As'ad's eyes brimmed with tears and he in turn repeated these couplets,

""Fate frights us when the thing is past and gone; *
           Weeping is not for form or face alone[FN#366]:
What ails the Nights?[FN#367] Allah blot out our sin, *
            And be the Nights by other hand undone!
Ere this Zubayr-son[FN#368] felt their spiteful hate, *
             Who fled for refuge to the House and Stone:
Would that when Khárijah was for Amru slain[FN#369] *
             They had ransomed Ali with all men they own.""

Then, with cheeks stained by tears down railing he recited also these verses,

""In sooth the Nights and Days are charactered *
            By traitor falsehood and as knaves they lie;
The Desert-reek[FN#370] recalls their teeth that shine; *
            All horrid blackness is their K of eye:
My sin anent the world which I abhor *
            Is sin of sword when sworders fighting hie.""

Then his sobs waxed louder and he said,

""O thou who woo'st a World[FN#371] unworthy, learn *
            'Tis house of evils, 'tis Perdition's net:
A house where whoso laughs this day shall weep *
            The next: then perish house of fume and fret!
Endless its frays and forays, and its thralls *
            Are ne'er redeemed, while endless risks beset.
How many gloried in its pomps and pride, *
            Till proud and pompous did all bounds forget,
Then showing back of shield she made them swill[FN#372] *
            Full draught, and claimed all her vengeance debt.
For know her strokes fall swift and sure, altho' *
             Long bide she and forslow the course of Fate:
So look thou to thy days lest life go by *
             Idly, and meet thou more than thou hast met;
And cut all chains of world-love and desire *
           And save thy soul and rise to secrets higher.""

Now when As'ad made an end of these verses, he strained his brother Amjad in his arms, till they twain were one body, and the treasurer, drawing his sword, was about to strike them, when behold, his steed took fright at the wind of his upraised hand, and breaking its tether, fled into the desert. Now the horse had cost a thousand gold pieces and on its back was a splendid saddle worth much money; so the treasurer threw down his sword, and ran after his beast.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when his horse ran away, the treasurer ran after it in huge concern, and ceased not running to catch the runaway till it entered a thicket. He followed it whilst it dashed through the wood, smiting the earth with its hoofs till it raised a dust-cloud which towered high in air; and snorting and puffing and neighing and waxing fierce and furious. Now there happened to be in this thicket a lion of terrible might; hideous to sight, with eyes sparkling light: his look was grim and his aspect struck fright into man's sprite. Presentry the treasurer turned and saw the lion making towards him; but found no way of escape nor had he his sword with him. So he said in himself, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This strait is come upon me for no other cause but because of Amjad and As'ad; and indeed this journey was unblest from the first!"" Meanwhile the two Princes were grievously oppressed by the heat and grew sore athirst, so that their tongues hung out and they cried for succour, but none came to their relief and they said, ""Would to Heaven we had been slain and were at peace from this pain! But we know not whither the horse hath fled, that the treasurer is gone and hath left us thus pinioned. If he would but come back and do us die, it were easier to us than this torture to aby."" Said As'ad, ""O my brother, be patient, and the relief of Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) shall assuredly come to us; for the horse started not away save of His favour towards us, and naught irketh us but this thirst."" Upon this he stretched and shook himself and strained right and left, till he burst his pinion-bonds; then he rose and unbound his brother and catching up the Emir's sword, said, ""By Allah, we will not go hence, till we look after him and learn what is become of him."" Then they took to following on the trail till it led them to the thicket and they said to each other, ""Of a surety, the horse and the treasurer have not passed out of this wood."" Quoth As'ad, ""Stay thou here, whilst I enter the thicket and search it;"" and Amjad replied, ""I will not let thee go in alone: nor will we enter it but together; so if we escape, we shall escape together and if we perish, we shall perish together."" Accordingly both entered and found that the lion had sprang upon the treasurer, who lay like a sparrow in his grip, calling upon Allah for aid and signing with his hands to Heaven. Now when Amjad saw this, he took the sword and, rushing upon the lion, smote him between the eyes and laid him dead on the ground. The Emir sprang up, marvelling at this escape and seeing Amjad and As'ad, his master's sons, standing there, cast himself at their feet and exclaimed, ""By Allah, O my lords, it were intolerable wrong in me to do you to death. May the man never be who would kill you! Indeed, with my very life, I will ransom you.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the treasurer to Amjad and As'ad, ""With my life will I ransom you both!"" Then he hastily rose and, at once embracing them, enquired how they had loosed their bonds and come thither; whereupon they told him how the bonds of one of them had fallen loose and he had unbound the other, whereto they were helped by the purity of their intentions, and how they had tracked his trail till they came upon him. So he thanked them for their deed and went with them forth of the thicket; and, when they were in the open country, they said to him, ""O uncle, do our father's bidding."" He replied, ""Allah forbid that I should draw near to you with hurt! But know ye that I mean to take your clothes and clothe you with mine; then will I fill two vials with the lion's blood and go back to the King and tell him I have out vou to death. But as for you two, fare ye forth into the lands, for Allah's earth is wide; and know, O my lords, that it paineth me to part from you."" At this, they all fell a-weeping; then the two youths put off their clothes and the treasurer habited them with his own. Moreover he made two parcels of their dress and, filling two vials with the lion's blood, set the parcels before him on his horse's back. Presently he took leave of them and, making his way to the city, ceased not faring till he went in to King Kamar al-Zaman and kissed the ground between his hands. The King saw him changed in face and troubled (which arose from his adventure with the lion) and, deeming this came of the slaughter of his two sons, rejoiced and said to him, ""Hast thou done the work?"" ""Yes, O our lord,"" replied the treasurer and gave him the two parcels of clothes and the two vials full of blood. Asked the King, ""What didst thou observe in them; and did they give thee any charge?"" Answered the treasurer, ""I found them patient and resigned to what came down upon them and they said to me, 'Verily, our father is excusable; bear him our salutation and say to him, 'Thou art quit of our killing. But we charge thee repeat to him these couplets,

'Verily women are devils created for us. We seek refuge with God from the artifice of the devils. They are the source of all the misfortunes that have appeared among mankind in the affairs of the world and of religion.'''[FN#373]

When the King heard these words of the treasurer, he bowed his head earthwards, a long while and knew his sons' words to mean that they had been wrongfully put to death. Then he bethought himself of the perfidy of women and the calamities brought about by them; and he took the two parcels and opened them and fell to turning over his sons' clothes and weeping,—And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Kamar la-Zaman opened the two bundles and fell to turning over his sons' clothes and weeping, it so came to pass that he found, in the pocket of his son As'ad's raiment, a letter in the hand of his wife enclosing her hair strings; so he opened and read it and understanding the contents knew that the Prince had been falsely accused and wrongously. Then he searched Amjad's parcel of dress and found in his pocket a letter in the handwriting of Queen Hayat al-Nufus enclosing also her hair-strings; so he opened and read it and knew that Amjad too had been wronged; whereupon he beat hand upon hand and exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I have slain my sons unjustly."" And he buffeted his face, crying out, ""Alas, my sons! Alas, my long grief!"" Then he bade them build two tombs in one house, which he styled ""House of Lamentations,"" and had graved thereon his sons' names; and he threw himself on Amjad's tomb, weeping and groaning and lamenting, and improvised these couplets,

""O moon for ever set this earth below, *
             Whose loss bewail the stars which stud the sky!
O wand, which broken, ne'er with bend and wave *
            Shall fascinate the ravisht gazer's eye;
These eyne for jealousy I 'reft of thee, *
            Nor shall they till next life thy sight descry:
I'm drowned in sea of tears for insomny *
            Wherefore, indeed in Sáhirah-stead[FN#374] I lie.""
Then he threw himself on As'ad's tomb, groaning and weeping and lamenting and versifying with these couplets,
""Indeed I longed to share unweal with thee, *
            But Allah than my will willed otherwise:
My grief all blackens 'twixt mine eyes and space, *
             Yet whitens all the blackness from mine eyes:[FN#375]
Of tears they weep these eyne run never dry, *
             And ulcerous flow in vitals never dries:
Right sore it irks me seeing thee in stead[FN#376] *
             Where slave with sovran for once levelled lies.""

And his weeping and wailing redoubled; and, after he had ended his lamentations and his verse, he forsook his friends and intimates, and denying himself to his women and his family, cut himself off from the world in the House of Lamentations, where he passed his time in weeping for his sons. Such was his case; but as regards Amjad and As'ad they fared on into the desert eating of the fruits of the earth and drinking of the remnants of the rain for a full month, till their travel brought them to a mountain of black flint[FN#377] whose further end was unknown; and here the road forked, one line lying along the midway height and the other leading to its head. They took the way trending to the top and gave not over following it five days, but saw no end to it and were overcome with weariness, being unused to walking upon the mountains or elsewhere.[FN#378] At last, despairing of coming to the last of the road, they retraced their steps and, taking the other, that led over the midway heights,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princes Amjad and As'ad returned from the path leading to the Mountain- head and took that which ran along the midway heights, and walked through all that day till nightfall, when As'ad, weary with much travel, said to Amjad, ""O my brother, I can walk no farther, for I am exceeding weak."" Replied Amjad, ""O my brother, take courage! May be Allah will send us relief."" So they walked on part of the night, till the darkness closed in upon them, when As'ad became weary beyond measure of weariness and cried out, ""O my brother, I am worn out and spent with walking,"" and threw himself upon the ground and wept. Amjad took him in his arms and walked on with him, bytimes sitting down to rest till break of day, when they came to the mountain-top and found there a stream of running water and by it a pomegranate-tree and a prayer-niche.[FN#379] They could hardly believe their eyes when they saw it; but, sitting down by that spring, drank of its water and ate of the fruit of that granado-tree; after which they lay on the ground and slept till sunrise, when they washed and bathed in the spring and, eating of the pomegranates, slept again till the time of mid-afternoon prayer. Then they thought to continue their journey, but As'ad could not walk, for both his feet were swollen. So they abode there three days till they were rested, after which they set out again and fared on over the mountain days and nights, tortured by and like to die of thirst, till they sighted a city gleaming afar off, at which they rejoiced and made towards it. When they drew near it, they thanked Allah (be His Name exalted!) and Amjad said to As'ad, ""O my brother, sit here, whilst I go to yonder city and see what it is and whose it is and where we are in Allah's wide world, that we may know through what lands we have passed in crossing this mountain, whose skirts had we followed, we had not reached this city in a whole year. So praised be Allah for safety!"" Replied As'ad, ""By Allah, O my brother, none shall go down into that city save myself, and may I be thy ransom! If thou leave me alone, be it only for an hour, I shall imagine a thousand things and be drowned in a torrent of anxiety on shine account, for I cannot brook shine absence from me."" Amjad rejoined, ""Go then and tarry not. So As'ad took some gold pieces, and leaving his brother to await him, descended the mountain and ceased not faring on till he entered the city. As he threaded the streets he was met by an old man age-decrepit, whose beard flowed down upon his breast and forked in twain;[FN#380] he bore a walking-staff in his hand and was richly clad, with a great red turband on his head. When As'ad saw him, he wondered at his dress and his mien; nevertheless, he went up to him and saluting him said, ""Where be the way to the market, O my master?"" Hearing these words the Shaykh smiled in his face and replied, ""O my son, meseemeth thou art a stranger?"" As'ad rejoined, ""Yes, I am a stranger.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Shaykh who met As'ad smiled in his face and said to him, ""O my son, meseemeth thou art a stranger?"" and As'ad replied, ""Yes, I am a stranger."" Then rejoined the old man, ""Verily, thou gladdenest our country with thy presence, O my son, and thou desolatest shine own land by reason of shine absence. What wantest thou of the market?"" Quoth As'ad, ""O uncle, I have a brother, with whom I have come from a far land and with whom I have journeyed these three months; and, when we sighted this city, I left him, who is my elder brother, upon the mountain and came hither, purposing to buy victual and what else, and return therewith to him, that we might feed thereon."" Said the old man, ""Rejoice in all good, O my son, and know thou that to-day I give a marriage-feast, to which I have bidden many guests, and I have made ready plenty of meats, the best and most delicious that heart can desire. So if thou wilt come with me to my place, I will give thee freely all thou lackest without asking thee a price or aught else. Moreover I will teach thee the ways of this city; and, praised be Allah, O my son, that I, and none other have happened upon thee."" ""As thou wilt,"" answered As'ad, ""do as thou art disposed, but make haste, for indeed my brother awaiteth me and his whole heart is with me."" The old man took As'ad by the hand and carried him to a narrow lane, smiling in his face and saying, ""Glory be to Him who hath delivered thee from the people of this city!"" And he ceased not walking till he entered a spacious house, wherein was a saloon and behold, in the middle of it were forty old men, well stricken in years, collected together and forming a single ring as they sat round about a lighted fire, to which they were doing worship and prostrating themselves.[FN#381] When As'ad saw this, he was confounded and the hair of his body stood on end though he knew not what they were; and the Shaykh said to them, ""O Elders of the Fire, how blessed is this day!"" Then he called aloud, saying, ""Hello, Ghazbán!"" Whereupon there came out to him a tall black slave of frightful aspect, grim-visaged and flat nosed as an ape who, when the old man made a sign to him, bent As'ad's arms behind his back and pinioned them; after which the Shaykh said to him, ""Let him down into the vault under the earth and there leave him and say to my slave girl Such-an-one, 'Torture him night and day and give him a cake of bread to eat morning and evening against the time come of the voyage to the Blue Sea and the Mountain of Fire, whereon we will slaughter him as a sacrifice.'"" So the black carried him out at another door and, raising a flag in the floor, discovered a flight of twenty steps leading to a chamber[FN#382] under the earth, into which he descended with him and, laying his feet in irons, gave him over to the slave girl and went away. Meanwhile, the old men said to one another, ""When the day of the Festival of the Fire cometh, we will sacrifice him on the mountain, as a propitiatory offering whereby we shall pleasure the Fire."" Presently the damsel went down to him and beat him a grievous beating, till streams of blood flowed from his sides and he fainted; after which she set at his head a scone of bread and a cruse of brackish water and went away and left him. In the middle of the night, he revived and found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating: so he wept bitter tears; and recalling his former condition of honour and prosperity, lordship and dominion, and his separation from his sire and his exile from his native land.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,

When it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when As'ad found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating he recalled his whilome condition of honour and prosperity and dominion and lordship, and he wept and groaned aloud and recited these couplets,

""Stand by the ruined stead and ask of us; *
             Nor deem we dwell there as was state of us:
The World, that parter, hath departed us; *
             Yet soothes not hate-full hearts the fate of us:
With whips a cursed slave girl scourges us, *
             And teems her breast with rancorous hate of us:
Allah shall haply deign to unpart our lives, *
             Chastise our foes, and end this strait of us.""

And when As'ad had spoken his poetry, he put out his hand towards his head and finding there the crust and the cruse full of brackish water he ate a bittock, just enough to keep life in him, and drank a little water, but could get no sleep till morning for the swarms of bugs[FN#383] and lice. As soon as it was day, the slave girl came down to him and changed his clothes, which were drenched with blood and stuck to him, so that his skin came off with the shirt; wherefor he shrieked aloud and cried, ""Alas!"" and said, ""O my God, if this be Thy pleasure, increase it upon me! O Lord, verily Thou art not unmindful of him that oppresseth me; do Thou then avenge me upon him!"" And he groaned and repeated the following verses,


""Patient, O Allah! to Thy destiny *
             I bow, suffice me what Thou deign decree:
Patient to bear Thy will, O Lord of me, *
             Patient to burn on coals of Ghazá-tree:
They wrong me, visit me with hurt and harm; *
             Haply Thy grace from them shall set me free:
Far be's, O Lord, from thee to spare the wronger *
             O Lord of Destiny my hope's in Thee!""

And what another saith,

""Bethink thee not of worldly state, *
             Leave everything to course of Fate;
For oft a thing that irketh thee *
             Shall in content eventuate;
And oft what strait is shall expand, *
             And what expanded is wax strait.
Allah will do what wills His will *
             So be not thou importunate!
But 'joy the view of coming weal *
            Shall make forget past bale and bate.""

And when he had ended his verse, the slave-girl came down upon him with blows till he fainted again; and, throwing him a flap of bread and a gugglet of saltish water, went away and left him sad and lonely, bound in chains of iron, with the blood streaming from his sides and far from those he loved. So he wept and called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that As'ad called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed; so he wept and groaned and complained and poured forth tears in floods and improvised these couplets,

""Easy, O Fate! how long this wrong, this injury, *
           Robbing each morn and eve my brotherhood fro' me?
Is't not time now thou deem this length sufficiency *
           Of woes and, O thou Heart of Rock, show clemency?
My friends thou wrongedst when thou madst each enemy *
            Mock and exult me for thy wrongs, thy tyranny:
My foeman's heart is solaced by the things he saw *
           In me, of strangerhood and lonely misery:
Suffice thee not what came upon my head of dole, *
           Friends lost for evermore, eyes wan and pale of blee?
But must in prison cast so narrow there is naught *
            Save hand to bite, with bitten hand for company;
And tears that tempest down like goodly gift of cloud, *
           And longing thirst whose fires weet no satiety.
Regretful yearnings, singulfs and unceasing sighs, *
           Repine, remembrance and pain's very ecstacy:
Desire I suffer sore and melancholy deep, *
           And I must bide a prey to endless phrenesy:
I find me ne'er a friend who looks with piteous eye, *
          And seeks my presence to allay my misery:
Say, liveth any intimate with trusty love *
           Who for mine ills will groan, my sleepless malady?
To whom moan I can make and, peradventure, he *
             Shall pity eyes that sight of sleep can never see?
The flea and bug suck up my blood, as wight that drinks *
             Wine from the proffering hand of fair virginity:
Amid the lice my body aye remindeth me *
             Of orphan's good in Kázi's claw of villainy:
My home's a sepulchre that measures cubits three, *
             Where pass I morn and eve in chained agony:
My wines are tears, my clank of chains takes music's stead, *
             Cares my dessert of fruit and sorrows are my bed.""

And when he had versed his verse and had prosed his prose, he again groaned and complained and remembered he had been and how he had been parted from his brother. Thus far concerning him; but as regards his brother Amjad, he awaited As'ad till mid-day yet he returned not to him: whereupon Amjad's vitals fluttered, the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Thirtieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Amjad awaited his brother As'ad till mid-day and he returned not to him, Amjad's vitals fluttered; the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears, exclaiming, ""Alas, my brother! Alas, my friend! Alas my grief! How I feared me we should be separated!"" Then he descended from the mountain-top with the tears running down his cheeks; and, entering the city, ceased not walking till he made the market. He asked the folk the name of the place and concerning its people and they said, ""This is called the City of the Magians, and its citizens are mostly given to Fire-worshipping in lieu of the Omnipotent King."" Then he enquired of the City of Ebony and they answered, ""Of a truth it is a year's journey thither by land and six months by sea: it was governed erst by a King called Armanus; but he took to son- in-law and made King in his stead a Prince called Kamar al-Zaman distinguished for justice and munificence, equity and benevolence."" When Amjad heard tell of his father, he groaned and wept and lamented and knew not whither to go. However, he bought a something of food and carried it to a retired spot where he sat down thinking to eat; but, recalling his brother, he fell a- weeping and swallowed but a morsel to keep breath and body together, and that against his will. Then he rose and walked about the city, seeking news of his brother, till he saw a Moslem tailor sitting in his shop so he sat down by him and told him his story; whereupon quoth the tailor, ""If he have fallen into the hands of the Magians, thou shalt hardly see him again: yet it may be Allah will reunite you twain. But thou, O my brother,"" he continued wilt thou lodge with me?"" Amjad answered, ""Yes""; and the tailor rejoiced at this. So he abode with him many days, what while the tailor comforted him and exhorted him to patience and taught him tailoring, till he became expert in the craft. Now one day he went forth to the sea-shore and washed his clothes; after which he entered the bath and put on clean raiment; then he walked about the city, to divert himself with its sights and presently there met him on the way a woman of passing beauty and loveliness, without peer for grace and comeliness. When she saw him she raised her face-veil and signed to him by moving her eyebrows and her eyes with luring glances, and versified these couplets,

""I drooped my glance when seen thee on the way *
            As though, O slim-waist! felled by Sol's hot ray:
Thou art the fairest fair that e'er appeared, *
             Fairer to-day than fair of yesterday:[FN#384]
Were Beauty parted, a fifth part of it *
             With Joseph or a part of fifth would stay;
The rest would fly to thee, shine ownest own; *
             Be every soul thy sacrifice, I pray!""

When Amjad heard these her words, they gladdened his heart which inclined to her and his bowels yearned towards her and the hands of love sported with him; so he sighed to her in reply and spoke these couplets,

""Above the rose of cheek is thorn of lance;[FN#385] *
             Who dareth pluck it, rashest chevisance?
Stretch not thy hand towards it, for night long *
             Those lances marred because we snatched a glance!
Say her, who tyrant is and tempter too *
             (Though justice might her tempting power enhance):—
Thy face would add to errors were it veiled; *
             Unveiled I see its guard hath best of chance!
Eye cannot look upon Sol's naked face; *
             But can, when mist-cloud dims his countenance:
The honey-hive is held by honey-bee;[FN#386] *
             Ask the tribe-guards what wants their vigilance?
An they would slay me, let them end their ire *
             Rancorous, and grant us freely to advance:
They're not more murderous, an charge the whole *
             Than charging glance of her who wears the mole.""

And hearing these lines from Amjad she sighed with the deepest sighs and, signing to him again, repeated these couplets,

""'Tis thou hast trodden coyness path not I: *
             Grant me thy favours for the time draws nigh:
O thou who makest morn with light of brow, *
             And with loosed brow-locks night in lift to stye!
Thine idol-aspect made of me thy slave, *
             Tempting as temptedst me in days gone by:
'Tis just my liver fry with hottest love: *
             Who worship fire for God must fire aby:
Thou sellest like of me for worthless price; *
             If thou must sell, ask high of those who buy.""
When Amjad heard these her words he said to her, ""Wilt thou come to my lodging or shall I go with thee to shine?"" So she hung her head in shame to the ground and repeated the words of Him whose Name be exalted, ""Men shall have the pre-eminence above women, because of those advantages wherein Allah hath caused the one of them to excel the other.""[FN#387] Upon this, Amjad took the hint.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Amjad took the woman's hint and understood that she wished to go with him whither he was going; he felt himself bounder to find a place wherein to receive her, but was ashamed to carry her to the house of his host, the tailor. So he walked on and she walked after him, and the two ceased not walking from street to street and place to place, till she was tired and said to him, ""O my lord, where is thy house?"" Answered he, ""Before us a little way."" Then he turned aside into a handsome by-street, followed by the young woman, and walked on till he came to the end, when he found it was no thoroughfare and exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"" Then raising his eyes, he saw, at the upper end of the lane a great doer with two stone benches; but it was locked. So Amjad sat down on one of the benches and she on the other; and she said to him, ""O my lord, wherefore waitest thou?"" He bowed his head awhile to the ground then raised it and answered, ""I am awaiting my Mameluke who hath the key; for I bade him make me ready meat and drink and flowers, to deck the wine-service against my return from the bath."" But he said to himself, ""Haply the time will be tedious to her and she will go about her business, leaving me here, when I will wend my own way."" However, as soon as she was weary of long waiting, she said, ""O my lord, thy Mameluke delayeth; and here are we sitting in the street;"" and she arose and took a stone and went up to the lock. Said Amjad, ""Be not in haste, but have patience till the servant come."" However, she hearkened not to him, but smote the wooden bolt with the stone and broke it in half, whereupon the door opened. Quoth he, ""What possessed thee to do this deed?"" Quoth she, ""Pooh, pooh, my lord! what matter it? Is not the house thy house and thy place?"" He said, ""There was no need to break the bolt."" Then the damsel entered, to the confusion of Amjad, who knew not what to do for fear of the people of the house; but she said to him, ""Why dost thou not enter, O light of mine eyes and core of my heart?"" Replied he, ""I hear and obey; but my servant tarrieth long and I know not if he have done aught of what I bade him and specially enjoined upon him, or not."" Hereupon he entered, sore in fear of the people of the house, and found himself in a handsome saloon with four dais'd recesses, each facing other, and containing closets and raised seats, all bespread with stuffs of silk and brocade; and in the midst was a jetting fountain of costly fashion, on whose margin rested a covered tray of meats, with a leather tablecloth hanging up and gem-encrusted dishes, full of fruits and sweet- scented flowers. Hard by stood drinking vessels and a candlestick with a single wax-candle therein; and the place was full of precious stuffs and was ranged with chests and stools, and on each seat lay a parcel of clothes upon which was a purse full of monies, gold and silver. The floor was paved with marble and the house bore witness in every part to its owner's fortune. When Amjad saw all this, he was confounded at his case and said to himself, ""I am a lost man! Verily we are Allah's and to Allah we are returning!"" As for the damsel, when she sighted the place she rejoiced indeed with a joy nothing could exceed, and said to him, ""By Allah, O my lord, thy servant hath not failed of his duty; for see, he hath swept the place and cooked the meat and set on the fruit; and indeed I come at the best of times."" But he paid no heed to her, his heart being taken up with fear of the house- folk; and she said, ""Fie, O my lord, O my heart! What aileth thee to stand thus?"" Then she sighed and, giving him a buss which sounded like the cracking of a walnut, said, ""O my lord, an thou have made an appointment with other than with me, I will gird my middle and serve her and thee. Amjad laughed from a heart full of rage and wrath and came forwards and sat down, panting and saying to himself, ""Alack, mine ill death and doom when the owner of the place shall return!"" Then she seated herself by him and fell to toying and laughing, whilst Amjad sat careful and frowning, thinking a thousand thoughts and communing with himself, ""Assuredly the master of the house cannot but come, and then what shall I say to him? he needs must kill me and my life will be lost thus foolishly."" Presently she rose and, tucking up her sleeves, took a tray of food on which she laid the cloth and then set it before Amjad and began to eat, saying, ""Eat, O my lord."" So he came forward and ate; but the food was not pleasant to him; on the contrary he ceased not to look towards the door, till the damsel had eaten her fill, when she took away the tray of the meats and, setting on the dessert, fell to eating of the dried fruits. Then she brought the wine service and opening the jar, filled a cup and handed it to Amjad, who took it from her hand saying to him self, ' Ah, ah! and well away, when the master of the house cometh and seeth me!""; and he kept his eyes fixed on the threshold, even with cup in hand. While he was in this case, lo! in came the master of the house, who was a white slave, one of the chief men of the city, being Master of the Horse[FN#388] to the King. He had fitted up this saloon for his pleasures, that he might make merry therein and be private with whom he would, and he had that day bidden a youth whom he loved and had made this entertainment for him. Now the name of this slave was Bahádur,[FN#389] and he was open of hand, generous, munificent and fain of alms-giving and charitable works.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it wad the Two Hundred and Thirty-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Bahadur, the Master of the Horse and the owner of the house, came to the door of the saloon and found it open, he entered slowly and softly and looking in, with head advanced and out stretched neck, saw Amjad and the girl sitting before the dish of fruit and the wine-jar in front of them. Now Amjad at that moment had the cup in his hand and his face turned to the door; and when his glance met Bahadur's eyes his hue turned pale yellow and his side-muscles quivered, so seeing his trouble Bahadur signed to him with his finger on his lips, as much as to say, ""Be silent and come hither to me."" Whereupon he set down the cup and rose and the damsel cried, ""Whither away?"" He shook his head and, signing to her that he wished to make water, went out into the passage barefoot. Now when he saw Bahadur he knew him for the master of the house; so he hastened to him and, kissing his hands, said to him, ""Allah upon thee, O my lord, ere thou do me a hurt, hear what I have to say."" Then he told him who he was from first to last and acquainted him with what caused him to quit his native land and royal state, and how he had not entered his house of his free will, but that it was the girl who had broken the lock-bolt and done all this.[FN#390] When Bahadur heard his story and knew that he was a King's son, he felt for him and, taking compassion on him, said, ""Hearken to me, O Amjad, and do what I bid thee and I will guarantee thy safety from that thou fearest; but, if thou cross me, I will kill thee."" Amjad replied, ""Command me as thou wilt: I will not gainsay thee in aught; no, never, for I am the freedman of thy bounty."" Rejoined Bahadur, ""Then go back forthwith into the saloon, sit down in thy place and be at peace and at shine ease; I will presently come in to thee, and when thou seest me (remember my name is Bahadur) do thou revile me and rail at me, saying, 'What made thee tarry till so late?' And accept no excuse from me; nay, so far from it, rise and beat me; and, if thou spare me, I will do away thy life. Enter now and make merry and whatsoever thou seekest of me at this time I will bring thee forthwith; and do thou spend this night as thou wilt and on the morrow wend thy way. This I do in honour of thy strangerhood, for I love the stranger and hold myself bounder to do him devoir."" So Amjad kissed his hand, and, returning to the saloon with his face clad in its natural white and red, at once said to the damsel, ""O my mistress, thy presence hath gladdened this shine own place and ours is indeed a blessed night."" Quoth the girl, ""Verily I see a wonderful change in thee, that thou now welcomest me so cordially!"" So Amjad answered, ""By Allah, O my lady, methought my servant Bahadur had robbed me of some necklaces of jewels, worth ten thousand diners each; however, when I went out but now in concern for this, I sought for them and found them in their place. I know not why the slave tarrieth so long and needs must I punish him for it."" She was satisfied with his answer, and they sported and drank and made merry and ceased not to be so till near sundown, when Bahadur came in to them, having changed his clothes and girt his middle and put on shoes, such as are worn of Mamelukes. He saluted and kissed the ground; then held his hands behind him and stood, with his head hanging down, as one who confesseth to a fault. So Amjad looked at him with angry eyes and asked, ""Why hast thou tarried till now, O most pestilent of slaves?"" Answered Bahadur, ""O my lord, I was busy washing my clothes and knew not of thy being here; for our appointed time was nightfall and not day-tide."" But Amjad cried out at him, saying, ""Thou liest, O vilest of slaves! By Allah, I must needs beat thee."" So he rose and, throwing Bahadur prone on the ground, took a stick and beat him gently; but the damsel sprang up and, snatching the stick from his hand, came down upon Bahadur so lustily, that in extreme pain the tears ran from his eyes and he ground his teeth together and called out for succour; whilst Amjad cried out to the girl ""Don't""; and she cried out, ""Let me satisfy my anger upon him!"" till at last he pulled the stick out of her hand and pushed her away. So Bahadur rose and, wiping away his tears from his cheeks, waited upon them the while, after which he swept the hall and lighted the lamps; but as often as he went in and out, the lady abused him and cursed him till Amjad was wroth with her and said, ""For Almighty Allah's sake leave my Mameluke; he is not used to this."" Then they sat and ceased not eating and drinking (and Bahadur waiting upon them) till midnight when, being weary with service and beating, he fell asleep in the midst of the hall and snored and snorted; whereupon the damsel, who was drunken with wine, said to Amjad, ""Arise, take the sword hanging yonder and cut me off this slave's head; and, if thou do it not, I will be the death of thee!"" ""What possesseth thee to slay my slave?"" asked Amjad; and she answered, ""Our joyaunce will not be complete but by his death. If thou wilt not kill him, I will do it myself."" Quoth Amjad, ""By Allah's rights to thee, do not this thing!"" Quoth she, ""It must perforce be;"" and, taking down the sword, drew it and made at Bahadur to kill him; but Amjad said in his mind, ""This man hath entreated us courteously and sheltered us and done us kindness and made himself my slave: shall we requite him by slaughtering him? This shall never be!"" Then he said to the woman, ""If my Mameluke must be killed, better I should kill him than thou."" So saying, he took the sword from her and, raising his hand, smote her on the neck and made her head fly from her body. It fell upon Bahadur who awoke and sat up and opened his eyes, when he saw Amjad standing by him and in his hand the sword dyed with blood, and the damsel lying dead. He enquired what had passed, and Amjad told him all she had said, adding, ""Nothing would satisfy her but she must slay thee; and this is her reward."" Then Bahadur rose and, kissing the Prince's hand, said to him, ""Would to Heaven thou hadst spared her! but now there is nothing for it but to rid us of her without stay or delay, before the day-break."" Then he girded his loins and took the body, wrapped it in an Abá-cloak and, laying it in a large basket of palm-leaves, he shouldered it saying, ""Thou art a stranger here and knowest no one: so sit thou in this place and await my return till day-break. If I come back to thee, I will assuredly do thee great good service and use my endeavours to have news of thy brother; but if by sunrise I return not, know that all is over with me; and peace be on thee, and the house and all it containeth of stuffs and money are shine."" Then he fared forth from the saloon bearing the basket; and, threading the streets, he made for the salt sea, thinking to throw it therein: but as he drew near the shore, he turned and saw that the Chief of Police and his officers had ranged themselves around him; and, on recognising him, they wondered and opened the basket, wherein they found the slain woman. So they seized him and laid him in bilboes all that night till the morning, when they carried him and the basket, as it was, to the King and reported the case. The King was sore enraged when he looked upon the slain and said to Bahadur, ""Woe to thee! Thou art always so doing; thou killest folk and castest them into the sea and takest their goods. How many murders hast thou done ere this?"" Thereupon Bahadur hung his head.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahadur hung down his head groundwards before the King, who cried out at him, saying, ""Woe to thee! Who killed this girl?"" He replied, ""O my lord! I killed her, and there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!""[FN#391] So the King in his anger, commanded to hang him; and the hangman went down with him by the King's commandment, and the Chief of Police accompanied him with a crier who called upon all the folk to witness the execution of Bahadur, the King's Master of the Horse; and on this wise they paraded him through the main streets and the market-streets. This is how it fared with Bahadur; but as regards Amjad, he awaited his host's return till the day broke and the sun rose, and when he saw that he came not, he exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Would I knew what is become of him?"" And, as he sat musing behold, he heard the crier proclaiming Bahadur's sentence and bidding the people to see the spectacle of his hanging at midday; whereat he wept and exclaimed, ""Verily, we are Allah's and to Him we are returning! He meaneth to sacrifice himself unjustly for my sake, when I it was who slew her. By Allah, this shall never be!"" Then he went from the saloon and, shutting the door after him, hurriedly threaded the streets till he overtook Bahadur, when he stood before the Chief of Police and said to him, ""O my lord, put not Bahadur to death, for he is innocent. By Allah, none killed her but I."" Now when the Captain of Police heard these words, he took them both and, carrying them before the King, acquainted him with what Amjad had said; whereupon he looked at the Prince and asked him, ""Didst thou kill the damsel?"" He answered, ""Yes"" and the King said, ""Tell me why thou killedst her, and speak the truth."" Replied Amjad, ""O King, it is indeed a marvellous event and a wondrous matter that hath befallen me: were it graven with needles on the eye-corners, it would serve as a warner to whoso would be warned!"" Then he told him his whole story and informed him of all that had befallen him and his brother, first and last; whereat the King was much startled and surprised and said to him, ""Know that now I find thee to be excusable; but list, O youth! Wilt thou be my Wazír?"" ""Hearkening and obedience,"" answered Amjad whereupon the King bestowed magnificent dresses of honour on him and Bahadur and gave him a handsome house, with eunuchs and officers and all things needful, appointing him stipends and allowances and bidding him make search for his brother As'ad. So Amjad sat down in the seat of the Wazirate and governed and did justice and invested and deposed and took and gave. Moreover, he sent out a crier to cry his brother throughout the city, and for many days made proclamation in the main streets and market-streets, but heard no news of As'ad nor happened on any trace of him. Such was his case; but as regards his brother, the Magi ceased not to torture As'ad night and day and eve and morn for a whole year's space, till their festival drew near, when the old man Bahram[FN#392] made ready for the voyage and fitted out a ship for himself.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahram, the Magian, having fitted out a ship for the voyage, took As'ad and put him in a chest which he locked and had it transported on board. Now it so came to pass that, at the very time of shipping it, Amjad was standing to divert himself by looking upon the sea; and when he saw the men carrying the gear and shipping it, his heart throbbed and he called to his pages to bring him his beast. Then, mounting with a company of his officers, he rode down to the sea-side and halted before the Magian's ship, which he commended his men to board and search. They did his bidding, and boarded the vessel and rummaged in every part, but found nothing; so they returned and told Amjad, who mounted again and rode back. But he felt troubled in mind; and when he reached his place and entered his palace, he cast his eyes on the wall and saw written thereon two lines which were these couplets,

""My friends! if ye are banisht from mine eyes, *
             From heart and mind ye ne'er go wandering:
But ye have left me in my woe, and rob *
             Rest from my eyelids while ye are slumbering.""

And seeing them Amjad thought of his brother and wept. Such was his case; but as for Bahram, the Magian, he embarked and shouted and bawled to his crew to make sail in all haste. So they shook out the sails and departed and ceased not to fare on many days and nights; and, every other day, Bahram took out As'ad and gave him a bit of bread and made him drink a sup of water, till they drew near the Mountain of Fire. Then there came out on them a storm-wind and the sea rose against them, so that the ship was driven out of her course till she took a wrong line and fell into strange waters; and, at last they came in sight of a city builded upon the shore, with a castle whose windows overlooked the main. Now the ruler of this city was a Queen called Marjánah, and the captain said to Bahram, ""O my lord, we have strayed from our course and come to the island of Queen Marjanah, who is a devout Moslemah; and, if she know that we are Magians, she will take our ship and slay us to the last man. Yet needs must we put in here to rest and refit."" Quoth Bahram, ""Right is thy recking, and whatso thou seest fit that will I do!"" Said the ship master, ""If the Queen summon us and question us, how shall we answer her?""; and Bahram replied, ""Let us clothe this Moslem we have with us in a Mameluke's habit and carry him ashore with us, so that when the Queen sees him, she will suppose and say, 'This is a slave.' As for me I will tell her that I am a slave-dealer[FN#393] who buys and sells white slaves, and that I had with me many but have sold all save this one, whom I retained to keep my accounts, for he can read and write."" And the captain said ""This device should serve."" Presently they reached the city and slackened sail and cast the anchors; and the ship lay still, when behold, Queen Marjanah came down to them, attended by her guards and, halting before the vessel, called out to the captain, who landed and kissed the ground before her. Quoth she, ""What is the lading of this thy ship and whom hast thou with thee?"""" Quoth he, ""O Queen of the Age, I have with me a merchant who dealeth in slaves."" And she said, ""Hither with him to me""; whereupon Bahram came ashore to her, with As'ad walking behind him in a slave's habit, and kissed the earth before her. She asked, ""What is thy condition?""; and he answered, ""I am a dealer in chattels."" Then she looked at As'ad and, taking him for a Mameluke, asked him, ""What is thy name, O youth?"" He answered, ""Dost thou ask my present or my former name?"" ""Hast thou then two names?"" enquired she, and he replied (and indeed his voice was choked with tears), ""Yes; my name aforetime was Al-As'ad, the most happy, but now it is Al- Mu'tarr—Miserrimus."" Her heart inclined to him and she said, ""Canst thou write?"" ""Yes,'' answered he, and she gave him ink- case and reed-pen and paper and said to him, ""Write somewhat that I may see it."" So he wrote these two couplets,

""What can the slave do when pursued by Fate, *
             O justest Judge! whatever be his state?[FN#394]
Whom God throws hand bound in the depths and says, *
             Beware lest water should thy body wet?""[FN#395]

Now when she read these lines, she had ruth upon him and said to Bahram, ""Sell me this slave."" He replied, ""O my lady, I cannot sell him, for I have parted with all the rest and none is left with me but he."" Quoth the Queen, ""I must need have him of thee, either by sale or way of gift."" But quoth Bahram, ""I will neither sell him nor give him."" Whereat she was wroth and, taking As'ad by the hand, carried him up to the castle and sent to Bahram, saying, ""Except thou set sail and depart our city this very night, I will seize all thy goods and break up thy ship."" Now when the message reached the Magian, he grieved with sore grief and cried, ""Verily this voyage is on no wise to be commended."" Then he arose and made ready and took all he needed and awaited the coming of the night to resume his voyage, saying to the sailors, ""Provide yourselves with your things and fill your water-skins, that we may set sail at the last of the night."" So the sailors did their business and awaited the coming of darkness. Such was their case; but as regards Queen Marjanah, when she had brought As'ad into the castle, she opened the casements overlooking the sea and bade her handmaids bring food. They set food before As'ad and herself and both ate, after which the Queen called for wine.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Marjanah bade her handmaids bring wine and they set it before her, she fell to drinking with As'ad. Now, Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) filled her heart with love for the Prince and she kept filling his cup and handing it to him till his reason fled; and presently he rose and left the hall to satisfy a call of nature. As he passed out of the saloon he saw an open door through which he went and walked on till his walk brought him to a vast garden full of all manner fruits and flowers; and, sitting down under a tree, he did his occasion. Then he rose and went up to a jetting fountain in the garden and made the lesser ablution and washed his hands and face, after which he would have risen to go away; but the air smote him and he fell back, with his clothes undone and slept, and night overcame him thus. So far concerning him; but as concerns Bahram, the night being come, he cried out to his crew, saying, ""Set sail and let us away!""; and the' answered, ""We hear and obey, but wait till we fill our water- skins and then we will set sail."" So they landed with their water skins and went round about the castle, and found nothing but garden-walls: whereupon they climbed over into the garden and followed the track of feet, which led them to the fountain; and there they found As'ad lying on his back. They knew him and were glad to find him; and, after filling their water-skins, they bore him off and climbed the wall again with him and carried him back in haste to Bahram to whom they said, ""Hear the good tidings of thy winning thy wish; and gladden thy heart and beat thy drums and sound thy pipes; for thy prisoner, whom Queen Marjanah took from thee by force, we have found and brought back to thee""; and they threw As'ad down before him. When Bahram saw him, his heart leapt for joy and his breast swelled with gladness. Then he bestowed largesse on the sailors and bade them set sail in haste. So they sailed forthright, intending to make the Mountain of Fire and stayed not their course till the morning. This is how it fared with them; but as regards Queen Marjanah, she abode awhile, after As'ad went down from her, awaiting his return in vain for he came not; thereupon she rose and sought him, yet found no trace of him. Then she bade her women light flambeaux and look for him, whilst she went forth in person and, seeing the garden- door open, knew that he had gone thither. So she went out into the garden and finding his sandals lying by the fountain, searched the place in every part, but came upon no sign of him; and yet she gave not over the search till morning. Then she enquired for the ship and they told her, ""The vessel set sail in the first watch of the night""; wherefor she knew that they had taken As'ad with them, and this was grievous to her and she was sore an-angered. She bade equip ten great ships forthwith and, making ready for fight, embarked in one of the ten with her Mamelukes and slave-women and men-at-arms, all splendidly accoutred and weaponed for war. They spread the sails and she said to the captains, ""If you overtake the Magian's ship, ye shall have of me dresses of honour and largesse of money; but if you fail so to do, I will slay you to the last man."" Whereat fear and great hope animated the crews and they sailed all that day and the night and the second day and the third day till, on the fourth they sighted the ship of Bahram, the Magian, and before evening fell the Queen's squadron had surrounded it on all sides, just as Bahram had taken As'ad forth of the chest and was beating and torturing him, whilst the Prince cried out for help and deliverance, but found neither helper nor deliverer: and the grievous bastinado sorely tormented him. Now while so occupied, Bahram chanced to look up and, seeing himself encompassed by the Queen's ships, as the white of the eye encompasseth the black, he gave himself up for lost and groaned and said, ""Woe to thee, O As'ad! This is all out of thy head."" Then taking him by the hand he bade his men throw him overboard and cried, ""By Allah I will slay thee before I die myself!"" So they carried him along by the hands and feet and cast him into the sea and he sank; but Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) willed that his life be saved and that his doom be deferred; so He caused him to sink and rise again and he struck out with his hands and feet, till the Almighty gave him relief, and sent him deliverance; and the waves bore him far from the Magian's ship and threw him ashore. He landed, scarce crediting his escape, and once more on land he doffed his clothes and wrung them and spread them out to dry; whilst he sat naked and weeping over his condition, and bewailing his calamities and mortal dangers, and captivity and stranger hood. And presently he repeated these two couplets,

""Allah, my patience fails: I have no ward; *
             My breast is straitened and clean cut my cord;
To whom shall wretched slave of case complain *
             Save to his Lord? O thou of lords the Lord!""

Then, having ended his verse, he rose and donned his clothes but he knew not whither to go or whence to come; so he fed on the herbs of the earth and the fruits of the trees and he drank of the streams, and fared on night and day till he came in sight of a city; whereupon he rejoiced and hastened his pace; but when he reached it,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it Was the Two Hundred and Thirty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he reached the city the shades of evening closed around him and the gates were shut. Now by the decrees of Pate and man's lot this was the very city wherein he had been a prisoner and to whose King his brother Amjad was Minister. When As'ad saw the gate was locked, he turned back and made for the burial-ground, where finding a tomb without a door, he entered therein and lay down and fell asleep, with his face covered by his long sleeve.[FN#396] Meanwhile, Queen Marjanah, coming up with Bahram's ship, questioned him of As'ad. Now the Magian, when Queen Marjanah overtook him with her ships, baffled her by his artifice and gramarye; swearing to her that he was not with him and that he knew nothing of him. She searched the ship, but found no trace of her friend, so she took Bahram and, carrying him back to her castle, would have put him to death, but he ransomed himself from her with all his good and his ship; and she released him and his men. They went forth from her hardly believing in their deliverance, and fared on ten days' journey till they came to their own city and found the gate shut, it being eventide. So they made for the burial-ground, thinking to lie the night there and, going round about the tombs, as Fate and Fortune would have it, saw the building wherein As'ad lay wide open; whereat Bahram marvelled and said, ""I must look into this sepulchre."" Then he entered and found As'ad lying in a corner fast asleep, with his head covered by his sleeve; so he raised his head, and looking in his face, knew him for the man on whose account he had lost his good and his ship, and cried, ""What! art thou yet alive?"" Then he bound him and gagged him without further parley, and carried him to his house, where he clapped heavy shackles on his feet and lowered him into the underground dungeon aforesaid prepared for the tormenting of Moslems, and he bade his daughter by name Bostán,[FN#397] torture him night and day, till the next year, when they would again visit the Mountain of Fire and there offer him up as a sacrifice. Then he beat him grievously and locking the dungeon door upon him, gave the keys to his daughter. By and by, Bostan opened the door and went down to beat him, but finding him a comely youth and a sweet-faced with arched brows and eyes black with nature's Kohl,[FN#398] she fell in love with him and asked him, ""What is thy name?"" ""My name is As'ad,"" answered he; whereat she cried, ""Mayst thou indeed be happy as thy name,[FN#399] and happy be thy days! Thou deservest not torture and blows, and I see thou hast been injuriously entreated."" And she comforted him with kind words and loosed his bonds. Then she questioned him of the religion of Al-Islam and he told her that it was the true and right Faith and that our lord Mohammed had approved himself by surpassing miracles[FN#400] and signs manifest, and that fire-worship is harmful and not profitable; and he went on to expound to her the tenets of Al-Islam till she was persuaded and the love of the True Faith entered her heart. Then, as Almighty Allah had mixed up with her being a fond affection for As'ad, she pronounced the Two Testimonies[FN#401] of the Faith and became of the people of felicity. After this, she brought him meat and drink and talked with him and they prayed together: moreover, she made him chicken stews and fed him therewith, till he regained strength and his sickness left him and he was restored to his former health. Such things befel him with the daughter of Bahram, the Magian; and so it happened that one day she left him and stood at the house-door when behold, she heard the crier crying aloud and saying, ""Whoso hath with him a handsome young man, whose favour is thus and thus, and bringeth him forth, shall have all he seeketh of money; but if any have him and deny it, he shall be hanged over his own door and his property shall be plundered and his blood go for naught."" Now As'ad had acquainted Bostan bint Bahram with his whole history: so, when she heard the crier, she knew that it was he who was sought for and, going down to him, told him the news. Then he fared forth and made for the mansion of the Wazir, whom, when As'ad saw, exclaimed, ""By Allah, this Minister is my brother Amjad!"" Then he went up (and the damsel walking behind him) to the Palace, where he again saw his brother, and threw himself upon him; whereupon Amjad also knew him and fell upon his neck and they embraced each other, whilst the Wazir's Mamelukes dismounted and stood round them. They lay awhile insensible and, when they came to themselves, Amjad took his brother and carried him to the Sultan, to whom he related the whole story, and the Sultan charged him to plunder Bahram's house.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Sultan ordered Amjad to plunder Bahram's house and to hang its owner. So Amjad despatched thither for that purpose a company of men, who sacked the house and took Bahram and brought his daughter to the Wazir by whom she was received with all honour, for As'ad had told his brother the torments he had suffered and the kindness she had done him. Thereupon Amjad related in his turn to As'ad all that had passed between himself and the damsel; and how he had escaped hanging and had become Wazir; and they made moan, each to other, of the anguish they had suffered for separation. Then the Sultan summoned Bahram and bade strike off his head; but he said, ""O most mighty King, art thou indeed resolved to put me to death?"" Replied the King, ""Yes, except thou save thyself by becoming a Moslem."" Quoth Bahram, ""O King, bear with me a little while!"" Then he bowed his head groundwards and presently raising it again, made pro fession of The Faith and islamised at the hands of the Sultan. They all rejoiced at his conversion and Amjad and As'ad told him all that had befallen them, whereat he wondered and said, ""O my lords, make ready for the journey and I will depart with you and carry you back to your father's court in a ship."" At this they rejoiced and wept with sore weeping but he said, ""O my lords, weep not for your departure, for it shall reunite you with those you love, even as were Ni'amah and Naomi."" ""And what befel Ni'amah and Naomi?"" asked they. ""They tell,"" replied Bahram, ""(but Allah alone is All knowing) the following tale of


Footnotes:




[FN#221] The ""topothesia"" is worthy of Shakespeare's day. ""Khálidán"" is evidently a corruption of ""Khálidatáni"" (for Khálidát), the Eternal, as Ibn Wardi calls the Fortunate Islands, or Canaries, which owe both their modern names to the classics of Europe. Their present history dates from A.D. 1385, unless we accept the Dieppe-Rouen legend of Labat which would place the discovery in A.D. 1326. I for one thoroughly believe in the priority on the West African Coast, of the gallant descendants of the Northmen.

[FN#222] Four wives are allowed by Moslem law and for this reason. If you marry one wife she holds herself your equal, answers you and ""gives herself airs""; two are always quarrelling and making a hell of the house; three are ""no company"" and two of them always combine against the nicest to make her hours bitter. Four are company, they can quarrel and ""make it up"" amongst themselves, and the husband enjoys comparative peace. But the Moslem is bound by his law to deal equally with the four, each must have her dresses her establishment and her night, like her sister wives. The number is taken from the Jews (Arbah Turim Ev. Hazaer, i.) ""the wise men have given good advice that a man should not marry more than four wives."" Europeans, knowing that Moslem women are cloistered and appear veiled in public, begin with believing them to be mere articles of luxury, and only after long residence they find out that nowhere has the sex so much real liberty and power as in the Moslem East. They can possess property and will it away without the husband's leave: they can absent themselves from the house for a month without his having a right to complain; and they assist in all his counsels for the best of reasons: a man can rely only on his wives and children, being surrounded by rivals who hope to rise by his ruin. As regards political matters the Circassian women of Constantinople really rule the Sultanate and there soignez la femme! is the first lesson of getting on in the official world.

[FN#223] This two-bow prayer is common on the bride-night; and at all times when issue is desired.

[FN#224] The older Camaralzaman=""Moon of the age."" Kamar is the moon between her third and twenty-sixth day: Hilál during the rest of the month: Badr (plur. Budúr whence the name of the Princess) is the full moon.

[FN#225] Arab ""Ra'áyá"" plur. of 'Ra'íyat"" our Anglo-Indian Ryot, lit. a liege, a subject; secondarily a peasant, a Fellah.

[FN#226] Another audacious parody of the Moslem ""testification"" to the one God, and to Mohammed the Apostle.

[FN#227] Showing how long ago forts were armed with metal plates which we have applied to war-ships only of late years.

[FN#228] The comparison is abominably true—in the East.

[FN#229] Two fallen angels who taught men the art of magic. They are mentioned in the Koran (chaps. ii.), and the commentators have extensively embroidered the simple text. Popularly they are supposed to be hanging by their feet in a well in the territory of Babel, hence the frequent allusions to ""Babylonian sorcery"" in Moslem writings; and those who would study the black art at head-quarters are supposed to go there. They are counterparts of the Egyptian Jamnes and Mambres, the Jannes and Jambres of St. Paul (2 Tim. iii. 8).

[FN#230] An idol or idols of the Arabs (Allat and Ozza) before Mohammed (Koran chaps. ii. 256). Etymologically the word means ""error"" and the termination is rather Hebraic than Arabic.

[FN#231] Arab. ""Khayt hamayán"" (wandering threads of vanity), or
Mukhát al-Shaytan (Satan's snivel),=our ""gossamer""=God's summer
(Mutter Gottes Sommer) or God's cymar (?).

[FN#232] These lines occur in Night xvii.; so I borrow from
Torrens (p. 163) by way of variety.

[FN#233] A posture of peculiar submission; contrasting strongly with the attitude afterwards assumed by Prince Charming.

[FN#234] A mere term of vulgar abuse not reflecting on either parent: I have heard a mother call her own son, ""Child of adultery.""

[FN#235] Arab. ""Ghazá,"" the Artemisia (Euphorbia ?) before noticed. If the word be a misprint for Ghadá it means a kind of Euphorbia which, with the Arák (wild caper-tree) and the Daum palm (Crucifera thebiaca), is one of the three normal growths of the Arabian desert (Pilgrimage iii. 22).

[FN#236] Arab. ""Banát al-Na'ash,"" usually translated daughters of the bier, the three stars which represent the horses in either Bear, ""Charles' Wain,"" or Ursa Minor, the waggon being supposed to be a bier. ""Banát"" may be also sons, plur. of Ibn, as the word points to irrational objects. So Job (ix. 9 and xxxviii. 32) refers to U. Major as ""Ash"" or ""Aysh"" in the words, ""Canst thou guide the bier with its sons?"" (erroneously rendered ""Arcturus with his sons"") In the text the lines are enigmatical, but apparently refer to a death parting.

[FN#237] The Chapters are: 2, 3, 36, 55, 67 and the two last (""Daybreak"" cxiii. and ""Men"" cxiv.), which are called Al-Mu'izzatáni (vulgar Al-Mu'izzatayn), the ""Two Refuge-takings or Preventives,"" because they obviate enchantment. I have translated the two latter as follows:—

""Say:—Refuge I take with the Lord of the Day-break *
from mischief of what He did make *
from mischief of moon eclipse-showing *
and from mischief of witches on cord-knots blowing *
and from mischief of envier when envying.""

""Say:—Refuge I take with the Lord of men *
the sovran of men *
the God of men *
from the Tempter, the Demon *
who tempteth in whisper the breasts of men *
and from Jinnis and (evil) men.""

[FN#238] The recitations were Náfilah, or superogatory, two short chapters only being required and the taking refuge was because he slept in a ruin, a noted place in the East for Ghuls as in the West for ghosts.

[FN#239] Lane (ii. 222) first read ""Múroozee"" and referred it to the Murúz tribe near Herat he afterwards (iii. 748) corrected it to ""Marwazee,"" of the fabric of Marw (Margiana) the place now famed for ""Mervousness."" As a man of Rayy (Rhages) becomes Rází (e.g. Ibn Fáris al-Razí), so a man of Marw is Marázi, not Murúzi nor Márwazi. The ""Mikna' "" was a veil forming a kind of ""respirator,"" defending from flies by day and from mosquitos, dews and draughts by night. Easterns are too sensible to sleep with bodies kept warm by bedding, and heads bared to catch every blast. Our grandfathers and grandmothers did well to wear bonnets-de-nuit, however ridiculous they may have looked.

[FN#240] Iblis, meaning the Despairer, is called in the Koran (chaps. xviii. 48) ""One of the genii (Jinnis) who departed from the command of his Lord."" Mr. Rodwell (in loco) notes that the Satans and Jinnis represent in the Koran (ii. 32, etc.) the evil-principle and finds an admixture of the Semitic Satans and demons with the ""Genii from the Persian (Babylonian ?) and Indian (Egyptian ?) mythologies.""

[FN#241] Of course she could not see his eyes when they were shut; nor is this mere Eastern inconsequence. The writer means, ""had she seen them, they would have showed,"" etc.

[FN#242] The eyes are supposed to grow darker under the influence of wine and sexual passion.

[FN#243] To keep off the evil eye.
[FN#244] Like Dahnash this is a fanciful P. N., fit only for a Jinni. As a rule the appellatives of Moslem ""genii"" end inús (oos), as Tarnús, Huliyánus, the Jewish in—nas, as Jattunas; those of the Tarsá (the ""funkers"" i.e. Christians) in—dús, as Sidús, and the Hindus in—tús, as Naktús (who entered the service of the Prophet Shays, or Seth, and was converted to the Faith). The King of the Genii is Malik Katshán who inhabits Mount Kaf; and to the west of him lives his son-in-law, Abd al-Rahman with 33,000 domestics: these names were given by the Apostle Mohammed. ""Baktanús"" is lord of three Moslem troops of the wandering Jinns, which number a total of twelve bands and extend from Sind to Europe. The Jinns, Divs, Peris (""fairies"") and other pre-Adamitic creatures were governed by seventy-two Sultans all known as Sulayman and the last I have said was Ján bin Ján. The angel Háris was sent from Heaven to chastise him, but in the pride of victory he also revolted with his followers the Jinns whilst the Peris held aloof. When he refused to bow down before Adam he and his chiefs were eternally imprisoned but the other Jinns are allowed to range over earth as a security for man's obedience. The text gives the three orders. flyers. walkers and divers.

[FN#245] i.e. distracted (with love); the Lakab, or poetical name, of apparently a Spanish poet.

[FN#246] Nothing is more ""anti-pathetic"" to Easterns than lean hips and flat hinder-cheeks in women and they are right in insisting upon the characteristic difference of the male and female figure. Our modern sculptors and painters, whose study of the nude is usually most perfunctory, have often scandalised me by the lank and greyhound-like fining off of the frame, which thus becomes rather simian than human.

[FN#247] The small fine foot is a favourite with Easterns as well as Westerns. Ovid (A.A.) is not ashamed ""ad teneros Oscula (not basia or suavia) ferre pedes."" Ariosto ends the august person in

                  Il breve, asciutto, e ritondetto piece,
         (The short-sized, clean-cut, roundly-moulded foot).

And all the world over it is a sign of ""blood,"" i.e. the fine nervous temperament.

[FN#248] i.e. ""full moons"": the French have corrupted it to
""Badoure""; we to ""Badoura."" winch is worse.

[FN#249] As has been said a single drop of urine renders the clothes ceremoniously impure, hence a Stone or a handful of earth must be used after the manner of the torche-cul. Scrupulous Moslems, when squatting to make water, will prod the ground before them with the point o f stick or umbrella, so as to loosen it and prevent the spraying of the urine.

[FN#250] It is not generally known to Christians that Satan has a wife called Awwá (""Hawwá"" being the Moslem Eve) and, as Adam had three sons, the Tempter has nine, viz., Zu 'l-baysun who rules in bazars. Wassin who prevails in times of trouble. Awan who counsels kings; Haffan patron of wine-bibbers; Marrah of musicians and dancers; Masbut of news-spreaders (and newspapers ?); Dulhán who frequents places of worship and interferes with devotion. Dasim, lord of mansions and dinner tables, who prevents the Faithful saying ""Bismillah"" and ""Inshallah,"" as commanded in the Koran (xviii. 23), and Lakís, lord of Fire worshippers (Herklots, chap. xxix. sect. 4).

[FN#251] Strong perfumes, such as musk (which we Europeans dislike and suspect), are always insisted upon in Eastern poetry, and Mohammed's predilection for them is well known. Moreover the young and the beautiful are held (justly enough) to exhale a natural fragrance which is compared with that of the blessed in Paradise. Hence in the Mu'allakah of Imr al-Keys:—

Breathes the scent of musk when they rise to rove, *
            As the Zephyr's breath with the flavour o'clove.

It is made evident by dogs and other fine-nosed animals that every human being has his, or her, peculiar scent which varies according to age and health. Hence animals often detect the approach of death.

[FN#252] Arab. ""Kahlá."" This has been explained. Mohammed is said to have been born with ""Kohl'd eyes.""

[FN#253] Hawá al-'uzrí, before noticed (Night cxiv.).

[FN#254] These lines, with the Názir (eye or steward), the Hájib (Groom of the Chambers or Chamberlain) and Joseph, are also repeated from Night cxiv. For the Nazir see Al-Hariri (Nos. xiii. and xxii.)

[FN#255] The usual allusion to the Húr (Houris) from ""Hangar,"" the white and black of the eye shining in contrast. The Persian Magi also placed in their Heaven (Bihisht or Minu) ""Huran,"" or black-eyed nymphs, under the charge of the angel Zamiyád.

[FN#256] In the first hemistich, ""bi-shitt 'it wády"" (by the wady-bank): in the second, ""wa shatta 'l wády"" (""and my slayer""— i.e. wády act. part. of wady, killing—""hath paced away"").

[FN#257] The double entendre is from the proper names Budúr and Su'ád (Beatrice) also meaning ""auspicious (or blessed) full moons.""

[FN#258] Arab. ""Házir"" (also Ahl al-hazer, townsmen) and Bádi, a Badawi, also called ""Ahl al-Wabar,"" people of the camel's hair (tent) and A'aráb (Nomadic) as opposed to Arab (Arab settled or not). They still boast with Ibn Abbas, cousin of Mohammed, that they have kerchiefs (not turbands) for crowns, tents for houses, loops for walls, swords for scarves and poems for registers or written laws.

[FN#259] This is a peculiarity of the Jinn tribe when wearing hideous forms. It is also found in the Hindu Rakshasa.

[FN#260] Which, by the by, are small and beautifully shaped. The animal is very handy with them, as I learnt by experience when trying to ""Rareyfy"" one at Bayrut.

[FN#261] She being daughter of Al-Dimiryát, King of the Jinns.
Mr. W. F. Kirby has made him the subject of a pretty poem.

[FN#262] These lines have occurred in Night xxii. I give
Torrens's version (p. 223) by way of variety.

[FN#263] Arab. ""Kámat Alfiyyah,"" like an Alif, the first of the Arabic alphabet, the Heb. Aleph. The Arabs, I have said, took the flag or water leaf form and departed very far from the Egyptian original (we know from Plutarch that the hieroglyphic abecedarium began with ""a""), which was chosen by other imitators, namely the bull's head, and which in the cursive form, especially the Phnician, became a yoke. In numerals ""Alif"" denotes one or one thousand. It inherits the traditional honours of Alpha (as opposed to Omega) and in books, letters and writings generally it is placed as a monogram over the ""Bismillah,"" an additional testimony to the Unity. (See vol. i. p. 1.) In mediæval Christianity this place of honour was occupied by the cross: none save the wildest countries have preserved it, but our vocabulary still retains Criss' (Christ-)cross Row, for horn-book, on account of the old alphabet and nine digits disposed in the form of a Latin cross. Hence Tickell (""The Horn-book""):

                ——Mortals ne'er shall know
                More than contained of old the Chris'-cross Row.

[FN#264] The young man must have been a demon of chastity.

[FN#265] Arab. ""Kirát"" from i.e. bean, the seed of the Abrus precatorius, in weight=two to three (English) grains; and in length=one finger-breadth here; 24 being the total. The Moslem system is evidently borrowed from the Roman ""as"" and ""uncia.""

[FN#266] Names of women.

[FN#267] Arab. ""Amsa"" (lit. he passed the evening) like ""asbaha"" (he rose in the morning) ""Azhá"" (he spent the forenoon) and ""bata"" (he spent the night), are idiomatically used for ""to be in any state, to continue"" without specification of time or season.

[FN#268] Lit. ""my liver ;"" which viscus, and not the heart, is held the seat of passion, a fancy dating from the oldest days. Theocritus says of Hercules, ""In his liver Love had fixed a wound"" (Idyl. xiii.). In the Anthologia ""Cease, Love, to wound my liver and my heart"" (lib. vii.). So Horace (Odes, i. 2); his Latin Jecur and the Persian ""Jigar"" being evident congeners. The idea was long prevalent and we find in Shakespeare:—

                 Alas, then Love may be called appetite,
                 No motion of the liver but the palate.

[FN#269] A marvellous touch of nature, love ousting affection; the same trait will appear in the lover and both illustrate the deep Italian saying, ""Amor discende, non ascende."" The further it goes down the stronger it becomes as of grand-parent for grand-child and vice versa.

[FN#270] This tenet of the universal East is at once fact and unfact. As a generalism asserting that women's passion is ten times greater than man's (Pilgrimage, ii. 282), it is unfact. The world shows that while women have more philoprogenitiveness, men have more amativeness; otherwise the latter would not propose and would nurse the doll and baby. Pact, however, in low-lying lands, like Persian Mazanderan versus the Plateau; Indian Malabar compared with Marátha-land; California as opposed to Utah and especially Egypt contrasted with Arabia. In these hot damp climates the venereal requirements and reproductive powers of the female greatly exceed those of the male; and hence the dissoluteness of morals would be phenomenal, were it not obviated by seclusion, the sabre and the revolver. In cold-dry or hot-dry mountainous lands the reverse is the case; hence polygamy there prevails whilst the low countries require polyandry in either form, legal or illegal (i,e. prostitution) I have discussed this curious point of ""geographical morality"" (for all morality is, like conscience, both geographical and chronological), a subject so interesting to the lawgiver, the student of ethics and the anthropologist, in ""The City of the Saints "" But strange and unpleasant truths progress slowly, especially in England.

[FN#271] This morning evacuation is considered, in the East, a sine quâ non of health; and old Anglo-Indians are unanimous in their opinion of the ""bard fajar"" (as they mispronounce the dawn-clearance). The natives of India, Hindús (pagans) and Hindís (Moslems), unlike Europeans, accustom themselves to evacuate twice a day, evening as well as morning. This may, perhaps, partly account for their mildness and effeminacy; for:—

C'est la constipation qui rend l'homme rigoureux.

The English, since the first invasion of cholera, in October, 1831, are a different race from their costive grandparents who could not dine without a ""dinner-pill."" Curious to say the clyster is almost unknown to the people of Hindostan although the barbarous West Africans use it daily to ""wash 'um belly,"" as the Bonney-men say. And, as Sonnini notes to propose the process in Egypt under the Beys might have cost a Frankish medico his life.

[FN#272] The Egyptian author cannot refrain from this characteristic polissonnerie; and reading it out is always followed by a roar of laughter. Even serious writers like Al- Hariri do not, as I have noted, despise the indecency.

[FN#273] ""'Long beard and little wits,"" is a saying throughout the East where the Kausaj (= man with thin, short beard) is looked upon as cunning and tricksy. There is a venerable Joe Miller about a schoolmaster who, wishing to singe his long beard short, burnt it off and his face to boot:—which reminded him of the saying. A thick beard is defined as one which wholly conceals the skin; and in ceremonial ablution it must be combed out with the fingers till the water reach the roots. The Sunnat, or practice of the Prophet, was to wear the beard not longer than one hand and two fingers' breadth. In Persian ""Kúseh"" (thin beard) is an insulting term opposed to ""Khush-rísh,"" a well-bearded man. The Iranian growth is perhaps the finest in the world, often extending to the waist; but it gives infinite trouble, requiring, for instance, a bag when travelling. The Arab beard is often composed of two tufts on the chin-sides and straggling hairs upon the cheeks; and this is a severe mortification, especially to Shaykhs and elders, who not only look upon the beard as one of man's characteristics, but attach a religious importance to the appendage. Hence the enormity of Kamar al-Zaman's behaviour. The Persian festival of the vernal equinox was called Kusehnishín (Thin-beard sitting). An old man with one eye paraded the streets on an ass with a crow in one hand and a scourge and fan in the other, cooling himself, flogging the bystanders and crying heat! heat! (garmá! garmá!). For other particulars see Richardson (Dissertation, p. Iii.). This is the Italian Giorno delle Vecchie, Thursday in Mid Lent, March 12 (1885), celebrating the death of Winter and the birth of Spring.

[FN#274] I quote Torrens (p. 400) as these lines have occurred in
Night xxxviii.

[FN#275] Moslems have only two names for week days, Friday,
Al-Jum'ah or meeting-day, and Al-Sabt, Sabbath day, that is
Saturday. The others are known by numbers after Quaker fashion
with us, the usage of Portugal and Scandinavia.

[FN#276] Our last night.

[FN#277] Arab. ""Tayf""=phantom, the nearest approach to our ""ghost,"" that queer remnant of Fetishism imbedded in Christianity; the phantasma, the shade (not the soul) of tile dead. Hence the accurate Niebuhr declares, ""apparitions (i.e., of the departed) are unknown in Arabia."" Haunted houses are there tenanted by Ghuls, Jinns and a host of supernatural creatures; but not by ghosts proper; and a man may live years in Arabia before he ever hears of the ""Tayf."" With the Hindus it is otherwise (Pilgrimage iii. 144). Yet the ghost, the embodied fear of the dead and of death is common, in a greater or less degree, to all peoples; and, as modern Spiritualism proves, that ghost is not yet laid.

[FN#278] Mr. Payne (iii. 133) omits the lines which are àpropos de rein and read much like ""nonsense verses."" I retain them simply because they are in the text.

[FN#279] The first two couplets are the quatrain (or octave) in
Night xxxv.

[FN#280] Arab. ""Ar'ar,"" the Heb. ""Aroer,"" which Luther and the A.
V. translate ""heath."" The modern Aramaic name is ""Lizzáb""
(Unexplored Syria. i. 68).

[FN#281] In the old version and the Bresl. Edit. (iii. 220) the
Princess beats the ""Kahramánah,"" but does not kill her.

[FN#282] 'This is still the popular Eastern treatment of the insane.

[FN#283] Pers. ""Marz-bán"" = Warden of the Marches, Margrave. The foster-brother in the East is held dear as, and often dearer than, kith and kin.

[FN#284] The moderns believe most in the dawn-dream.
                —Quirinus

Post mediam noctem visus, quum somnia vera.
                  (Horace Sat. i. 10, 33,)

[FN#285] The Bresl. Edit. (iii. 223) and Galland have ""Torf:""
Lane (ii. 115) ""El-Tarf.""

[FN#286] Arab. ""Maghzal ;"" a more favourite comparison is with a tooth pick. Both are used by Nizami and Al-Hariri, the most ""elegant"" of Arab writers.

[FN#287] These form a Kasídah, Ode or Elegy= rhymed couplets numbering more than thirteen: If shorter it is called a ""Ghazal."" I have not thought it necessary to preserve the monorhyme.

[FN#288] Sulaymá dim. of Salmá= any beautiful woman Rabáb = the viol mostly single stringed: Tan'oum=she who is soft and gentle. These fictitious names are for his old flames.

[FN#289] i.e. wine. The distich is highly fanciful and the conceits would hardly occur to a

[FN#290] Arab. ""Andam,"" a term applied to Brazil-wood (also called ""Bakkam"") and to ""dragon's blood,"" but not, I think, to tragacanth, the ""goat's thorn,"" which does not dye. Andam is often mentioned in The Nights.

[FN#291] The superior merit of the first (explorer, etc.) is a lieu commun with Arabs. So Al-Hariri in Preface quotes his predecessor:—

                  Justly of praise the price I pay;
                  The praise is his who leads the way.

[FN#292] There were two Lukmans, of whom more in a future page.

[FN#293] This symbolic action is repeatedly mentioned in The
Nights.

[FN#294] Arab. ""Shakhs""=a person, primarily a dark spot. So ""Sawád""=blackness, in Al-Hariri means a group of people who darken the ground by their shade.

[FN#295] The first bath after sickness, I have said, is called
""Ghusl al-Sihhah,""—the Washing of Health.

[FN#296] The words ""malady"" and ""disease"" are mostly avoided during these dialogues as ill-omened words which may bring on a relapse.

[FN#297] Solomon's carpet of green silk which carried him and all his host through the air is a Talmudic legend generally accepted in Al-Islam though not countenanced by the Koran. chaps xxvii. When the ""gnat's wing"" is mentioned, the reference is to Nimrod who, for boasting that he was lord of all, was tortured during four hundred years by a gnat sent by Allah up his ear or nostril.

[FN#298] The absolute want of morality and filial affection in the chaste young man is supposed to be caused by the violence of his passion, and he would be pardoned because he ""loved much.""

[FN#299] I have noticed the geomantic process in my ""History of Sindh"" (chaps. vii.). It is called ""Zarb al-Ram!"" (strike the sand, the French say ""frapper le sable"") because the rudest form is to make on the ground dots at haphazard, usually in four lines one above the other: these are counted and, if even-numbered, two are taken ( ** ); if odd one ( * ); and thus the four lines will form a scheme say * * * * * * This is repeated three times, producing the same number of figures; and then the combination is sought in an explanatory table or, if the practitioner be expert, he pronounces off-hand. The Nights speak of a ""Takht Raml"" or a board, like a schoolboy's slate, upon which the dots are inked instead of points in sand. The moderns use a ""Kura'h,"" or oblong die, upon whose sides the dots, odd and even, are marked; and these dice are hand-thrown to form the e figure. By way of complication Geomancy is mixed up with astrology and then it becomes a most complicated kind of ariolation and an endless study. ""Napoleon's Book of Fate,"" a chap-book which appeared some years ago, was Geomancy in its simplest and most ignorant shape. For the rude African form see my Mission to Dahome, i. 332, and for that of Darfour, pp. 360-69 of Shaykh Mohammed's Voyage before quoted.

[FN#300] Translators understand this of writing marriage contracts; I take it in a more general sense.

[FN#301] These lines are repeated from Night Ixxv.: with Mr. Payne's permission I give his rendering (iii. 153) by way of variety.

[FN#302] The comparison is characteristically Arab.

[FN#303] Not her ""face"": the head, and especially the back of the head, must always be kept covered, even before the father.

[FN#304] Arab. ""Siwák""=a tooth-stick; ""Siwá-ka""=lit. other than thou.

[FN#305] Arab. ""Arák""=tooth stick of the wild caper-tree; ""Ará-ka"" lit.=I see thee. The capparis spinosa is a common desert-growth and the sticks about a span long (usually called Miswák), are sold in quantities at Meccah after being dipped in Zemzem water. In India many other woods are used, date-tree, Salvadora, Achyrantes, phyllanthus, etc. Amongst Arabs peculiar efficacy accompanies the tooth-stick of olive, ""the tree springing from Mount Sinai"" (Koran xxiii. 20); and Mohammed would use no other, because it prevents decay and scents the mouth. Hence Koran, chaps. xcv. 1. The ""Miswák"" is held with the unused end between the ring-finger and minimus, the two others grasp the middle and the thumb is pressed against the back close to the lips. These articles have long been sold at the Medical Hall near the ""Egyptian Hall,"" Piccadilly. They are better than our unclean tooth-brushes because each tooth gets its own especial rubbing' not a general sweep; at the same time the operation is longer and more troublesome. In parts of Africa as well as Asia many men walk about with the tooth-stick hanging by a string from the neck.

[FN#306] The ""Mehari,"" of which the Algerine-French speak, are the dromedaries bred by the Mahrah tribe of Al-Yaman, the descendants of Mahrat ibn Haydan. They are covered by small wild camels (?) called Al-Húsh, found between Oman and Al-Shihr: others explain the word to mean ""stallions of the Jinns "" and term those savage and supernatural animals, ""Najáib al-Mahriyah""nobles of the Mahrah.

[FN#307] Arab. ""Khaznah""=a thousand purses; now about £5000. It denotes a large sum of money, like the ""Badrah,"" a purse containing 10,000 dirhams of silver (Al-Hariri), or 80,000 (Burckhardt Prov. 380); whereas the ""Nisáb"" is a moderate sum of money, gen. 20 gold dinars=200 silver dirhams.

[FN#308] As The Nights show, Arabs admire slender forms; but the hips and hinder cheeks must be highly developed and the stomach fleshy rather than lean. The reasons are obvious. The Persians who exaggerate everything say e.g. (Husayn Váiz in the Anvár-i-Suhayli):—

                  How paint her hips and waist ? Who saw
                  A mountain (Koh) dangling to a straw (káh)?

In Antar his beloved Abla is a tamarisk (T. Orientalis). Others compare with the palm-tree (Solomon), the Cypress (Persian, esp. Hafiz and Firdausi) and the Arák or wild Capparis (Arab.).

[FN#309] Ubi aves ibi angel). All African travellers know that a few birds flying about the bush, and a few palm-trees waving in the wind, denote the neighbourhood of a village or a camp (where angels are scarce). The reason is not any friendship for man but because food, animal and vegetable, is more plentiful Hence Albatrosses, Mother Carey's (Mater Cara, the Virgin) chickens, and Cape pigeons follow ships.

[FN#310] The stanza is called Al-Mukhammas=cinquains; the quatrains and the ""bob,"" or ""burden"" always preserve the same consonance. It ends with a Koranic lieu commun of Moslem morality.

[FN#311] Moslem port towns usually have (or had) only two gates. Such was the case with Bayrut, Tyre, Sidon and a host of others; the faubourg-growth of modern days has made these obsolete. The portals much resemble the entrances of old Norman castles—Arques for instance. (Pilgrimage i. 185.)

[FN#312] Arab. ""Lisám""; before explained.

[FN#313] i.e. Life of Souls (persons, etc.).

[FN#314] Arab. ""Insánu-há""=her (i.e. their) man: i.e. the babes of the eyes: the Assyrian Ishon, dim. of Ish=Man; which the Hebrews call ""Bábat"" or ""Bit"" (the daughter) the Arabs ""Bubu (or Hadakat) al-Aye""; the Persians ""Mardumak-i-chashm"" (mannikin of the eye); the Greeks and the Latins pupa, pupula, pupilla. I have noted this in the Lyricks of Camoens (p. 449).

[FN#315] Ma'an bin Zá'idah, a soldier and statesman of the eighth century.

[FN#316] The mildness of the Caliph Mu'áwiyah, the founder of the Ommiades, proverbial among the Arabs, much resembles the ""meekness"" of Moses the Law-giver, which commentators seem to think has been foisted into Numbers xii. 3.

[FN#317] Showing that there had been no consummation of the marriage which would have demanded ""Ghusl,"" or total ablution, at home or in the Hammam.

[FN#318] I have noticed this notable desert-growth.

[FN#319] 'The ""situation"" is admirable, solution appearing so difficult and catastrophe imminent.

[FN#320] This quatrain occurs in Night ix.: I have borrowed from
Torrens (p. 79) by way of variety.

[FN#321] The belief that young pigeon's blood resembles the virginal discharge is universal; but the blood most resembling man's is that of the pig which in other points is so very human. In our day Arabs and Hindus rarely submit to inspection the nuptial sheet as practiced by the Israelites and Persians. The bride takes to bed a white kerchief with which she staunches the blood and next morning the stains are displayed in the Harem. In Darfour this is done by the bridegroom. ""Prima Venus debet esse cruenta,"" say the Easterns with much truth, and they have no faith in our complaisant creed which allows the hymen-membrane to disappear by any but one accident.

[FN#322] Not meaning the two central divisions commanded by the
King and his Wazir.

[FN#323] Ironicè.

[FN#324] Arab. ""Rasy""=praising in a funeral sermon.

[FN#325] Arab. ""Manáyá,"" plur. of ""Maniyat"" = death. Mr. R. S. Poole (the Academy, April 26, 1879) reproaches Mr. Payne for confounding ""Muniyat"" (desire) with ""Maniyat"" (death) but both are written the same except when vowel-points are used.

[FN#326] Arab. ""Iddat,"" alluding to the months of celibacy which, according to Moslem law, must be passed by a divorced woman before she can re-marry.

[FN#327] Arab. ""Talák bi'l-Salásah""=a triple divorce which cannot be revoked; nor can the divorcer re-marry the same woman till after consummation with another husband. This subject will continually recur.

[FN#328] An allusion to a custom of the pagan Arabs in the days of ignorant Heathenism The blood or brain, soul or personality of the murdered man formed a bird called Sady or Hámah (not the Humá or Humái, usually translated ""phnix"") which sprang from the head, where four of the five senses have their seat, and haunted his tomb, crying continually, ""Uskúni!""=Give me drink (of the slayer's blood) ! and which disappeared only when the vendetta was accomplished. Mohammed forbade the belief. Amongst the Southern Slavs the cuckoo is supposed to be the sister of a murdered man ever calling or vengeance.

[FN#329] To obtain a blessing and show how he valued it.

[FN#330] Well-known tribes of proto-historic Arabs who flourished before the time of Abraham: see Koran (chaps. xxvi. et passim). They will be repeatedly mentioned in The Nights and notes.

[FN#331] Arab. ""Amtár""; plur. of ""Matr,"" a large vessel of leather or wood for water, etc.

[FN#332] Arab. ""Asáfírí,"" so called because they attract sparrows (asáfír) a bird very fond of the ripe oily fruit. In the Romance of ""Antar"" Asáfír camels are beasts that fly like birds in fleetness. The reader must not confound the olives of the text with the hard unripe berries (""little plums pickled in stale"") which appear at English tables, nor wonder that bread and olives are the beef-steak and potatoes of many Mediterranean peoples It is an excellent diet, the highly oleaginous fruit supplying the necessary carbon,

[FN#333] Arab. ""Tamer al-Hindi""=the ""Indian-date,"" whence our word ""Tamarind."" A sherbet of the pods, being slightly laxative, is much drunk during the great heats; and the dried fruit, made into small round cakes, is sold in the bazars. The traveller is advised not to sleep under the tamarind's shade, which is infamous for causing ague and fever. In Sind I derided the ""native nonsense,"" passed the night under an ""Indian date-tree"" and awoke with a fine specimen of ague which lasted me a week.

[FN#334] Moslems are not agreed upon the length of the Day of Doom when all created things, marshalled by the angels, await final judgment; the different periods named are 40 years, 70, 300 and 50,000. Yet the trial itself will last no longer than while one may milk an ewe, or than ""the space between two milkings of a she-camel."" This is bringing down Heaven to Earth with a witness; but, after all, the Heaven of all faiths, including ""Spiritualism,"" the latest development, is only an earth more or less glorified even as the Deity is humanity more or less perfected.

[FN#335] Arab. ""Al-Kamaráni,"" lit. ""the two moons."" Arab rhetoric prefers it to ""Shamsáni,"" or {`two suns,"" because lighter (akhaff), to pronounce. So, albeit Omar was less worthy than Abu-Bakr the two are called ""Al-Omaráni,"" in vulgar parlance, Omarayn.

[FN#336] Alluding to the angels who appeared to the Sodomites in the shape of beautiful youths (Koran xi.).

[FN#337] Koran xxxiii. 38.

[FN#338] ""Niktu-hu taklidan"" i.e. not the real thing (with a woman). It may also mean ""by his incitement of me."" All this scene is written in the worst form of Persian-Egyptian blackguardism, and forms a curious anthropological study. The ""black joke"" of the true and modest wife is inimitable.

[FN#339] Arab. ""Jamíz"" (in Egypt ""Jammayz"") = the fruit of the true sycomore (F. Sycomorus) a magnificent tree which produces a small tasteless fig, eaten by the poorer classes in Egypt and by monkeys. The ""Tín"" or real fig here is the woman's parts; the ""mulberry- fig,"" the anus. Martial (i. 65) makes the following distinction:—

                  Dicemus ficus, quas scimus in arbore nasci,
                  Dicemus ficos, Caeciliane, tuos.

And Modern Italian preserves a difference between fico and fica.

[FN#340] Arab. ""Ghániyat Azárá"" (plur. of Azrá = virgin): the former is properly a woman who despises ornaments and relies on ""beauty unadorned"" (i.e. in bed).

[FN#341] ""Nihil usitatius apud monachos, cardinales, sacrificulos,"" says Johannes de la Casa Beneventius Episcopus, quoted by Burton Anat. of Mel. lib. iii. Sect. 2; and the famous epitaph on the Jesuit,

                  Ci-git un Jesuite:
                  Passant, serre les fesses et passe vite!

[FN#342] Arab. ""Kiblah""=the fronting-place of prayer, Meccah for Moslems, Jerusalem for Jews and early Christians. See Pilgrimage (ii. 321) for the Moslem change from Jerusalem to Meccah and ibid. (ii. 213) for the way in which the direction was shown.

[FN#343] The Koran says (chaps. ii.): ""Your wives are your tillage: go in therefore unto your tillage in what manner so ever ye will."" Usually this is understood as meaning in any posture, standing or sitting, lying, backwards or forwards. Yet there is a popular saying about the man whom the woman rides (vulg. St. George, in France, le Postillon); ""Cursed be who maketh woman Heaven and himself earth!"" Some hold the Koranic passage to have been revealed in confutation of the Jews, who pretended that if a man lay with his wife backwards, he would beget a cleverer child. Others again understand it of preposterous venery, which is absurd: every ancient law-giver framed his code to increase the true wealth of the people—population—and severely punished all processes, like onanism, which impeded it. The Persians utilise the hatred of women for such misuse when they would force a wive to demand a divorce and thus forfeit her claim to Mahr (dowry); they convert them into catamites till, after a month or so, they lose all patience and leave the house.

[FN#344] Koran lit 9: ""He will be turned aside from the Faith (or Truth) who shall be turned aside by the Divine decree;"" alluding, in the text, to the preposterous venery her lover demands.
[FN#345] Arab. ""Futúh"" meaning openings, and also victories, benefits. The lover congratulates her on her mortifying self in order to please him.

[FN#346] ""And the righteous work will be exalt"": (Koran xxxv. 11) applied ironically.

[FN#347] A prolepsis of Tommy Moore:—

                 Your mother says, my little Venus,
                 There's something not quite right between us,
                               And you're in fault as much as I,
                  Now, on my soul, my little Venus,
                  I swear 'twould not be right between us,
                               To let your mother tell a lie.

But the Arab is more moral than Mr. Little. as he purposes to repent.

[FN#348] Arab. ""Khunsa"" flexible or flaccid, from Khans=bending inwards, i.e. the mouth of a water-skin before drinking. Like Mukhannas, it is also used for an effeminate man, a passive sodomite and even for a eunuch. Easterns still believe in what Westerns know to be an impossibility, human beings with the parts and proportions of both sexes equally developed and capable of reproduction; and Al-Islam even provides special rules for them (Pilgrimage iii. 237). We hold them to be Buffon's fourth class of (duplicate) monsters belonging essentially to one or the other sex, and related to its opposite only by some few characteristics. The old Greeks dreamed, after their fashion, a beautiful poetic dream of a human animal uniting the contradictory beauties of man and woman. The duality of the generative organs seems an old Egyptian tradition, at least we find it in Genesis (i. 27) where the image of the Deity is created male and female, before man was formed out of the dust of the ground (ii. 7). The old tradition found its way to India (if the Hindus did not borrow the idea from the Greeks); and one of the forms of Mahadeva, the third person of their triad, is entitled ""Ardhanárí""=the Half-woman, which has suggested to them some charming pictures. Europeans, seeing the left breast conspicuously feminine, have indulged in silly surmises about the ""Amazons.""

[FN#349] This is a mere phrase for our ""dying of laughter"": the queen was on her back. And as Easterns sit on carpets, their falling back is very different from the same movement off a chair.

[FN#350] Arab. ""Ismid,"" the eye-powder before noticed.

[FN#351] When the Caliph (e.g. Al-Tá'i li'llah) bound a banner to a spear and handed it to an officer, he thereby appointed him Sultan or Viceregent.

[FN#352] Arab. ""Sháib al-ingház""=lit. a gray beard who shakes head in disapproval.

[FN#353] Arab. ""Ayát"" = the Hebr. ""Ototh,"" signs, wonders or
Koranic verses.

[FN#354] The Chapter ""Al-Ikhlás"" i.e. clearing (oneself from any faith but that of Unity) is No. cxii. and runs thus:—

                  Say, He is the One God!
                                The sempiternal God,
                   He begetteth not, nor is He begot,
                              And unto Him the like is not.

It is held to be equal in value to one-third of the Koran, and is daily used in prayer. Mr. Rodwell makes it the tenth.

[FN#355] The Lady Budur shows her noble blood by not objecting to her friend becoming her Zarrat (sister-wife). This word is popularly derived from ""Zarar""=injury; and is vulgarly pronounced in Egypt ""Durrah"" sounding like Durrah = a parrot (see Burckhardt's mistake in Prov. 314). The native proverb says, ""Ayshat al-durrah murrah,"" the sister-wife hath a bitter life. We have no English equivalent; so I translate indifferently co-wife, co-consort, sister-wife or sister in wedlock.

[FN#356] Lane preserves the article ""El-Amjad"" and ""El-As'ad;"" which is as necessary as to say ""the John"" or ""the James,"" because neo-Latins have ""il Giovanni"" or ""il Giacomo."" In this matter of the article, however, it is impossible to lay down a universal rule: in some cases it must be preserved and only practice in the language can teach its use. For instance, it is always present in Al-Bahrayn and al-Yaman; but not necessarily so with Irak and Najd.

[FN#357] It is hard to say why this ugly episode was introduced.
It is a mere false note in a tune pretty enough.

[FN#358] The significance of this action will presently appear.

[FN#359] An ""Hadís.""

[FN#360] Arab. ""Sabb"" = using the lowest language of abuse. chiefly concerning women-relatives and their reproductive parts.

[FN#361] The reader will note in the narration concerning the two Queens the parallelism of the Arab's style which recalls that of the Hebrew poets. Strings of black silk are plaited into the long locks (an ""idiot-fringe"" being worn over the brow) because a woman is cursed ""who joineth her own hair to the hair of another"" (especially human hair). Sending the bands is a sign of affectionate submission; and, in extremes"" cases the hair itself is sent.

[FN#362] i.e., suffer similar pain at the spectacle, a phrase often occurring.

[FN#363] i.e., when the eye sees not, the heart grieves not.

[FN#364] i.e., unto Him we shall return, a sentence recurring in almost every longer chapter of the Koran.

[FN#365] Arab. ""Kun,"" the creative Word (which, by the by, proves the Koran to be an uncreated Logos); the full sentence being ""Kun fa kána"" = Be! and it became. The origin is evidently, ""And God said, Let there be light: and there was light"" (Gen. i. 3); a line grand in its simplicity and evidently borrowed from the Egyptians, even as Yahveh (Jehovah) from ""Ankh""=He who lives (Brugsch Hist. ii. 34).

[FN#366] i.e. but also for the life and the so-called ""soul.""

[FN#367] Arab. ""Layáli""=lit. nights which, I have said, is often applied to the whole twenty-four hours. Here it is used in the sense of ""fortune"" or ""fate ;"" like ""days"" and ""days and nights.""

[FN#368] Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr a nephew of Ayishah, who had rebuilt the Ka'abah in A.H. 64 (A.D. 683), revolted (A.D. 680) against Yezid and was proclaimed Caliph at Meccah. He was afterwards killed (A.D. 692) by the famous or infamous Hajjáj general of Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, the fifth Ommiade, surnamed ""Sweat of a stone"" (skin-flint) and ""Father of Flies,"" from his foul breath. See my Pilgrimage, etc. (iii. 192-194), where are explained the allusions to the Ka'abah and the holy Black Stone.

[FN#369] These lines are part of an elegy on the downfall of one of the Moslem dynasties in Spain, composed in the twelfth century by Ibn Abdun al-Andalúsi. The allusion is to the famous conspiracy of the Khárijites (the first sectarians in Mohammedanism) to kill Ah, Mu'awiyah and Amru (so written but pronounced ""Amr"") al-As, in order to abate intestine feuds m Al-Islam. Ali was slain with a sword-cut by Ibn Muljam a name ever damnable amongst the Persians; Mu'awiyah escaped with a wound and Kharijah, the Chief of Police at Fustat or old Cairo was murdered by mistake for Amru. After this the sectarian wars began.

[FN#370] Arab. ""Saráb""= (Koran, chaps. xxiv.) the reek of the Desert, before explained. It is called ""Lama,"" the shine, the loom, in Al-Hariri. The world is compared with the mirage, the painted eye and the sword that breaks in the sworder's hand.

[FN#371] Arab. ""Dunyá,"" with the common alliteration ""dániyah"" (=Pers. ""dún""), in prose as well as poetry means the things or fortune of this life opp. to ""Akhirah""=future life.

[FN#372] Arab. ""Walgh,"" a strong expression primarily denoting the lapping of dogs; here and elsewhere ""to swill, saufen.""

[FN#373] The lines are repeated from Night ccxxi. I give Lane's version (ii. 162) by way of contrast and—warning.

[FN#374] ""Sáhirah"" is the place where human souls will be gathered on Doom-day: some understand by it the Hell Sa'ír (No. iv.) intended for the Sabians or the Devils generally.

[FN#375] His eyes are faded like Jacob's which, after weeping for Joseph, ""became white with mourning"" (Koran, chaps. xxi.). It is a stock comparison.

[FN#376] The grave.

[FN#377] Arab. ""Sawwán"" (popularly pronounced Suwán) =""Syenite"" from Syrene; generally applied to silex, granite or any hard stone.

[FN#378] A proceeding fit only for thieves and paupers: ""Alpinism"" was then unknown. ""You come from the mountain"" (al-Jabal) means, ""You are a clod-hopper""; and ""I will sit upon the mountain""=turn anchorite or magician. (Pilgrimage i. 106.)

[FN#379] Corresponding with wayside chapels in Catholic countries. The Moslem form would be either a wall with a prayer niche (Mibráb) fronting Meccah-wards or a small domed room. These little oratories are often found near fountains, streams or tree-clumps where travellers would be likely to alight. I have described one in Sind (""Scinde or the Unhappy Valley"" i. 79), and have noted that scrawling on the walls is even more common in the East than in the West; witness the monuments of old Egypt bescribbled by the Greeks and Romans. Even the paws of the Sphinx are covered with such graffiti; and those of Ipsambul or Abu Símbal have proved treasures to epigraphists.

[FN#380] In tales this characterises a Persian; and Hero Rustam is always so pictured.

[FN#381] The Parsis, who are the representatives of the old Guebres, turn towards the sun and the fire as their Kiblah or point of prayer; all deny that they worship it. But, as in the case of saints' images, while the educated would pray before them for edification (Labia) the ignorant would adore them (Dulia); and would make scanty difference between the ""reverence of a servant"" and the ""reverence of a slave."" The human sacrifice was quite contrary to Guebre, although not to Hindu, custom; although hate and vengeance might prompt an occasional murder.

[FN#382] These oubliettes are common in old eastern houses as in the medieval Castles of Europe, and many a stranger has met his death in them. They are often so well concealed that even the modern inmates are not aware of their existence.

[FN#383] Arab. ""Bakk""; hence our ""bug"" whose derivation (like that of ""cat"" ""dog"" and ""hog"") is apparently unknown to the dictionaries, always excepting M. Littré's.

[FN#384] i.e. thy beauty is ever increasing.

[FN#385] Alluding, as usual, to the eye-lashes, e.g.
An eyelash arrow from an eyebrow bow.

[FN#386] Lane (ii. 168) reads:—""The niggardly female is protected by her niggardness;"" a change of ""Nahílah"" (bee-hive) into ""Bakhílah"" (she skin flint).

[FN#387] Koran iv. 38. The advantages are bodily strength, understanding and the high privilege of Holy War. Thus far, and thus far only, woman amongst Moslems is ""lesser

[FN#388] Arab. ""Amir Yákhúr,"" a corruption of ""Akhor""=stable
(Persian).

[FN#389] A servile name in Persian, meaning ""the brave,"" and a title of honour at the Court of Delhi when following the name. Many English officers have made themselves ridiculous (myself amongst the number) by having it engraved on their seal-rings, e.g. Brown Sáhib Bahádur. To write the word ""Behadir"" or ""Bahádir"" is to adopt the wretched Turkish corruption.

[FN#390] ""Jerry Sneak"" would be the English reader's comment; but in the East all charges are laid upon women.

[FN#391] Here the formula means ""I am sorry for it, but I couldn't help it.""

[FN#392] A noble name of the Persian Kings (meaning the planet
Mars) corrupted in Europe to Varanes.

[FN#393] Arab. ""Jalláb,"" one of the three muharramát or forbiddens, the Hárik al-hajar (burner of stone) the Káti' al-shajar (cutter of trees, without reference to Hawarden N. B.) and the Báyi' al-bashar (seller of men, vulg. Jalláb). The two former worked, like the Italian Carbonari, in desert places where they had especial opportunities for crime. (Pilgrimage iii. 140.) None of these things must be practiced during Pilgrimage on the holy soil of Al-Hijaz—not including Jeddah.

[FN#394] The verses contain the tenets of the Murjiy sect which attaches infinite importance to faith and little or none to works. Sale (sect. viii.) derives his ""Morgians"" from the ""Jabrians"" (Jabari), who are the direct opponents of the ""Kadarians"" (Kadari), denying free will and free agency to man and ascribing his actions wholly to Allah. Lane (ii. 243) gives the orthodox answer to the heretical question:—

Water could wet him not if God please guard His own; *
Nor need man care though bound of hands in sea he's thrown:
But if His Lord decree that he in sea be drowned; *
He'll drown albeit in the wild and wold he wone.

It is the old quarrel between Predestination and Freewill which cannot be solved except by assuming a Law without a Lawgiver.

[FN#395] Our proverb says: Give a man luck and throw him into the sea.

[FN#396] As a rule Easterns, I repeat, cover head and face when sleeping especially in the open air and moonlight. Europeans find the practice difficult, and can learn it only by long habit.

[FN#397] Pers. = a flower-garden. In Galland, Bahram has two daughters, Bostama and Cavam a. In the Bres. Edit. the daughter is ""Bostan"" and the slave-girl ""Kawám.""

[FN#398] Arab. ""Kahíl""=eyes which look as if darkened with antimony: hence the name of the noble Arab breed of horses ""Kuhaylat"" (Al-Ajuz, etc.).

[FN#399] ""As'ad""=more (or most) fortunate.

[FN#400] This is the vulgar belief, although Mohammed expressly disclaimed the power in the Koran (chaps. xiii. 8), ""Thou art commissioned to be a preacher only and not a worker of miracles."" ""Signs"" (Arab. Ayát) may here also mean verses of the Koran, which the Apostle of Allah held to be his standing miracles. He despised the common miracula which in the East are of everyday occurrence and are held to be easy for any holy man. Hume does not believe in miracles because he never saw one. Had he travelled in the East he would have seen (and heard of) so many that his scepticism (more likely that testimony should be false than miracles be true) would have been based on a firmer foundation. It is one of the marvels of our age that whilst two-thirds of Christendom (the Catholics and the ""Orthodox"" Greeks) believe in ""miracles"" occurring not only in ancient but even in our present days, the influential and intelligent third (Protestant) absolutely ""denies the fact.""

Corrine I want no opinion from you
Was it fun or just a bad thing to do
And while you play, I’m waiting for the day
I’ll find some way to make you pay

[Chorus]
But then you come and you pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
I need some food, some sleep
Some company to keep
The sun, some shade
A word and a will made

[Verse 2]
And drink, my cabinet’s open wide
I’ll take something to make me go wild
In truth, good fortune sets me free
Would vengeance make a killer of me

[Chorus]
Pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
I need some food, some sleep

The sun, some shade
And somebody’s bed

Lull me around, drag my bad name down

Would Jesus pull me around

Friends tell me I am crazy
That I'm wasting time with you
You'll never be mine
That's not the way I see it
'Cause I feel you're already mine
Whenever you're with me

People always talk about reputation
I don't care about your other girls
Just be good to me
Friends are always telling me you're a user
I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me

Friends seem to always listen
To the bad things that you do
You never do them to me
You may have many others
But I know when you're with me
You are all mine

And you I won't try to change
We talk about it and I'd
Rather have a piece of you
Than all of nothing

In the morning
Just be good to me
In the afternoon or evening
Just be good to me

I'm not the jealous kind
I won't tie you down
When you need me
I'll be around

You'll be good to me

Be together

You know I felt it from the start
And when we kiss
It starts a chain reaction

As I was walkin' by
Saw you standin' there with a smile
Lookin' shy you caught my eye
Thought you'd want to hang for a while
Well I'd like to be with you
And you know it's Friday too
I hope you can find the time
This weekend to relax and unwind
My mind's tired
I've worked so hard all week
Ooh all week
I cashed my check I'm ready to go
I promise you I'll show you such a good time

[Chorus]
Come on baby let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
Let's go

We'll have a good time
Es-ca-pade
Leave your worries behind
Es-ca-pade
Well you can be mine
Es-ca-pade

Just have a good time
We'll make the rules up
As we go along
And break them all
If we're not havin' fun

It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands

[Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

[Verse 2]
Mutual misunderstandin'
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns

Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through

(Verse 1)
Everyday we used to slip away to talk
We would talk about the goodness of your heart
Now it seems I admit that never exist at all
And it leaves me feeling empty
With this hollow chord

(Chorus)
Make it like it was
The way it used to be
When i hungered for your love
Constantly
Make it like it was
It was easier for me
I know you're able
To make it like it was

(Verse 2)
At a certain time you would find me on my knees
Asking you to show light on my brother's needs
Now it seems the needs are a secondary thing
And it truly makes me wonder
Whats really happening

(Chorus)
Make it like it was
The way it used to be
When i hungered for your love
Constantly
Make it like it was
It was easier for me
I know you're able
To make it like it was

(Bridge)
Now when I compare there's really no comparing
I just want it the way it used to be
Just the thought of living with the horror
Makes me ask that you make it like it was

Make it like it was

When i hungered for your love
Constantly
Make it like it was
It was easier for me
I know you're able
To make it like it was

Face to face
We forget
Time and place

Hold me now
Don't let go
Though it hurts and we both know

The time we spend together's gonna fly
And everything you do to me
Is gonna feel so right

Baby, when you're loving me
I feel like I could cry
'Cause there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you
No, no, no, no, no

Here we are
All alone
Trembling hearts
Beating strong

Reaching out
Breathless kiss
I never thought could feel like this

I want to stop the time from passing by
I wanna close my eyes
And feel your lips are touching mine

Baby, when you're close to me
I want you more each time
And there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you

There's nothing I can do
I'm helpless in your arms
Oh, baby what you do

I'm in love
This is it
There's no turning back this time
No, no, no

Here we are
Once again
But this time we're only friends

Funny world sometimes lies
Become the game
When loves the prize

And though no one knows
What's going on inside
And all the love I feel for you
Is something I should hide

When I have you close to me
The feeling's so sublime
But there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you
No, no, no

Can't keep from loving you, baby
No, no, no
There's nothing I can do my baby
Can't keep from loving you","['here', 'we', 'be', 'face', 'to', 'face', 'we', 'forget', 'time', 'and', 'place', 'hold', 'me', 'now', 'dont', 'let', 'go', 'though', 'it', 'hurt', 'and', 'we', 'both', 'know', 'the', 'time', 'we', 'spend', 'togethers', 'gonna', 'fly', 'and', 'everything', 'you', 'do', 'to', 'me', 'be', 'gonna', 'feel', 'so', 'right', 'baby', 'when', 'youre', 'love', 'me', 'i', 'feel', 'like', 'i', 'could', 'cry', 'cause', 'theres', 'nothing', 'i', 'can', 'do', 'to', 'keep', 'from', 'love', 'you', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'here', 'we', 'be', 'all', 'alone', 'tremble', 'hearts', 'beat', 'strong', 'reach', 'out', 'breathless', 'kiss', 'i', 'never', 'think', 'could', 'feel', 'like', 'this', 'i', 'want', 'to', 'stop', 'the', 'time', 'from', 'pass', 'by', 'i', 'wanna', 'close', 'my', 'eye', 'and', 'feel', 'your', 'lips', 'be', 'touch', 'mine', 'baby', 'when', 'youre', 'close', 'to', 'me', 'i', 'want', 'you', 'more', 'each', 'time', 'and', 'theres', 'nothing', 'i', 'can', 'do', 'to', 'keep', 'from', 'love', 'you', 'theres', 'nothing', 'i', 'can', 'do', 'im', 'helpless', 'in', 'your', 'arm', 'oh', 'baby', 'what', 'you', 'do', 'im', 'in', 'love', 'this', 'be', 'it', 'theres', 'no', 'turn', 'back', 'this', 'time', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'here', 'we', 'be', 'once', 'again', 'but', 'this', 'time', 'be', 'only', 'friends', 'funny', 'world', 'sometimes', 'lie', 'become', 'the', 'game', 'when', 'love', 'the', 'prize', 'and', 'though', 'no', 'one', 'know', 'whats', 'go', 'on', 'inside', 'and', 'all', 'the', 'love', 'i', 'feel', 'for', 'you', 'be', 'something', 'i', 'should', 'hide', 'when', 'i', 'have', 'you', 'close', 'to', 'me', 'the', 'feel', 'so', 'sublime', 'but', 'theres', 'nothing', 'i', 'can', 'do', 'to', 'keep', 'from', 'love', 'you', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'cant', 'keep', 'from', 'love', 'you', 'baby', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'theres', 'nothing', 'i', 'can', 'do', 'my', 'baby', 'cant', 'keep', 'from', 'love', 'you']",253,Gloria Estefan,Gloria Estefan,1990,"[96, 88, 76, 62, 55, 44, 29, 25, 8, 6, 8, 12, 14, 19, 23, 31, 37, 44]",18,Here We Are,https://open.spotify.com/track/4asTNYhhrp323lLp81KIKQ,4asTNYhhrp323lLp81KIKQ,spotify:track:4asTNYhhrp323lLp81KIKQ,Cuts Both Ways,4rPsV2qfjewaH9tAidFVv9,spotify:album:4rPsV2qfjewaH9tAidFVv9,Gloria Estefan,5IFCkqu9J6xdWeYMk5I889,spotify:artist:5IFCkqu9J6xdWeYMk5I889,289.706,12.0,36.0,1989-07-11,0.6940000000000001,0.467,9.0,-14.437,1.0,0.0329,0.639,1.6100000000000002e-05,0.0869,0.63,142.132,"['dance pop', 'latin pop', 'new wave pop', 'soft rock']",[],1.0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02100000000000002

C'mon And Get My Love
C'mon And Get My Love
D-Mob Introducing Cathy Dennis
Written by D. Poku
C'mon & get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you
Break it down
So many times I've been around you
And I know how much I like you
It's like a dream each time I see you
And there's this magic in the air
I feel so shy that I can't approach you
Even though you're just there
But I know that one day I'll get my way
And this is what I'll say
C'mon and get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you
C'mon and get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you
And in my dreams I am with you
And I dance with your silhouette
There are many times I've tried to squeeze you
In these dreams I won't forget
It seems so long we've been together
Since way back then
And only if you knew how much I loved you
You'd turn to me and say.....
Let's just say that our love is right
Would you kiss and hold me tight
Cos I want to hold you and squeeze you
And tell you that I love you
Each and every night
Let's just say that our love is strong
Would you know were you belong
Or would I have to show you and teach you
Hold you and please you to show you that you belong
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you
If there's been a time that I needed you
Then the time is now
I want to see you every hour
When I think I always hear you say....
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you

324,324,Keep It Together,"[Intro]
One, two, three, hit It
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever

[Verse 1]
I got brothers
I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face
I'm tired of sharing all the hand-me-downs
To get attention, I must always be the clown
I wanna be different, I wanna be on my own
But Daddy said, 'Listen, you will always have a home""

[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

[Verse 2]
I hit the big time, but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger
City life can get to you
People can be so cold
Never want to turn your back
Just giving to get something, always wanting something back

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lonely and I need to be loved for who I am
Not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

[Refrain]
When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
Because blood is thicker than any other circumstance

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lonely and I need to be loved for who I am
Not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

[Refrain]
When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
Because blood is thicker than any other circumstance

[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

[Outro]
Keep, keep it together

325,325,True Blue Love,"Had enough of my yesterdays
Can't go back to mistakes that I've made
Had enough of my dark side
And the hard ride we've been through

Now I know I've got so much to prove
But don't let go, I've been a heart-selfish fool
It's a feeling I'm rising above
And I'll give you love, true love, true blue love
Give you true blue love

And I know into one heart that's shattered
Tenderness is the only thing that matters
Don't turn away from true blue love

Running hard in an empty race
Just take a look at the lines on this face
In my eyes you can measure the miles
But no one can measure desire

So take my hand, can you feel how it burns
Don't let go till your heart finally learns
Why this wandering soul has returned
To give you love, true love, true blue love
Give you true blue love

And I know into one heart that's shattered
Tenderness is the only thing that matters
Don't turn away from true blue love

And I know into one soul that's healing
Loneliness is the only thing you're feeling
Don't turn away from true blue love

I'll give you love, true love, true blue love
Give you true blue love

Now I know into one heart that's shattered
Tenderness is the only thing that matters
Don't turn away from true blue love

Now I know into one soul that's healing
Loneliness is the only thing you're feeling
Don't turn away, away from true blue love

Into one heart that's shattered
Tenderness is the only thing that matters
Don't turn away from true blue love

No more loneliness
Just some tenderness
Don't turn away true blue love

Only tenderness
No more loneliness
Oh, baby, I'll give you true blue love
Oh yeah, only tenderness
Don't turn away

326,326,Sometimes She Cries,"Mercy don't think she's pretty no more
Starin' at the stars through her back screen door
She tries and tries to make it all work out
No matter what she does
She's left standin' in the middle of doubt
In a lonely day
And in the pourin' rain
You can count on me

Sometimes she cries
When she's alone at night
Sometimes she weeps
When she's feelin' cold and weak
Sometimes the pain
It just tears her up inside
Sometimes she cries
Ooh, I wonder why

Mercy don't have a lover no more
She plays with her pillow
Stares at the bedroom floor
Used to have a million
They've come and gone
No matter what she does
She can't figure out what she's doin' wrong
In a lonely night
And in the pourin' rain
You can count on me

Sometimes she cries
When she's alone at night
Sometimes she weeps
When she's feelin' cold and weak
Sometimes the pain
Oh, it tears her up inside
Sometimes she cries
Ooh yeah

Livin', lovin', giving everything you got
After all the heartache
Maybe give love just one more shot away

In a lonely night
And in the pourin' rain
The only thing I really wanna know is why

Sometimes she cries
When she's alone at night
Sometimes she weeps
When she's feelin' cold and weak
Sometimes the pain

That I don't say the things I should
To you, I act like I'm no good
And you, wait for me patiently
This house is not a home without you
It takes two hearts to share

Your eyes will always see through me
And bring me to my knees
And I will always turn to you
You're everything I need

And through the good and bad times
You have always been there
We hold each other close
You tell me it's alright
The nights we fight about it
Never dream of givin' up
That's the price of love

Love, sometimes it makes us cry
Forgive me when I get it wrong
Sometimes it's hard to be that strong
And oh, I would do anything
For you I'd turn the stars around
I'd find a way somehow

This time, you'll see I built a bridge to you again
Love shines, we'll sweep away the past
We're more than lovers, more than friends

And through the good and bad times
You have always been there
We hold each other tight
You tell me it's alright
The nights we fight about it
Never think of givin' up
That's the price of love

And bring me to my knees
And I will always turn to you
You're everything I need

And through the good and bad times
You have always been there

You tell me it's alright
And sometimes I can't give enough

Right at this moment I'm totally cool
Clear as a crystal, sharp as a knife
I feel like I'm in the prime of my life
Sometimes it feels like I'm going too fast
I don't know how long this feeling will last
Maybe it's only tonight

[Chorus 1]
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes

Sometimes I'm tired, sometimes I'm shot
Sometimes I don't know how much more I've got
Maybe I'm headed over the hill
Maybe I've set myself up for the kill
Tell me how much do you think you can take
Until the heart in you is starting to break?
Sometimes it feels like it will

[Chorus 2]
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes

Out of the darkness, into the light
Leaving the scene of the crime
Either I'm wrong or I'm perfectly right every time
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes?

And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes

So
She says it's time she goes
But wanted to be sure I know
She hopes we can be friends

""I think
Yeah, I guess we can"" say I
But didn't think to ask her why
She blocked her eyes and drew the curtains
With knots I've got yet to untie

[Chorus]
What if I were Romeo in black jeans
What if I was Heathcliff, it's no myth
Maybe she's just looking for
Someone to dance with

[Verse 2]
See
It was just too soon to tell
And looking for some parallel
Can be an endless game

We
We said goodbye before hello
My secrets she will never know
And if I dig a hole to China
I'll catch the first junk to Soho

[Chorus]
What if I were Romeo in black jeans
What if I was Heathcliff, it's no myth
Maybe she's just looking for
Someone to dance with

[Bridge]
Sometime from now you'll bow to pressure
Some things in life you cannot measure by degrees
I'm between the poles and the equator
Don't send no private investigator to find me please
'Less he speaks Chinese
And can dance like Astaire overseas
Okay

331,331,I Come Off,"[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, ya, ya, you got it going on
Aah na-na, na-na

Now I wrote this record for when I perform
Lonely nights inside a university dorm
I put pen to paper with a paper and pen
For the times I'm rockin' the mic in front of women and men
I get raw like Eddie, rough like Freddy
Krueger with a Luger turnin' men into spaghetti
I'm like Fats Domino, off of Blueberry Hill
Because my rhymes are funky fresh and not run of the mill
Just like a king has palaces I give an analysis
You can't talk because you suffer from paralysis
Of the mouth, of the lip, of the tongue
Comin' to you compliments of a brother named Young
Now you can't talk because I'm leaving you speechless
So be quiet and let an educator teach this
It's due to my producer, so he's in a rage
And Mike you control the vinyl I'll control the stage
'Cause I come off

[Verse 2]
Four score and seven years ago
There were a whole bunch of rappers who were in the know
Four score and seven years later
I dig holes in those rappers like the moon with a crater
Because to battle me you're really taking a risk
'Cause you're an eight track tape and I'm a compact disc
Like Tyson drops boxers in rapid succession
That's how I'm droppin' MCs in the rappin' profession
I'm comin' off, just like the clothes on a hooker
And I can fly like Jimmy Superfly Snuka
Like a shuttle goes up into outer space
People's hands go up when I enter the place
I don't mean to brag or boast or to tell ya I'm great
But I can rock the microphone like Dorothy Hamill can skate
Yeah, I can say a funky rhyme like Greg Louganis can dive
Don't have to be Saturday night for Young MC to get live
'Cause I come off

[Chorus]

Yo I come off, My name is Young MC and baby I come off
Yo the brother's comin' off, Bust this, Here we go

[Verse 3]
Now one behold, Young MC struck gold
From the rhymes that I've been sayin' to the young and the old
From the battles I've been havin' with the smart and the dumb
From the records I've been makin' with the mic and the drum
You know the other rappers wanna play a game with me
They run and hide when they hear the name of Young MC
Like a kid playing tag, that's how it's got to be
So when I start I say Olly Olly Oxen Free
Yo, you can never write a rhyme as strong as this one
So pay attention cause you don't wanna miss one, of my healthy rhymes
Nobody's are healthier, New York, New Jersey, LA or Philadelphia
City to city, and town to town, place to place
Country to country, 'cause I get around
Even if you were in prison you'da heard me play
'Cause the warden had me rock and I'm on the PA
So when you get out come and see my show
And if you start static back in you go
'Cause comin' off is the title and the theme of the jam
And when the rhymes are finally finished people say God damn
'Cause I come off

[Chorus]

I come off. Yo baby, I come off.

I can see it scrawled on your empty face
And I feel the hurt
It's in the words you say, they make me want to

Scream out to the world
For taking life for granted and I know
You are by my side
When I turn to hear you cry

I am so afraid of living in oblivion
I am so afraid of living in oblivion

Am I so blind?
With my eyes turned to a different time or hour
At the end of the day
When we both run down and our hopes are heavy

Tell me what you will
'Cause I've got to know the truth inside of you
Can you hear what I say
When I hold you and you scorn the day?

I am so afraid of living in oblivion
I am so afraid of living in oblivion

Living in oblivion
Living in oblivion

So I ask again
Am I so alone and full of pride?
To never speak out
This is my world, this is my world

Don't tell me now
I won't feel those words, I won't feel the lies they tell
Can you hear my scream?

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I used to travel in the shadows
And I never found the nerve to try to walk up to you
But now I am a man and I know that there's no time to waste
There's too much to lose
Girl you say anything at all, and you know that you can call
And I'll be right there for you
First love, heartbreak, tough luck, big mistake
What else can you do

[Chorus]
I'll say anything you want to hear
I'll see everything through
I'll do anything I have to do
Just to win the love of a girl like you
A girl like you

[Verse 2]
People talk and people stare, tell them I don't really care
This is the place I should be
And if they think it's really strange for a girl like you
To be in love with someone like me
I wanna tell them all to go to hell
That we're doing very well without them you see
That's just the way it is and they will see
I am yours and you are mine the way it should be

[Chorus]

A girl like you
A girl like you
Oh, yeah

Yeah!

[Bridge]
Now if I seem a little wild, there's no holding back
I'm trying to get a message to you
I won't take anything from anyone
I won't walk and I won't run, I believe in you
London, Washington, anywhere you are I'll run
Together we'll be
Inside, outside, got my pride
I won't let him take you from me

[Chorus]

A girl like you
A girl like you
A girl like you
A girl like you
Oh, yeah

From Geelong (payouts to workers affected by asbestos)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(There'll be food on the table tonight)
Hey, hey, hey
(There'll be pay in your pocket tonight)

My gut is wrenched out, it is crunched up and broken
My life that is lived is no more than a token
Who'll strike the flint upon the stone and tell me why?
If I yell out at night there's a reply of blue silence
The screen is no comfort, I can't speak my sentence
They blew the lights at heaven's gate and I don't know why

But if I work all day on the Blue Sky Mine
(There'll be food on the table tonight)
Still I walk up and down on the Blue Sky Mine
(There'll be pay in your pocket tonight)

The candy store paupers lie to the shareholders
They're crossing their fingers, they pay the truth makers
The balance sheet is breaking up the sky
So I'm caught at the junction, still waiting for medicine
The sweat of my brow keeps on feeding the engine
Hope the crumbs in my pocket can keep me for another night

And if the Blue Sky Mining Company won't come to my rescue
If the sugar refining company won't save me
Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me?

But if I work all day on the Blue Sky Mine
(There'll be food on the table tonight)
And if walk up and down on the Blue Sky Mine
(There'll be pay in your pocket tonight)

And some have sailed from a distant shore
(And the company takes what the company wants)
And nothing's as precious as a hole in the ground

Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me?
I pray that sense and reason brings us in
Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me?
We got nothing to fear
In the end the rain comes down
In the end the rain comes down
Washes clean the streets of the Blue Sky town","['hey', 'hey', 'hey', 'hey', 'hey', 'hey', 'hey', 'my', 'gut', 'be', 'wrench', 'out', 'it', 'be', 'crunch', 'up', 'and', 'break', 'my', 'life', 'that', 'be', 'live', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'than', 'a', 'token', 'wholl', 'strike', 'the', 'flint', 'upon', 'the', 'stone', 'and', 'tell', 'me', 'why', 'if', 'i', 'yell', 'out', 'at', 'night', 'theres', 'a', 'reply', 'of', 'blue', 'silence', 'the', 'screen', 'be', 'no', 'comfort', 'i', 'cant', 'speak', 'my', 'sentence', 'they', 'blow', 'the', 'light', 'at', 'heavens', 'gate', 'and', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'why', 'but', 'if', 'i', 'work', 'all', 'day', 'on', 'the', 'blue', 'sky', 'mine', 'still', 'i', 'walk', 'up', 'and', 'down', 'on', 'the', 'blue', 'sky', 'mine', 'the', 'candy', 'store', 'paupers', 'lie', 'to', 'the', 'shareholders', 'theyre', 'cross', 'their', 'finger', 'they', 'pay', 'the', 'truth', 'makers', 'the', 'balance', 'sheet', 'be', 'break', 'up', 'the', 'sky', 'so', 'im', 'catch', 'at', 'the', 'junction', 'still', 'wait', 'for', 'medicine', 'the', 'sweat', 'of', 'my', 'brow', 'keep', 'on', 'feed', 'the', 'engine', 'hope', 'the', 'crumb', 'in', 'my', 'pocket', 'can', 'keep', 'me', 'for', 'another', 'night', 'and', 'if', 'the', 'blue', 'sky', 'mine', 'company', 'wont', 'come', 'to', 'my', 'rescue', 'if', 'the', 'sugar', 'refine', 'company', 'wont', 'save', 'me', 'whos', 'gonna', 'save', 'me', 'whos', 'gonna', 'save', 'me', 'whos', 'gonna', 'save', 'me', 'but', 'if', 'i', 'work', 'all', 'day', 'on', 'the', 'blue', 'sky', 'mine', 'and', 'if', 'walk', 'up', 'and', 'down', 'on', 'the', 'blue', 'sky', 'mine', 'and', 'some', 'have', 'sail', 'from', 'a', 'distant', 'shore', 'and', 'nothings', 'as', 'precious', 'as', 'a', 'hole', 'in', 'the', 'grind', 'whos', 'gonna', 'save', 'me', 'whos', 'gonna', 'save', 'me', 'i', 'pray', 'that', 'sense', 'and', 'reason', 'bring', 'us', 'in', 'whos', 'gonna', 'save', 'me', 'whos', 'gonna', 'save', 'me', 'we', 'get', 'nothing', 'to', 'fear', 'in', 'the', 'end', 'the', 'rain', 'come', 'down', 'in', 'the', 'end', 'the', 'rain', 'come', 'down', 'wash', 'clean', 'the', 'streets', 'of', 'the', 'blue', 'sky', 'town']",278,Midnight Oil,Midnight Oil,1990,"[96, 69, 56, 49, 47, 50, 57, 61, 67, 77]",10,Blue Sky Mine - Remastered,https://open.spotify.com/track/64eZ2hy7R21VDPgzeQrb9q,64eZ2hy7R21VDPgzeQrb9q,spotify:track:64eZ2hy7R21VDPgzeQrb9q,20000 Watt RSL - The Midnight Oil Collection,2H371tT3IIvmqji0iZCp0O,spotify:album:2H371tT3IIvmqji0iZCp0O,Midnight Oil,72KyoXzp0NOQij6OcmZUxk,spotify:artist:72KyoXzp0NOQij6OcmZUxk,260.16,18.0,44.0,1997,0.669,0.775,1.0,-6.059,1.0,0.0275,0.0388,0.00349,0.118,0.8109999999999999,132.019,"['australian alternative rock', 'australian rock', 'dance rock', 'rock']",[],1.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.046

342,342,You're The Only Woman,"[Round 1: Rone]
I have orchestrated this beautifully, like I was intricate on strings with it
Co-Rone-ation day, from my Simba shit to the king of this
Today I think like a king; it’s in my bones, in my speech
Today I eat like a king; I’m thinkin' bon appetit
It’s been six months, what glory did you bring home to the league?
You ain’t even seize the throne; that crown was thrown at your feet
What is the title to you? Oh, what, now you’re a star?
No, you’re still broke, bummy, scrounging for rounds at the bar
So I consider the term “title” not sounding so hard
When you’ll never have a title on a house or a car
See, you never rap enough piff to pack up the joint
And so they made a call to Rone (Calderon) to back up the point
See we could battle for one hour. We could do a one-rounder
You lost the title after one match; that’s a short reign (rain) like a sun shower
You think like such a pussy...... whenever you make a verse
You’re so scared of what someone else might say, so you try to say it first
Well I predict that you’ll predict what I do in this match
And you’ll get done like the last prophet (Prophit) that I threw in the trash
Boy thinks that he’s a psychic, but no one here’s believing him
It’s funny he’s an extra small but he thinks that he’s a medium
But this pussy smells fishy
Is that salmon or albacore?
Is he mackerel or just gutted? He can’t get a call back from Macklemore
Bitch all my dogs loyal, like DJ Khaled or a Labrador;
I’m in El Salvador, dodging bullshit off the cape just like a matador
Bitch, I’m just getting started; this is salad course
You’re mad trash like a bag full of apple cores
Oh he ain’t catch it? Who the fuck he, Nelson Agholor?
If he the plug, I’ll rip him out by the power cord
You think you could rap, but my flow’s so disgustin'
Stumpman, stumpman, stumpman, you like five foot nothin'
Since I brought my boys here I think I might jump him; no
Since he this tall, damn, I think that I could jump him; whoa
You live off apology checks you get ‘cause you’re a eighth Native American
That means we’re payin' you, to shut the fuck up and not complain ‘bout your heritage
And that’s the only checks you get, the only income that you draw
So if my people hadn’t killed your people, you would get no money at all
I mean, no hood booger want to boogie with you
No neighbor got any sugar to use
I mean, Saurus gets ten million times more pussy than you and look at the dude
And I bet those walls in the friend zone steep
Twin bitches suck a nut for a Benzo each
You a snitch and a broke little S.O.B
I bet the pink slip on any car that Greg Poe lease (police)
Wait. Any bar that Ill conceived is ill-conceived
It’s no illusion; Ill losing. This the guillotine
It’s incredible; I’m what makes Ill edge-able
The fact that he can’t read me, I feel like like I’m illegible
But, you braggin' ‘bout smoking weed in Oregon, I said that isn’t even Ill, is it?
Wait, smoking weed in Oregon; that isn’t even illicit
Boy, I pass models coke on glass-bottom boats
This some sacrificial slaughter, it’s the lamb vers’ the G.O.A.T
And I get he’s your bro and that you think that he’s dope
But do me a favor: get Bigg K’s dick out your throat
I mean, in the Caustic battle, you have his whole D in your mouthpiece
You all over Kenny’s nuts like Stevie Janowski
You takin' trips, I make your bitch sit and leave me a house key
Then come piss on the rug like the scene from Lebowski
World Dom One, we were faded off Canadian liquor
Saurus had a bitch in his room; trying to say he could hit her
But he declined, when he ain’t even have to pay for the stripper
So for thinkin' Ill is straight (illustrate), well, what, I got to paint you a picture?
World Dom Two, you blackout wrestled Dirtbag Dan
The full story is that Dirt merked that man
At the hotel that night, he choked you out twice
I’m used to your rounds putting me to sleep, well now you know what that’s like
Check, Illmac tried to rush him, right? Dan got him mummified
He couldn’t have put you to sleep faster with warm milk and a lullaby
So talk shit when I’m passin' by you and it’s not a thing to pacify you
And if you sleep on any of my shit tonight, then I’m lookin' for Dan behind you

[Round 1: Illmaculate]
He mentioned my homie from Seattle, which reminds me
There’s just something wrong about you
To the point Macklemore might make a song about you
I mean, I’ll show you how to deliver the frees and get sick in the ring
He said The Saurus gets more pussy and he might be spittin' the frees
But that’s fitting
You know why that that’s fitting to me?
‘Cause you’re getting loose
And this is the biggest pussy that’s every been given to me
All right, look, straight to it
I been the champ, before the title or trophy
Get your wifey to blow me, but I don’t chase birds; that’s for Wile E. Coyote
My fam is full of animals like I was Mowgli
They won’t be happy ’til his head in a box: (Bing,) smiley emoji
Get socked in the ring, like I’m Mick Foley minus the goatee
You’d get ate (eight) with a twenty-four, but I’m retiring Roney
With a seasoned sixteen; shit remind me of Kobe
I don’t play in the ring
Yo, you got no bars, like a parolee
You got no bars, like a parolee
I said it twice; that’s okay, cause I guaranteed to pepper Roney
Hold up. No bars, like a parolee
It doesn’t matter; you know why?
I’ll get a body out of nowhere like Kylie and Khloe
Grimey, I’ll treat Roney like a entree served warm
And never fight clean, I was always dirt poor
I rep the North West like Kanye’s first-born
You couldn’t ride the wave with Beyonce’s surfboard
Surfboard...
Roney’s music? Nerdcore
You are a joke
This motherfucker is a shtick
Him and his friends get together and punch each other in the dick
You are a clown, I guess college life made them closer
They’re like, “party’s on, bro.” Invite some ladies over
But don’t pass out, these guys could play the joker
They shave each other’s eyebrows and draw dicks on their faces
While they’re wide awake and sober
You are a cornball
You’re battle rap for teeny boppers, expose the gimmicks
Wave riders: motion sickness
I mean, we might be close in pigment, but the approach is different
You, “white kid raps fast”, Mac Lethal, all viral, so suspicious
I mean, why? Old traditions? Wholesome image?
It’s simple; you’re a symbol of their own existence
Clothes and skin, shit
They look at you, see a mirror, don’t even know the difference
Just can’t get Past his Presence. Oh, so simplistic
They think he’s the Future ‘cause he reflects their lives like the Ghosts of Christmas
You’re battle rap for dummies, for the casual fan
Get rocked; whip him with my spatula hand since he a flash in the pan
That’s just the tip of the iceberg; the Titanic get slammed
Put us in the same boat, I’ll split you like a catamaran
If my name’s at stake (steak), I got cattle to brand
Bitch, I’m a legend, and I still (steel) open doors, like a battering ram
You a virus; I’ll penicillin ya
There’s never been a ceilin' to my writing so my pen is sealing ya
Spiteful, I bet it’s killing ya
Thirsty, riding on genitalia
Such a desperate for attention whore, where he’s from is a metaphor
Be mindful, his city’s telling ya
He’d probably swap AIDS with Tom Hanks just to go viral in Philadelphia
See, you’re just here to entertain, so you’re feeling like the cash crop
But that little bit of fame dries up when the laughs stop
So you can have them views, ‘cause I’ll be here when your fans not
I’ll hold down the champ slot
He can be the mascot

[Round 2: Rone]
You said I could be the mascot, but no one believes you
If it wasn’t for the stage, no one could see you
But, I’ve battled fat rappers
I’ve battled short rappers
I’ve battled gun rappers, but never sword rappers
He doesn’t rap about guns ‘cause they’re not realistic
He’ll rap about dragons that fight with Aladdin, but it comes to ‘matics
And he’ll be like eh-eh
He’ll rap about Frodo and all-seeing logo, but it comes to fo’-fo’s
And he’ll be like no, no
Well what you got, the Yoroitoshi or the bolo on ya?
You got the viking, or the bowie, or the old Katana?
I’m in the Cutlass laughing at the blade at your side
Rocking stilettos, you’ve been giving off a rapier vibe
Like it’s a game in your mind, trying to perpetuate that thug life
He holds his blade like a mic, screaming, “All I need is one knife.”
That shit isn’t cut right, that shit shows your blood type
There’s a name for that: bringing a knife to a gun fight
I mean, you rap of the corniest shit:
“I’ll take the hammer of Thor off Orion’s belt
If I stared at Medusa, her eyes would melt.”
Shut the fuck up
That shit’s your only angle, so you don’t want to tangle
If the Illuminati are what’s keeping your music off the radio
We owe them a “thank you”
See I could coach him, like Cus D’Amato, with details like custom autos
You think that it’s just bravado? I done this (Dundas) like West Toronto
You playing yourself on stage just like he John Leguizamo
So fuck Hitori Hanzo; I’ll turn Greg into Greg Giraldo
Bro, you look like Wee Man with a cheap tan and no bread
If you’re ever kicking yourself, it’s probably in your own head
His name is Greg Poe but it should be Po’ Greg
‘cause I’d be your size if I had no legs
A paper cut could lay him up under a surgical lampshade
Then we could cover your whole body with one vertical Band-Aid
I will give your fam shells like I’m serving a clam bake
Then I’ll break down a pound like I’m learning a handshake
What you know about talkin' about fake drug shit to fit in?
You can’t argue with that
Fucking selling edibles out in Oregon, well you started with snacks
On that White in New York, you want to party with Smack
Whenever sonny (Sunny) In Philadelphia then it’s (Dennis) Charlie with Mac
But who getting Jobs in the Apple out of Mac and Tosh (MacIntosh)?
And if you can’t get booked there, you can’t get looked at one of the battle gods
He break the law in front of some cops out in Brooklyn for sport
Just so he could say that he got booked in New York
Fuck if you pray to the West; you look like prey to the East
And so it’s asalamalakum, then I’m making him sleep
I feel like Kanye if it came to the beef
‘cause I’d throw 500 on a fade every day of the week
Oh, you got locked up? Well it doesn’t count if you were tryin' to get caught
Buying drugs, shining your watch in the eyes of the cops
Like, “Please, at least slam me down or pull me out of traffic, pal
Or at least get me patted down, so I have somethin' to rap about.”
You the dude at the DUI checkpoint like, “I know my rights.”
As he’s ridin' home at night down the road on a stolen bike
Talkin' ‘bout, diamonds are evil and jewelry is opulent
Until you got your first chain and you couldn’t stop rockin' it
You think you got it figured out about anything ornate
You think expensive clothes exemplify poor taste
You trying to justify the salad that’s sittin' on your plate
Acting like meat is murder ‘cause you can’t afford steak
What look, outside of battling, did Illmaculate get?
You turn your opportunities into nothing, and that’s sad as a bitch
And now you couldn’t even leave if we asked you to quit
It’s like you’re holdin' onto battling like it’s the only thing you have, ‘cause it is

[Round 2: Illmaculate]
This body’s about be a classic in this bitch
He brought up the Hitori Hanzo blade, like that shit was a myth
I think Rone thinks that he’s actually a prince
I’m confused, Rone, ‘cause you talk like man, but you act like bitch
I mean, you look like Rone, but you rap like Twist
I drank with Norm Kelly, we toast a glass like this
Said Cheers, and told Norm I got his back like Cliff
You called him a bitch, sounding a bit jelly
But who’s the mayor of Philly? Go ‘head, bitch, tell me
No? No? Cool, ‘cause Norm ‘ll beat the shit out of Jim Kenny
And run him out of Philly quicker than Chip Kelly
You battled DNA
Day of the event, here’s an angle he ‘a pick
He said black rappers don’t raise their kids...you a racist piece of shit
If that’s who you want as champ, you can get AIDS and eat a dick
Cause that shit ain’t acceptable on any stage or league you with
For real, that’s the reason some fans don’t care KOTD exists
First you gay this week, then switch
You’re cornier than the day Charron claimed that he’s a Crip
You should be put in your place and make good on your statements
But he ran track for Penn State, so he’s always been good with the races
I heard he was getting roasted on the message board
After bloggin' throwing a tantrum on the tennis court
Which I thought was the perfect metaphor
You know, him getting served over the 'net when he could’ve been a better sport?
It’s perfect, ‘cause in that blog
He said I was the benefactor of the system, that’s why I get more credit
While bloggin' from all-white facility for indoor tennis
(You don’t see the— all right.)
Benefactor of what, Rone? It’s been a long road, chock full of potholes
I lost a match in the ring, I was Jack with the beans
I aimed high ’til my stock (stalk) rose
Stockholm; yeah, the fans can be hot-cold
But mono e mono I’ll cook you like pot roast on a hot stove
Or waffles at Roscoe’s, you a snot-nose;
But what I wrote is {sniffs} El Chapo to nostrils
So don’t reach; that’s a Dot role
Don’t Flop; you a lost Soul
Dude is silly; you from Philly? I’m Ali when he boxed Joe
Get it? You boxed, Rone
You John Doe; you’re spot’s blown like a foxhole
You’re not dope; you’re not Diz; he’s not me; he’s not grown
And we all know that I’m 5’4”
But if I roll to Rone’s crib then Rone’s getting 5-0
In three rounds you’re getting five-o’ed
Uou rap fast; you could die slow
Toronto, this is not close
He’s Tosh hostin' a talk show; I mean he’s got jokes
But what I’ve written will inspire ambition in a writer (Ridah)
A combo of Pac’s ghost, Hollow and Pablo Picasso in God mode
Bruh, even you admit you’re corny
It’s just sad that your fans can’t
Spoiled brat, his parents paid for rap camp and half the sales on Bandcamp
He just wants what he can’t have, so he wrote until his hands cramped
Then got the chain as a lower back tat
Know what he calls it? His champ stamp
But he’s soon to be the king, soon to be the k— that’s how they brand you
Cool. I got the King, helpless, think, Elvis
Watch where this fall from grace lands (Graceland) you
Malpractice: boy, I’m out of patience (patients) and such
Soon to be the— man, that obnoxious phrase is a crutch
Got ‘em calling you “king” for no reason: conversations with Lux
(Look at me, king. Oh, he gon get this work.)
See, his whole persona is “look at me, look at me,” so proud of his fame
They should call you ""Team Mascot"" when announcin' your name
You know why? He puts on this character to keep the crowd entertained
Then pulls a couple stunts
Til a real player comes and you get taken out of the game

[Round 3: Rone]
What’s the point of going out on a tour
When there’s no one in the crowd when you clowns go perform?
You’re so deep in the game, still sleeping down on the floor
You act proud, but it rots you right down to your core
So, to say I fuck with you? Well I doubt it for sure
Renowned or obscure, I never heard a sound you recorded
Bitch, you’ve been making music since 2004
And I still haven’t listened to one album of yours
And the fans of your rap music are white as a Klan unit
I’m tryin' to make him embrace it, but damn it, he can’t do it
He should be grassroot-ing, but instead he pack-mule-ing
‘lac cruising, gat shooting, back of the tan Buick
Said you had nicks (Knicks) for starters, like Al Houston and Pat Ewing
What’s next, you makin' gram movements like Fat Jewish?
Well, that lightweight angle is shaky as Shaq shootin'
And that’s stupid as Atlanta fans rootin' for Cam Newton
Boy, you said your dream battle’s Jin
I couldn’t give a shit less
It’s funny a little Asian kid couldn’t make you a success (6's)
It’s a vignette on forgotten skill and a prequel to popping pills
It’s sick how you think you’re sick
How the mighty have fallen Ill
Bro. Pat Stay’s first was all short jokes to put this herb down
So for me to try any of that shit would be retarded
But I gave Pat Stay every short joke he used in his first round
So I was up one nothing before this battle even started
I don’t have short jokes; I don’t have short facts
I don’t have short quotes; I just have short math
Lookism
A guy who’s 5’6” has to make $183,000 a year
More than someone who is 6’ to be deemed equally attractive
That’s $24,000 an inch, that’s the fraction we’ll use
And what I did is I took my height and subtract it from dude’s
So look at you, 5’5”, but that’s adding a few;
So Google me. 6’1 and a half or 6’2”
Before this battle even starts, by all the math that I do
I’m already a quarter million dollars more attractive than you
And there’s nothin' you can do about it, you know that it’s unfair
You could be Brad Pitt in the face and no woman would care
I mean, there’s height restrictions in the military, I don’t know why; it’s disgusting
But of course you hate the government, you’re too short to die for your country
So that explains his head condition
His conspiracies, his pessimism
Another adolescent victim, short, poor, expecting visits
From a daddy who’d never swing it, so rage done festered in him
And he turned it against the system
But being short is no excuse for being a mental midget
I mean, you hate yourself for being short, I can tell it through your face
But look on the bright side; there’s less of you hate
And losses are a positive, so you should see some growth from this
But the fact is, you’re 5’3” and you just can’t get over it
He’s jealous I call myself the Prince, like that should describe you
Well, maybe you’re right, too, ‘cause you and Prince are both 5’2”
I call myself the Prince as a Symbol, that I’m forging my own path
I call myself the Prince ‘cause it will always be something I was formerly known as
Like: 2056, in a nursing home. T-Rex’s granddaughter is nursin' holmes
Brittle bones, decrepit clothes, shoes too big for your feet
Cause after all the years of gravity, he’s shrunken to 4’3”
He’s past the whole rapping thing, now he’s battling for his sanity
Dementia and Alzheimer’s; he can’t recognize his own family
So they don’t visit, he’s so lonely; his incontinent useless ass
Well one of the nurses, somehow, hears that he used to rap
So as a birthday present, she decides to drag a classic out
Gets all the invalids, the old people, and has them gather ‘round
She says it’s Illmac versus Rone, but then he panics at the sound
Cause as soon as he hears my name, then he flashes back to now
And suddenly, he’s wishin; for his casket and his death
Suddenly, he’s short of air and he’s grabbing for his neck
And if that was then and this is now, and you’re still panicking' through sweat
Then imagine just how bad it was at the actual event

[Round 3: Illmaculate]
He keeps bringing up conspiracies, and half of you laugh
Well, I must be a conspiracy theorist; that’s actually facts
Shit, I feel like B.O.B. with what Adam just rapped
‘cause I swear that entire round was actually flat
As a matter fact, you talking ‘bout my drugs, when I got caught for the case
He didn’t mention my P’s, did he (Diddy)?
I mean that’d be perfect, ‘cause his most-reacted line is when he remixed me
(P Diddy - Remix me? Fuck all that.)
What you looking at? You are not a man. You will never be a man
You know why? He let Pat palm the back of his head with his hand
Never mind Sandusky molesting this bitch
YouTube “getting brains in the lac”. I didn’t edit this shit
It’s a video of you giving Pat head in the whip
You don’t remember the clip? You didn’t think I would mention this shit?
Pat looked like MadChild last Blackout
A Swollen Member getting neck while he’s stiff
The video starts, Pat getting head in the car, nothing too embarrassing in it
Til it’s revealed it’s not a girl, it’s you
Genius, being gay is hilarious
Get it?
(No? Me either.)
Tell me this: what was the moment you became aware they were taping there?
Was it when Pat came, you came up for air, wiped your facial hair
After treating Pat’s dick like you was ‘bout to find the chain in there?
I guess we just from two different scenes
Cause I ain’t trying to get on YouTube and watch men (Watchmen) do shit obscene
You normally play the Comedian, but in that new clip I seen
You just went Dr. Manhattan on us: just blew(blue) dick on screen
Hey, fuck it though. You should get a letterman jacket for pleasuring Pat
Giving head in the ‘lac
Yo, I guess when he lettered in track
Ain’t the only time he’s ever been a(-)head in a lap
We both battled Pat. Look how we related to him
I left with Pat’s head. You gave it to him
How did that relationship start? Does he think that it’s fate as well?
Or did you just slide in his DMs like, “A/S/L”?
That shit’s gay as hell, and you taped it. Well
I don’t care he made it, he’s Larry David: he played himself
You know what? You’re the most disrespected battler. Pesci ain’t got shit on you
Daylyt left the stage and dipped on you. Pat Stay put his dick on you
Diz made you dress up as Bruce Jenner and put a wig on you
Now, I’m ‘bout to wig on you
The judge decide the outcome, think Pimp a Butterfly album:
I got schitz(skits) on you
Slap that Roney Baby the Prince off you;
Cold case. Charron’s face: leave prints on you
Break you down; put it together: I’ll jigsaw you
Show up to your improv group, impromptu, insult the chick on you
Diss her, and spit on you. No, Diz / Eurgh spit on you
I’ll diss her(Eurgh) and leave: Irvine crip on you
Walk in your crib on you, skip the welcome mat, wipe my kicks on you
Slap the cereal bowl out your hand and go Queenzflip in the whip on you
When I whip on you
You know what? It’s something bothering me, I just can’t ignore it
Everybody blames Sandusky; they got the facts distorted
I mean, if you seen what Rone was wearing, he was practically asking for it
Forget the rape. That’s a subject that we’ll avoid
I mean, I had to mention it; I didn’t have any choice
But now it’s a tactic employed he’s learned to handle with poise
So fuck it, I’ll bell-clap him. Won’t hear any actual noise
Flat on canvas, no punch landed; you scrapping with Floyd
Shoulder lock, crack clavicle; grapple on point
Jab like Zab; jaw tap him like Roy
Body blow, head shot; his jaw crack like his voice
Mandible snapped at the joint
Hey yo Sandusky! That’s how you put hands on this boy
And as you just seen, I beat his ass so badly
I’m on my next lap. Next title match, me and Pass in Cali

Has come back to haunt
Like a restless wind
And the best of times
That were left behind
They come blowing in

No one's pushing me
Through that door
It might as well be
A forty-four in the night

It's too late to say goodbye
I'm all out of lies
It's too late to say goodbye

How can I resist
One more stranger's kiss
Should the thrill be gone
And if I must refrain
Will I wind up the same
As the jealous dogs?

From this day forward
Could be too long
But crossing the border
Would be so wrong, and you're right

It's too late to say goodbye
I've run out of lies
And it's too late to say goodbye

I know that you're right
It's too late to say goodbye
I'm all out of lies
It's too late to say goodbye

It's too late to say goodbye

For so long
I kept these feelings for you locked up inside
And there were nights that
I would cry myself to sleep and wonder why

Now I don't wanna tell you how to live
Don't wanna put the blame
But don't you think
It's time for you and I
To try to make a change

[Chorus:]
We can't go wrong
(Loving one another)
We can't go wrong
(Caring for each other)

We can't go wrong
If the love we have is real
We can't go wrong

[Verse 2:]
There was a time when things were better
Than the way they are today
But we forgot the vows we made
And love got lost along the way

Now I can tell just by the way
You look at me that you feel the same
So don't you think it's time for
You and I to try to make a change

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

Whispering our goodbyes waiting for the train
I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain
I can hear him saying: ""Nothing will change
Come dance with me, baby, in the summer rain""
I remember the rain on his skin
And his kisses hotter than the Santa Ana winds
Whispering our goodbyes waiting for the train
I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain
I remember laughing 'til we almost cried
There at the station that night
I remember looking in his eyes

[Chorus]
Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of
Oh, my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain
Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I say
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain, oh, summer

[Verse 2]
I can hear the whistle, military train
I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain
I can hear him singing: ""Oh, love is strange
Come dance with me, baby in the summer rain""
I remember the rain pouring down
And we poured our hearts out
As the train pulled out
I can see my baby waving from the train
It was the last time that I saw him in the summer rain

[Chorus]
Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of
Oh my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain
Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I say
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain

[Bridge]
Ooh, summer
Every time I see the lightning
Every time I hear the thunder
Every time I close the window
When this happens in the summer
Oh, the night is so inviting
I can feel that you were so close
I can feel you when the wind blows
Blows right through my heart

[Chorus]
Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of
Oh, my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain
Every night and every day now
Though I know you've gone away
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain
Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I say","['whisper', 'our', 'goodbyes', 'wait', 'for', 'the', 'train', 'i', 'be', 'dance', 'with', 'my', 'baby', 'in', 'the', 'summer', 'rain', 'i', 'can', 'hear', 'him', 'say', 'nothing', 'will', 'change', 'come', 'dance', 'with', 'me', 'baby', 'in', 'the', 'summer', 'rain', 'i', 'remember', 'the', 'rain', 'on', 'his', 'skin', 'and', 'his', 'kiss', 'hotter', 'than', 'the', 'santa', 'ana', 'wind', 'whisper', 'our', 'goodbyes', 'wait', 'for', 'the', 'train', 'i', 'be', 'dance', 'with', 'my', 'baby', 'in', 'the', 'summer', 'rain', 'i', 'remember', 'laugh', 'til', 'we', 'almost', 'cry', 'there', 'at', 'the', 'station', 'that', 'night', 'i', 'remember', 'look', 'in', 'his', 'eye', 'oh', 'my', 'love', 'its', 'you', 'that', 'i', 'dream', 'of', 'oh', 'my', 'love', 'since', 'that', 'day', 'somewhere', 'in', 'my', 'heart', 'im', 'always', 'dance', 'with', 'you', 'in', 'the', 'summer', 'rain', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'what', 'i', 'do', 'now', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'what', 'i', 'say', 'somewhere', 'in', 'my', 'heart', 'im', 'always', 'dance', 'with', 'you', 'in', 'the', 'summer', 'rain', 'oh', 'summer', 'i', 'can', 'hear', 'the', 'whistle', 'military', 'train', 'i', 'be', 'dance', 'with', 'my', 'baby', 'in', 'the', 'summer', 'rain', 'i', 'can', 'hear', 'him', 'sing', 'oh', 'love', 'be', 'strange', 'come', 'dance', 'with', 'me', 'baby', 'in', 'the', 'summer', 'rain', 'i', 'remember', 'the', 'rain', 'pour', 'down', 'and', 'we', 'pour', 'our', 'hearts', 'out', 'as', 'the', 'train', 'pull', 'out', 'i', 'can', 'see', 'my', 'baby', 'wave', 'from', 'the', 'train', 'it', 'be', 'the', 'last', 'time', 'that', 'i', 'saw', 'him', 'in', 'the', 'summer', 'rain', 'oh', 'my', 'love', 'its', 'you', 'that', 'i', 'dream', 'of', 'oh', 'my', 'love', 'since', 'that', 'day', 'somewhere', 'in', 'my', 'heart', 'im', 'always', 'dance', 'with', 'you', 'in', 'the', 'summer', 'rain', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'what', 'i', 'do', 'now', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'what', 'i', 'say', 'somewhere', 'in', 'my', 'heart', 'im', 'always', 'dance', 'with', 'you', 'in', 'the', 'summer', 'rain', 'ooh', 'summer', 'every', 'time', 'i', 'see', 'the', 'lightning', 'every', 'time', 'i', 'hear', 'the', 'thunder', 'every', 'time', 'i', 'close', 'the', 'window', 'when', 'this', 'happen', 'in', 'the', 'summer', 'oh', 'the', 'night', 'be', 'so', 'invite', 'i', 'can', 'feel', 'that', 'you', 'be', 'so', 'close', 'i', 'can', 'feel', 'you', 'when', 'the', 'wind', 'blow', 'blow', 'right', 'through', 'my', 'heart', 'oh', 'my', 'love', 'its', 'you', 'that', 'i', 'dream', 'of', 'oh', 'my', 'love', 'since', 'that', 'day', 'somewhere', 'in', 'my', 'heart', 'im', 'always', 'dance', 'with', 'you', 'in', 'the', 'summer', 'rain', 'every', 'night', 'and', 'every', 'day', 'now', 'though', 'i', 'know', 'youve', 'go', 'away', 'somewhere', 'in', 'my', 'heart', 'im', 'always', 'dance', 'with', 'you', 'in', 'the', 'summer', 'rain', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'what', 'i', 'do', 'now', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'what', 'i', 'say']",383,Belinda Carlisle,Belinda Carlisle,1990,"[97, 83, 68, 55, 35, 30, 30, 32, 40, 49, 59, 71, 86]",13,Summer Rain,https://open.spotify.com/track/4tWlR5VTAAa1mwi7E4qJb1,4tWlR5VTAAa1mwi7E4qJb1,spotify:track:4tWlR5VTAAa1mwi7E4qJb1,Runaway Horses,0RrHXijPCR0ma2d6hOnc3I,spotify:album:0RrHXijPCR0ma2d6hOnc3I,Belinda Carlisle,7xkAwz0bQTGDSbkofyQt3U,spotify:artist:7xkAwz0bQTGDSbkofyQt3U,332.4,10.0,38.0,1989-10-17,0.7340000000000001,0.815,5.0,-9.203,1.0,0.0303,0.0407,2.85e-06,0.0555,0.958,128.869,"['dance pop', 'dance rock', 'europop', 'new romantic', 'new wave pop', 'pop rock', 'soft rock']",[],1.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08700000000000001

It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you

[Chorus]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

[Verse 1]
From the start it's plain to see
You're suffering from a serious broken heart
You know that it's a shame
But I'm here to ease your pain
There's no need for you to feel so all alone
And you and I could seriously be
A sure enough happening thing
Don't you know that---

[Chorus]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

[Verse 2]
I can see it in your eyes
You feel the same way, I feel about you
Some call it chemistry
I call it, you should be with me
'Cause I know together we can really turn this mother out
In my mind there is no doubt
That one and one equals me and you
Don't you know that---

[Chorus]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

[Verse 3]
I don't believe in fairy tales
But I believe some things were meant to be
Why should we be alone?
When we could have each others arms to hold
'Cause I know together we could really turn this mother out
In my mind there is no doubt
That one and one equals me and you
And don't you know that---

I can almost hear you sigh
I can almost hear you cry
On every crowded street
All the places we would meet
What will I do without you
They say that life goes on
I'm feeling sorry for myself
I can't believe you're gone

You acted much too calm
You turned on all the charm
You had a cold look in your eyes

I can feel your tongue on mine
Silky smooth like wine
I'm living with these memories
That's all that's left of you and me

[Chorus]
I can almost hear you sigh
Almost hear you cry
When you made sweet love to me
And you turned on all the charm
Acted much too calm
You had a cold look in your eyes

[Verse 2]
Did it mean nothing
Was it all in vain
Was I just your fool
Or was the pleasure pain

Have you set me free
Or will I wake up
In the morning
And find out it's been a bad dream

[Bridge]
Come on, I beg you
I want to be your main man

[Chorus/Outro]
I can almost hear you sigh
Almost hear you cry
When you made sweet love to me
Almost see your smile

We were not just lovers
We were not just friends, boy
The time we shared was not a simple love affair
No

We learned about each other
That you're so afraid of the love, boy
There is no one that could ever love me better
No

Time and time again
I thought you were my friend
You say you gotta go
And I want you to know

If you leave me now, boy
I'll close my eyes and I'll just lay down and cry
Why would you leave me now, boy
After all the things that we've been through?

You say you leave me now, boy
And when you're gone
What am I supposed to do?
And if you wanna come back to me
I think you should know that I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you

No more changes for my life
I pray to God that you'll come back to me
When we're together
There's nothing better than loving you

I wanna know why you're leaving, boy
The love we had was an open door
What happened to the dreams we shared together?
No

Time and time again
I thought you were my friend
You say you gotta go
And I want you to know

Why are you leaving me now, boy
After all the things that we've been through?
(You know I love you)
You know I still love you
(You know I need you)

Time and time again
I thought you were my friend
You say you gotta go

356,356,Bad Love,"[Verse 1]
Oh, what a feeling I get when I'm with you
You take my heart into everything you do
And it makes me sad for the lonely people
I walked that road for so long
Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people
Your love is making me strong

[Chorus]
I've had enough bad love
I need something I can be proud of
I've had enough bad love
No more bad love

[Verse 2]
And now I see that my life has been so blue
With all the heartaches I had until I met you
But I'm glad to say now that is all behind me
With you here by my side

I could hardly believe it, when I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see it's true

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

[Chorus]
Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

[Verse 2]
I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming, oh
Even now it's more than I can take

Girl, well it's been one of those days again
And it seems like the harder I try
Over and over, I'm right back where I began
But you understand
Oh girl, when nothing else in this world goes right
Oh I just want to run to you
You pull me through
Oh baby, who wouldn't want to have you in their life?

[Chorus]
Tell me, what kind of man would I be
Living a life without any meaning?
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I had to live without you
Tell me what kind of man would I be?

[Verse 2]
Times when it was pointless for me to try
I was more than a desperate man
What seemed like forever was gone with one touch of your hand
Oh, girl, if I could count all the sleepless nights
When you were there for me
A fool could see, oh baby
Once that I found you there was no letting go

Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
And when you needed me I came through

[Verse 2]
I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew you were there for me
Time after time you were there for me

[Hook]
Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sands - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you
Oh, whoa

[Verse 3]
We spent the summer with the top rolled down
And wished ever after would be like this
You said ""I love you babe,"" without a sound
I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss

[Hook]
Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sands - I remember you
And through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you, oh

[Bridge]
We've had our share of hard times, but that's the price we paid
And through it all we kept the promise that we made
I swear you'll never be lonely

[Verse 4]
We woke up to the sound of pouring rain
Washed away a dream of you
But nothing else could ever take you away
'Cause you'll always be my dream come true
Oh, my darling, I love you

Advice for the young at heart
Soon we will be older
When we gonna make it work?

[Verse 1]
Too many people living in a secret world
While they play mothers and fathers
We play little boys and girls
When we gonna make it work?
I could be happy, I could be quite naive
It's only me and my shadows
Happy in our make believe
Soon...

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And with the hounds at bay
I'll call your bluff
Hey, 'cause it would be okay
To walk on tiptoes everyday

[Chorus]
And when I think of you and all the love that's due
I'll make a promise, I'll make a stand
'Cause to these big brown eyes, this comes as no surprise
We've got the whole wide world in our hands

[Hook]
Advice for the young at heart
Soon we will be older
When we gonna make it work?

[Verse 2]
Love is promise, love is a souvenir
Once given
Never forgotten, never let it disappear
This could be our last chance
When we gonna make it work?
Working hour is over

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And how it makes me weep
Cause someone sent my soul to sleep

[Chorus]
And when I think of you and all the love that's due
I'll make a promise, I'll make a stand
Cause to these big brown eyes, this comes as no surprise
We've got the whole wide world in our hands

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
We've got the whole wide world in our hands
We've got the whole wide world in our hands

[Hook]
Advice for the young at heart
Soon we will be older
When we gonna make it work?

[Hook]
Advice for the young at heart
Soon we will be older
When we gonna make it work?

[Outro]
Working hour is over
We can do anything that we want
Anything that we feel like doing

Look at this face
I know the years are showing
Look at this life
I still don't know where it's going

[Chorus: Aaron Neville]
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be all I need to know

[Verse 2: Linda Ronstadt]
Look at these eyes
They never seen what matters
Look at these
Dreams so beaten and so battered

[Chorus: Aaron Neville & Linda Ronstadt]
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be all I need to know

[Verse 3: Aaron Neville & Linda Ronstadt]
So many questions still left unanswered
So much I've never broken through
And when I feel you near me, sometimes I see so clearly
That only truth I'll never know is me and you

[Verse 4: Aaron Neville & Linda Ronstadt]
Look at this man
So blessed with inspiration
Look at this soul
Still searching for salvation

368,368,Downtown Train,"[Verse 1]
Outside another yellow moon
Has punched a hole in the night time mist
I climb through the window and down to the street
I'm shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
Full of all them Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds

[Verse 2]
You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh if I was the one you chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now

[Chorus]
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
Every night, every night its just the same
On a downtown train

[Verse 3]
I know your window and I know its late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light of the four way
And watch them as they fall, oh baby
They all having their heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

[Chorus]
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
Every night, every night its just the same
You leave me lonely
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
All my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain
On a downtown train
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
Every night, every night its just the same
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
All my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain
On a downtown train
On a downtown train
All my dreams fall like rain

Let? to the clock, let walk out to

371,371,Was It Nothing At All,"Driving in the car
With the wind run through your hair
I reach for you now
But you're not there

It was perfect time
A perfect place for us to be
The nights were so warm
You were close to me
Was it nothing at all?

No more hope of holding your body in the moonlight
Did I fall in love for nothing?
No more hope of touching you feeling you by my side
Did I fall in love for nothing?

The music can play
As the sun started to fade
Our dream vacation
Was in my mind

Just the other day
I thought I heard you call my name
I wake up, she's gone
There's no one to blame
Was it nothing at all?

No more hope of holding your body in the moonlight
Did I fall in love for nothing?
No more hope of touching you feeling you by my side
Did I fall in love for nothing?

I tell you right away
I want you back into my life
But if you don't find the way
I would dream of you tonight

No more hope of holding your body in the moonlight
Did I fall in love for nothing?
No more hope of touching you feeling you by my side
Did I fall in love for nothing?

No more hope of holding your body in the moonlight
Did I fall in love for nothing?
No more hope of touching you feeling you by my side
Did I fall in love for nothing?

373,373,Tell Me Why,"(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)

Echoes thunder almost every night
Why this prison if we're all alike?
Look around you, look at all your friends
Tell me, are they just what they pretend?

Listen to my story if you have the time
Yes, we'll make the difference if we really try
Listen, everybody, and start to make it right
One and all together, feel it from inside

CHORUS:
Tell me why it echoes every night
Why we fight just to find who's wrong or right
Don't let it slide, you can't run and hide
Tell me why, oh, won't you please tell me why?

(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)

Give me a reason for all this senseless crime
We can change it, why they have to die
Think of the children, tomorrow's their future
Don't make them feel it's just another day

Tell me, anybody, why can't we live together
End all the fighting, erase it all forever?
Listen for this reason before it gets too late
Soon, there will be no one, no one left to hate

CHORUS

Oh oh oh oh, tell me, tell me why
Oh oh oh oh, tell me, tell me why
Oh oh oh oh, tell me, tell me why
Oh oh oh oh, tell me, tell me why

INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE

So, tell me, anybody, why can't we live together
End all the fighting, erase it all forever?
Listen for this reason before it gets too late
Soon, there will be no one, no one left to hate

CHORUS (2x)

Games are not where it's at
Give it up, no time for that
Imagine people, hand in hand
No more fighting in this land
Red, yellow, black, or white
Colors don't make up what's right
Come with me and see the light
We can start the peace tonight
Make the music fill your life
Now's the time to realize
Don't be living in a lie
Can't you hear the people's cry?

Can't you hear the people's cry?

Keep our voices low and don't act surprised
If the word gets out, yeah, that's all right
I know you're just looking for some sympathy
But listen, you don't know how it gets back to me
You're getting reckless, girl, but that's all right

Now don't you know that one cold word's gonna lead to another
Then we'll have nowhere to go

Even if heaven and earth collide tonight
We'll be all alone in a different light
I don't care what the world can't see
It's just between you and me
You and me

I see telltale signs of a love in decline
Should be something to say but we don't take the time
And I don't understand, but that's all right
Now you can turn the page or you can tear me apart
Don't make an open book out of my private heart
You should know better now, but that's all right

Don't you know that one cold word's gonna lead to another
Then we'll have nowhere to go

Even if heaven and earth collide tonight
We'll be all alone in a different light
Now, I don't care what the world can't see
It's just between you and me
I said it's just between you and me

If we don't work this out, we won't recover
We'll lose this soulful love for one another
But with all I've heard and all I've seen
I'm still lost in your mystery

Again we're staring at each other with accusing eyes
Keep our voices low, don't act surprised
If the word gets out, yeah, that's all right

And don't you know that one cold word's gonna lead to another
And then we'll have nowhere to go

Even if heaven and earth collide tonight
We'll be all alone in a different light
Now, I don't care what the world can't see
It's just between you and me

Even if heaven and earth collide tonight
We'll be all alone in a different light
Now, I don't care what the world can't see
When it's just between you and me
It's just between you and me
You and me

Heaven and earth
I don't understand
Ooh, you're getting reckless, girl
All alone
One cold, cold word
Could lead to another

I have come to indecision
Someone is pushing me
All the cities, subways, rivers
No direction left for me
I have lost my way home early
I dont care cause I won't stay there
All I hear is this silent whisper
""Will you be here again""

[Chorus]
Imagination takes the shadows away
Everyday, I've been without you
Imagination keeps the shadows away
Everyday, I stay without you
Too many times, without you

[Verse 2]
I have seen your eyes in purple
I have seen your eyes in blue
All the flowers, tears and faces
All the days I spent with you
Again and again, Ive been escaping
I've been lost in the dark, I fear
Can you hear this silent whisper
Will you be here again?

[Chorus]
Imagination takes the shadows away
Everyday, I've been without you
Imagination keeps the shadows away
Everyday, I stay without you
Too many times, without you

[Bridge]
Choose and change you say
How can you let this run away
See the storms through your broken window
See the beauty of the falling rain
Everyday, I've been without you
Everyday, shadow follows me
Can't you see you left your traces
In too many faces

[Chorus]
Imagination takes the shadows away
Everyday, I've been without you
Imagination keeps the shadows away
Everyday, I stay without you
Too many times, without you

And fix you up
But my life could never ever be the same
Without your touch

Every time I close my eyes
I can clearly see the image of your smile
Shine through my darkest dreams
I never thought that I'd find myself this close, this close
To you, my dear, tell me what it means
I can feel your sweet caress wash away all the loneliness
That I once felt inside my heart
Boy, if you could read my mind I'm sure that you would find
What you've been searching for, what you've been searching for

Free me from despair (Free me), there's so much to share
If you surrender to me

I feel like I'm in heaven when you walk my way
You're such a mystery (Such a mystery)
The butterflies I feel inside must be (must be), must be (must be)
A sign of love, no one can disagree
My desire for your love is like a new horizon
Only lovers see like you and I, I
Sacred love will be the start to sacred nights, our hearts
I'll love you 'til my dying day, until my dying day

378,378,Peace In Our Time,"Oh, darling, how strong is
Love supposed to be
Surrounded by fire and magic
We long to be free

Cheating, heating up
Down on the streets of shame
To be strong enough
To fly without love
Like a phoenix from the flame

You've gotta have faith
To work it out, faith and hope
Without a doubt, give us strength
To make a start
Put a song in our heart

Then we're gonna break down the walls
And build the prison with the stone

'Cause you and I know
What love is worth
We're gonna build
A Heaven on Earth

Running in the
Wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
Gonna make love the bottom line
Gonna find peace in our time

Whoa, oh, peace in our time

Sweet, sweet darling
When there is lightning in the sky
Come out of the storm
And into the warmth of
The healing I'll supply

Gotta have faith
And get it fast, faith and hope
If you let it last, give us strength
To reach the stars
Put a song in our heart

'Cause you and I know
What love is worth
We're gonna build
A Heaven on Earth

Running in the
Wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
Gonna make love the bottom line
Gonna find peace in our time

Whoa, oh

And the sign of the dove
Gonna shine, shine, shine
On the wing and prayer
We'll get by, by, by

Keep on keeping on
As long as our dreams are true
When cities are dust
It's Heaven or bust
In the shape of me and you

Gotta have faith (faith)
To goad us along
Now there's hope (hope)
To carry us on
Give us strength (strength)
We'll never go wrong
With this song in our hearts

Then we're gonna break down the walls
And build the prison with the stone

'Cause you and I know
What love is worth
We're gonna build
A Heaven on Earth

Running in the
Wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
Gonna make love the bottom line
We're gonna find peace in our time

Then we're gonna
Break down the walls
Build the prison
With the stone

Cause you and I know
What love might be worth
We're gonna build
A Heaven here on Earth

We're running, running
With the wheels of fortune

Tender lover
Tender love

[Verse 1:]
Eleanor Rigby spends half her life
All alone
No fault of her own

Made a decision
Love has no place in her home
Love
It has a right to go

[Hook #1:]
Love has no limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so

Don't even give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on

We didn't didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

[Chorus:]
Tender lover
Girl, I'm so sorry
Well
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart

Tender love
So broken hearted
Well
I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart

[Verse 2:]
Don't ever give up in spite of our love
Love is much too precious
It's greater than both of us

There's more than enough
Keep looking for love
Just be a believer
It'll give you what you want

[Hook #2:]
Sky is the limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so

Don't ever give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on

We didn't
Didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

[Repeat Chorus:]

You said you didn't need her
You told her good-bye
You sacrificed a good love
To satisfy your pride
Now you wished that you should have her
And you feel like such a fool
You let her walk away
Now it just don't feel the same
Gotta blame it on something
Gotta blame it on something

[Chorus]
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that shine at night
Whatever you do
Don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah-yeah
You can blame it on the rain

[Verse 2]
Should've told her you were sorry
Could have said you were wrong
But no you couldn't do that
You had to prove you were strong
If you hadn't been so blinded
She might still be there with you
You want her back again
But she just don't feel the same
Gotta blame it on something
Gotta blame it on something

And the rain don't care
You got to blame it on something

I say, ooh-ah

But for now there's something else that's calling me
So take me down that lonesome road
Point me east and let me go
That suitcase weighs me down with memories

I just want to be the one you run to
I just want to be the one you come to
I just want to be there with someone when the night comes
Let's put all our cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just want to be there beside you
When the night comes
When the night comes

Two spirits in the night
We can leave before the morning light
When there's nothing left to lose
There's nothing left to fear
So meet me on the edge of town
Won't keep you waiting I'll be around
Then you and I we'll just roll right out of here

I just want to be the one you run to
I just want to be the one you come to
I just want to be there with someone when the night comes
Let's put all our cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just want to be there beside you
When the night comes
When the night comes

I know there'll be a time when you and I
Could take our hands and run away
Pick up all the pieces of this shattered dream
We're gonna make it out some day
We'll be coming back, coming back to stay

I want to be the one you run to
To be the one you come to
I want to be the one you run to

I just want to be the one you run to
I want to be the one you come to
I just want to be there with someone
When the night comes
Let's put all our cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us

She calls out to the man on the street
""Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?""

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

[Chorus]
Oh, think twice, it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

[Interlude]
Think about it

[Verse 2]
She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying

[Chorus]
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

[Interlude]
Just think about it

[Bridge]
Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh lord, there must be something you can say

[Verse 3]
You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'cos she didn't fit in there

[Chorus]
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you

Want to know, baby
Just how you feel, girl
Said I wanna know
If what you feel is real, girl
Cause there's a reason
For the things that I say, what I talk about
But oh, I want to love you girl
In a special way, come here woman
We've been together
For so very long
I'd hate to break up
Break up my happy home

[Chorus 1]
(The way we stand and the way we lie)
The way we lie
(The way we love and the way we cry)
Girl, we cry
(Of all these things, there comes a time)
There's a time
(Makes me feel that it's worth a try)
Makes me feel, it's worth a try
(I'll be good to you)

[Chorus 2]
Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, I'll be good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, I'll be good to you

[Verse 2]
Girl you said, we've been together
So very long, very long
I would hate to break up
Break up my happy home
Let me take off your shoes
Take a stand, now
And let me know how
Ooh always baby, and all your know-how

[Chorus 1]
(The way we stand and the way we lie)
The way we lie
(The way we love and the way we cry)
The way we cry
(Of all these things, there lies a time)
(Makes me feel that it's worth a try)

[Chorus 2][3x]

[Spoken: Ray Charles]
Girl, I'll be good to you, babe
Y'know I'll be good to you, take you shopping
You know what I mean baby? Anything you want
I'll be good to you
I'll give it up, with my credit cards
Like Visa, Master Charge, American Express
Turn my pants upside down
Any day of the week

[Bridge]
Oh, you, you, you
Come here, give me love
Talk to me

I once knew a girl by the name of Monique
She was my childhood sweetheart every day of the week
Whether PS46, or 151
After school I'd go to her house, to have some fun
We both lived in Colonial Projects
I lived in building 48, she lived in building 26
We used to play Ringling, Coke or 1-2-3
But when I'm in Monique's presence, I would just freeze
The relationship began when I was five startin
She was in nursery school, I was in kindergarten
We was more closer than a hand and glove
This is what you call real puppy love
When we'd go trick or treating, I would carry her bag
When we moved to Long Island, it was all such a drag
Cause I know it would be difficult to see her again
I wouldn't miss her more than I'd miss all of my friends
Even though we was little this love was unique
And this is what I say to my love Monique, because

[Chorus - repeat 4X]
""She's not, just another woman..
She's not, no no!""

[Verse Two]
Let me tell ya a little somethin, about Monique
Even though we was little she had a physique
Indian brown skin with a nice complexion
She always gave me tender love and affection
I knew she was different in her own little way
I used to knock at her door bout every single day
I remember when we used to go trick or treatin
I used to snatch bags, so she could sink her teeth in
Crazy big variety of a lot of candy
She would share it with her friends Kim Ron and Fran and
Lee-nette, the girl she called her cousin
We never had an argument, oh we was never fussin
That's why me and her got along so good
Anything I asked her to do, you know she would
We would have family day, in back of building 70
I would win her a prize, so she could treat me heavenly
I don't care what nobody say, because
This girl would make my day, and

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now this is the epilogue of this story
About a young little girl, especially for me
No matter how many years ago I can't forget
But then again 1986 hit
She looked just the same, but in a bigger version
My mind started goin on a love excursion
I started reminiscin to her bout old times
She began to smile, I guess I rang her chimes
I didn't see her again until 1988
And I saw her again, and she still was straight
Now this time I had enough courage to speak to her
I told her would you be with me, and what would occur
Then I asked was, she swingin any capers
She said - no not me, nobody got no papers
I couldn't believe, after all of these years
I was so happy she waited it brought me to tears, cause

394,394,Principal's Office,"[Intro]
Now normally if I can help But I don't spend a lot of time in a principal's office
(RING!!!)
What?
9'o clock

[Verse 1]
Now as I get to school I hear the late bell ringing
Runnning through the halls, I hear the glee club singing
And as I get to the office I can hardly speak
Cause it's the third late pass that I got this week
So to my first class I run and don't walk
All I hear is my sneakers and the scratching of chalk
And as I get to the room I hear the teacher say
""Mr. Young I'm very happy you could join us today""
I try to sit down so I can take some notes
But I can't read what the kid next to me wrote
And if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete
As I try to get up, I find this gum on my seat
So with the seat stuck to me, I raised my hand
And said, ""Excuse me but can I go to the bathroom, ma'am?""
The teacher got upset, and she screamed out ""No!
It's off the principal's office you go.""

[Verse 2]
12 o'clock comes with mass hysteria
Everybody rushes down to the cafeteria
Picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch
And as I tried the apple sauce, I heard it crunch
I'm running up the stairs with my front tooth broken
The nurse just laughed, and said you must be joking
I looked up at her with a smile on my face
No joke cause my front tooth is out of place
So I walked to school with ice on my lip
The nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip
My books are real heavy, I'm walking, I'm dragging
Ain't no school lunch next week, I'm brown-bagging it
Forget class, I'm a shoot some ball
With the late pass I got no trouble at all
But then the nurse walks up and says ""What do you know?
It's off to the prinicipal's office you go.""

Recess!

[Verse 3]
Passing notes is my favorite pastime
I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to
To express my feelings
Give me a week B, and the girl'll be dealing
Now one young lady was looking at me
I said ""Hi my name is Marvin, known as Young MC""
But then the ball rang, and the teacher came in
And that's when the game of passing notes would begin
I wrote the first note, told her she was fine
And I hoped that the two of us could spend some time
She wrote me back and told me ""You're fine too
I'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you""
So then I sat there reeling, and looking at the ceiling
Words can't express the way that I was feeling
Then I thought to myself, the sure way to get her
Is to write another note, oh yes, a love letter
When I finished the note, it was ready to pass
The teacher took it, and read it right in front of the class
She read it word by word and line by line
And everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine
Even then my girl was laughing, and it was too late
For me to write another note cause there would be no date
The teacher looked at me, and I said ""I know
It's off to the principal's office I go.""

396,396,I Will Survive,"At first I was afraid
I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never
Live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights
Thinkin how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and
I learned how to get along
And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried
To hurt me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive
Hey hey
It took all the strength
I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart
And I spent, oh, so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry but now
I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up
Little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free
Now I'm saving all my loving
For someone who's loving me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried
To break me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die

So all of you please listen

There are some people living in this world
They have no food to eat
They have no place to go
But we all are God's children

We've got to learn to love one another
Just remember
They could be us
Remember, we all are brothers

I'm not trying to darken up your day
But help others in need
And show them there's a better way

This one's for the children
The children of the world
This one's for the children
May God keep them in His throne

Many people are happy
And many people are sad
Some people have many things
That others can only wish they had

So for the sake of the children
Show them love's the only way to go
'Cause they are tomorrow
And people, they've got to know

I'm not trying to darken up your day
But help others in need
And show them there's a better way

Honey are you lookin' for some trouble tonight? Well, alright
You think you're so bad, drive the women folk wild
Shoot 'em all down with the flash of your pearly smile
Honey but you met your match tonight, oh, that's right
You think you'll knock me off my feet 'till I'm flat on the floor
'Till my heart is crying indian and I'm beggin' for more
So come on, baby, come on, baby
Come on, baby, show me what that loaded gun is for

If you can give it, I can take it
'Cause if this heart is gonna break
It's gonna take a lot to break it
'Cause I know tonight
Somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it
Your heart is down for the count
And you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James

[Verse 2]
You're an outlaw lover and I'm after your hide
Well, you ain't so strong
Won't be long 'till your hands are tied
Tonight I'm gonna take you in dead or alive, that's right
You break the laws of love in the name of desire
Take ten steps back, c'ause I'm ready, baby, aim and fire
Baby, there's no way you're gonna run tonight
Ooh, that's right
Well, you've had your way with love
But it's the end of the day
Now a team of wild horses couldn't break your heart away
So come on, baby, come on, baby
Come on, baby, you know there ain't nothing left to say

[Chorus]
If you can give it, I can take it
'Cause if this heart is gonna break
It's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight
Somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it
Your heart is down for the count
And you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James

[Bridge]
You think you'll knock me off my feet
'Til I'm flat on the floor
'Til my heart is crying indian and I'm beggin' for more
So come on, baby, come on, baby
Come on, baby, come on

[Chorus]
If you can give it, I can take it
'Cause if this heart is gonna break
It's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight
Somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it
Your heart is down for the count
And you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James

When the fire is gone, when the weak break the strong
There's no danger, when a heart is cold
But if I stay alone, mine will soon turn to stone

I know - girl you're not the only one
Who's looking for someone to hold

Chorus:
The look in your eyes ain't the same anymore
Something has changed deep inside
We both know it's right, what are we waiting for
There's no holding back
'cause with you I've got nothin' to hide

Sleepin' on a bed of lies
I've been lonely too long
Now the hurt is all gone
You were waiting for me to come around
How could I be so blind, not to see in your mind

And your heart - you've always been the only one
Believin' in me all along

Think on better days
Life is rude, treats you bad
Tears your wings away
Raise your eyes to star and sky
Believe in fly always
Take your dreams, your broken schemes
And sweep the past away

Fly lonely angel
High above these streets
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

Hollywood ain't paved with gold
It's just a trick of light
Sunset falls on stars of old
And blinds you with its light
A spiders web of tangled lives
Lays stretched across the hills
From distances it's glistening
Like El Dorado's halls

Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

The dream was light
And fragrant nights
But how were you to know
The streets are hard
They're mean and scared
Where only fools find gold

Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

Fly lonely angel
Spread your wings another way
Fly lonely angel
Find a better way

I got to know
I got to know

[Chorus 2]
Is it better to love one another
Than to go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yeah, we'd better take good care of each other
Avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eight

[Bridge]
Well, figure it out for yourself, little girl
I don't go nowhere at all
It's nothing more than a tape loop in a big dance hall

[Chorus 1]
Well, you've got me dancing in a figure of eight
Don't know if I'm coming or going, I'm early or late
Round and round the ring I go
I want to know
I want to know

[Chorus 2]
Is it better to love one another
Than to go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yeah, we'd better take good care of each other

I don't need no license
To sign on no line
And I don't need no preacher
To tell me you're mine
I don't need no diamonds
I don't need no new bride
I just need you, baby
To look me in the eye
I know they have a hand time
And your Daddy don't approve
But I don't need your Daddy
Telling us what we should do
Now there's a million questions
I could ask about our lives
But I only need one answer
To get me through the night

[Chorus]
So baby, can you tell me just where we fit in
I call it love they call it living in sin
Is it you and me or just this world we live in
I say we're living on love they say we're living in sin

[Verse 2]
Is it right for both our parents
Who fight it out most nights
Then pray for God's forgiveness
When they both turn out the lights
Or wear that ring of diamonds
When your heart is made of stone
You can talk but still say nothing
You stay together but alone
Or is it right to hold you
And kiss your lips goodnight
They say the promise is forever
If you sign it on the dotted line

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
I call it love they call it living in sin
Living in sin
I don't know where to begin
I don't know where we fit in

The way that you love me
The way that you love me
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me
Way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me

[Verse 1]
It ain't the clothes that you wear
It ain't the things that you buy
It ain't your house on the hill
It ain't the plane that you fly
It ain't your black limousine
It ain't your ninety-foot yacht
It ain't the things that you'll get
It ain't the things that you got

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It ain't the money or the diamond rings
Honey, I ain't impressed with your material things

[Chorus]
It's the way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me, baby
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me, baby

[Verse 2]
It ain't your friends at the top
It ain't their fortune and fame
It ain't your heavy connections
It ain't the Hollywood game

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ain't famous people or the parties they throw
Honey, I ain't impressed with all the people you know

[Chorus]
It's just the way that you love me
In the heat of the night
It's just the way that you love me, baby
It's just the way that you love me
When you love me right
It's just the way that you love me, baby
It's just the way that you love me
And the things that you do
It's just the way hat you love me, baby
It's just the way that you love me
Make me crazy for you
It's just the way that you love me, baby

[Breakdown]
Break it down, huh
That's right
Keep it
Right there
Ow!
Right there
Guitar

[Pre-Chorus 3]
It ain't the money or the diamond rings
Honey, I ain't impressed with those material things

[Verse 3]
It ain't the trips to Brazil
It ain't the weekends in Rome
Baby, it ain't the French Riviera
You know I'd rather stay home

[Pre-Chorus 4]
Ain't the Bahamas
It ain't Monaco
Honey, I ain't impressed with all the places we go

[Chorus]
It's just the way that you love me
The way that you love me, baby
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me, baby
The way that you love me
It ain't the money
It's just the way that you love me
Or the diamond rings
The way that you love me
Ain't you're buying me
It's just the way that you love me
The material things
The way that you love me
It ain't your Maserati
It's just the way that you love me
Your house on the hill
The way that you love me
It ain't the parties
It's just the way that you love me
Or the trips to Brazil

I know you broke up with him
And your heart's still on the shelf
It's been over two years for me
And I'm still not quite myself
You can't be with someone new
And you can't go back to him
You're beginning to realize
That it's sink or swim

I see you around sometimes
And my heart just melts
You're lookin' like if you had your wish
You'd be somewhere else
And it just breaks my heart
To see you here this way
Someday I'll get the nerve
To walk up to you and say

[Chorus 1]
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause I'll be there
When your broken heart is on the mend

[Verse 2]
Every night it's the same old crowd in smoky rooms
You catch a faint glimpse of love sometimes
But it never blooms
I've been around this block a time or two
And I've made some big mistakes
But girl I promise you, I promise you

[Chorus 2]
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause it won't be long
Til your little heart is on the mend

[Verse 3]
People inside their houses
With the shades pulled down
God knows we could use some romance
In this sleepy bedroom town
I know you're still afraid to rush into anything
But there are just so many summers, babe
And just so many springs

[Chorus 2]
And this is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend, baby
Just gimme a chance, gimme a chance
To show you love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause it won't be long
Til your little heart is on the mend

Just gimme a chance, darlin

I was thinking about parking the other night
We was out on a back road
Me and my baby was just getting right
All systems on overload
Radio blasting in the front seat
Turning out the music fine
And we were snuggled up in the back seat
Making up for lost time

[Chorus]
Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat

[Verse 2]
You can wine and dine with a man all night
With good intent
But there is something about a confrontation on a back road
Breaks down the defense

[Chorus]
Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat

The fields of Eden are full of trash
And if we beg and we borrow and steal
We'll never get it back
People are hungry, they crowd around
And the city gets bigger as the country comes begging to town

[Chorus]
We're stuck between a rock
And a hard place
Between a rock
And a hard place

[Verse 2]
This talk of freedom and human rights
Means bullying and private wars
And chucking all the dust into our eyes
And peasant people, poorer than dirt
Who are caught in the crossfire
End up nothing to lose but their shirts, yeah

[Chorus]
We're stuck between a rock
And a hard place
Between a rock
And a hard place
You'd better stop
Put on a kind face
Between a rock
And a hard place

[Verse 3]
We're in the same boat on the same sea
And we're sailing south on the same breeze
Building dream churches with silver spires
And our rogue children are playing loaded dice

[Bridge]
You'd better stop, yeah, give it all you got
Give me the truth now, don't want no shame
I'd be hung, drawn and quartered for a sheep
Just as well as a lamb

Stuck between a rock and a hard place
A rock and a hard place
You'd better stop, put on a kind face
Can't you see what you've done to me?
Between a rock and a hard place (That's what I said)
Between a rock and a hard place (Yeah)
You'd better stop (Stop, yeah, you'd better stop)
Put on a kind face (Just a little smile)
Yeah, come on now, yeah
Between a rock and a hard place
Between a rock and a hard place

It's funny that way
You can get used to the tears and the pain
What a child will believe

I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh father, I have sinned

When I look back, I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

421,421,Right And Hype,"A TETE-A-TETE AND A DISCOVERY

In little more than twenty minutes, the journey was accomplished. I paused at the gate to wipe my streaming forehead, and recover my breath and some degree of composure. Already the rapid walking had somewhat mitigated my excitement; and with a firm and steady tread, I paced the garden walk. In passing the inhabited wing of the building, I caught a sight of Mrs. Graham, through the open window, slowly pacing up and down her lonely room.

She seemed agitated, and even dismayed at my arrival, as if she thought, I too was coming to accuse her. I had entered her presence intending to condole with her upon the wickedness of the world, and help her to abuse the vicar and his vile informants, but now I felt positively ashamed to mention the subject, and determined not to refer to it, unless she led the way.

""I am come at an unseasonable hour,"" said I, assuming a cheerfulness I did not feel, in order to reassure her; ""but I won't stay many minutes.""

She smiled upon me, faintly it is true, but most kindly—I had almost said thankfully, as her apprehensions were removed.

""How dismal you are, Helen! Why have you no fire?"" I said, looking round on the gloomy apartment.

""It is summer yet,"" she replied.

""But we always have a fire in the evenings—if we can bear it;—and you, especially require one in this cold house and dreary room.""

""You should have come a little sooner, and I would have had one lighted for you; but it is not worth while now—you won't stay many minutes you say, and Arthur is gone to bed.""

""But I have a fancy for a fire, nevertheless. Will you order one, if I ring?""

""Why Gilbert, you don't look cold!"" said she, smilingly regarding my face, which no doubt seemed warm enough.

""No,"" replied I, ""but I want to see you comfortable before I go.""

""Me comfortable!"" repeated she, with a bitter laugh, as if there were something amusingly absurd in the idea. ""It suits me better as it is,"" she added in a tone of mournful resignation.

But determined to have my own way I pulled the bell.

""There now, Helen!"" I said, as the approaching steps of Rachel were heard in answer to the summons. There was nothing for it but to turn round and desire the maid to light the fire.

I owe Rachel a grudge to this day for the look she cast upon me ere she departed on her mission—the sour, suspicious, inquisitorial look that plainly demanded, ""what are you here for, I wonder?"" Her mistress did not fail to notice it, and a shade of uneasiness darkened her brow.

""You must not stay long Gilbert,"" said she, when the door was closed upon us.

""I'm not going to,"" said I, somewhat testily, though without a grain of anger in my heart against any one but the meddling old woman. ""But Helen, I've something to say to you before I go.""

""What is it?""

""No, not now—I don't know yet precisely what it is—or how to say it,"" replied I, with more truth than wisdom; and then, fearing lest she should turn me out of the house, I began talking about indifferent matters in order to gain time. Meanwhile Rachel came in to kindle the fire, which was soon effected by thrusting a red-hot poker between the bars of the grate, where the fuel was already disposed for ignition. She honoured me with another of her hard, inhospitable looks in departing, but, little moved thereby, I went on talking; and setting a chair for Mrs. Graham on one side of the hearth and one for myself on the other, I ventured to sit down, though half suspecting she would rather see me go.

In a little while we both relapsed into silence, and continued for several minutes gazing abstractedly into the fire—she intent upon her own sad thoughts, and I reflecting how delightful it would be to be seated thus beside her with no other presence to restrain our intercourse—not even that of Arthur, our mutual friend, without whom we had never met before—if only I could venture to speak my mind, and disburden my full heart of the feelings that had so long oppressed it, and which it now struggled to retain, with an effort that it seemed impossible to continue much longer,—and volving the pros and cons for opening my heart to her there and then, and imploring a return of affection, the permission to regard her thenceforth as my own, and the right and the power to defend her from the calumnies of malicious tongues. On the one hand, I felt a new-born confidence in my powers of persuasion—a strong conviction that my own fervour of spirit would grant me eloquence—that my very determination—the absolute necessity for succeeding, that I felt must win me what I sought; while on the other, I feared to lose the ground I had already gained with so much toil and skill, and destroy all future hope by one rash effort, when time and patience might have won success. It was like setting my life upon the cast of a die; and yet, I was ready to resolve upon the attempt. At any rate I would entreat the explanation she had half promised to give me before: I would demand the reason of this hateful barrier, this mysterious impediment to my happiness and, as I trusted, to her own.

But while I considered in what manner I could best frame my request, my companion wakened from her reverie with a scarcely audible sigh, and looking towards the window where the blood-red harvest moon, just rising over one of the grim, fantastic evergreens, was shining in upon us, said,—

""Gilbert, it is getting late.""

""I see,"" said I. ""You want me to go, I suppose.""

""I think you ought. If my kind neighbours get to know of this visit—as no doubt they will—they will not turn it much to my advantage.""

It was with what the Vicar would doubtless have called a savage sort of a smile that she said this.

""Let them turn it as they will,"" said I. ""What are their thoughts to you or me, so long as we are satisfied with ourselves—and each other. Let them go to the deuce with their vile constructions, and their lying inventions!""

This outburst brought a flush of colour to her face.

""You have heard, then, what they say of me?""

""I heard some detestable falsehoods; but none but fools would credit them for a moment, Helen, so don t let them trouble you.""

""I did not think Mr. Millward a fool, and he believes it all; but however little you may value the opinions of those about you—however little you may esteem them as individuals, it is not pleasant to be looked upon as a liar and a hypocrite, to be thought to practice what you abhor, and to encourage the vices you would discountenance, to find your good intentions frustrated, and your hands crippled by your supposed unworthiness, and to bring disgrace on the principles you profess.""

""True; and if I, by my thoughtlessness and selfish disregard to appearances, have at all assisted to expose you to these evils, let me entreat you not only to pardon me, but to enable me to make reparation; authorize me to clear your name from every imputation: give me the right to identify your honour with my own, and to defend your reputation as more precious than my life!""

""Are you hero enough to unite yourself to one whom you know to be suspected and despised by all around you, and identify your interests and your honour with hers? Think! it is a serious thing.""

""I should be proud to do it Helen!—most happy—delighted beyond expression!—and if that be all the obstacle to our union, it is demolished, and you must—you shall be mine!""

And starting from my seat in a frenzy of ardour, I seized her hand and would have pressed it to my lips, but she as suddenly caught it away, exclaiming in the bitterness of intense affliction:—

""No, no, it is not all!""

""What is it then? You promised I should know some time, and—""

""You shall know some time—but not now—my head aches terribly,"" she said, pressing her hand to her forehead, ""and I must have some repose—and surely, I have had misery enough to day!"" she added, almost wildly.

""But it could not harm you to tell it,"" I persisted: ""it would ease your mind; and I should then know how to comfort you.""

She shook her head despondingly. ""If you knew all, you, too, would blame me—perhaps even more than I deserve—though I have cruelly wronged you,"" she added in a low murmur, as if she mused aloud.

""You, Helen? Impossible!""

""Yes, not willingly; for I did not know the strength and depth of your attachment—I thought—at least I endeavoured to think your regard for me was as cold and fraternal as you professed it to be.""

""Or as yours?""

""Or as mine—ought to have been—of such a light and selfish, superficial nature that—""

""There, indeed, you wronged me.""

""I know I did; and sometimes, I suspected it then; but I thought, upon the whole, there could be no great harm in leaving your fancies and your hopes to dream themselves to nothing—or flutter away to some more fitting object, while your friendly sympathies remained with me; but if I had known the depth of your regard, the generous disinterested affection you seem to feel—""

""Seem, Helen?""

""That you do feel, then, I would have acted differently.""

""How? You could not have given me less encouragement, or treated me with greater severity than you did! And if you think you have wronged me by giving me your friendship, and occasionally admitting me to the enjoyment of your company and conversation, when all hopes of closer intimacy were vain—as indeed you always gave me to understand—if you think you have wronged me by this, you are mistaken; for such favours, in themselves alone, are not only delightful to my heart, but purifying, exalting, ennobling to my soul; and I would rather have your friendship than the love of any other woman in the world!""

Little comforted by this, she clasped her hands upon her knee, and glancing upward, seemed, in silent anguish, to implore divine assistance; then turning to me, she calmly said—

""To-morrow, if you meet me on the moor about mid-day, I will tell you all you seek to know; and perhaps you will then see the necessity of discontinuing our intimacy—if, indeed, you do not willingly resign me as one no longer worthy of regard.""

""I can safely answer no, to that: you cannot have such grave confessions to make—you must be trying my faith, Helen.""

""No, no, no,"" she earnestly repeated—I wish it were so! Thank Heaven;"" she added, ""I have no great crime to confess; but I have more than you will like to hear, or, perhaps, can readily excuse,—and more than I can tell you now; so let me entreat you to leave me!""

""I will; but answer me this one question first;—do you love me?""

""I will not answer it!""

""Then I will conclude you do; and so good night.""

She turned from me to hide the emotion she could not quite controul; but I took her hand and fervently kissed it.

""Gilbert, do leave me!"" she cried, in a tone of such thrilling anguish that I felt it would be cruel to disobey.

But I gave one look back before I closed the door, and saw her leaning forward on the table, with her hands pressed against her eyes, sobbing convulsively; yet I withdrew in silence. I felt that to obtrude my consolations on her then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings.

To tell you all the questionings and conjectures—the fears, and hopes, and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as I descended the hill, would almost fill a volume in itself. But before I was half way down a sentiment of strong sympathy for her I had left behind me had displaced all other feelings, and seemed imperatively to draw me back: I began to think, ""Why am I hurrying so fast in this direction? Can I find comfort or consolation—peace, certainty, contentment, all—or anything that I want at home? and can I leave all perturbation, sorrow and anxiety behind me there?""

And I turned round to look at the old Hall. There was little besides the chimnies visible above my contracted horizon. I walked back to get a better view of it. When it rose in sight, I stood still a moment to look, and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction. Something called me nearer—nearer still—and why not, pray? Might I not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile with the full moon in the cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it—with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to an August night—and the mistress of my soul within, than in returning to my home where all comparatively was light, and life, and cheerfulness, and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind,—and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins—and how could I endure to hear it openly declared—or cautiously insinuated—which was worse?—I had had trouble enough already, with some babbling fiend that would keep whispering in my ear, ""It may be true,"" till I had shouted aloud, ""It is false! I defy you to make me suppose it!""

I could see the red fire-light dimly gleaming from her parlour window. I went up to the garden wall, and stood leaning over it, with my eyes fixed upon the lattice, wondering what she was doing, thinking, or suffering now, and wishing I could speak to her but one word, or even catch one glimpse of her, before I went.

I had not thus looked, and wished, and wondered long, before I vaulted over the barrier, unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window, just to see if she were more composed than when we parted;—and if I found her still in deep distress, perhaps I might venture to attempt a word of comfort—to utter one of the many things I should have said before, instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity. I looked. Her chair was vacant: so was the room. But at that moment some one opened the outer door, and a voice—her voice—said,—

""Come out—I want to see the moon, and breathe the evening air: they will do me good—if anything will.""

Here, then, were she and Rachel coming to take a walk in the garden. I wished myself safe back over the wall. I stood, however, in the shadow of the tall holly bush, which, standing between the window and the porch, at present screened me from observation, but did not prevent me from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlight; Mrs. Graham followed by another—not Rachel, but a young man, slender and rather tall. Oh heavens, how my temples throbbed! Intense anxiety darkened my sight; but I thought—yes, and the voice confirmed it—it was Mr. Lawrence.

""You should not let it worry you so much' Helen,"" said he; ""I will be more cautious in future; and in time—""

I did not hear the rest of the sentence; for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that I could not catch the words. My heart was splitting with hatred; but I listened intently for her reply. I heard it plainly enough.

""But I must leave this place, Frederic,"" she said—""I never can be happy here,—nor anywhere else, indeed,"" she added, with a mirth less laugh,—""but I cannot rest here.""

""But where could you find a better place?"" replied he,—""so secluded—so near me, if you think any thing of that.""

""Yes,"" interrupted she, ""it is all I could wish, if they could only have left me alone.""

""But wherever you go, Helen, there will be the same sources of annoyance. I cannot consent to lose you: I must go with you, or come to you; and there are meddling fools elsewhere, as well as here.""

While thus conversing, they had sauntered slowly past me, down the walk, and I heard no more of their discourse; but I saw him put his arm round her waist, while she lovingly rested her hand on his shoulder;—and then, a tremulous darkness obscured my sight, my heart sickened and my head burned like fire, I half rushed, half staggered from the spot where horror had kept me rooted, and leaped or tumbled over the wall—I hardly know which—but I know that, afterwards, like a passionate child, I dashed myself on the ground and lay there in a paroxysm of anger and despair— how long, I cannot undertake to say; but it must have been a considerable time; for when, having partially relieved myself by a torrent of tears, and looked up at the moon, shining so calmly and carelessly on, as little influenced by my misery as I was by its peaceful radience, and earnestly prayed for death or forgetfulness, I had risen and journeyed homewards—little regarding the way, but carried instinctively by my feet to the door, I found it bolted against me, and every one in bed except my mother, who hastened to answer my impatient knocking, and received me with a shower of questions and rebukes.

""Oh, Gilbert, how could you do so? Where have you been? Do come in and take your supper—I've got it all ready, though you don't deserve it, for keeping me in such a fright, after the strange manner you left the house this evening. Mr. Millward was quite—Bless the boy! how ill he looks! Oh, gracious! what is the matter?""

""Nothing, nothing—give me a candle.""

""But won't you take some supper?""

""No, I want to go to bed,"" said I, taking a candle and lighting it at the one she held in her hand.

""Oh, Gilbert, how you tremble!"" exclaimed my anxious parent. ""How white you look!—Do tell me what it is? Has anything happened?""

""It's nothing!"" cried I, ready to stamp with vexation because the candle would not light. Then, suppressing my irritation, I added, ""I've been walking too fast, that's all. Good night,"" and marched off to bed, regardless of the ""Walking too fast! where have you been?"" that was called after me from below.

My mother followed me to the very door of my room with her questionings and advice concerning my health and my conduct; but I implored her to let me alone till morning; and she withdrew, and at length, I had the satisfaction to hear her close her own door. There was no sleep for me however, that night, as I thought; and instead of attempting to solicit it, I employed myself in rapidly pacing the chamber—having first removed my boots lest my mother should hear me. But the boards creaked, and she was watchful. I had not walked above a quarter of an hour before she was at the door again.

""Gilbert, why are you not in bed—you said you wanted to go?""

""Confound it! I'm going,"" said I.

""But why are you so long about it? you must have something on your mind—""

""For heaven's sake, let me alone, and get to bed yourself!""

""Can it be that Mrs. Graham that distresses you so?""

""No, no, I tell you— It's nothing!""

""I wish to goodness it mayn't!"" murmured she with a sigh, as she returned to her own apartment, while I threw myself on the bed, feeling most undutifully disaffected towards her for having deprived me of what seemed the only shadow of a consolation that remained, and chained me to that wretched couch of thorns.

Never did I endure so long, so miserable a night as that. And yet, it was not wholly sleepless: towards morning my distracting thoughts began to lose all pretensions to coherency, and shape themselves into confused and feverish dreams, and, at length, there followed an interval of unconscious slumber. But then the dawn of bitter recollection that succeeded—the waking to find life a blank, and worse than a blank—teeming with torment and misery—not a mere barren wilderness, but full of thorns and briars—to find myself deceived, duped, hopeless, my affections trampled upon, my angel not an angel, and my friend a fiend incarnate—it was worse than if I had not slept at all.

It was a dull, gloomy morning, the weather had changed like my prospects, and the rain was pattering against the window. I rose nevertheless, and went out; not to look after the farm, though that would serve as my excuse, but to cool my brain, and regain, if possible, a sufficient degree of composure to meet the family at the morning meal without exciting inconvenient remarks. If I got a wetting, that, in conjunction with a pretended over exertion before breakfast, might excuse my sudden loss of appetite; and if a cold ensued, the severer the better, it would help to account for the sullen moods and moping melancholy likely to cloud my brow for long enough.",[],0,Anne Brontë,Abstrac',1990,"[94, 90, 89, 89]",4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0
422,422,Leave A Light On,"[Verse 1]
Take my hand
Tell me what you are feeling
Understand, this is just the beginning
Although I have to go
It makes me feel like crying
I don't know when I'll see you again

[Chorus]
Darling, leave a light on for me
I'll be there before you close the door
To give you all the love that you need
Darling, leave a light on for me
'Cause when the world takes me away
You are still the air that I breathe

[Post-Chorus]
I can't explain, I don't know
Just how far I have to go
But darling I'll keep the key
Just leave a light on for me

[Verse 2]
Yes, I know what I'm asking is crazy
You could go, just get tired of waiting
But if I lose your love
Torn out by my desire
That would be the one regret of my life

[Chorus]
Darling, leave a light on for me
I'll be there before you close the door
To give you all the love that you need
Darling, leave a light on for me
'Cause when the world takes me away
You are still the air that I breathe

[Post-Chorus]
I can't explain, I don't know
Just how far I have to go
But darling I'll keep the key
Just leave a light on for me

[Bridge]
Just like a spark lights up the dark
Baby, that's your heart
Baby, that's your heart
Baby, that's your heart

[Chorus]
Darling, leave a light on for me
I'll be there before you close the door
To give you all the love that you need
Darling, leave a light on for me
'Cause when the world takes me away
You are still the air that I breathe
Darling, leave a light on for me

How many times must we tell the tale?
How many times must we fall?
Living in lost memory
You just recalled

Working on the sound of the band
Trying to get the music right
Two go out working
Three stay home at night

[Chorus]
That's when she said she was pretending
Like she knew the plan
That's when I knew she was pretending
Pretending to understand
Pretending, pretending

Satisfied but lost in love
Situations change
You're never who you used to think you are
How strange

I get lost in alibis
Sadness cannot prevail
Everybody knows strong love
Can't fail

Don't be pretending that your love is real
Don't be pretending about how you feel
Don't be pretending that your love is real

Well you laughed at me right in my face
At the wrong time and in the wrong place
You turned around and said ""I'm all shook up""
Said to me ""I'm your sweet buttercup
You're lying, you're lying, begging him to stay and crying
You're lying, you're lying, you're never satisfied

Hard, hard you think you're so hard

But you did it in spite and that just isn't right

You took my man, the only one I ever had
You took my man, I didn't treat you bad

*Anyway, it's gonna get you anyway
Any day, it's gonna get you*

You took my man and didn't mean it
But you did it to hurt my feelings
What I should do is slap you in your face
You left me here with a pain below my waste
You lose a guy you move into the larder
You got no style, why don't you try a little harder

Johnny saw her riding on a street car named Desire
His fate was sealed
She could see him coming like a hundred other liars
It was no big deal
Rosa had a lover on the shady side of town
Tito, he was king of the streets
She was his possession like a jewel on his crown
Johnny better run, better run

[Chorus]
Better hide your heart, better hold on tight
Say your prayers, 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart, 'cause you're playing with fire

[Verse]
The ride was over but the story doesn't end
He took her heart
She looked him in the eye and said they couldn't meet again
You could see the trouble start
The word went out that Rosa's messin' with someone
It was on the street
Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun
Johnny better run, better run

[Chorus]

Johnny's holdin' Rosa on a rooftop in the night
As time stood still
They couldn't hear him coming 'til he had them both in sight
You could feel a chill
A shot ran out like thunder and the blood was on her hands
With nothing won
When someone lies dying
Lovers finally understand

Fourth Draft
November 1998

INT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHT

An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side.
The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged
silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths
decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous
exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and
confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style:
pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Alaïa, Armani power suits.

CLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials.

WAITER
With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula
Caesar salad. For entrées tonight I have a swordfish
meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge
breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...

Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen
table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four
inches square and look exactly alike.

CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of
conversation. ""Is that Charlie Sheen over there?"" ""Excuse
me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet.""

WAITER
And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our
pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...

CLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate
perpendicular desserts descending on another table.

PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID
VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing
expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back
hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses.

The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:

BATEMAN (V.O.)
We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California
place on the Upper East Side.

The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately
decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's
description of each of the men at the table.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in
a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences
between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van
Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the
best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a
bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten
keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress.

VAN PATTEN
What are the rules for a sweater vest?

McDERMOTT
What do you mean?

PRICE
Yes. Clarify.

McDERMOTT
Well, is it strictly informal-

BATEMAN
Or can it be worn with a suit?

McDERMOTT
(Smiling)
Exactly

BATEMAN
With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or
charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder
vest.

McDERMOTT
But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or
tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look
too studied.

VAN PATTEN
You think so?

PRICE
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.

VAN PATTEN
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.

Van Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy
discreetly removes their largely untouched plates.

BATEMAN
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?

PRICE
It looks that way, doesn't it?

McDERMOTT
(Staring at retreating waiter)
Did he just take our plates away?

PRICE
He took them away because the portions are so small he
probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place.
This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?

McDERMOTT
Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head.
(He guffaws)

Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him.

McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man
with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT
Is that Reed Robinson over there?
PRICE
Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.

McDERMOTT
Who is it then?

PRICE
That's Paul Owen.

BATEMAN
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the
room. Over there.

He points to another handsome young man with slicked-back
hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT
Who is he with?

PRICE
(Distracted by the waitress's
cleavage as she bends over to
uncork a bottle of wine – the
waitress glares at him)
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

Van Patten returns.

VAN PATTEN
They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.

McDERMOTT
Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there?

PRICE
Yes. McDufus, I am.

McDERMOTT
He's handling the Fisher account.

PRICE
Lucky bastard.

McDERMOTT
Lucky Jew bastard.

BATEMAN
Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with
anything?

McDERMOTT
Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the
phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The
bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.

BATEMAN
You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah.
You spin a dreidel.

McDERMOTT
Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?

BATEMAN
No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.

McDERMOTT
Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the
ACLU.

Price leans over and pats Bateman on the back.

PRICE
The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking
of reasonable...

He shows McDermott the bill for the meal.

McDERMOTT
Only $470.

VAN PATTEN
(Without irony)
Not bad.

The others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap
down on the table.

INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
Bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes. Price is
lighting up a cigar.

McDERMOTT
Last week I picked up this Vassar chick-

VAN PATTEN
Oh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this
story again.

McDERMOTT
But I never told you what happened afterwards. So
okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big
tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I
buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on
spring break and she's practically blowing me in the
Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-

BATEMAN
Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all
this?

McDERMOTT
Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick
who's gonna let me-

VAN PATTEN
(Putting his hands over his ears)
I don't want to hear this. He's going to say something
disgusting.

McDERMOTT
You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op
together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some
chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.

Price throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it.

McDERMOTT
Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to
this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking
rhino tipsy, and get this-

VAN PATTEN
She let you fuck her without a condom?

McDERMOTT
This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She
would only-are you ready?
(Dramatic pause)
She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept
her glove on.

The men sit in shocked, horrified silence.

ALL IN UNISON Never date a Vassar girl.

EXT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

The limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel.
McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN,
who looks confused.

McDERMOTT
I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask
him if he takes American Express.

PRICE
(Offering card)
You take Amex, dude?

The man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine,
unhooks the
velvet rope and welcomes them inside.

INT. LADIES ROOM, TUNNEL - NIGHT

Brilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a
black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels.
MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls
stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the
counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as
women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they
wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple
lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes
past them and slams the door.

PRICE
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the
AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected,
then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular
dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for
Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-

BATEMAN
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a
virus.

PRICE
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.

Price and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is
sweating.

PRICE
I'm shaking. You open it.

Bateman opens a tiny packet of coke.

PRICE
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?

BATEMAN
Maybe it's just the light.

PRICE
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips
the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort)
Oh my God...

BATEMAN
What?

PRICE
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!

Bateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts.

BATEMAN
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do
enough of it we'll be okay.

PRICE
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it
on my fucking All-Bran.

The GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate
voice:

GUY IN STALL
Could you keep it down, I'm trying to do drugs!

Price pounds his fist against the stall.

PRICE
(screaming)
SHUT UP!

BATEMAN
Calm down. Let's do it anyway

PRICE
I guess you're right...
(Raising his voice)
THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!

GUY IN STALL
Fuck you!

PRICE
(Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider)
No, FUCK YOU!!
(He collapses, panting against the stall door)
Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it.

BATEMAN
That's the spirit.

They both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope
of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking
their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into
their gums.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Bateman saunters toward the bar as ""Pump Up the Volume""
plays in the background.

BATEMAN (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks.

He hands her two drink tickets.

BARGIRL
It's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's
a cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars.

Bateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her
a $50.

She turns her back and searches the cash register for
change.

BATEMAN You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to
death and then play around with your blood.

The music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is
smiling at her. She gives him his change impassively.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT- MORNING

Tableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light.
A huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows
looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist
high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large
Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive
electronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly
impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of
a design magazine.

BATEMAN (V.0.)
My name is Patrick Bateman. I am
twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden
Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh
floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.

Bateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to
see his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his
toilet.

BATEMAN
(V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a
balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the
morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice
pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand
now.

Bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face.

Bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living
room wearing the ice pack.

CUT TO:

A mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the
shower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep
pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a
water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body
scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.

Bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a
gel facial masque.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which
I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my
routine.

Bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is
stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He
begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in
readiness on the marble counter.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I always use an after-shave lotion with little
or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes
you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye
balm, followed by a final moisturizing ""protective"" lotion...

Bateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried,
giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been
wrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque
off his face.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some
kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an
entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold
gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you
and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably
comparable: I simply am not there.

INT. BATEMAN BEDROOM - MORNING

Another huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled
white sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large
expensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by
Bateman's interior decorator.

Dressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a
huge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts,
shoes and designer suits, organized according to color and
tone.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
It is hard for me to make sense on any given
level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality
is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is
persistent.

Fully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a
full-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom,
adjusting his cuff-links.

BATEMAN (V.0.)
My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared
a long time ago, if they ever did exist.

He gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees.
He gives his reflection a smile.

INT. OFFICES OF PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY

As Bateman walks down the corridor, he passes another MAN who
looks just like him.

MAN
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

Bateman walks past the desk of JEAN, his secretary, pulling
his Walkman from around his neck. Jean is attractive,
wholesome, earnest. She smiles shyly. She loves him.

JEAN
Late?

BATEMAN
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?

JEAN
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what
he was canceling or why.

BATEMAN
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club.
Anyone else?

JEAN
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.

BATEMAN
When?

JEAN
After six.

BATEMAN
Negative. Cancel it.

Jean follows him into his office.

JEAN
Oh? And what should I say?

BATEMAN
Just...say...no.

JEAN
Just say no?

Jean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions.

BATEMAN
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols
at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All
right?

JEAN
(Playfully)
Yes, sir.

She turns to leave.

BATEMAN
Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight
tonight.

Jean turns around.

JEAN
Oh, something. . romantic?

BATEMAN
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.

JEAN
I'll do it.

BATEMAN
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?

JEAN
You look nice today.

Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his
office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a
slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a
beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a
Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment
later with the Perrier and a file.

JEAN
Yes?

BATEMAN
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that
outfit again.

JEAN
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.

BATEMAN
I said ""Do not wear that outfit again."" Wear a
dress. A skirt or something.

Jean stands there, then looks down at herself.

JEAN
(Smiling bravely)
You don't like this, I take it?

BATEMAN
Come on, you're prettier than that.

JEAN
(Sarcastically)
Thanks, Patrick.

The phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave.

BATEMAN
I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels.

As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner
of the room and starts watching Jeopardy!

INT. TAXI - EVENING

EVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's
fiancée, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping
a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically
beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with
herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a
small child.

EVELYN
I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd
want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something
ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots
of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring
out the window.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I'm trying to listen to the new George
Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fiancée-keeps buzzing
in my ear.

Evelyn continues to make notes.

EVELYN
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses.
Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz.
And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.

BATEMAN
(Removing his Walkman)
Do...what.

EVELYN
Get married. Have a wedding.

BATEMAN
Evelyn?

EVELYN
Yes, darling?

BATEMAN
Is your Evian spiked?

EVELYN
We should do it.

BATEMAN
No-I can't take the time off work.

EVELYN
Your father practically owns the company. You can do
anything you like, silly.

BATEMAN
I don't want to talk about it.

EVELYN
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just
quit? You don't have to work.

BATEMAN
Because I...want...to...fit...in.

The taxi bumps to a halt.

INT. ESPACE RESTAURANT- NIGHT

A cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in
self-conscious brutalist chic. Iron girders, walls of waxed
plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel
smashed-plate painting on one wall. The tables and chairs are
made of extremely uncomfortable
bolted steel.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace
since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do,
and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.

Tm Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are
already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen,
with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with
ragged black hair and bad skin.

They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus
that look like minimalist art.

PRICE
The menu's in braille.

He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long
kiss.

PRICE
I have to talk to you.

He drags her away, half giggling and protesting.

EVELYN
(Over her shoulder)
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden
and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.

BATEMAN
(After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and
checking his hair)
Hi. Pat Bateman.

Vanden takes his hand reluctantly, says nothing.

BATEMAN
Let me guess-you live in the East Village?

Pause.

STASH
SoHo.

COURTNEY RAWLINSON and LUIS CARRUTHERS arrive at the table.
Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from
precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is
considerably more fragile and neurotic. Luis is
half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a
rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please. He
wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and
Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets,
bow-ties, boldly patterned vests.

They exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back,
Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck.

COURTNEY
(Whispering)
Stop it!

Stash and Vanden watch them in silence.

LATER:

Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear. Everyone else is
quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching
Evelyn and Price.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn
are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting
person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s
usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight
I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use,
though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers,
the biggest dufus in the business.

Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze.

COURTNEY
Tell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is
becoming to...commercial?

CARRUTHERS
Yes, I read that.

PRICE
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

VANDEN
Hey. That affects us.

PRICE
(Wired on coke)
Oh ho ho. That affects us? What
about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that
affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri
Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of
Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?

BATEMAN
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important
problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign
policy is important, but there are more pressing problems
at hand.

PRICE
Like what?

BATEMAN
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow
down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world
hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We
have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We
have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and
oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while
also promoting equal rights for women but change the
abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still
somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.

The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably.

BATEMAN
We also have to control the influx of illegal
immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional
moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in
movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have
to promote general social concern and less materialism in
young people.

Price chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and
mystified.

CARRUTHERS
Patrick, how thought-provoking.

INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENING

Bateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television.

BATEMAN
Why don t you just go for Price?

EVELYN
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?

BATEMAN
He's rich.

EVELYN
Everybody's rich.

BATEMAN
He's good-looking.

EVELYN
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.

BATEMAN
He has a great body

EVELYN
Everybody has a great body now.

Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get
Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the
Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally,
he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to
look around him at the TV, then takes notice.

EVELYN
What do you want to do with that, floss with it?

Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television.

EVELYN
Are you using minoxidil?

BATEMAN
No. I'm not. Why should I ?

EVELYN
Your hairline looks like it's receding.

BATEMAN
It's not.

EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT

It is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the
comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine.
Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk
past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his
wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up
to her as she pauses at a red light.

BATEMAN
Hello.

The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing
his smile, smiles back.

INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY

Bateman, dressed in an Armani suit
with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry
cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the
counter.

BATEMAN
Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait...
you're not giving me valid reasons.

The woman continues to speak to him in another language,
grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket.

BATEMAN
What are you trying to say to me?

Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained
sheets out of the bag and is staring at them.

BATEMAN
Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee?
Bleach-ee. Oh my God.

She keeps pointing to the jacket and talking.

BATEMAN
(Talking over her)
Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question.
Two.
(Louder)
Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very
expensive sheets and I really need them clean.

She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her.

BATEMAN
If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill
you, are you understanding me?

She talks faster.

BATEMAN
Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting
(Checks Rolex)
at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those
...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at
Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need
those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.

She keeps talking.

BATEMAN Listen. I cannot understand you.

Bateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the
counter.

BATEMAN
This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with
this.

Bateman is on the verge of tears.

BATEMAN
Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!

Someone enters the store behind him. It's VICTORIA,
late-twenties, attractive but a little overweight, wearing a
tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks.

VICTORIA
Patrick?

She takes off her sunglasses.

VICTORIA
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.

BATEMAN
Hello
(Mumbles un incomprehensible name)

Awkward pause.

BATEMAN
Well.

VICTORIA
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here,
but you
know. They really are the best.

BATEMAN
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk
to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.

Victoria moves toward the sheet that the old man is holding
up. She
touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking
again.

VICTORIA
Oh my, I see. What are those? Oh my.
BATEMAN
Um, well...it s cranberry juice. Cranapple.

VICTORiA
(Skeptically) Really?

BATEMAN
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You
know, like...
like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?

VICTORIA
(As if sharing a secret joke) Oh yeah. Oh I get it.
Fun with chocolate.

BATEMAN
Listen, if you could talk to them
(He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand)
I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a
lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.

Bateman turns to leave.

VICTORIA
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?

BATEMAN
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank
you, uh...
Victoria?

VICTORIA
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You
know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.

BATEMAN
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the
time.

VICTORIA
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?

BATEMAN
(Checking his watch)
Next Saturday?

VICTORIA
(Shrugging)
Yeah.

BATEMAN
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables.
Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call
you.

VICTORIA
Okay. Do.

Bateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes
out the door. Victoria stares after him as we hear the sound
of the bell on the closing door.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Bateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video, talking to
Courtney on a portable phone. He's holding a video box in one
hand, perusing the title: Inside Lydia's Ass. Offscreen we hear
the sounds of the porn movie as he talks.

BATEMAN
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

COURTNEY
What? Oh, I'm...busy.

BATEMAN
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to
tonight?

COURTNEY
Stop it. I'm...

BATEMAN
On a lot of lithium?

COURTNEY
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call
tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.

BATEMAN
You should come have dinner with me.
COURTNEY
But-when?

BATEMAN
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?

COURTNEY
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I
need to be
home for that.

BATEMAN
Pumpkin?

COURTNEY
Yes?

BATEMAN
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.

COURTNEY
Uh huh.

BATEMAN
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New
York.

COURTNEY
I know. Stop it.

BATEMAN
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling
dickweed.

COURTNEY
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.

BATEMAN
Courtney? Dinner?

COURTNEY
I can't.

BATEMAN
I'm thinking Dorsia.

COURTNEY
Dorsia's nice.

BATEMAN
Nice?

COURTNEY
You like it there, don't you?

BATEMAN
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will
you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a
boyfriend to eat there tonight.

COURTNEY
Okay. Yeah. What time?

BATEMAN
Eight?

COURTNEY
Pick me up?

BATEMAN
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear
something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?

Bateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the
number for Dorsia with trembling fingers. It's busy and so
he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial. He waits with
his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there
is finally an answer.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia. Please hold.

He is on hold for a long time, getting very tense.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia.

BATEMAN
(Both of his eyes are closed)
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to
reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?

Long pause. The Maitre D' starts giggling quietly and then
more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he
hangs up the phone.

INT. TAXI- NIGHT

Bateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab. Courtney is
heavily medicated.

COURTNEY
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really
relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this
silver muffin dish.
(She starts to pass out)

BATEMAN
Is that Donald Trump's car?

COURTNEY
(Thickly)
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.

BATEMAN
You know, Courtney, you should take some more
lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.

COURTNEY
I just want to have a child. Just...two...
perfect...children...
(Her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze)

The cab draws up outside a restaurant. The awning reads
""Barcadia.""

INT. BARCADIA - NIGHT

An insanely expensive nouvelle Italian restaurant all
polished natural brick, spotless white tablecloths,
minimalist flower arrangements, discreet lighting.

A waiter has come to take their drink orders.

BATEMAN
J&B. Straight.

COURTNEY
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with
a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman
leans over and pulls her back up.

COURTNEY
Are we here?

BATEMAN
Yes.

COURTNEY
This is Dorsia?

BATEMAN
(Examining a menu that says ""Barcadia"" in large script)
Yes, dear.

Courtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu, and
starts to slide off of her chair. Bateman grabs her by both
shoulders and props her up.

BATEMAN
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter
soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine
called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish."" You'll
love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and
pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.

COURTNEY
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.

She falls asleep at the table.

INT. COURTNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Bateman and Courtney are in Courtney's bed. Bateman is on
top of her, reaching for a condom in the ashtray. He tears
it open with his teeth, puts it on.

COURTNEY
(Dazed on lithium)
I want you to fuck me.

Bateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her.

COURTNEY
Luis is a despicable twit.

BATEMAN
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.

He keeps fucking her.

COURTNEY
No, you idiot. I said ""Is it a receptacle tip?""
Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip?
Get off me.

BATEMAN
Is it a what?

COURTNEY
Pull out.

BATEMAN
I'm ignoring you.

COURTNEY
(screaming)
Pull out, goddamnit!

BATEMAN
(Slowing down but not stopping)
What do you want, Courtney?

She pushes him away from her.

BATEMAN
It's a plain end. I think.

COURTNEY
Turn the light on.

She tries to sit up.

BATEMAN
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.

COURTNEY
Patrick. Turn on the Light.
He turns on the light.

BATEMAN
It's a plain end, see? So?

COURTNEY
Take it off.

BATEMAN
Why?

COURTNEY
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip –
(She covers herself with her comforter)
to catch the force of the ejaculate!
BATEMAN
I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?

Courtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying.

COURTNEY
(Screaming)
Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex?

Bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face.

BATEMAN
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see,
Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.
(He slaps her again lightly)
Why is it pulled down half an inch?
So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!

COURTNEY
(Choking crying)
Well, it's not a turn-on for me.
I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.

Bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom.

BATEMAN
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?

COURTNEY
Oh God, just get it over with.

He fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and
falls down next to her. They lie side by side with their
bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the
ceiling.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY

Bateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in
the conference room at Pierce & Pierce, which looks out onto
a spectacular view of Manhattan.

CARRUTHERS
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney.
Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a
reservation there?

BATEMAN
Lucky, I guess.

CARRUTHERS
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess,
Valentino Couture?

BATEMAN
Uh huh.

CARRUTHERS
(Reaching out to touch it)
It looks so soft.

BATEMAN
(Catching Luis hand)
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.

Carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague
on his left.Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St. Journal
under his arm. He is handsome, supremely confident and
self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men.

OWEN
(To Bateman)
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?

BATEMAN
I've been great. And you?

Their conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's
thoughts.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam.
It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in
fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a
penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses.
Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have
a slightly better haircut.

During this voiceover the CAMERA WANDERS over to MARCUS
HALBERSTAM, who is conferring with a colleague in the
opposite corner of the room. He bears a
superficial resemblance to Bateman.

OWEN
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?

BATEMAN
(Nervous)
It's...it's...all right.

OWEN
Really? That's interesting.
(He stares at Bateman, smiling)
Not great?

BATEMAN
Oh well, you know.

OWEN
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.

BATEMAN
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.

McDermott and Price enter.

McDERMOTT
Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account.

OWEN
Thank you, Baxter.

PRICE
Listen, Paul. Squash?

OWEN
Call me.
(Hands him a business card)

PRICE
How about Friday?

OWEN
No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea
urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away
and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face, cold with hatred.

PRICE
(Whispering)
Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that?

McDERMOTT (Whispering)
I think he's lying.

Bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card.

PRICE
(Suddenly enthused)
What's that, a gram?

BATEMAN
New card. What do you think?

McDermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully.

McDERMOTT
Whoa. Very nice. Take a look.

He hands it to Van Patten.

BATEMAN
Picked them up from the printers yesterday

VAN PATTEN
Good coloring.

BATEMAN
That's bone. And the lettering is something called
Silian Rail.

McDERMOTT
(Envious)
Silian Rail?

VAN PATTEN
It is very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.

He pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the
table.

VAN PATTEN
Look at this.

They all lean forward to inspect it.

PRICE
That's really nice.

Bateman clenches his fists beneath the table, trying to
control his anxiety.

VAN PATTEN
Eggshell with Romalian type.
(Turning to Bateman)
What do you think?

BATEMAN
(Barely able to breath, his voice a croak)
Nice.

PRICE
(Holding the card up to the light)
Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so
tasteful?

Bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at
McDermott's.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.

PRICE
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

He holds up his own card.

PRICE
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...

BATEMAN
(Choking with anxiety)
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.

Price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it
up for their inspection: ""PAUL OWEN, PIERCE & PIERCE,
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS."" Bateman swallows, speechless.
The sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint
heartbeat as Bateman stares at the magnificent card.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness
of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...

His hand shaking, Bateman lifts up the card and stares at it
until it fills the screen.

He lets it fall. The SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL.

CARRUTHERS Is something wrong? Patrick...you're sweating.

EXT. STREET- EVENING

The financial district. The streets are eerily deserted.

Bateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of
$500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns
to leave, he notices someone across the street.

A HOMELESS MAN is lying in a doorway on top of an open
grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart. A
cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: I AM
HOMELESS AND HUNGRY PLEASE HELP ME. A small, thin dog lies
next to him.

He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green
polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants.

BATEMAN
(Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman.

The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up.

BATEMAN
You want some money?. Some...food?

The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches
into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his
mind and holds out a $5 instead.

BATEMAN
Is this what you need?

The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose.

HOMELESS MAN
I'm so hungry.

BATEMAN
It's cold out, too, isn't it?

HOMELESS MAN
I'm so hungry.

BATEMAN
(Holding the bill just out of the man's reach)
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you
get a job?

HOMELESS MAN
(Shivering and sobbing)
I lost my job...

BATEMAN
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it?
Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on
the job?

HOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off.

BATEMAN
Gee, uh, that's too bad.

HOMELESS MAN
I'm so hungry.

The dog starts to whimper.

BATEMAN
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?

HOMELESS MAN
I'm not...

BATEMAN
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?

HOMELESS MAN
I'm hungry

BATEMAN
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record.
I'm trying to help you.

HOMELESS MAN
I'm hungry.

BATEMAN
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who
do have jobs? From people who do work?

HOMELESS MAN
What am I gonna do?

BATEMAN
Listen, what's your name?

HOMELESS MAN
Al.

BATEMAN
Speak up. Come on.

HOMELESS MAN
Al.

BATEMAN
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together.
I'll help you.

HOMELESS MAN
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind
man. I can tell.

BATEMAN
(Petting the dog)
Shhhh...it's okay.

HOMELESS MAN
(Grabbing Bateman's wrist)
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.

BATEMAN
(Stroking his face, whispering)
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.

HOMELESS MAN
I can't...I can't find a shelter

BATEMAN
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?
(Shouting)
Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of
faggot. Al...I'm sorry.

Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet.

BATEMAN
It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common
with you.

He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with
a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to
protect it.

BATEMAN
Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are?

HOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife.

EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure
is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach.
The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is
silent.

LOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground.

BATEMAN
There's a quarter. Go buy some gum.

Bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street.
Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the
body left twitching on the ground.

INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY

CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face and torso. His eyes are closed as a
woman's hands rub cream into his face.

FACIALIST
What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman. So
fine, so smooth...

His eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he
closes them again.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood,
skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except
for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside
me and I don't know why.

CUT TO:

Bateman sitting in a chair, looking down at the
MANICURIST who is giving him a pedicure. She is cutting his
nails with tiny sharp scissors. He stares at them longingly.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal,
on the verge of frenzy.

CUT TO:

Bateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning
bed, wearing goggles.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.

INT. TEXARKANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT

An insanely expensive nouvelle Tex-Mex restaurant, with an
ironic Southwestern decor: Santa Fe colors, Navajo blankets,
naive cowboy art, rawhide banquettes.

Bateman bursts in the door, late, and approaches the MAITRE D'.

BATEMAN
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?

MAITRE D'
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.

Paul Owen is seated at a table underneath an enormous pair of
ram's horns. He is arguing with the WAITER.

OWEN
No, I want to know. I came here for the cilantro
crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one
could have for being in this restaurant, which is by the
way, almost completely empty. Am I to believe that all ten
people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of
cilantro crawfish gumbo?

WAITER
I'm very sorry sir. There was a fire in the kitchen
earlier today, and-

BATEMAN
J&B, straight. And a Dixie beer.

WAITER
Would you like to hear-

OWEN
Double Absolut martini.

WAITER
Yes, sir. Would you like to hear the specials?

BATEMAN
Not if you want to keep your spleen.

The Waiter leaves.

OWEN
This is a real beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam.

This place is hot, very hot.

BATEMAN
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous
here.

OWEN
Yeah, well, you're late.

BATEMAN
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break
(Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood)
Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.

OWEN
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.

BATEMAN
Nobody goes there anymore.

There is a long disgruntled silence.

BATEMAN
Is that Ivana Trump over there? (Laughs) Jeez
Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana
be at Texarkana?

Another pause.

BATEMAN
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the
Fisher account? How did you get it?

OWEN
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have
to kill you.

He guffaws. Bateman laughs politely.

LATER:
Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober.

BATEMAN
I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?

Owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another
drink.

OWEN
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan?

BATEMAN Salon.

OWEN
I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.

Bateman nods, agitated.

OWEN
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?

BATEMAN
Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think
she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams.

OWEN
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick
Bateman. What a dork.

BATEMAN
Another Martini, Paul?

Owen nods drunkenly.

LATER:

The end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the
table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid
down.

BATEMAN
(Talking to Owen like a child)
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy.
Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.

BATEMAN
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave
a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?

OWEN
No, man. I'm gonna bail.

BATEMAN
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.
(Helping him into his jacket)
I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a
bottle of Absolut waiting for us.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The living room floor has been meticulously covered with
newspaper.

Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass
in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs.

BATEMAN
You like Huey Lewis and the News?

OWEN
They're okay.
BATEMAN
Their early work was a little too New Wave for my
taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really
came into their own, commercially and artistically.

Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the
shower. He takes two Valium.

BATEMAN
(Said partly from the bathroom)
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost.
Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall.
He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen
from behind ail the time.

BATEMAN
He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think
Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys
catalogue.

OWEN
Hey, Halberstam?

BATEMAN
Yes, Owen?

OWEN
Why are there copies of the Style section all over
the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?

BATEMAN
No, Owen.

OWEN
(Confused)
Is that a raincoat?

BATEMAN
Yes, it is.

Bateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its
case and slides it in the machine.

BATEMAN
In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most
accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is
""HiP To Be Square,"" a song so catchy that most people probably
don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not
just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of
trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself.

Bateman puts on ""Hip To Be Square.""

BATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax.

We follow BATEMAN from behind as he walks up to Owen, the
ax raised over his head.

BATEMAN
Hey, Paul?

As Owen turns around, FROM OWEN'S POV we see Bateman swing
the ax toward his face.

Blood sprays onto the white raincoat.

FROM BEHIND OWEN, we see BATEMAN as he yanks the ax out.

Owen drops to the floor. His body falls out of the frame.
We stay on his legs twitching mechanically.

Blood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor.

BATEMAN
(Raising the ax and screaming)
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking
stupid bastard!

LOW ANGLE ON BATEMAN as he beats Owen with the back of the
ax.

OFFSCREEN, the sound of the ax hitting Owen.

BATEMAN
(Panting)
Fucking bastard...

Bateman takes his raincoat off, still panting. He folds the
coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly
over the back of a chair.

He sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene. He
checks his Rolex and lights a cigar.

OFFSCREEN, Paul Owen's last faint sighs are heard.

INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

BATEMAN drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby,
past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

BATEMAN is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his
feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him.

CARRUTHERS
Patrick? Is that you?

BATEMAN
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.

CARRUTHERS
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good
friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to
Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.
(Looking down at the body)
Where did you get your overnight bag?

BATEMAN
Commes des Garcon.

A cab stops. BATEMAN opens the door and manages to get
Owen's body into the backseat.

Bateman gets into the cab.

CARRUTHERS
Call me please, Patrick.

BATEMAN
Jesus lives, Luis.

INT. BATEMAN'S HELL'S KITCHEN APARTMENT - NIGHT

A bare room, lit by one light bulb. The walls are blank
except for a Les Miserables poster. There is one ratty chair.

Bateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in
a bathtub. He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the
body dissolve.

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very
similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls
are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting
on the wall. One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale
scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch.

BATEMAN
Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans?

He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing
toiletries and shoving them in.

BATEMAN
Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London.

He puts some music on to help muffle his voice, then leans
over the answering machine.

He does a passable imitation of Owen's speech.

BATEMAN
Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London
for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING

Bateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of
Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing
Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes
the Walkman off.

BATEMAN
(Faintly irritable)
What is it?

JEAN
Patrick?

BATEMAN
(Condescendingly)
Ye-es, Je-an?

JEAN
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.

BATEMAN
Who?

JEAN
Detective Donald KIMBALL?

Silence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the
drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back
cover of Sports Illustrated.

BATEMAN
Tell him I'm at lunch.

JEAN
(whispering)
Patrick, I think he knows you're here.
It's only ten-thirty.

Silence.

BATEMAN
Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless
phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end.

BATEMAN
Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion
to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good
buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt
calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties...

The door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD
KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age -
and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of
the type Bateman and his friends might wear.

Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a
self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to
carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at
him curiously, noticing the silence.

BATEMAN
(Realizing that Kimball is staring at him)
Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.

Bateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in
exasperation.

KIMBALL nods understandingly.

BATEMAN
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just
walked in...
(He laughs inanely)
Just joking...
(Pause)
No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John,
right, got it.
(He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in)
Sorry about that.

KIMBALL
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.
(Gesturing toward the phone)
Was that anything important?

BATEMAN
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems.
Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors...
Spreading gossip.

They laugh politely.

KIMBALL
(Holding out his hand)
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL

BATEMAN
(Shaking firmly)
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

KIMBALL
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed
to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well,
you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.

KIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports
Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk.
Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines
into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is
still running.

BATEMAN
(Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed)
So, what's the topic of discussion?

KIMBALL
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate
the disappearance of Paul Owen.

BATEMAN
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?

KIMBALL
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.

BATEMAN
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.

KIMBALL
So it's nothing that official. I just have some
basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-

BATEMAN
Coffee?

KIMBALL
No. I'm okay.

BATEMAN
Perrier? San Pellegrino?

KIMBALL
No, I'm okay.

KIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold
Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes
Jean.

JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick?

BATEMAN
Can you bring Mr...

KIMBALL
KIMBALL.

BATEMAN
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-

KIMBALL
Oh no, I'm okay.

BATEMAN
It's no problem

Bateman watches intently as KIMBALL writes something down
in his notebook, then crosses something out. Jean enters
and places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched
glass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman.
He glares at her. KIMBALL smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves.

BATEMAN
Well, what's the topic of discussion?

KIMBALL
The disappearance of Paul Owen.

BATEMAN
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the
disappearance or anything...
(Trying to laugh)
Not on ""Page Six"" at least.

KIMBALL
I think his family wants this kept quiet.

BATEMAN
Understandable.
(Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino)
Lime?

KIMBALL
No, really. I'm okay.

BATEMAN
You sure? I can always get you a lime.

A pause.

KIMBALL
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own
files, okay?

BATEMAN
Shoot.

KIMBALL
How old are you?

BATEMAN
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.

KIMBALL
(Scribbling in his notebook)
Where did you go to school?

BATEMAN
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

KIMBALL
Your address?

BATEMAN
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American
Gardens Building.

KIMBALL
(Looking up, impressed)
Nice. Very nice.

BATEMAN
(Flattered)
Thanks.

A pause as KIMBALL studies his notebook. Bateman closes his
eyes, as if in pain.

KIMBALL
Pardon me, but are you okay?

BATEMAN
Who do you ask?

KIMBALL
You seem...nervous.

Bateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a
bottle of aspirin.

BATEMAN
Nuprin?

KIMBALL Uh...no, thanks.

Kimball takes out a pack of Marlboro's and lays it on the
desk.

BATEMAN
Bad habit.

KIMBALL
I know. I'm sorry.

A pause, as Bateman stares at the cigarettes.

KIMBALL
Would you rather I not smoke?

BATEMAN
No, I guess it's okay.

KIMBALL
You sure?

BATEMAN
No problem.
(Buzzing Jean)

JEAN (O.S.)
Yes, Patrick?

BATEMAN
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please.
She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.

KIMBALL
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?

BATEMAN
Well...

He coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows
them dry.

KIMBALL
How well did you know him?

BATEMAN
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing,
you know.

KIMBALL
Yale thing?

A pause.

BATEMAN
Yeah...Yale thing.

KIMBALL
What do you mean...Yale thing?

A pause.

BATEMAN
Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet
homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing.

A silence during which the sound of the air conditioner
becomes deafening.

KIMBALL
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul
Owen?

BATEMAN
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He...
ate a balanced diet.

KIMBALL
What kind of man was he? Besides...
(He hesitates tries to smile)
the information you've just given.

BATEMAN
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.

KIMBALL
Do you feel that way?

BATEMAN
No. Not really.

KIMBALL
(As he writes without looking up)
Where did Paul hang out?

BATEMAN
Hang...out?

KIMBALL
Yeah. You know...hang out.

BATEMAN
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine.
Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular
places.

KIMBALL
He had a yacht?

BATEMAN
No, he just hung out there.

KIMBALL
And where did he go to school?

A slight pause.

BATEMAN
Don't you know this?

KIMBALL
I just wanted to know if you know.
BATEMAN
Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's...
Listen, I just...I just want to help.

KIMBALL
I understand.

He makes another note.

KIMBALL
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?

BATEMAN
We were both seven in 1969.

KIMBALL
(Smiles)
So was I.

BATEMAN
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?

KIMBALL
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he
went to London.

BATEMAN
Well, maybe he did, huh?

KIMBALL
His girlfriend doesn't think so.

BATEMAN
But...has anyone seen him in London?

KIMBALL
Actually, yes.

BATEMAN
Hmmm.

KIMBALL
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification.
A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but
I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert
Ainsworth for Paul, so...

BATEMAN
Oh.

KIMBALL
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan
worship?

BATEMAN
What?

KIMBALL
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I
know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't
know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was
recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano
girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-

BATEMAN
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced
diet and-

KIMBALL
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.

A pause - the longest so far.

BATEMAN
Have you consulted a psychic?

KIMBALL
No.

BATEMAN
Had his apartment been burglarized?

KIMBALL
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A
suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.

BATEMAN
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet
or anything, right?

KIMBALL
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But...
basically no one has seen or heard anything.

BATEMAN
That's so typical, isn't it?

KIMBALL
It's just strange.
(He stares out the window, lost in thought)
One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive,
and then...

BATEMAN
Nothing.

KIMBALL
People just...disappear.

BATEMAN
The earth just opens up and swallows people.
(He checks his Rolex)

KIMBALL
Eerie. Really eerie.

Silence.

BATEMAN
(Standing up)
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting
with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.

KIMBALL
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I
mean aren't you going to be late?

BATEMAN
Uh, no. There's one...down here.

KIMBALL
Oh really? I didn't know that.

Bateman leads him to the door.

BATEMAN
Yes. It's very good.

KIMBALL turns to face him.

KIMBALL
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information
at all...

BATEMAN
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.

KIMBALL
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.

Bateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his
eyes and leans against the door, sweating.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

A perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian,
a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect
green grapes, a few berries.

OFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard
from the living room.

The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal
crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw
Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table,
next to a copy of GQ.

LATER:

Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand,
jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing.

BATEMAN
You like that, slut?

The person on the other end clearly hangs up.

CLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone.

BATEMAN
You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar
boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white
cotton T-shirt by
Commes des Garcons.
(He snorts like a pig)
My Rolex cost-

Another hang-up. He dials again.

BATEMAN
(Whipering)
I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do
you think of that?
(Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts)
Huh, bitch?

GIRL (O.S.)
Dad, is that you?

Bateman hangs up, frustrated.

EXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

Bateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside
CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket.
Bateman opens his window to speak to her.

BATEMAN
I haven't seen you around here.

CHRISTIE
You just haven't been looking.

BATEMAN
Would you like to see my apartment?

Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a
tuxedo.

CHRISTIE
(looking away to some dark corner)
I'm not supposed to.

Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now
notices, then takes.

BATEMAN
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?

CHRISTIE
I'm not supposed to.
(She pockets the bill)
But I can make an exception.

BATEMAN
Do you take American Express?

Christie is still looking out behind her.

BATEMAN
Do you take American Express?

Christie looks at him like he's crazy.

BATEMAN
I'm joking. Come on, get in.

As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He
reads off a credit card number.

BATEMAN
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does
couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the
American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really
can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.

He hangs up.

BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that?
You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is
that clear?

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Christie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white
milky bath oil.

BATEMAN
That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.

Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and
Bateman is casually touching her breast.

BATEMAN
I want you to clean your vagina.

Christie reaches for a washcloth.

BATEMAN
No. From behind. Get on your knees.

Christie shrugs.

BATEMAN
I want to watch. You have a very nice body.

The doorman RINGS. Bateman answers.

BATEMAN
Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry
off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and
our guest in the living room for drinks.

Bateman answers the door.

BATEMAN
You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat.
I'm Paul. How good of you to come.

The escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes
her coat and inspects her body and face.

BATEMAN
Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm
going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen.

Bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a
glass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the
couch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a
long silence.

BATEMAN
So, don't you want to know what I do?

The two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles.
Christie shrugs.

CHRISTIE
No.

SABRINA
(Smiling)
No, not really.

Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs.

BATEMAN
Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce & Pierce.
(Long pause)
Have you heard of it?

Another long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands
up and goes over to the CD collection.

CHRISTIE
You have a really nice place here...Paul.
How much did you pay for it?

BATEMAN
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie,
hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.

Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a
pack of cigarettes out of her purse.
Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.

BATEMAN
No, no smoking. Not in here.

He walks over to Christie.

BATEMAN
Varda truffle?

Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head. Sabrina
takes one.

BATEMAN
I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very
fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.

Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection.
He takes one out and examines it.

BATEMAN
Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis
fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before
that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too
artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins'
presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out
another one.

BATEMAN
I think ""Invisible Touch"" is the group's undisputed
masterpiece.

He puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him
into the bedroom.

BATEMAN
It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the
same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding
three albums. Christie, take off the robe.

Bateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to
put it on.

BATEMAN
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks,
Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance
of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.

Bateman starts to undress.

BATEMAN
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer
songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

Sabrina dances awkwardly. Christie sits on the bed.

BATEMAN
Take the lyrics to ""Land of Confusion."" In this
song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political
authority.

Bateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather
menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves.

BATEMAN
""In Too Deep"" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about
monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting.
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything
I've heard in rock.

He turns on the video camera.

BATEMAN
Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your
asshole.

Bateman looks through the viewfinder.

BATEMAN
Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and
therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially
songs like ""In the Air Tonight"" and ""Against
All Odds."" Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.

He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in
the CD.

BATEMAN
But I also think that Phill Collins works better
within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and
I stress the word artist. This is ""Sussudio,"" a great,
great song, a personal favorite.

SEX MONTAGE CUT TO ""Sussudio."" We see this in WIDE SHOT, or
through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA.

CUT TO:

Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina
on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his
wrist. Bateman's eyes open.

BATEMAN
Don't touch the Rolex.

Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire.

He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger,
a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns
around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up
and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger.

BATEMAN
We're not through yet...

CUT TO:

Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They
are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a
deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the
b.g. Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"" is playing.

INT. YALE CLUB – DAY

McDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are
having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and
gives them the finger.

BATEMAN
What an asshole.

McDERMOTT
Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a
fucking drug addict. No self-control.

VAN PATTEN
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do
you think, Bateman?

BATEMAN
I know her. I knew her.

McDERMOTT
Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it
like that?

VAN PATTEN
Because he dated her.

BATEMAN
How did you guess?

VAN PATTEN
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ,
Bateman.

BATEMAN
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy
personality.

McDERMOTT
So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a
babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other
reason.

VAN PATTEN
If they have a good personality, then something
is very wrong.

McDERMOTT
If they have a good personality and they are not
great looking-who fucking cares?

BATEMAN
Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if
they have a good personality?
(He smiles giving up)
I know, I know-

ALL IN UNISON
There are no girls with good personalities!
(They laugh and high-five each other)

VAN PATTEN
A good personality consists of a chick with a
little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without
being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth
shut.

McDERMOTT
Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are
smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even
talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly
chicks.

VAN PATTEN
Absolutely.

McDERMOTT
And this is because they have to make up for how
fucking unattractive they are.

Pause.

BATEMAN
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?

VAN PATTEN
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

BATEMAN
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was
an interesting guy.

McDERMOTT
So what did Ed say?

BATEMAN
He said, ""When I see a pretty girl walking down the
street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her
out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat
her right.""

Pauses, finishes his drink.

McDERMOTT
What does the other part of him think?

BATEMAN
What her head would look like on a stick.

McDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back
at Bateman. Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily
join In.

Luis Carruthers walks up to the table.

CARRUTHERS
(Shyly)
Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.

McDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table.

McDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you
know how we feel about it. Luis laughs good-naturedly.

CARRUTHERS
Yes, I do. No, it's my business card-I decided to
get a new one too.

He pulls out something incredibly tasteful. Everyone
compliments Luis except Bateman. The SOUND DROPS and all we hear
is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously.
Luis plucks it from his hand and walks away, pleased with
himself.

VAN PATTEN
Listen, what about dinner?

BATEMAN
(Suddenly angry)
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? ""What about
fucking dinner?""

McDERMOTT
Ah, cheer up, Bateman.
(Slaps him on the back, massages his neck)
What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning?

BATEMAN
(Watching Luis going into the men's room)
Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.

McDERMOTT
Whoa, hold on there, little buddy.

BATEMAN
Excuse me.

He gets up from the table. As Bateman walks away, Van
Patten grabs a waiter.

VAN PATTEN
Is this tap water? I don't drink tap water Bring
me an Evian or something, okay?

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Bateman pulls on his gloves as he
enters the men's room. Carruthers is standing in a stall with his
back to Bateman. The sound of his urinating is heard until Bateman
approaches, then abruptly stops. Slowly, Bateman brings his hands
up over the collar of Carruthers' cashmere jacket, circling his
neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet. All we can hear
is the sound of Bateman's heavy breathing. Slowly he starts to
squeeze. Almost in slow motion, Carruthers turns around.

Carruthers looks down at Bateman's wrists as if lost in
thought. Then he lowers his head and kisses Bateman's
wrist. He looks back at Bateman with a shy, love-struck
expression, then reaches up and tenderly touches the side
of his face.

CARRUTHERS
God, Patrick. Why here?

He strokes Bateman's hair.

CARRUTHERS
I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your hot body.

Carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but Bateman backs
away. He drops his hands from Carruthers' neck. Carruthers
immediately takes them and places them back. Bateman drops
them again.

CARRUTHERS
Don't be shy.

Bateman takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and tries to lift
his hands again, but abandons the attempt.

CARRUTHERS
You don't know how long I've wanted it. Ever since that Christmas
party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you were wearing that
red-striped paisley Armani tie.

Bateman looks down and sees that Carruthers' pants are
still unzipped. He moves past him out of the stall and
stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he
realizes he still has his gloves on. Carruthers comes up
behind him.

CARRUTHERS
I want you. I want you...too.

Bateman storms out of the men's room, bumping into a waiter
and several customers and cursing. Noticing the maitre d'
and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely,
Bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at
them. Carruthers walks up behind him.

BATEMAN
(Hissing)
What...is...it?

CARRUTHERS
Where are you going?

BATEMAN
(Stumbling away from him)
I've gotta...I've
gotta...return some videotapes.

CARRUTHERS
Patrick?

BATEMAN
What?
CARRUTHERS
(Silently mouthing the words)
I'll call you.

Bateman storms out of the restaurant.

INT. COURTNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex.
Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels
something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy,
a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence.

COURTNEY
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?

BATEMAN
Maybe.

Courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her
nightstand, swallowing several. Bateman gets up and begins
to dress, admiring himself in the mirror. Courtney watches
the TV at low volume.

COURTNEY
What are you doing tonight?

BATEMAN
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

COURTNEY
That's nice.

BATEMAN
You and...Luis?

COURTNEY
(Lighting a cigarette)
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and
Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...

BATEMAN
I never knew you smoked.

COURTNEY
(Smiling sadly)
You never noticed.

Bateman is making final adjustments to his tie.

COURTNEY
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?

BATEMAN
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're
going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.

COURTNEY
(Sarcastically)
Isn't that special?
(A pause)
Patrick?

BATEMAN
Yes, Courtney?

C0URTNEY
If I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay?

BATEMAN
(Flatly)
You too.

Courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its
head. Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door.

COURTNEY
Patrick?

BATEMAN
Yes?

COURTNEY
Nothing.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

A big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop
kids, visitors from Jersey, downtown art people, yuppies.

I Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and
tries to attract the bartender's attention. He is wearing a
suit and his tie is loosened. Kimball approaches him.

KIMBALL
Mr. Bateman?

Bateman gasps and recovers.

BATEMAN
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell?
KIMBALL
Kimball.
(Extending his hand)
Call me Don.

BATEMAN
Don.

KIMBALL
So...you hang out here a lot?

BATEMAN
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You
know.

Pause.

BATEMAN
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone
in for ""formal questioning?"" (He makes quotation marks
in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh)

KIMBALL
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?

BATEMAN
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.

KIMBALL
(Looking at his glass)
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much
more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting,
don't you think?

Bateman is nodding nervously, idiotically.

KIMBALL
Some people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli?

Bateman shakes his head.

KIMBALL
I mean they want to get caught.

BATEMAN
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need
anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean
Owen was a...complex man.

Bateman wanders away.

He looks back uneasily at KIMBALL, who is watching him from
the bar. A GUY WITH DREADLOCKS walks by.

BATEMAN
(Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man!

The man stares at him.

BATEMAN
I mean-Mon. We be jammin'...

The man walks by, shaking his head.

Bateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a
more familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in
black designer dresses. Across the room he spots McDermott
and Price sitting with three models, all wearing black
mini-dresses. Price and McDermott are having a whispered
argument.

PRICE
I have to talk to these girls? They're models.

McDERMOTT
Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder.
You went last time. Stay here.

McDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears.
Bateman looks at the models. DAISY and CARON are staring
into space, smoking. LIBBY is trying to work out how to
unfold her napkin. Price signals to Bateman for help.

PRICE
(Clapping his hands together)
Let's have a conversation. So...it was hot out today, no?

Silence.

LIBBY
Where did Craig go?

PRICE
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to
sign a peace treaty with him between the United States
and Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know.

LIBBY
Well...yeah. But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions.

PRICE
You're not confused, are you?

LIBBY
No, not really.

CARON
Gorbachev's not downstairs.

DAISY
(Smiling)
Are you Iying?

PRICE
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's
at Tunnel.

BATEMAN
(To Daisy)
Ask me a question.

DAISY
So, what do you do?

BATEMAN
What do you think I do?

DAISY
A model? An actor?

BATEMAN
No. Flattering, but no.

DAISY
Well...

BATEMAN
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.

DAISY (Unfazed)
Do you like it?

BATEMAN
Welt...it depends, why?

DAISY
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and
acquisitions don't really like it.

Silence.

BATEMAN
So, where do you work out?

MUCH LATER IN THE EVENING:

The club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a
balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him
in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over
the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman
is reaching for him.

PRICE
(Shouting)
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.

BATEMAN
Leaving what?

PRICE
This.

Bateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his
drink.

BATEMAN
Don't, I'll drink it.

PRICE
(Screaming)
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.

BATEMAN
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?

PRICE
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!

BATEMAN
Don't tell me...merchant banking?

PRICE
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm
disappearing.

BATEMAN
(laughing)
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?

Price looks away.

McDermott and Daisy walk up to them.

McDERMOTT
Hey-don't worry, be happy.

Price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is
shouting something that can't be heard, then

PRICE
Goodbye! Fuckheads!

He climbs over the railing.

DAISY What is he doing?

BATEMAN
Price! Come back!

Price leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment
then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd.

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT
Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab.

DAISY
My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays
in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand
what I was doing with a yuppie.

BATEMAN
Oh really?
DAISY
He said...
(She laughs)
He said you gave him bad vibes.

BATEMAN
That's...that's too bad.

DAISY
You think I'm dumb, don't you?

BATEMAN
What?

DAISY
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.

BATEMAN
(insincerely) No. I really don't.

DAISY
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.

She takes his hand as they get into a cab.

INT. DAISY'S HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

Bateman leaves Daisy's apartment carrying a suitcase. He pauses
in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the
case.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

Bateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York
Times crossword puzzle at dusk.

Jean knocks gently on the half-open door and walks in with
a folder in her hand. Bateman ignores her.

JEAN
Doin' the crossword?

Bateman nods without looking up.

JEAN
Need help?

BATEMAN doesn't respond. We see that every space on the
puzzle has been filled in with the words MEAT or BONE. Jean
drops the folder on his desk and then walks out.

BATEMAN
Jean?

JEAN
(Re-enters office)
Yes, Patrick?

BATEMAN
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?

He erases one of the M's on the crossword puzzle.

BATEMAN
That is...if you're not doing anything.

JEAN
Oh no. I have no plans.

BATEMAN
(Lowering his Wayfarers)
Well, isn't this a coincidence.

A pause.

BATEMAN
Listen, where should we go?

He leans back and pulls a Zagat's from the desk drawer.

JEAN
Anywhere you want?

BATEMAN
Let's not think about what I want. How about
anywhere you want.

JEAN
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.

BATEMAN
No, come on. Anywhere you want.

JEAN
Oh, I can't.
(Sighs)
I don't know.

BATEMAN
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want.
Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

A long pause.

JEAN
What about...Dorsia?

Bateman stops looking through the Zagat's guide and smiles
at her.

BATEMAN
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...

JEAN
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.

BATEMAN
Dorsia is...fine.

He dials the number.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia, yes?

BATEMAN
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at
nine o'clock?

He checks his Rolex and winks at Jean.

MAITRE D'
We are totally booked.

BATEMAN
Oh really? That's great.

MAITRE D'
I said we are totally booked.

BATEMAN
Two at nine? Perfect.

MAITRE D'
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is
also totally booked.

BATEMAN
See you then.

He hangs up the phone. He walks over to the coat rack. He
glances over at Jean, who is still standing in front of the
desk, confused.

BATEMAN
Yes? You're dressed...okay.

JEAN
You didn't give them a name.

BATEMAN
They know me.

Pause.

BATEMAN
Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock
for drinks, okay?

She turns to leave.

BATEMAN
And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

Jean stands by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out.

JEAN
Patrick, it's so...elegant. What a wonderful view.

Bateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady
visible.

BATEMAN
Jean? Sorbet?

JEAN
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

Bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in
his hand and hands her the sorbet.

Jean is eating the sorbet.

JEAN
Want a bite?

BATEMAN
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

JEAN
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right?
You look great. Very fit.

BATEMAN
(Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness)
You can always he thinner. Look...better.

JEAN
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't
want to ruin your willpower.

BATEMAN
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling
it anyway.

Silence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up
his knife drawer, looking at the knives.

BATEMAN
So listen, what do you really want to do with your
life?

Pause.

BATEMAN
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children,
okay?

JEAN
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school,
but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life
where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so...
I don't know...unsure.

Bateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge
of the blade.

BATEMAN
Do you have a boyfriend?

JEAN
No, not really.

BATEMAN
Interesting.

JEAN
(Shyly)
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?

BATEMAN
Maybe. I don't know Not really.
Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very
Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly
ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape,
twine and a nail gun.

BATEMAN
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?

JEAN
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused
on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about
changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.

BATEMAN
Growing. I'm glad you said that.

Bateman picks up the duct tape.

BATEMAN
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie,
was named Lassie? Had you heard this?

JEAN
Who's Ted Bundy?

BATEMAN
Forget it.

JEAN
What's that?

BATEMAN
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for...
taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the
nail gun.

JEAN
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?

Jean puts her spoon down on the table.

BATEMAN
(Looking up from loading nails into the gun)
What...No! Put it in the carton.

JEAN
Sorry.
(She puts the spoon in the carton)

BATEMAN
Jean? What?

JEAN
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?

From behind, we follow Bateman as he walks across the room and
stands behind the couch.

BATEMAN
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just
want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.

JEAN
Hmmmm.

He points the nail gun at the back of Jean's head.
The phone RINGS. Startled, Bateman hides the nail gun
behind his back. The answering machine picks up. As Bateman
listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch.
He sits down opposite Jean, enjoying her discomfort as she
listens to the message.

EVELYN
Patrick I know you're there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy.
What are you up to tonight? It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope
you're not out with some little number you picked up because
you're my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never
called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for
Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with
Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar,
auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell
Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps!
You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye.

Silence. Jean is obviously embarrassed and upset.

JEAN
Was that...Evelyn?

Silence.

JEAN
Are you still seeing her?

Silence.

JEAN
I'm sorry, I have no right to ask that.

Silence.

JEAN
Do you want me to go?

A long pause.

BATEMAN
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.

JEAN
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get
involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you
want me to go?

Another long pause.

BATEMAN
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I
think I might hurt you.
(Almost hopefully)
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

JEAN
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised.
You're right, I should go.

She gets up to leave.

JEAN
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with
Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.

BATEMAN
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.

He sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Bateman enters P&P, walks up the corridor and pauses outside
the door to his office. He sees KIMBALL in conversation with
Jean, and Jean looking through her date book. He watches for
a moment, frozen with anxiety. He then bursts in, shutting
the door behind him.

BATEMAN
Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come
into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?

Jean looks flustered.

Kimball follows Bateman into his office.

KIMBALL
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's
taken a leave of absence.

BATEMAN
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.
(Hopefully)
Is he a suspect?

KIMBALL
Not really.

A pause.

KIMBALL
Do you remember where you were on the night of
Paul's disappearance?
(He checks his notebook)
Which was on the twentieth of December?

BATEMAN
God...I guess...I was probably returning
videotapes.

He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his
diary.

BATEMAN
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

KIMBALL
Wait. That's not what I've got.

BATEMAN
What?

KIMBALL
That's not the information I've received.

BATEMAN
Well...I...Wait...What information have
you received?

KIMBALL
Let's see...
(He flips through his notebook)
That you were with-

BATEMAN
Well, I could he wrong.

KIMBALL
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?

BATEMAN
(Clearly nervous and under pressure)
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It
was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner
at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I
physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't
remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.

Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens
his briefcase to put away his notebook.

KIMBALL
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.

BATEMAN
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long
day-a bit scattered.

KIMBALL
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch
in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?

BATEMAN
Great, yes, I'd like that.

KIMBALL
And if you could try and pin down where you were
the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a
lot easier.

BATEMAN
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

Kimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a
new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up.

KIMBALL
Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I
just bought it on my way here.

Bateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified.

BATEMAN
Never. I mean...I don't really like...
singers.

KIMBALL
Not a big music fan, eh?

BATEMAN
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too...
black sounding. For me.

KIMBALL
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll
call your secretary about reservations.

BATEMAN
I'll be there.

EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before.
The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a
half-opened window.

CHRISTIE
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after
last time...

BATEMAN
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.

CHRISTIE
I don't think so.

He hands her a $500 bill.

BATEMAN
Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute.

The driver's here, you'll be safe.

Christie gets in hesitantly.

BATEMAN
Nothing like last time, promise.

CHRISTIE
Alright.

He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it.

BATEMAN
(Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party)
So, you're looking great, how have you been?

CHRISTIE
(A little confused)
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.

BATEMAN
(Mock shock)
Really?

CHRISTIE
My friend told me I should maybe even get a
lawyer.

BATEMAN
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.

He writes her a check for $I ,000 to cash and hands it to
her. She snatches the check out of his hand and gets
quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street.

BATEMAN
Bitch.

He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge
wad of cash at her. She hesitates; he uses the money to
lure her into the car. As she reluctantly gets into the
limo, she reaches for the money.

He snatches it away.

BATEMAN
Uh uh uh. Half now, half later.

She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt.

BATEMAN
Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine,
Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly.
You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything
about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?

Christie nods.

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The living room: ELIZABETH has kicked off her shoes and flopped
down on the couch underneath the Baselitz. Elizabeth is an
attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally.
Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to
examine a CD.

ELIZABETH
You look really familiar. Did you you go to Dalton?

Christie shakes her head.

The kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and
putting them in a bottle of wine. In the living room, Elizabeth
is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars.

ELIZABETH
I think I met you at Au Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey?

Christie looks blank.

ELIZABETH
Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar.

Christie still blank.

ELIZABETH
You know, Au Bar?

Christie shakes her head.

ELIZABETH
Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible. I went to a birth
day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God, please.

Bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses.
Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at
the floor. There is an awkward silence.

CHRISTIE
This is nicer than your other apartment.

BATEMAN
(Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment)
It's not that nice.

Silence.

CHRISTIE
Where did you two meet?

ELIZABETH
Oh God! I met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no,
'87, and...
(Turning to Patrick)
You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole.
(Sarcastically)
Hot number.

BATEMAN
What do you mean, she was a hot number.

ELIZABETH
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.
(To Christie)
Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need
I say more?...What do you do?

A long silence. Christie reddens and stares at the floor.

BATEMAN
She's my...cousin.

ELIZABETH
(Skeptically)
Uh huh?

BATEMAN
She's from...France.

A pause. Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously.

ELIZABETH
Where's your phone? I've got to call Harley.

Bateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares
At Christie while she waits for someone to answer.

ELIZABETH
Where do you summer? Southampton?

Christie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth.

CHRISTIE
No.

ELIZABETH
(Listening to the receiver)
Oh God, it's his machine.

BATEMAN
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.

ELIZABETH
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.

BATEMAN
Don't tell him you're here.

ELIZABETH
Why would I?

Bateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the
whole glass, making a face.

ELIZABETH
This tastes weird.
(She examines the label and shrugs)
Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway
you'd like. I'm at-

BATEMAN
(Whispering)
You're at Paul Owen s.

ELIZABETH
Who?

BATEMAN
(Whispering)
Paul Owen.

ELIZABETH
I want the number, idiot.
(She waves him away and continues into the reciever)
Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I
don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my
hairdresser on you.

She hangs up.

ELIZABETH
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce
& Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?

BATEMAN
No.

ELIZABETH
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.

Bateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her
another glass of the drugged wine.

BATEMAN
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on.
What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.

ELIZABETH
(Laughing)
Patrick, you re a lunatic.

BATEMAN
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?

ELIZABETH
Let's not get lewd.
(Flirty)
I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.

BATEMAN
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.

ELIZABETH
(To Christie)
Does he do this all the time?

Christie shrugs.

BATEMAN
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.

Christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip.

BATEMAN
(To Elizabeth)
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?

ELIZABETH
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?

BATEMAN
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

ELIZABETH
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me
feel weird.

LATER:

Elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making
out with Christie. Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston CD,
showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover.

BATEMAN
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP
called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles
on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps
across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's
mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album
on a first listening.

ELIZABETH
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You
actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

She giggles, rolling off the sofa onto the floor.

BATEMAN
(Ignoring her)
It's hard to choose a favorite track
among so many great ones, but ""The Greatest Love of All""
is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about
self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message
crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope
that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder.
Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in
to empathize with others, we can always empathize with
ourselves.

As he speaks, he opens the case and carefully places the CD
in the player, admiring its pristine silver surface, and
watches it slide into the machine.

BATEMAN
It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's
beautifully stated on the album.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER

AN OUT-OF-FOCUS HOME VIDEO SHOT of Elizabeth, Christie and
Bateman in the throes of sex, in the master bedroom.

CUT BACK TO WIDE SHOT of the bedroom, partially blocked by
the video camera in the foreground. Their bodies are an
incoherent tangle of arms and legs. The only sounds are
moans, heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against
flesh. CLOSE ON Christie's head and shoulders. Her eyes are
shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional
performance, turning her head every so often to check the
progress of her partners.

OFFSCREEN WE HEAR Elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure,
moaning loudly. Her voice gets louder and louder and then
shifts to actual pain.

Bateman rises up off the bed, suddenly appearing behind
Christie. There is blood on his face.

Christie turns her head and sees him. She screams and leaps
off the bed, running out of the room. She slams the
mirrored door behind her, and as it swings shut for a split
second we see Elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed.

We follow Christie out of the room, panicking, screaming.

Christie runs down a darkened hallway, frantically opening
doors, looking for an escape.

She hears the SOUND OF A CHAINSAW coming from the bedroom.

She opens a closet. The closet lights up as she opens the
door and sees two dead, women hanging inside. She screams,
then claps a hand over her mouth. She stops and listens. THE
DISTANT SOUND OF THE CHAINSAW.

She backs away slowly, into another dark room, lit only by
the light from a television set. Through the darkness she
sees a head on the top of the TV and starts to whimper.

She runs toward the nearest door. Finding herself in the
main hallway, she begins to jog toward the front door, then
runs.

Bateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw,
spattered with blood.

Christie screams and changes direction. Bateman leaps at
her, bellowing.

They run through the bedroom and into the bathroom.
Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the
bathtub.

Both are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood.

Christie falls, tries to get up. Bateman grabs her leg. He
tries to bite it.

She kicks him in the face and gets up, running toward the
front door.

He runs after her.

BATEMAN
Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you
piece of bitch trash!

Christie, screaming, makes it out the front door.

Bateman runs after her.

She runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors.

She moves to the elevator, pounding hysterically on the
buttons. She sees the stairwell and runs for it.

Bateman sees this and runs after her, revving the chainsaw.

She runs down the stairs, Bateman two flights behind her.
He stops, leans over the railing to look at her, then aims
the chainsaw at her and drops it.

Christie SCREAMS OFFSCREEN, then is suddenly silent.

FROM BATEMAN'S POV we see Christie's body sprawled facedown
at the bottom of the stairwell. The chainsaw sticks out of
her back like a sword.

INT. CRAYONS - EARLY EVENING

An insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif: paper
tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing, lots of primary
colors, and a goldfish bowl on each table.

Bateman is at a table with Evelyn. They are both drawing on
the tablecloth. Bateman is drawing Christie with the
chainsaw in her back.

EVELYN
I want a firm commitment.

BATEMAN
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.

Evelyn waves to a couple across the room.

EVELYN
(Distracted)
Why? What's wrong?

BATEMAN
(Speaking very carefully, measuring each word)
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale
cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill
my needs.

The woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a
new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly.

BATEMAN
We need to talk.

EVELYN
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk
about?

BATEMAN
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over

EVELYN
(Motioning to the waiter for water)
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just
avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?

BATEMAN
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This
is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.

EVELYN
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your
friends. I don't think it would work.
(Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin)
You have a little something on your upper lip.

BATEMAN
(Brushing her hand away)
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about
that. You can have them.

Evelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a
realization dawning.

EVELYN
You're really serious, aren't you?

BATEMAN
Yes, I am.

EVELYN
But what about the past? Our past?

BATEMAN
We never really shared one.

EVELYN
You're inhuman.

BATEMAN
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.
(He pauses, as if searching for the right words)
You're just not terribly important to me.

Evelyn begins to cry.

EVELYN
No, no, no.

BATEMAN
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.

She reaches desperately across the table and takes his
hand. Bateman pulls his hand away.

EVELYN
(Sobbing)
What do you want me to do, what is it you want?

The occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is
becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed.

BATEMAN
(Looking uncomfortably around the room)
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making
this scene right now.

EVELYN
Oh God, I can't believe this.

BATEMAN
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.

Evelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the
tears so they will not affect her make-up.

EVELYN
(Surprisingly calm)
Where are you going?

BATEMAN
I'm just leaving.

EVELYN
But where?

BATEMAN
I have to return some videotapes.

He rushes out of the room.

EXT. TRIBECA STREET - EVENING

Bateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat.

BATEMAN
Here kitty, kitty.

The small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and
walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in
the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT.
Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the
deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He
takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the
kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him.

WOMAN
Oh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?

Bateman wheels around and shoots her. She falls screaming
to the floor.

Responding to the gunshot, A POLICE CAR SIREN WAILS in the
distance. Bateman breaks into a run. The police car
screeches after him.

COP CAR (O.S.)
HALT STOP. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.

Bateman ducks down an alley.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

A COP rushes toward him, seemingly from
out of nowhere, and tackles him, trying to get the gun away
from him.

Bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of
them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again. He
reloads the gun. The sound of more COP CARS arriving.

He runs out of the alley.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

As he reaches the street, he finds A PHALANX OF POLICE CARS
approaching.

COP CAR
Halt. Put down your weapon.

The cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air.
Bateman shoots at them. The police return fire.

Bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues
shooting wildly. A bullet hits the gas tank of one of the
police cars. It catches fire and explodes. The flames light
up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living
and dead.

NEW ANGLE: Bateman flees from the scene. The camera follows
him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each
one, setting off a cacophony of CAR ALARMS.
THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS draws near.

NEW ANGLE: He runs, panting, until he ends up in front of a
tail, brilliantly lit office building. As he approaches,
the lights in the building are going off floor by floor.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

He rushes into the lobby, running for the elevator.

NIGHT WATCHMAN
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? You
forgot to sign in.

Bateman wheels around and shoots him. He runs toward the
revolving doors. As he swings around in the doors, he
notices a JANITOR who has witnessed the shooting. He
revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor.

NEW ANGLE:

He runs out of the building and across the
street to an identical office building, the one that houses
Pierce & Pierce.

INT. PIERCE & PIERCE LOBBY - NIGHT

Bateman nods at the Pierce & Pierce NIGHT WATCHMAN and signs
in. He breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close
behind him.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Bateman stands looking out
through the floor-length windows at a panoramic night view
of the city and the river.

Below him he sees a SWAT TEAM swarming over the roof of the
opposite building. There are ambulances standing by, flares
everywhere, distant sirens.

Suddenly, THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER draws near. Frightened,
he drops to the floor behind his desk.

Helicopter searchlights scan the building, illuminating
Bateman's office for a few moments with a blaze of light.

He is crouched in one corner, half-sobbing, talking into
the phone, as the searchlight keeps circling.

BATEMAN
Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my
lawyer so I think you should know-I've killed a lot of
people. Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some
homeless people, maybe five or ten, an NYU girl I met in
Central Park. I left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin'
Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail
gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I
killed another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost
got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, I
can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed
Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything
out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes
of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even...
well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little.
Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not
sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess
I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show
up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open.

Bateman hangs up the phone. The helicopter searchlight
circles back, briefly illuminating the room. The camera rises
up over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the
sky.

INT. SMITH AND WOLLENSKY RESTAURANT - DAY

KIMBALL and Bateman are sitting at a corner table.

KIMBALL
(Very surprised)
No hash browns?

BATEMAN
Not in the mood, I guess.

KIMBALL
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I
mean- it's-have you been here before?

BATEMAN
(Deliberately nonchalant)
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not...
ordering them.

KIMBALL
(Looking at him like he's nuts)
Suit yourself, I guess.

Pause.

KIMBALL
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on
what you did?

BATEMAN
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some
sorbet?

KIMBALL
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.

BATEMAN
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?

KIMBALL
According to his date book, and this was verified by his
secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.

BATEMAN
And?

KIMBALL
I've questioned him.

BATEMAN
Marcus?

KIMBALL
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't
be sure.

BATEMAN
But Marcus denied it?

KIMBALL
Yes.

BATEMAN
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?

KIMBALL
Yes.

A pause.

BATEMAN
He does? You're sure?

KIMBALL
(smiling)
I checked it out. It's clean.

BATEMAN
Oh.
KIMBALL Now where were you?
(He laughs)

BATEMAN
(Laughing with him)
Where was Marcus?

KIMBALL
He wasn't with Paul
Owen.

BATEMAN
So who was he with?

KIMBALL
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,
Harry Newman, George Butner and –
(He pauses, Then looks up)
- you.

A moment of stunned silence.

BATEMAN
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen
to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner
with Victoria...the following night.

KIMBALL
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for
a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking.
Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or
later.
(A pause)
I mean, to think that one of his friends
killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too
ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?

McDermott stops by the table.

McDERMOTT
KIMBALL! How's the investigation?
Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says.
(Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back)
Bateman, what's wrong with ,you?

Bateman looks at him in silence,
panicking.

McDERMOTT
You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky
without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a
raving maniac. Been at Pierce & Pierce too long.
(He wanders off muttering)
No fucking hash browns...

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Bateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He
has a surgical mask in one hand.

DOORMAN
What can I do for you, sir?

BATEMAN
20B.

DOORMAN
Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.

BATEMAN
Mrs. Wolfe?

DOORMAN
The real estate agent? You do have an appointment,
don't you?

Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down
the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly
painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English
country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There
are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands
admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman
wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops
at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He
opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs.
Wolfe approaches, smiling.

MRS. WOLFE
Are you my two o'clock?

BATEMAN
No.

Mrs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the
surgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes.

MRS. WOLFE
Can I help you?

BATEMAN
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.

She stares at him impassively.

BATEMAN
Doesn't he live here?

MRS. WOLFE
No, he doesn't.

BATEMAN
Are you sure?

MRS. WOLFE
You saw the ad in the Times?

BATEMAN
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But...
doesn't Paul Owen still live here?

MRS. WOLFE
There was no ad in the Times.

Bateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other.

MRS. WOLFE
I think you should go now.

BATEMAN
But I think...I want to know what happened
here.

MRS. WOLFE
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.

Bateman backs away slowly.

MRS. WOLFE
Don't come back.

BATEMAN
I won't...don't worry.

Mrs. Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall,
rattled, and gets into the elevator.

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Bateman enters the revolving
door of an office building, panicking and breathing
heavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks
deranged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes
out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY
just like him.

GUY
Hey, Kinsley.

Bateman looks up at him wild-eyed.

GUY
See you at Fluties, okay?

The guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down
the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage
cans, etc.

EXT. MIDTOWN PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Bateman searches his pockets
for pills. He finds three different pills and swallows
them. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his
face, dialing a number.

JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick Bateman's office.

BATEMAN
Jean? Hello? Jean?

JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick? Is that you?

BATEMAN
Hello? Jean, I need help!

JEAN (O.S.)
Where are you?

BATEMAN
Jean-I'm not-

JEAN (O.S.)
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and
David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.

BATEMAN
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?

JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick? I can't hear you.

BATEMAN
What are I doing?

JEAN (O.S.)
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?

BATEMAN
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.

Pause.

BATEMAN
...to the office this afternoon.

JEAN (O.S.)
Why?

BATEMAN
(Screaming)
Just...say...no!

JEAN (O.S.)
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?

BATEMAN
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!

He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck
into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his
jacket.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAY

Jean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens
his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it.

INT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENING

Bateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the
previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking
and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down,
still breathing heavily.

Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations.

McDERMOTT
Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough
day at the office?

They all laugh.

McDERMOTT
Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking
Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't
get a reservation to save his life.

Bateman sits down silently.

McDERMOTT
Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them.

BATEMAN
(On automatic)
I'm not going anywhere unless we
have a reservation.

VAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on,
faggots-just get a res.

PRICE
Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders.

Bateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses.

BATEMAN
(He downs his drink)
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back.
He approaches Carnes cautiously.

CARNES
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the
end of the '90s.

Bateman approaches, trying to act casual.

BATEMAN
Shut up, Carnes, they will not.

Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused.

BATEMAN
So, Harold, did you get my message?

Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs.

CARNES
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you,
wasn't it?

BATEMAN
(Waving smoke out of his face)
Yes, naturally.

CARNES
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s
fabulous. That's rich...

Pause

CARNES
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?

BATEMAN
What exactly do you mean?

CARNES
The message you left.

Carnes is distracted, waving at people.

CARNES
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still
seeing her, right?

BATEMAN
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?

Carnes isn't really listening.

CARNES
Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?

He turns to go.

BATEMAN
Carnes? Wait.

CARNES
(Sighing)
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing.
But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork,
such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully
appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said
Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's
have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.

BATEMAN
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?

CARNES
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let
alone...what was it you said he did to her?

Carnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing
couple. He laughs politely.

CARNES
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...

BATEMAN
(Desperate, shouting)
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really
comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes.
I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off.
I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your
machine was true.

CARNES
Excuse me. I really must he going.

BATEMAN
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm
Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time!
Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.

Carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance.

BATEMAN
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed
Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer

CARNES
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find
this funny anymore.

BATEMAN
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?

CARNES
(Eyeing Bateman worriedly)
It's just not.

BATEMAN
Why not, you stupid bastard?

Carnes stares at him.

CARNES
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in
London...just ten days ago.

BATEMAN
No, you...didn't?

CARNES
Now, if you'll excuse me.

Bateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze.
They are all looking at the television, where Ronald
Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are
halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's
lying.

PRICE
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?

VAN PATTEN
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at?
I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have
reservations somewhere.

PRICE
(To Bateman)
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so...
out of it. So...undangerous.

McDERMOTT
He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless.
Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that
shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know,
what can I say?

PRICE
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that
way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so
fucking, I don't know, cool about it?

VAN PATTEN
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

Bateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look.

PRICE
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?

BATEMAN
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'.
VAN PATTEN
(To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal.
Working for UNICEF now?

McDERMOTT
Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water?

PRICE
Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless
Old codger. But inside...

Pause.

PRICE
But inside...

The SOUNDS OF THE BAR FADE AWAY and we hear Bateman's thoughts:

BATEMAN (V.O.)
But inside doesn't matter...

THE SOUNDS OF THE BAR RETURN.

McDERMOTT
(Bored)
Inside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually
listening to you.

PRICE
Bateman? Come on, what do you think?

Bateman looks up and smiles at Price. Then shrugs.

BATEMAN
Whatever.

The conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone.

VAN PATTEN
Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers? I need a Scotch.

The sounds of the bar fade down. The following voiceover runs
over images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking
on portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of
other very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking
on portable phones, talking, laughing,

BATEMAN (V.O.)
There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with
the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil,
all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward
it, I have now surpassed...

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Jean is alone in Bateman's office, looking through his diary.
We see the pages that she is looking at. They are filled with
doodles of mutilated women and their names...Jean looks lost
and frightened, and begins to cry.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better
world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on
others. I want no escape.

INT. HARRY'S BAR - EARLY EVENING
As the film ends the camera moves CLOSE on Bateman. He is
leaning back in his leather armchair, drinking a double Scotch,
his eyes blank.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no
deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted
from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any
of this. This confession has meant nothing...

The camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him:
""THIS IS NOT AN EXIT.""

427,427,I Live By The Groove,"Hey

Everybody loves to feel the beat
From Malibu to 42nd Street

I like to groove
No matter where I am
From Detroit City down to Alabam

It has moved me heart and soul
So I do believe
It's a whole philosophy to me

I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can hear it, baby
I can't lose

A good groove will
Turn your head around
Lifts you up
When you're feeling down

Get your body moving into gear
That's why the world's
Been turning all these years

It ain't written
In the statute books
It can't be learned in school
It's the law, baby
It's the golden rule

I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can hear it, baby
I can't lose

All right

It ain't written
In the statute books
It can't be learned in school
It's the law, baby
It's the golden rule

I live by the groove
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
I live by the groove

Hey, hey, hey, hey

I live by the groove
If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move

I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can hear it, baby
I can't lose

I live by the groove
I live by the groove

I live by the groove
I live by the groove

I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move

Said I live by the groove
I live by, live by
Live by, live by the groove

If I can't hear it
I can't move

Highschool sweethearts, love was so brand new
We took the vows of man and wife
Forever, for life
I remember how we made our way
A little patience, the time we pray

Can't imagine that this love is through
Feelin' the pain, girl when you lose
Ot it's too hot, too hot, lady
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot, too hot, lady
We gotta cool this anger
What a mess we made
So long ago you were my love

Oh my love

Flyin' high we never took the time
To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me
I remember love's fever
In our hearts, girl and in our minds

Feeling the pain

Oh it's too hot, too hot, lady
Gotta run for shelter

430,430,Lullaby,"[Intro]
I spy
Something beginning with 'S'

[Verse 1]
On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

[Verse 2]
Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

[Bridge]
And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the Spiderman is always hungry

I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
You've built a love, but that love falls apart
Your little piece of Heaven turns too dark

[Chorus]
Listen to your heart, when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away, and nothing is what is seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams

[Chorus]
Listen to your heart, when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And there are voices that want to be heard
So much to mention but you can't find the words
The scent of magic, the beauty that's been
When love was wilder than the wind

[Chorus]
Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before, uhh
Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

You say I know it's a waste of time
There's no use trying
So scared that life's gonna pass you by
Your spirit dying
Not long ago
I could feel your strength
And your devotion
What was so clear is now overcast
With mixed emotions
Deep in your heart is the answer
Find it
I know it will pull you through

[Chorus]
Get on your feet
Get up and make it happen
Get on your feet
Stand up and take some action

[Verse 2]
I think it's true that we've all been through
Some nasty weather
Let's understand that we're here to
Handle things together
You gotta keep looking onto tomorrow
There's so much in life
That's meant for you

[Chorus]
Get on your feet
Get up and make it happen
Get on your feet
Stand up and take some action
Get on your feet
Don't stop before it's over
Get on your feet
The weight is off your shoulder
Get up and make it happen
Stand up, stand up, stand up
And take some action
Gotta get on your feet, yeah, yeah
Don't stop before it's over

[Dice sounds]
Uh, yeah
Uhh, here's another one, and another one
Yeah
Lil' Kim, the Queen Bee

[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
It's ladies night, what
It must be Angie on the mic
The Butter P honey got the sugar, got the spice
Roll the L's tight, keep the rhymes right
Yo, I just made this motherfucker up last night
And uhh... I'm the rookie on this all-star team
Me and Kim is gettin' cream, like Thelma and Louise, but on chrome
Never leave that Brooklyn shit alone
So if you say it's on, then it's on

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Bang this in your whips
Pack em call the roadie with the chips in the wrists
Here's a French kiss
I dismissed all you chicks
Split six from the four-fifth
Make you dance, ow
I stay focused, in the dopest
Like a penny with a hole in it, y'all just hopeless
And toke this, I ain't lyin'
Niggas trying to knock me off, keep tryin'
All it takes is one phone call to my street team
Promote that ass, like a soundtrack New Jack Ci-tay
Set It Off with the eight-fitay
Y'all missin' the buck, with the fuck
Bump Biggie in the trunk and the buck to my thorough bitches
Lemme see ya do the Bankhead if ya richest
It's the rap Mae West, the Q-B
And I got all my sisters with me

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Oh this is ladies night, and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
Oh this is ladies night, and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Uhh, never the one, packin' a gun
Got some other raw chicks for that, lay dat ass flat
I be the one chokin' ya paragraphs, with laughs
Getcha back up on the right path
Ain't no stoppin' me ladies from club hoppin' gets my rock on
From flavors still frozen at Paradise joint
Booty shakin' with the glass in my left one
Right-hand sayin' step-son
To me my girls is fancy fly bitches
To my niggas straight snitches and to them other chicos
Lady pimp ain't havin' that shit
If you ain't got the cash to stash, suck my dick hoes
Strictly a bell ringer
Lay another finger on this big bad wolf miss lady rap singer
I be the one to blame as the flames keep risin'
To the top and it don't stop

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Oh this is ladies night, and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
Oh this is ladies night, and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)

[Verse 4: Da Brat]
Y'all see, how these bogus niggas
Try not to notice the dopest bitches
Approachin' with good intentions
But focusin' on they riches
If it's, too hot then get the fuck up out the kitchen
Niggas dicks, stay lifted when they thinkin' of me
Cause the rhythm I kick, puzzle 'em like arithe-ma-tic
Fillin em with, sluggers off the nine milli luger clip
Bitches bust, we just, keep kickin' up dust
And you can spread rumors
Shit is makin' me sicker than head tumors
Humor me, by huggin' me sayin' you lovin' me
Bet ya phony niggas be buggin', I can tell
Cause the thug in me wanna sell drugs and push keys
Need to get me mo' of deez, VV's and M3's
Smoke weed from overseas pimped out styled Rol-eys
Fuck the police keep my wallet obese
Who the Windy City woman still still comin' and gunnin'
Straight from the Chi?
Tonight's the night for all the ladies, let's get high

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Oh this is ladies night, and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
Oh this is ladies night, and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)

[Interlude: Missy Elliott]
Ayo Kim, heh heh, yaknowhatI'msayin?
I ain't even gon' leave without sayin' sun'un on this track
You ain't gonna use me to just be singin' hooks
What I look like?
Patti LaBelle or somebody, nigga? Heh heh
Check it out, uh huh, yeah

[Verse 5: Missy Elliott]
Oh what a night
You should be like Missy 'stead of bein like Mike
I like to ride ponies instead of ridin' bikes
Me and Lil' Kim got the rhymes to incite
I gotta catch a flight, uh heh heh, around three and shit
Niggas can't see us from Elektra to Undeas
Ow, niggas wanna be us
Heh, I'm out hehe

That's the pain I feel
I feel whenever we're apart
Not to say that I'm in love with you
But who's to say that I'm not
I just know that it feels wrong
When I'm away too long
It makes my body hot
So let me tell ya baby

[Chorus]
I'll tell your mama
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby
Tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl
Who likes to be alone
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
Baby, I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much

[Verse 2]
I'm rushing home
Just as soon as I can
I'm rushing home to see
Your smiling face
And feel your warm embrace
It makes f-feel so g-g-g good
So I'll tell you baby

[Chorus]
I'll tell your mama
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby
Tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl
Who likes to be alone
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
Baby, I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
Baby, I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much

[Bridge]
Miss you much
I miss you much
I really really miss you much
Miss you much
I miss you much
I'm not ashamed to tell the world
I miss you

[Chorus]
I'll tell your mama
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby
Tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl
Who likes to be alone
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
Baby, I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
Baby, I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much

440,440,I Don't Know,"Now I don't know if all boy scouts are gay
But they could probably ""tie the knot"" in like fifty different ways
I've got a safe full of cherries
‘cause I pop it and lock it
A girl's like a fridge
Once a week you should stock it
And girl, if your into a rimmin’
It's only safe if you’re swimmin’
But girl don't sit on that couch
‘cause I treat my objects like women
I spit fire like I just blew a demon
My shits so hot I’ll leave your toilet bowl steamin’
I'm gonna tarot like the cards of the gypsies
You'll bleed for so long you'll get monthly ellipses
If your pants are loose, I'll re-pleat ya
You're a first time vegan and it's nice to meet ya

‘Cause I'm Bo yo! I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you’re better? You're not
Don't need a sweater; I'm hot
I'm a real G that can really find your g-spot...

Go to a vagina orchard. Count 1, 2, 3
Spin that plant around and you've got a third world country
That's right! Consider yourself warned
I'm offensive and creative like handicapped porn
You’re playin’ with your breasts, excuse me, can I try it ma'am?
You’re pushin’ them together like a titty Venn diagram
Look at that crack! excuse me, can I buy a gram?
Right below your diaphragm, ass looks like you’re hidin’ ham

First base, we're making out
Second base, I'm getting faked out yo
Third base, I'm getting take out
And I'd try to take it home if I knew I'd take it out
But I just don't know
I said I just don't care
I said my flow is so cold (that)
I need a tampon from a polar bear
And you can spell and you can smell my stink
‘Cause B.O. lingers and it makes you think

‘Cause I'm Bo yo! I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you’re better? You're not
Don't need a sweater; I'm hot
I'm a real G that can really find your g-spot…

It was all a dream, I used to read a quick Nick magazine
Ren and Stimpy, Tommy Pickles and the games between
Watching TV in the dark
Every Saturday double dare with my main man Marky Mark
Summers, Falls, Winters and Springs
I've seen [23] sets. Cut me open count the rings
But I wish that I could be 8, 9, or 10
Wearing ""Life is Good"" t-shirts that made sense back then
You wanna know me? Well here's a list;
When I tried to hit puberty I swung and I missed
I like palindromes like ""do geese see god?""
Or ""go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog.""
And I can do a Rubik's Cube in a minute twenty
Fast food and the Internet's plenty for me
I'm simple with one dimple
And a weird mole thing on my left nipple

I'm part of the fattest country on the global scale
And we’re “phat” with a ph on the ph scale
Because we're so basic

I'm a little kid in a cave, yo
Just starin' at my shadows and playin’ with Play-Doh
Oh hey yo, Aristotle, I got some Hemlock, let's share a bottle
Oh, too soon. I was Socra-teasin'
Let's drink hot chocolate, think, talk, reason
Oh my, oh me ah. I think I'll 'see ya
If I want a piece of Greece, then I'll pirate ""Mama Mia.""

Schwinn road kill - bicycle victim
Is that my dog? Yeah, I Michael Vick'd him
Put a pic of my nuts as my profile pic
And your girl clicked it, liked it, and licked it
My attempt is, check the tenses so the flow don't stop
In the future you'll be passed out like a present with a bow on top. Oh!

‘Cause I'm Bo yo! I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you’re better? You're not
Don't need a sweater; I'm hot
I'm a real G that can really find your g-spot…

Now, give us a house and a car and a kid
So we can raise it, praise it, blaze it up
And get Lasik to see how bad we fucked it up

We all had braces. Our smiles are fake
Another mother saw her hotter daughter's water break
The Miley Cyrus virus is as bad as it gets
And similarly as bad as simile Tourette's
Cause like it's like I like my right to like
But like I also have like a life to write, right?
Wrong. This is a road kill song
About a kid who followed the bouncing ball during the sing along
I'm a little teapot who’s steaming mad
Because the world’s not careful cause I'm hot...
(1, 2, Fuck You)

I take a stroll around the block to relax my mind
And then I walk by the clock just to pass the time
And rhymin', mathematical timin'
Syntax impacts the intact hymen
Trust me, you don't want to fuck with me
Check my record. Wrecked it on my SAT's
I got a 780 math, 730 verbal
Kick a Jonas brother and he'll fart out a gerbil

Voice so sweet, call me Mr. (Herbal) T
More deadly than Joseph Goebbel's pee
In a swastika Dixie cup
I’ve got a dick full of helium; I'll fuck you up!

Put down your fists ‘cause it’s a battle of wits
And if you bring your facts sis
Just the cattle with tits
And I'll get mad at their zits
And paddle their bits
With saddles and whips
And rattle their clits . . . that was rude

Yo, so girls are like donuts when I be bustin’ Bo nuts;
I can make ‘em cream-filled or give them a layer of glaze
I’m like Doug's friend Skeeter whenever I meet her
‘Cause I skeet her so hard you could call her Patty Mayonnaise
My girl is epileptic cause shes the one I'm jerkin with
Common you Asian child laborer show me what your workin' with...

Cause theres an inverse relationship between respect and sects
I'm talking about religious sects like a Mormon sect
That says you can't have sex with members of different sects
But you can't have sex with members of the same sex
So if the sects can't be different, the sex can be same
Then the only sex left is some left hand shame
And girl I left you ‘cause you left the game
And if that don't feel right then u can write my name

‘Cause I'm Bo yo! I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you’re better? You're not
Don't need a sweater; I'm hot
I'm a real G that can really find your g-spot...

Look past the skin and look to the lyrics
I run miracle circles around you like spherical lyrics
This isn't about ironic pigment
If you're imagining this then I'm a chronic figment

My junks so long that it hangs and swings
So at the nude beach people think I'm lookin' for lost rings
Play the skin flute while your big boy sings
And if you want to take it all wear African neck rings

Haters call me gay, but that ain't hatin'
‘Cause I'm not homophobic, my morals are straight and
If I'm in the closet then you are below me
Taking the b-a-t out of basement, homie

Yeah
Yo, yeah, what?
Cause I'm Bo, yo and I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you're better? You're not
Don't need a sweater-
I'm a real G that can really find your what now!
Oh, yeah!
Cause I'm Bo yo, yo, what?
I'm representing you
I'm representing the people from the 01982 yo
Oh yeah
What?
Yo, mother fucker
Tinkle
Yeah","['now', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'if', 'all', 'boy', 'scout', 'be', 'gay', 'but', 'they', 'could', 'probably', 'tie', 'the', 'knot', 'in', 'like', 'fifty', 'different', 'ways', 'ive', 'get', 'a',

And my heart is beatin' like a drum
And my words don't make a sound
And I'm dancin' but my feet ain't on the ground

Chorus:
I am flyin', forever within your arms
Oh I'm flyin', forever within your heart, I am flyin'
I didn't mean to stay all night, oh no, but baby you hold so tight
I didn't mean to turn you loose, oh no, but baby you won't refuse
I didn't mean to turn you on, oh no, it's heaven it can't be wrong
I didn't mean to stay all night

My thoughts are runnin' in a race
And my mind is slippin' into space
Cause your world is all around
So I'm dancing but my feet ain't on the ground

I am flyin', forever within your arms
Oh I'm flyin', forever within your heart, I am flyin'
I didn't mean to stay all night, oh no, but baby you hold so tight
I didn't mean to turn you loose, oh no, but baby you won't refuse
I didn't mean to turn you on, oh no, it's heaven it can't be wrong

Oh I'm flyin', forever within your heart

I didn't mean - I didn't mean to fool around, but baby you held me down

I didn't mean to stay all night
I didn't mean - I didn't mean to make you stay - oh no
I didn't mean to let you get your way
I didn't mean - I didn't mean to fool around - oh no
I didn't mean to let you hold me down
I didn't mean - to turn you on baby - oh no
To make you fall in love, I didn't mean
I didn't mean - to turn you loose honey - oh no
But you just can't refuse, and I didn't mean
I didn't mean - to stay all night, oh no, but you won't let go

No means no now
I said no

[Chorus:]
I talk to myself
'Cause there is no one to talk to
People ask me why
Why I do what I do
I talk to myself
'Cause there is no one to talk to
People ask me why
Why I do what I do

People ask me why
I feel this way
Always alone
Day after day

Well, I used to be sweet
And I used to be kind
But I've been used and abused
For the last time

I just don't know
Why I do what I do
I can't let go
This feeling that I'm feeling

[Repeat Chorus]

They think that I'm crazy
They say I'm strange
'Cause my attitude
Has taken a change

Well, it doesn't really matter
I really don't care
'Cause all of them
Can go to Hell

I just don't know
Why I do what I do
I can't let go
This feeling that I'm feeling
Solo

Yo, Chris (what)
You want to talk (no)
What do you want to do
(Kick it)

Talk to myself
This is how it started
People call me crazy
And think I'm retarded

Since you've been gone
I've been all alone
No one to talk to on the phone

Yeah, baby
I admit I was to blame
But since you've left
Life hasn't been the same

Since you've left
There's been no one else
So all I do is talk to myself

I can't let go
This feeling that I'm feeling

[Chorus]
If you miss the train I'm on, you will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

[Verse 2]
Not a shirt on my back, not a penny to my name
And the land that I once loved was not my own

Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home

In my life and time
Light
Dark
Short
Tall
Women of all kind
Sister named Velda
Snow named Gidget
I even got busy
With a cute little midget
Nothing made my heart sing
Nothing seemed to last
The future looked dim
Just like the past
But surprise from the sky
Came a dream called you
No one's ever rocked me
Like the way that you do
It hurts so good
When you do what you do
You're the end of the line
I wanna spend my life with you
Whitney Houston
Madonna
And even Brooke Shields
Don't come close to you
The real deal
You're erotic
Exotic
A chocolate ton of fun
Every woman I need
All wrapped up in one
More cushion for the pushin'
