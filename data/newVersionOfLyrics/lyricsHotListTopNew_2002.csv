To my ladies (Whoo! Good god!)
You sure know how to work that

Yeah, it's Missy Elliott!
I hope y'all enjoying what y'all heard so far
I was sittin' here thinkin' like
Big Daddy Kane and Public Enemy
Salt n Pepa, Lyte, EPMD, LL, Run-DMC
KRS-One, Rakim
Most of them artists used to dance
And still get respected in the street
Don't be scared to Bankhead or Bogo
Or move as far as sold Michael Jackson 43 million
Shoot, errbody have the zipper jacket
And half of these thugs have the glove to match, ya feel me?
Yo, it's ok though, if you wanna be hard and ice grill
And Harlem Shake at the same time, whatever

1,'03 Bonnie & Clyde,"[Intro: Jay Z]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé (and Jay-Z)]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' bout 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em

[Verse 2: Kyjuan]
Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; my niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

[Verse 3: Ali]
Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

[Verse 4: Murphy Lee]
Don't get me wrong, man
And Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 5: Murphy Lee]
We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin there as if I'm shootin free throws
I said, ""Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you Murph especially in the white 'n blue""
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice""
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), ""Thanks for the advice""

[Verse 6: Ali]
I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers the Broncos the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops,  which are clear so
But this tims and fat laces with it is cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit them lil' dots in the toe
Then I'm stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho
On dem Nike Air Force, ""NE"" behind the ""O""

[Verse 7: Kyjuan]
O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces at what wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with the electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, you know I'm buyin dem

[Verse 8: Nelly]
Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose ya heard me kinda like my daytons

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 9: Kyjuan]
I wore spurs at first now theres tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

[Verse 10: Murphy Lee]
Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (wow) fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

[Verse 11: Nelly]
Now some time I get em free some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

[Verse 12: Ali]
Now where da boxes where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine , (beep mine)
Maybe once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl

3,Beautiful,"[Intro]
Don't look at me

[Verse 1]
Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure from all the pain
I'm so ashamed

[Chorus 1]
I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

[Verse 2]
To all your friends, you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
Is that the way it is?

[Chorus 2]
You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no
'Cause you are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

[Bridge]
No matter what we do (No matter what we do)
No matter what we say (No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune, yeah
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine
The sun will always, always shine
(And tomorrow, we might wake on the other side)

[Chorus 3]
'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no

Y'all know how I met her
We broke up and got back together
To get her back, I had to sweat her
Thought she'd roll with bad boys forever in many ways
Them boys may be better, to grow, I had to let her
She needed cheddar and I understood that
Looking for cheese, that don't make her a hoodrat
In fact she's a queen to me, her light beams on me

This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
Cuz lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don’t feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you’re hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, “You make me sick”
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart’s half-broken and that’s hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
Cuz I can’t see you bouncin’ with somebody else
It’s a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn’t give it up
I can’t let us self-destruct

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin’ all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL’s, baguettes and rings
Instead I walk around like I’m a king
And having you ain’t nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin’ you the lovin’ was good
Too busy frontin’ in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don’t ever let go
I’mma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don’t say no
Cuz I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it’s time for the pain to go, ya’know

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do

It’s a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin’ you foul names
Actin’ like females is all the same
I’m gon’ love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I’ll never be the same
I’mma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you’re back in my life
But this time I’mma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin’s gonna tear us apart, promise

Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: ""Home is where the heart is.""
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‘Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to grow?
If you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream ""Peace!"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion

You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

Something 'bout the way

Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

And it's crazy, but oh, baby (Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh)
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (What you want, baby?)
I gotta leave you alone (Come on now)
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot

So without me you'll be fine, right? (Come on, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you (Uh, uh, uh)
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town (Creepin')
I thought my tender touch could lock you down (Yeah)
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now (Come here)
Stop playing (Haha, aw), you gaming
I gotta leave you alone (What you want now?)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
'Cause I'm good holding my spot

Cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me, you love me (Oh)

I promise I'm not a phony, don't bounce, baby, console me (Come here)
Ain't nothing you can say to me that
Can change my mind, I got to let you go now (Chill, baby)
And nothing will ever be the same, so just (Yeah)
Be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now (Baby, don't go)
And there's no more to explain to me, you know (Come on, now)
I know your game and I'm not feeling what you do (Come on, now)
So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (Don't bounce)
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah (Don't bounce, don't bounce, baby)

26,Cry Me A River,"LYRICS:
You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance, made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you love me
Why did you leave me all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl I refuse
You must have me confused with some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry

Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river

You know that they say somethings are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him
And you know it
(Don't act like you don't know it)
All of these things people told me
Keep messing with my head
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have thought it

You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you love me
Why did you leave me all alone
Now you tell me you need me

Hey baby, is that you?
Wow, your hair got so long
Yeah, yeah, I love it, I really do
""Norma Jean"", ain't that the song we'd sing in the car?
Driving downtown, top down, making the rounds
Checking out the bands on Doheeney Avenue
Yeah, life throws you curves
But you learned to swerve
Me, I swung and I missed and the next thing ya know
I'm reminiscing
Dreaming old dreams, wishing old wishes
Like you would be back again

[Chorus]
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home
Check the phone, just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days
Yeah, that's what I'm doing

[Verse 2]
Someone told me after college, you ran off to Vegas
You married a rodeo cowboy
Wow, that ain't the girl I knew
Me, I've been a few places
Mostly here and there, once or twice
Still sortin' out life, but I'm doing alright
Yeah, it's good to see you too
Well, hey girl, you're late
And those planes, they don't wait
But if you ever come back around his sleepy old town
Promise me you'll stop in to see an old friend
And until then...

It was the dawning of a new decade
We got our first microwave
And Dad broke down and finally shaved
Them old sideburns off

In them cut-off jeans
A space shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried

I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I saw you yesterday with an old friend
It was the same old same, how have you been?
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid
King of the town? Yeah, I been that
You know I click-clack — where you and your mens at?
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat

Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up

This ain't rappin', this is Street Hop
Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot
My live niggas lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up

I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk-asses

Don't feel me baby, it's just Justin

Listen

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I kinda noticed, something wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song to me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
See, people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go, the music should move your bones

[Verse 4: Pusha T, Malice, (Justin Timberlake)]
Ma, whatchu wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend see, I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
In the mall kids ask ""How the chain glow?""
Point to her they say, ""Wow, it's the same glow""
Point to me I say, ""Yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my a-like
You have me sleepin' in the same bed every night
Go ride wit me you deservin' the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called ""Brain"" (I just love your... brain)
Ma, took a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake - now how heavy is that?

Right here waiting
Staying strong
Come and
Fall into me
You say you've turned it off
Hid your heart up on a shelf
Scared of what it might cost
To take it down for someone else
Cause loving him you lost
Too much of yourself
Baby can't you see
That he's
Not me

And I need you
To know you can
Fall into me
That my arms
Are wide open and
Will always be
Right here waiting
Staying strong
Come and
Fall into me

I'll follow any road
Anywhere to get to you
I'll open up my soul
If that's what you need me to do
Now baby it's your move
All you got to do is believe
In love
Just believe
In us

A lot of niggas is bitches, a lot of bitches be trippin'
A lot of them be wishin' that they was in my position
A lot of niggas be cowards and most chicks be chickens
Fuck 'bout the CLUCK! CLUCK! Eve ain't trippin'
Most dudes is okay (half of the rest ain't)
Talkin' 'bout what they wanna do (reality they can't)
Ask 'em what they life worth, watch 'em draw a blank
I really ain't got no interest if it don't involve the bank
Most of the time I'm nice to 'em (half the time I'm not)
It ain't nothin' new though (learned it from off the block)
People think I changed much 'cuz I'm livin' good
Now they get my voicemail, hear them callin' me rude?
Sometimes I feel bad (most of the time I don't)

Can't beat me, join me, baby, then get to clappin'
Bang it in ya whips to get ya neck snappin'
I know you hopin' that I rest so you can breathe
Stressed when we in the same places 'till I leave
Whisper to they friends, ""What they wanna do to me?""
Wish they could erase me, take away the air I breathe
And I feed 'cuz that shit only give me hunger pains
Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame
Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain
And I always been a savage 'bout the fame
Separate the girls from the women and the winnin'
Always knew the thrill was worth it from the beginnin'

47,All My Life,"[Intro]
All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost

[Verse 1]
Come down don't you resist
You have such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there?
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

[Chorus]
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down

[Verse 2]
Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?
Over and over, down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I've got nothing to hide
On and on, I've got nothing to hide

[Chorus]
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste

Funny how it's hard to find the words sometimes, you know

You're always actin' so composed and cool
Never got too many words for me (too many words)
You always turn your head and make sure I see (just to make sure)
Baby, ain't nothin' wrong with the love
That you and I dream of; so sweet
Your actions say more than your lips can speak

How a love unspoken can be so deep (can be so deep)
And every time that you look my way
I see what your heart wants to say to me

49,Red Rag Top,"[Verse 1]
I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just as wild as we were green, in the ways of the world
She picked me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
On a summer night running all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove and the night
Was hot as a coal burning' stove
We were cooking the gas we were had to last

[Chorus]
In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

[Verse 2]
Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl was a mother to be for 2 weeks
I was out of a job and she was in school
Life was fast and the world was cruel

We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down
There would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

[Chorus 2]
On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me

[Verse 3]
We took one more trip around the sun
It was all make believe in the end
No I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then
Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins

And there's no such thing as what might've been
That's a waste of time; drive you outta your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
I was in an old scene

[Outro]
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped

Said come on home to Louisiana
And come as fast as you can fly

My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that

I just want to be mad for a while

For now, you might as well forget it
Don't run your fingers through my hair
Yeah that's right, I'm being stubborn
No, I don't want to go back upstairs
I'm going to leave for work
Without a goodbye kiss
But as I'm driving off
Just remember this

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just want to be mad for a while

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change

57,A Lot Of Things Different,"[Verse 1]
I'd spend a lot more time in the pouring rain
Without an umbrella
Covering my head
And I'd stood up to that bully when he pushed
And called me names
But I was too afraid
And I'd a gone on and saw Elvis that night he came to town
But mama said I couldn't
And I'd a-went skinny dipping with Jenny Carson
That time she dared me to
But I didn't

[Chorus]
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different

[Verse 2]
I wished I'd a spent more time with my dad
When he was alive
Now I don't have the chance
I wish I had told my brother how much I loved him
Before he went off to war
But I just shook his hand
And I wish I had gone to church on Sunday morning
When my grandma begged me too
But I was afraid of God
And I wish I would've listened when they said Boy
You're going to wish you hadn't
But I wouldn't

[Chorus]
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different

People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could
Oh, but I would

[Verse 3]
There was this red dress she wanted one time so bad
She could taste it
And I should have bought it'
But I didn't
She wanted to paint our bedroom yellow and trim it
Blues and greens
But I wouldn't let her, wouldn't a-hurt nothing
She loved to be held and kissed and touched but I didn't do it
Not nearly enough
And if I'd a known that dance was going to be our last dance
I'd a asked that band to play on and on and on

[Chorus]
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different

[Outro]
People say they wouldn't change a thing, even if they could
Oh but I would
Oh whoa, Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things
I think we'd all done a lot of things different",Kenny Chesney,Kenny Chesney,2002,"[60, 55, 58, 65, 74]",5

Then she falls asleep with just my t-shirt on
But even when her hair's messed up and her make-up's gone

You can't hide Beautiful
You Can't hide wonderful
There's nothing that she has to do
It just comes natural

No way to disguise
The way that she shines
You can't hide beautiful, oh no

She can take a simple dress
Put it on and turn some heads
Man Everytime she moves she gets me
She doesn't even know she's sexy

And the way she thinks sometimes
Out of no where blows my mind
She makes me laugh and makes me dream
I love the way she looks at things

Motel, sitting in the dark
Empty room like an empty heart
Lovers stop, but they never stay
They don't look back as they drive away
Maybe I can fix this broken neon light
Fill in the cracks and paint it bright
That maybe love will stop here tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And if she knocks on my door
I'll give her the key
Just one look in her eyes
And I know I'll be everything that she sees in me
More than I ever thought I could be, but...

[Chorus]
These are the days
When all that I can do is dream
But I don't wanna spend forever
Living in the in-between
I'm stuck here in a place without love
And I just can't let it stay this way
But for now, I'm gonna have to face it
These are the days

[Verse 2]
I gotta use this lonely time
To change the picture in my frame of mind
Outside the window, there's a sunny day
I wanna feel it on my face
You and I
We're out here looking for the same thing
An end to all the wondering
Waiting for someone to share this feeling

And if she knocks on my door
I'll give her the key
Just one look in her eyes
And I know I'll be
Everything that she sees in me

But I don't wanna spend forever

These are the days

But I don't wanna spend forever

I'd rather chase your shadow all my life
Than be afraid of my own
I'd rather be with you
I'd rather not know
Where I'll be
Than be alone and convinced that I know

When the world keeps spinning round
My world's upside down
And I wouldn't change a thing
I've got nothing else to lose
I lost it all when I found you
And I wouldn't change a thing
No, you and I wouldn't change a thing

Everything I know has let me down
So I will just let go
Let you turn me inside out
Cause I know I'm not sure
About anything
But you wouldn't have it any other way

And there's no color to behold

They say it's over and I'm fine again, yeah
Try to stay sober, feels like I'm dying here

I am prepared now, seems everyone's gonna be fine
One day, too late, just as well

I feel the dream in me expire
And there's no one left to blame it on

Why try to stay sober when I'm dying here?

Wish I was too dead to cry

Stones to throw at my creator

You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go 'til it bleeds

[Verse 2]
Wish I was too dead to care
If indeed I cared at all
Never had a voice to protest
So you fed me shit to digest
I wish I had a reason;
My flaws are open season
For this, I gave up trying
One good turn deserves my dying

You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go 'til it bleeds

Wish I'd died instead of lived

Another dream that will never come true
Just to compliment your sorrow
Another life that I've taken from you
A gift to add onto your pain and suffering

Another truth you can never believe
Has crippled you, completely
All the cries you're beginning to hear
Trapped in your mind, and the sound is deafening

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray

[Chorus]
Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away

[Verse 2]
Another nightmare about to come true
Will manifest, tomorrow
Another love that I've taken from you
Lost in time, on the edge of suffering

Another taste of the evil I breed
Will level you, completely
Bring to life everything that you fear
Live in the dark, and the world is threatening

Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray

Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Stepped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite
Hard to the core
Core to the rotten
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton

Now today seem strange
No call on my celly, no name on my caller ID
Callin' you up and ya OGs sayin' you ain't home
What's really goin' on? I wanna know
So gimme a call and let's play no games
I'm playin', you want the plane
Don't point a finger over herre
I bought you a fur coat for your birthday
And this the things I get shorty?
Over there you starin' mad
That I went out with them other chicks
I told you they ain't shit!
They were just some buddies from high school that I went to
Where my old homies wanted me to kick it to 'em
But I called you up but you wasn't home
Baby girl when you get this message, gimme a call
I'll be waitin' at home

From the Field to creep wit', when ya guys are dummy
Honey you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a late of neck bones
Tenderized and yummy, the Energizer bunny can't compete with me
Cuz I be goin' and goin', rowin'
With mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'

Something in return

If your love could be caged
Honey, I would hold the key
And conceal it underneath
The pile of lies you handed me

For me to be fine, yeah

Can you cry a little?
Die just a little

I gave, now I'm wanting
Something in return

Honey, give it a try
I don't want pity
I just want what is mine, yeah

81,Through The Rain,"[Verse 1]
When you get caught in the rain with nowhere to run
When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved, but nobody comes
And you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, once you say

[Chorus]
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

[Verse 2]
And if you keep falling down, don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
Once you say

[Chorus]
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

[Bridge]
And when the wind blows
And shadows grow close
Don't be afraid, there's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate, stand tall and say

[Chorus]
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again

And I'll live one more day, and I
I can make it through the rain
Oh, yes, you can
You're gonna make it through the rain",Mariah Carey,Mariah Carey,2002,[84],1

86,Come Close To Me,"In the early 1990s, a writer for the New Republic magazine, reviewing with approval in the New York Times a book about the influence of dangerously unpatriotic elements among American intellectuals, warned his readers of the existence of ""a permanent adversarial culture"" in the United States

It was an accurate observation. Despite the political consensus of Democrats and Republicans in Washington which set limits on American reform, making sure that capitalism was in place, that national military strength was maintained, that wealth and power remained in the hands of a few, there were millions of Americans, probably tens of millions, who refused, either actively or silently, to go along. Their activities were largely unreported by the media. They constituted this ""permanent adversarial culture.""

The Democratic party was more responsive to these Americans, on whose votes it depended. But its responsiveness was limited by its own captivity to corporate interests, and its domestic reforms were severely limited by the system's dependency on militarism and war. Thus, President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty in the sixties became a victim of the war in Vietnam, and Jimmy Carter could not go far so long as he insisted on a huge outlay of money for the military, much of this to stockpile more nuclear weapons

As these limits became clear in the Carter years, a small but determined movement against nuclear arms began to grow. The pioneers were a tiny group of Christian pacifists who had been active against the Vietnam war (among them were a former priest, Philip Berrigan, and his wife, Elizabeth McAlister, a former nun). Again and again, members of this group would be arrested for engaging in nonviolent acts of dramatic protest against nuclear war at the Pentagon and the White House—trespassing on forbidden areas, pouring their own blood on symbols of the war machine

In 1980, small delegations of peace activists from all over the country maintained a series of demonstrations at the Pentagon, in which over a thousand people were arrested for acts of nonviolent civil disobedience

In September of that year, Philip Berrigan, his brother Daniel (the Jesuit priest and poet), Molly Rush (a mother of six), Anne Montgomery (a nun and counselor to young runaways and prostitutes in Manhattan), and four of their friends made their way past a guard in the General Electric Plant at King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where nose cones for nuclear missiles were manufactured. They used sledgehammers to smash two of the nose cones and smeared their own blood over missile parts, blueprints, and furniture. Arrested, sentenced to years in prison, they said they were trying to set an example to do as the Bible suggested, to beat swords into plowshares

They pointed to the huge allocations of taxpayers' money to corporations producing weaponry: ""G.E. drains $3 million a day from the public treasury-an enormous larceny against the poor."" Before their trial (they came to be known as the Plowshares Eight), Daniel Berrigan had written in the Catholic Worker

I know of no sure way of predicting where things will go from there, whether others will hear and respond, or how quickly or slowly. Or whether the act will fail to vitalize others, will come to a grinding halt then and there, its actors stigmatized or dismissed as fools. One swallows dry and takes a chance

In fact, the movement did not come to a halt. Over the next decade, a national movement against nuclear weapons developed, from a small number of men and women willing to go to jail to make others stop and think to millions of Americans frightened at the thought of nuclear holocaust, indignant at the billions of dollars spent on weaponry while people were in need of life's necessities

Even the very Middle-American Pennsylvania jurors who convicted the Plowshares Eight showed remarkable sympathy with their actions. One juror, Michael DeRosa, told a reporter, ""I didn't think they really went to commit a crime. They went to protest."" Another, Mary Ann Ingram, said the jury argued about that: ""We . . . really didn't want to convict them on anything. But we had to because of the way the judge said the thing you can use is what you get under the law."" She added: ""These people are not criminals. Here are people who are trying to do some good for the country. But the judge said nuclear power wasn't the issue.""

Reagan's huge military budget was to provoke a national movement against nuclear weapons. In the election of 1980 that brought him into the Presidency, local referenda in three districts in western Massachusetts permitted voters to say whether they believed in a mutual Soviet-American halt to testing, production, and deployment of all nuclear weapons, and wanted Congress to devote those funds instead to civilian use. Two peace groups had worked for months on the campaign and all three districts approved the resolution (94,000 to 65,000), even those that voted for Reagan as President. Similar referenda received majority votes between 1978 and 1981 in San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland, Madison, and Detroit

Women were in the forefront of the new antinuclear movement. Randall Forsberg, a young specialist in nuclear arms, organized the Council for a Nuclear Weapons Freeze, whose simple program—a mutual Soviet-American freeze on the production of new nuclear weapons—began to catch on throughout the country. Shortly after Reagan's election, two thousand women assembled in Washington, marched on the Pentagon, and surrounded it in a great circle, linking arms or stretching to hold the ends of brightly colored scarves. One hundred forty women were arrested for blocking the Pentagon entrance

A small group of doctors began to organize meetings around the country to teach citizens the medical consequences of nuclear war. They were the core of the Physicians for Social Responsibility, and Dr. Helen Caldicott, the group's president, became one of the most powerful and eloquent national leaders of the movement. At one of their public symposia, Howard Hiatt, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, gave a graphic description of the results of one twenty-megaton nuclear bomb falling on Boston. Two million people would die. Survivors would be burned, blinded, crippled. In a nuclear war there would be 25 million severe burn cases in the nation, yet all existing facilities could take care of only 200 cases

At a national meeting of Catholic bishops early in the Reagan administration, the majority opposed any use of nuclear weapons. In November 1981, there were meetings on 151 college campuses around the country on the issue of nuclear war. And at local elections in Boston that month, a resolution calling for increased federal spending on social programs ""by reducing the amount of our tax dollars spent on nuclear weapons and programs of foreign intervention"" won a majority in every one of Boston's twenty-two wards, including both white and black working-class districts

On June 12, 1982, the largest political demonstration in the history of the country took place in Central Park, New York City. Close to a million people gathered to express their determination to bring an end to the arms race

Scientists who had worked on the atom bomb added their voices to the growing movement. George Kistiakowsky, a Harvard University chemistry professor who had worked on the first atomic bomb, and later was science adviser to President Eisenhower, became a spokesman for the disarmament movement. His last public remarks, before his death from cancer at the age of eighty-two, were in an editorial for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists in December 1982. ""I tell you as my parting words: Forget the channels. There simply is not enough time left before the world explodes. Concentrate instead on organizing, with so many others of like mind, a mass movement for peace such as there has not been before.""

By the spring of 1983, the nuclear freeze had been endorsed by 368 city and county councils across the country, by 444 town meetings and 17 state legislatures, and by the House of Representatives. A Harris poll at this time indicated that 79 percent of the population wanted a nuclear freeze agreement with the Soviet Union. Even among evangelical Christians—a group of 40 million people presumed to be conservative and pro-Reagan—a Gallup poll sampling showed 60 percent favoring a nuclear freeze

A year after the great Central Park demonstration, there were over three thousand antiwar groups around the country. And the antinuclear feeling was being reflected in the culture-in books, magazine articles, plays, motion pictures. Jonathan Schells impassioned book against the arms race, The Fate of the Earth, became a national best-seller. A documentary film on the arms race made in Canada was forbidden to enter the country by the Reagan administration, but a federal court ordered it admitted

In less than three years, there had come about a remarkable change in public opinion. At the time of Reagan's election, nationalist feeling—drummed up by the recent hostage crisis in Iran and by the Russian invasion of Afghanistan—was strong; the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center found that only 12 percent of those it polled thought too much was being spent on arms. But when it took another poll in the spring of 1982, that figure rose to 32 percent. And in the spring of 1983, a New York Time/CBS News poll found that the figure had risen again, to 48 percent

Antimilitarist feeling expressed itself also in resistance to the draft. When President Jimmy Carter, responding to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, called for the registration of young men for a military draft, more than 800,000 men (10 percent) failed to register. One mother wrote to the New York Time:

To the Editor: Thirty-six years ago I stood in front of the crematorium. The ugliest force in the world had promised itself that I should be removed from the cycle of life-that I should never know the pleasure of giving life. With great guns and great hatred, this force thought itself the equal of the force of lift

I survived the great guns, and with every smile of my son, they grow smaller. It is not for me, sir, to offer my son's blood as lubricant for the next generation of guns. I remove myself and my own from the cycle of death
Isabella Leitner

Former Nixon aide Alexander Haig warned, in an interview in the French journal Politique Internationale, that there might reappear in the U.S. the conditions that forced President Nixon to stop the draft. ""There is a Jane Fonda on every doorstep,"" he said

One of the young men who refused to register, James Peters, wrote an open letter to President Carter:

Dear Mr. President: On July 23, 1980, I ... am expected to report to my local post office for the purpose of registering with the Selective Service System. I hereby inform you, Mr. President, that I will not register on July 23, or at any time thereafter... . We have tried militarism, and it has failed the human race in every way imaginable

Once he was in office, Ronald Reagan hesitated to renew draft registration, because, as his Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, explained, ""President Reagan believes that resuming the draft to meet manpower problems would lead to public unrest comparable to that in the sixties and seventies."" William Beecher, a former Pentagon reporter, wrote in November 1981 that Reagan was ""obviously concerned, even alarmed, by the mounting voices of discontent and suspicion over emerging U.S. nuclear strategy both in the streets of Europe and more recently on American campuses.""

Hoping to intimidate this opposition, the Reagan administration began to prosecute draft resisters. One of those facing prison was Benjamin Sasway, who cited U.S. military intervention in El Salvador as a good reason not to register for the draft

Aroused by Sasway's civil disobedience, a right-wing columnist (William A. Rusher, of the National Review) wrote indignantly that one heritage of the sixties was a new generation of antiwar teachers:

Almost certainly there was a teacher, or teachers, who taught Benjamin Sasway to look at American society as a hypocritical, exploitative, materialistic roadblock on the path of human progress. The generation of the Vietnam protesters is now in its early thirties, and the academicians among them are already ensconced in the faculties of the country's high schools and colleges.... What a pity our jurisprudence doesn't allow us to reach and penalize the real architects of this sort of destruction!

Reagan's policy of giving military aid to the dictatorship of El Salvador was not accepted quietly around the nation. He had barely taken office when the following report appeared in the Boston Globe:

It was a scene reminiscent of the 1960s, a rally of students in Harvard Yard shouting antiwar slogans, a candlelight march through the streets of Cambridge.. .. 2000 persons, mostly students, gathered to protest U.S. involvement in El Salvador... . Students from Tufts, MIT, Boston University and Boston College, the University of Massachusetts, Brandeis, Suffolk, Dartmouth, Northeastern, Vassar, Yale and Simmons were represented

During commencement exercises that spring of 1981 at Syracuse University, when Reagan's Secretary of State, Alexander Haig, was given an honorary doctorate in ""public service,"" two hundred students and faculty turned their backs on the presentation. During Haig's address, the press reported, ""Nearly every pause in Mr. Haig's fifteen-minute address was punctuated by chants: 'Human needs, not military greed!' 'Get out of El Salvador!' 'Washington guns killed American nuns!'""

The last slogan was a reference to the execution in the fall of 1980 of four American nuns by Salvadoran soldiers. Thousands of people in El Salvador were being murdered each year by ""death squads"" sponsored by a government armed by the United States, and the American public was beginning to pay attention to events in this tiny Central American country

As has been true generally in the making of U.S. foreign policy, there was no pretense at democracy. Public opinion was simply ignored. A New York Time/CBS News poll in the spring of 1982 reported that only 16 percent of its sampling favored Reagan's program of sending military and economic aid to El Salvador

In the spring of 1983, it was disclosed that an American physician named Charles Clement was working with the Salvadoran rebels. As an Air Force pilot in Southeast Asia, he had become disillusioned with U.S. policy there, having seen firsthand that his government was lying, and refused to fly any more missions. The Air Force response was to commit him to a psychiatric hospital, then to discharge him as psychologically unfit. He went to medical school, and then volunteered to be a doctor with the guerrillas in El Salvador

There was much talk in the American press in the early eighties about the political cautiousness of a new generation of college students concerned mostly with their own careers. But when, at the Harvard commencement of June 1983, Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes criticized American intervention in Latin America, and said, ""Because we are your true friends, we will not permit you to conduct yourselves in Latin American affairs as the Soviet Union conducts itself in Central European and Central Asian affairs,"" he was interrupted twenty times by applause and received a standing ovation when finished

Among my own students at Boston University, I did not find the pervasive selfishness and unconcern with others that the media kept reporting, in deadening repetition, about the students of the eighties. In the journals they kept, I found the following comments:

A male student: ""Do you think anything good that has happened in the world had anything to do with government? I work in Roxbury [a black neighborhood]. I know the government doesn't work. Not for the people of Roxbury, and not for the people anywhere. It works for people with money.""

A graduate of a Catholic high school: ""America to me is a society, a culture. America is my home; if someone were to rob that culture from me, then perhaps there would be reason to resist. I will not die, however, to defend the honor of the government.""

A young woman: ""As a white middle class person I've never felt discriminated against at all. But I'll say this: If anyone ever tried to make me sit in a different schoolroom, use a different bathroom, or anything like that, I would knock them right on their ass.. . . The people are the last ones that need their rights stated on paper, for if they're abused or injusticed by government or authority, they can act on the injustice directly.. . . When you look at the ... statements of rights and laws, it's really government and authority and institutions and corporations that need laws and rights to insulate them from the physicality, the directness of the people.""

Beyond the campuses, out in the country, there was opposition to government policy, not widely known. A report from Tucson, Arizona, early in the Reagan presidency described ""demonstrators, mainly middle-aged,"" protesting at the Federal Building against U.S. involvement in El Salvador. Over a thousand people in Tucson marched in a procession and attended a mass to commemorate the anniversary of the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero, who had spoken out against the Salvadoran death squads

Over 60,000 Americans signed pledges to take action of some sort, including civil disobedience, if Reagan moved to invade Nicaragua. When the President instituted a blockade of the tiny country to try to force its government out of power, there were demonstrations around the country. In Boston alone, 550 people were arrested protesting the blockade

During Reagan's presidency, there were hundreds of actions throughout the nation against his policies in South Africa. He obviously did not want to see the white ruling minority of South Africa displaced by the radical African National Congress, which represented the black majority. Chester Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, in his memoirs, called Reagan ""insensitive"" to the conditions under which blacks lived there. Public opinion was strong enough to cause Congress to legislate economic sanctions against the South African Government in 1986, overriding Reagan's veto

Reagan's cuts in social services were felt on the local level as vital needs could not he taken care of, and there were angry reactions. In the spring and summer of 1981, residents of East Boston took to the streets; for fifty-five nights they blocked major thoroughfares and the Sumner Tunnel during rush hour, in order to protest cutbacks in funds for fire, police, and teachers. The police superintendent, John Doyle, said: ""Maybe these people are starting to take lessons from the protests of the sixties and seventies."" The Boston Globe reported: ""The demonstrators in East Boston were mostly middle-aged, middle- or working-class people who said they had never protested anything before.""

The Reagan administration took away federal funds for the arts, suggesting that the performing arts seek help from private donors. In New York, two historic Broadway theaters were razed to make way for a luxury fifty-story hotel, after two hundred theater people demonstrated, picketing, reading plays and singing songs, refusing to disperse when ordered by police. Some of the nation's best-known theater personalities were arrested, including producer Joseph Papp, actresses Tammy Grimes, Estelle Parsons, and Celeste Holm, actors Richard Gere and Michael Moriarty

The budget cuts spurred strikes across the country, often by groups unaccustomed to striking. In the fall of 1982, United Press International reported:

Angered by layoffs, salary cuts and uncertainty about job security, more schoolteachers throughout the country have decided to go on strike. Teachers' strikes last week in seven states, from Rhode Island to Washington, have idled more than 300,000 students

Surveying a series of news events in the first week of January 1983, David Nyhan of the Boston Globe wrote: ""There is something brewing in the land that bodes ill for those in Washington who ignore it. People have moved from the frightened state to the angry stage and are acting out their frustrations in ways that will test the fabric of civil order."" He gave some examples:

In Little Washington, Pennsylvania, in early 1983, when a 50-year-old computer science teacher who led a teachers' strike was sent to jail, 2000 people demonstrated outside the jailhouse in his support, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called it ""the largest crowd in Washington County since the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion.""

When unemployed or bankrupt home owners in the Pittsburgh area could no longer make mortgage payments, and foreclosure sales were scheduled, 60 pickets jammed the courthouse to protest the auction, and Allegheny sheriff Eugene Coon halted the proceedings

The foreclosure of a 320-acre wheat farm in Springfield, Colorado, was interrupted by 200 angry farmers, who had to be dispersed by tear gas and Mace

When Reagan arrived in Pittsburgh in April 1983 to make a speech, 3000 people, many of them unemployed steelworkers, demonstrated against him, standing in the rain outside his hotel. Demonstrations by the unemployed were taking place in Detroit, Flint, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Washington—over twenty cities in all

Just around that time, Miami blacks rioted against police brutality; they were reacting against their general deprivation as well. The unemployment rate among young African-Americans had risen above 50 percent, and the Reagan administration's only response to poverty was to build more jails. Understanding that blacks would not vote for him, Reagan tried, unsuccessfully, to get Congress to eliminate a crucial section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which had been very effective in safeguarding the right of blacks to vote in Southern states

Reagan's policies clearly joined the two issues of disarmament and social welfare. It was guns versus children, and this was expressed dramatically by the head of the Children's Defense Fund, Marian Wright Edelman, in a commencement speech at the Milton Academy in Massachusetts in the summer of 1983:

You are graduating into a nation and world teetering on the brink of moral and economic bankruptcy. Since 1980, our President and Congress have been turning our national plowshares into swords and been bringing good news to the rich at the expense of the poor. .. . Children are the major victims. Our misguided national and world choices are literally killing children daily.... Yet governments throughout the world, led by our own, spend over $600 billion a year on arms, while an estimated 1 billion of our world's people live in poverty and 600 million are under- or unemployed. Where is the human commitment and political will to find the relative pittance of money needed to protect children?

She urged her listeners: ""Pick a piece of the problem that you can help solve while trying to see how your piece fits into the broader social change puzzle.""

Her words seemed to represent a growing mood that worried the Reagan administration. It withdrew some of its proposed cutbacks, and Congress eliminated others. When, in its second year, the administration proposed $9 billion in cuts in support for children and poor families, Congress accepted only $1 billion. The Washington correspondent of the New York Time reported: ""Political concerns about the fairness of Mr. Reagan's programs have forced the Administration to curtail its efforts to make further cutbacks in programs for the poor.""

The repeated elections of Republican candidates, Reagan in 1980 and 1984, George Bush in 1988, were treated by the press with words like ""landslide"" and ""overwhelming victory."" They were ignoring four facts: that roughly half the population, though eligible to vote, did not; that those who did vote were limited severely in their choices to the two parties that monopolized the money and the media; that as a result many of their votes were cast without enthusiasm; and that there was little relationship between voting for a candidate and voting for specific policies

In 1980 Reagan received 51.6 percent of the popular vote, while Jimmy Carter received 41.7 percent and John Anderson (a liberal Republican running on a third-party ticket) received 6.7 percent. Only 54 percent of the voting-age population voted, so that—of the total eligible to vote—27 percent voted for Reagan

A survey by the New York Time found that only 11 percent of those who voted for Reagan did so because ""he's a real conservative."" Three times as many said they voted for him because ""it is time for a change.""

For a second term, running against former Vice-President Walter Mondale, Reagan won 59 percent of the popular vote, but with half the electorate not voting, he had 29 percent of the voting population

In the 1988 election, with Vice-President George Bush running against Democrat Michael Dukakis, Bush's 54 percent victory added up to 27 percent of the eligible voters

Because our peculiar voting arrangements allow a small margin of popular votes to become a huge majority of electoral votes, the media can talk about ""overwhelming victory,"" thus deceiving their readers and disheartening those who don't look closely at the statistics. Could one say from these figures that ""the American people"" wanted Reagan, or Bush, as President? One could certainly say that more voters preferred the Republican candidates to their opponents. But even more seemed to want neither candidate. Nevertheless, on the basis of these slim electoral pluralities, Reagan and Bush would claim that ""the people"" had spoken

Indeed, when the people did speak about issues, in surveys of public opinion, they expressed beliefs to which neither the Republican nor Democratic parties paid attention

For instance, both parties, through the eighties and early nineties, kept strict limits on social programs for the poor, on the grounds that this would require more taxes, and ""the people"" did not want higher taxes

This was certainly true as a general proposition, that Americans wanted to pay as little in taxes as possible. But when they were asked if they would be willing to pay higher taxes for specific purposes like health and education, they said yes, they would. For instance, a 1990 poll of Boston area voters showed that 54 percent of them would pay more taxes if that would go toward cleaning up the environment

And when higher taxes were presented in class terms, rather than as a general proposal, people were quite clear. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in December 1990 showed that 84 percent of the respondents favored a surtax on millionaires (this provision was dropped around that time from a Democratic-Republican budget compromise). Even though 51 percent of the respondents were in favor of raising the capital gains tax, neither major party favored that

A Harris/Harvard School of Public Health poll of 1989 showed that most Americans (61 percent) favored a Canadian-type health system, in which the government was the single payer to doctors and hospitals, bypassing the insurance companies, and offering universal medical coverage to everyone. Neither the Democratic nor the Republican party adopted that as its program, although both insisted they wanted to ""reform"" the health system

A survey by the Gordon Black Corporation for the National Press Club in 1992 found that 59 percent of all voters wanted a 50 percent cut in defense spending in five years. Neither of the major parties was willing to make major cuts in the military budget

How the public felt about government aid to the poor seemed to depend on how the question was put. Both parties, and the media, talked incessantly about the ""welfare"" system, that it was not working, and the word ""welfare"" became a signal for opposition. When people were asked (a New York Times/CBS News poll of 1992) if more money should he allocated to welfare, 23 percent said no. But when the same people were asked, should the government help the poor, 64 percent said yes

This was a recurring theme. When, at the height of the Reagan presidency, in 1987, people were asked if the government should guarantee food and shelter to needy people, 62 percent answered yes

Clearly, there was something amiss with a political system, supposed to be democratic, in which the desires of the voters were repeatedly ignored. They could be ignored with impunity so long as the political system was dominated by two parties, both tied to corporate wealth. An electorate forced to choose between Carter and Reagan, or Reagan and Mondale, or Bush and Dukakis could only despair (or decide not to vote) because neither candidate was capable of dealing with a fundamental economic illness whose roots were deeper than any single presidency

That illness came from a fact which was almost never talked about: that the United States was a class society, in which I percent of the population owned 33 percent of the wealth, with an underclass of 30 to 40 million people living in poverty. The social programs of the sixties- Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps, etc.-did not do much more than maintain the historic American maldistribution of resources

While the Democrats would give more help to the poor than the Republicans, they were not capable (indeed, not really desirous) of seriously tampering with an economic system in which corporate profit comes before human need

There was no important national movement for radical change, no social democratic (or democratic socialist) party such as existed in countries in Western Europe, Canada, and New Zealand. But there were a thousand signs of alienation, voices of protest, local actions in every part of the country to call attention to deep-felt grievances, to demand that some injustice be remedied

For instance, the Citizens' Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes in Washington, D.C., which had been formed early in the Reagan administration by housewife and activist Lois Gibbs, reported that it was giving help to 8000 local groups around the country. One of these groups, in Oregon, brought a series of successful lawsuits to force the Environmental Protection Agency to do something about unsafe drinking water in the Bull Run reservoir near Portland

In Seabrook, New Hampshire, there were years of persistent protest against a nuclear power plant which residents considered a danger to themselves and their families. Between 1977 and 1989, over 3500 people were arrested in these protests. Ultimately, the plant, plagued by financial problems and opposition, had to shut down

Fear of nuclear accidents was intensified by disastrous events at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979 and by an especially frightening calamity in Chernobyl in the Soviet Union in 1986. All of this was having an effect on the once-booming nuclear industry. By 1994, the Tennessee Valley Authority had stopped the construction of three nuclear plants, which the New York Time called ""the symbolic death notice for the current generation of reactors in the United States.""

In Minneapolis, Minnesota, thousands of people demonstrated year after year against the Honeywell Corporation's military contracts, and between 1982 and 1988 over 1800 people were arrested

Furthermore, when those who engaged in such civil disobedience were brought into court, they often found sympathetic support from juries, winning acquittals from ordinary citizens who seemed to understand that even if they had technically broken the law, they had done so in a good cause

In 1984, a group of Vermont citizens (the ""Winooski Forty-four"") refused to leave the hallway outside a U.S. Senator's office, protesting his votes to give arms to the Nicaraguan contras. They were arrested, but at their trial they were treated sympathetically by the judge and acquitted by the jury

At another trial shortly after, a number of people (including activist Abbie Hoffman and Amy Carter, daughter of former President Jimmy Carter) were charged with blocking CIA recruiters at the University of Massachusetts. They called to the witness stand ex-CIA agents who told the jury that the CIA had engaged in illegal and murderous activities all around the world. The jury acquitted them

One juror, a woman hospital worker, said later: ""I was not familiar with the CIA's activities.... I was shocked.... I was kind of proud of the students."" Another juror said: ""It was very educational."" The county district attorney, prosecuting the case, concluded: ""If there is a message, it was that this jury was composed of middle America.. .. Middle America doesn't want the CIA doing what they are doing.""

In the South, while there was no great movement comparable to the civil rights movement of the Sixties, there were hundreds of local groups organizing poor people, white and black. In North Carolina, Linda Stout, the daughter of a mill worker who had died of industrial poisons, coordinated a multiracial network of 500 textile workers, farmers, maids—most of them low-income women of color—in the Piedmont Peace Project

The historic Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, which had nurtured so many black and white activists throughout the South, was now joined by other folk schools and popular education centers

Anne Braden, a veteran of racial and labor struggles in the South, was still organizing, leading the Southern Organizing Committee for Economic and Social Justice. The group gave help in local actions: to 300 African-Americans in Tift County, Georgia, who were protesting the existence of a chemical plant which was making them sick; to Native Americans in Cherokee County, North Carolina, who were organizing to stop a polluted landfill

Back in the sixties, Chicane farm workers, people of Mexican descent who came to work and live mostly in California and the Southwestern states, rebelled against their feudal working conditions. They went out on strike and organized a national boycott of grapes, under the leadership of Cesar Chavez. Soon farmworkers were organizing in other parts of the country

In the seventies and eighties, their struggles against poverty and discrimination continued. The Reagan years hit them hard, as it did poor people all over the country. By 1984, 42 percent of all Latino children and one-fourth of the families lived below the poverty line

Copper miners in Arizona, mostly Mexican, went on strike against the Phelps-Dodge company after it cut wages, benefits, and safety measures in 1983. They were attacked by National Guardsmen and state troopers, by tear gas and helicopters, but held out for three years until a combination of governmental and corporate power finally defeated them

There were victories too. In 1985, 1700 cannery workers, most of them Mexican women, went on strike in Watsonville, California, and won a union contract with medical benefits. In 1990 workers who had been laid off from the Levi Strauss company in San Antonio because the company was moving to Costa Rica called a boycott, organized a hunger strike, and won concessions. In Los Angeles, Latino janitors went on strike in 1990 and despite police attacks, won recognition of their union, a pay raise, and sick benefits

Latino and Latina activists (not necessarily Chicano, which refers to those of Mexican ancestry), through the eighties and early nineties, campaigned for better labor conditions, for representation in local government, for tenants' rights, for bilingual education in the schools. Kept out of the media, they organized a bilingual radio movement, and by 1991 had fourteen Latino stations in the country, twelve of them bilingual

In New Mexico, Latinos fought for land and water rights against real estate developers who tried to throw them off land they had lived on for decades. In 1988 there was a confrontation, and the people organized an armed occupation, built bunkers for protection against attack, and won support from other communities in the Southwest; finally, a court ruled in their favor

Abnormal rates of cancer for farmworkers in California aroused the Chicano community. Cesar Chavez of the United Farm Workers fasted for thirty-five days in 1988 to call attention to these conditions. There were now United Farm Workers unions in Texas, Arizona, and other states

The importation of Mexican workers for low wages, under terrible conditions, spread from the Southwest to other parts of the country. By 1991, 80,000 Latinos lived in North Carolina, 30,000 in north Georgia. The Farm Labor Organizing Committee, which had won a difficult strike in the Ohio tomato fields in 1979, the largest agricultural strike ever in the Midwest, brought thousands of farmworkers together in several Midwest states

As the Latino population of the country kept growing, it soon matched the 12 percent of the population that was African-American and began to have a distinct effect on American culture. Much of its music, art, and drama was much more consciously political and satirical than mainstream culture

The Border Arts workshop was formed in 1984 by artists and writers in San Diego and Tijuana, and its work dealt powerfully with issues of racism and injustice. In Northern California, Teatro Campesino and Teatro de la Esperanza performed for working people all over the country, turning schoolhouses, churches, and fields into theaters

Latinos were especially conscious of the imperial role the United States had played in Mexico and the Caribbean, and many of them became militant critics of U.S. policy toward Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Cuba. In 1970 a great march in Los Angeles against the Vietnam war, which had been attacked by police, left three Chicanos dead

When the Bush administration was preparing for war against Iraq in the summer of 1990, thousands of people in Los Angeles marched along the same route they had taken twenty years before, when they were protesting the Vietnam war. As Elizabeth Martinez wrote (500 Years of Chicano History in Pictures):

Before and during President Bush's war in the Persian Gulf many people- including Raza [literally ""race""; a term adopted by Latino activists]-had doubts about it or were opposed. We had learned some lessons about wars started in the name of democracy that turned out to benefit only the rich and powerful. Raza mobilized to protest this war of mass murder, even faster than the U.S. war in Vietnam, though we could not stop it

In 1992, a fund-raising group which came out of the Vietnam war called Resist made donations to 168 organizations around the country- community groups, peace groups, Native American groups, prisoners' rights organizations, health and environmental groups

A new generation of lawyers, schooled in the sixties, constituted a small but socially conscious minority within the legal profession. They were in court defending the poor and the helpless, or bringing suit against powerful corporations. One law firm used its talent and energy to defend whistleblowers—men and women who were fired because they ""blew the whistle"" on corporate corruption that victimized the public

The women's movement, which had managed to raise the consciousness of the whole nation on the issue of sexual equality, faced a powerful backlash in the eighties. The Supreme Court's defense of abortion rights in its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision aroused a pro-life movement that had strong supporters in Washington. Congress passed, and the Supreme Court later let stand, a law that eliminated federal medical benefits to help poor women pay for abortions. But the National Organization of Women and other groups remained strong; in 1989, a Washington rally for what had come to be known as the right to choose drew over 300,000 people. When, in 1994 and 1995, abortion clinics were attacked and several supporters murdered, the conflict became grimly intense

The rights of gay and lesbian Americans had come vividly to the forefront in the Seventies with radical changes in ideas about sexuality and freedom. The gay movement then became a visible presence in the nation, with parades, demonstrations, campaigns for the elimination of state statutes discriminating against homosexuals. One result was a growing literature about the hidden history of gay life in the United States and in Europe

In 1994, there was a Stonewall 25 march in Manhattan, which commemorated an event homosexuals regarded as a turning point: twenty-five years earlier, gay men fought back vigorously against a police raid on the Stonewall bar in Greenwich Village. In the early nineties, gay and lesbian groups campaigned more openly, more determinedly, against discrimination, and for more attention to the scourge of AIDS, which they claimed was being given only marginal attention by the national government

In Rochester, New York, a local campaign achieved an unprecedented decision barring military recruiters from a school district because of the Defense Department discrimination against gay soldiers

The labor movement in the eighties and nineties was considerably weakened by the decline of manufacturing, by the flight of factories to other countries, by the hostility of the Reagan administration and its appointees on the National Labor Relations Board. Yet organizing continued, especially among white collar workers and low-income people of color. The AFL-CIO put on hundreds of new organizers to work among Latinos, African-Americans, and Asian-Americans

Rank-and-file workers in old, stagnant unions began to rebel. In 1991, the notoriously corrupt leadership of the powerful Teamsters Union was voted out of office by a reform slate. The new leadership immediately became a force in Washington, and took the lead in working for independent political coalitions outside the two major parties. But the labor movement as a whole, much diminished, was struggling for survival

Against the overwhelming power of corporate wealth and governmental authority, the spirit of resistance was kept alive in the early nineties, often by small-scale acts of courage and defiance. On the West Coast, a young activist named Keith McHenry and hundreds of others were arrested again and again for distributing free food to poor people without a license. They were part of a program called Food Not Bombs. More Food Not Bombs groups sprang up in communities around the country

In 1992, a New York group interested in revising traditional ideas about American history received approval from the New York City Council to put up thirty metal plaques high on lampposts around the city. One of them, placed opposite the Morgan corporate headquarters, identified the famous banker J.P. Morgan as a Civil War ""draft dodger."" In fact, Morgan had avoided the draft and profited in business deals with the government during the war. Another plaque, placed near the Stock Exchange, portrayed a suicide and carried the label ""Advantage of an Unregulated Free Market.""

The general disillusionment with government during the Vietnam years and the Watergate scandals, the exposure of anti-democratic actions by the FBI and the CIA, led to resignations from government and open criticism by former employees

A number of former CIA officials left the agency, and wrote books critical of its activities. John Stockwell, who had headed the CIA operation in Angola, resigned, wrote a hook exposing the CIA's activities, and lectured all over the country about his experiences. David MacMichael, a historian and former CIA specialist, testified at trials on behalf of people who had protested government policy in Central America

FBI Agent Jack Ryan, a twenty-one-year veteran of the bureau, was fired when he refused to investigate peace groups. He was deprived of his pension and for some time had to live in a shelter for homeless people

Sometimes the war in Vietnam, which had ended in 1975, came back to public attention in the eighties and nineties through people who had been involved in the conflicts of that day. Some of them had since made dramatic turnabouts in their thinking. John Wall, who prosecuted Dr. Benjamin Spock and four others in Boston for ""conspiring"" to obstruct the draft, showed up at a dinner honoring the defendants in 1994, saying the trial had changed his ideas

Even more striking was the statement by Charles Hutto, a U.S. soldier who had participated in the atrocity known as the My Lai massacre, in which a company of American soldiers shot to death women and children by the hundreds in a tiny Vietnamese village. Interviewed in the eighties, Hutto told a reporter:

I was nineteen years old, and I'd always been told to do what the grown-ups told me to do. , . . But now I'll tell my sons, if the government calls, to go, to serve their country, but to use their own judgment at times ... to forget about authority ... to use their own conscience. I wish somebody had told me that before I went to Vietnam. I didn't know. Now I don't think there should be even a thing called war ... cause it messes up a person's mind

It was this legacy of the Vietnam war-the feeling among a great majority of Americans that it was a terrible tragedy, a war that should not have been fought-that plagued the Reagan and Bush administrations, which still hoped to extend American power around the world

In 1985, when George Bush was Vice-President, former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger had warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: ""Vietnam brought a sea change in domestic attitudes ... a breakdown in the political consensus behind foreign policy. . ..""

When Bush became President, he was determined to overcome what came to be called the Vietnam syndrome-the resistance of the American people to a war desired by the Establishment. And so, he launched the air war against Iraq in mid-January 1991 with overwhelming force, so the war could be over quickly, before there was time for a national antiwar movement to develop

The signs of a possible movement were there in the months of the prewar buildup. On Halloween, 600 students marched through downtown Missoula, Montana, shouting ""Hell no, we won't go!"" In Shreveport, Louisiana, despite the Shreveport Journal's front-page headline: ""Poll Favors Military Action,"" the story was that 42 percent of the respondents thought the U.S. should ""initiate force"" and 41 percent said ""wait and see.""

The November 11, 1990, Veterans Parade in Boston was joined by a group called Veterans for Peace, carrying signs: ""No More Vietnams. Bring 'Em Home Now"" and ""Oil and Blood Do Not Mix, Wage Peace."" The Boston Globe reported that ""the protesters were greeted with respectful applause and, at some places, strong demonstrations of support by onlookers."" One of those onlookers, a woman named Mary Belle Dressier, said: ""Personally, parades that honor the military are somewhat troublesome to me because the military is about war, and war is troublesome to me.""

Most Vietnam veterans were supporting military action, but there was a strong dissident minority. In one survey that showed 53 percent of the veterans polled saying they would gladly serve in the Gulf War, 37 percent said they would not

Perhaps the most famous Vietnam veteran, Ron Kovic, author of Born on the Fourth of July, made a thirty-second television speech as Bush moved toward war. In the appeal, broadcast on 200 television stations in 120 cities across the country, he asked all citizens to ""stand up and speak out"" against war. ""How many more Americans coming home in wheelchairs—like me—will it take before we learn?""

That November of 1990, several months into the Kuwait crisis, college students in St. Paul, Minnesota, demonstrated against war. The local press reported:

It was a full-blown antiwar demonstration with mothers pushing kids in strollers, college professors and grade school teachers carrying signs, peace activists bedecked in peace symbols, and hundreds of students from a dozen schools singing, beating drums and chanting, ""Hey, hey, ho ho, we won't fight for Amoco.""

Ten days before the bombing began, at a town meeting in Boulder, Colorado, with 800 people present, the question was put: ""Do you support Bush's policy for war?"" Only four people raised their hands. A few days before the war began, 4100 people in Santa Fe, New Mexico, blocked a four-lane highway for an hour, asking that there be no war. Residents said this was larger than any demonstration in the Vietnam era

On the eve of war, 6000 people marched through Ann Arbor, Michigan, to ask for peace. On the night the war began, 5000 people gathered in San Francisco to denounce the war and formed a human chain around the Federal Building. Police broke the chain by swinging their clubs at the hands of the protesters. But the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution declaring the city and county a sanctuary for those who for ""moral, ethical or religious reasons cannot participate in war.""

The night before Bush gave the order to launch the bombing, a seven-year-old girl in Lexington, Massachusetts, told her mother she wanted to write a letter to the President. Her mother suggested it was late and she should write the next day. ""No, tonight,"" the girl said. She was still learning to write, so she dictated a letter:

Dear President Bush. I don't like the way you are behaving. If you would make up your mind there won't be a war we won't have to have peace vigils. If you were in a war you wouldn't want to get hurt. What I'm saying is: I don't want any fighting to happen. Sincerely yours, Serena Kabat

After the bombing of Iraq began along with the bombardment of public opinion, the polls showed overwhelming support for Bush's action, and this continued through the six weeks of the war. But was it an accurate reflection of the citizenry's long-term feelings about war? The split vote in the polls just before the war reflected a public still thinking its opinion might have an effect. Once the war was on, and clearly irreversible, in an atmosphere charged with patriotic fervor (the president of the United Church of Christ spoke of ""the steady drumbeat of war messages""), it was not surprising that a great majority of the country would declare its support

Nevertheless, even with little time to organize, and with the war over very fast, there was an opposition-a minority for sure, but a determined one, and with the potential to grow. Compared to the first months of the military escalation in Vietnam, the movement against the Gulf War expanded with extraordinary speed and vigor

That first week of the war, while it was clear most Americans were supporting Bush's action, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in protest, in towns and cities all over the country. In Athens, Ohio, over 100 people were arrested, as they clashed with a prowar group. In Portland, Maine, 500 marched wearing white arm bands or carrying white paper crosses with one word, ""Why?,"" written in red

At the University of Georgia, 70 students opposed to the war held an all-night vigil, and in the Georgia Legislature, Representative Cynthia McKinnon made a speech attacking the bombing of Iraq, leading many of the other legislators to walk off the floor. She held her ground, and it seemed that there had been at least some change In thinking since Representative Julian Bond was expelled from the very same legislature for criticizing the war in Vietnam during the 1960s. At a junior high school in Newton, Massachusetts, 350 students marched to city hall to present a petition to the mayor declaring their opposition to the war in the Gulf. Clearly, many were trying to reconcile their feelings about war with their sympathy for soldiers sent to the Middle East. A student leader, Carly Baker, said: ""We don't think bloodshed is the right way. We are supporting the troops and are proud of them, but we don't want war.""

In Ada, Oklahoma, while East Central Oklahoma State University was ""adopting"" two National Guard units, two young women sat quietly on top of the concrete entrance gate with signs that read ""Teach Peace ... Not War."" One of them, Patricia Biggs, said: ""I don't think we should be over there. I don't think it's about justice and liberty, I think it's about economics. The big oil corporations have a lot to do with what is going on over there. . . . We are risking people's lives for money.""

Four days after the United States launched its air attack, 75,000 people (the estimate of the Capitol Police) marched in Washington, rallying near the White House to denounce the war. In Southern California, Ron Kovic addressed 6000 people who chanted ""Peace Now!"" In Fayetteville, Arkansas, a group supporting military policy was confronted by the Northwest Arkansas Citizens Against War, who marched carrying a flag-draped coffin and a banner that read ""Bring Them Home Alive.""

Another disabled Vietnam veteran, a professor of history and political science at York College in Pennsylvania named Philip Avillo, wrote in a local newspaper: ""Yes, we need to support our men and women under arms. But let's support them by bringing them home; not by condoning this barbarous, violent policy."" In Salt Lake City, hundreds of demonstrators, many with children, marched through the city's main streets chanting antiwar slogans

In Vermont, which had just elected Socialist Bernie Sanders to Congress, over 2000 demonstrators disrupted a speech by the governor at the state house, and in Burlington, Vermont's largest city, 300 protesters walked through the downtown area, asking shop owners to close their doors in solidarity

On January 26, nine days after the beginning of the war, over 150,000 people marched through the streets of Washington, D.C., and listened to speakers denounce the war, including the movie stars Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. A woman from Oakland, California, held up the folded American flag that was given to her when her husband was killed in Vietnam, saying, ""I learned the hard way there is no glory in a folded flag.""

Labor unions had supported the war in Vietnam for the most part, but after the bombing started in the Gulf, eleven affiliates of the AFL-CIO, including some of its more powerful unions—like steel, auto, communications, chemical workers—spoke out against the war

The black community was far less enthusiastic than the rest of the country about what the U.S. Air Force was doing to Iraq. An ABC News/Washington Post poll in early February, 1991, found that support for the war was 84 percent among whites, but only 48 percent among African-Americans

When the war had been going on for a month, with Iraq devastated by the incessant bombing, there were feelers from Saddam Hussein that Iraq would withdraw from Kuwait if the United States would stop its attacks. Bush rejected the idea, and a meeting of black leaders in New York sharply criticized him, calling the war ""an immoral and unspiritual diversion ... a blatant evasion of our domestic responsibilities.""

In Selma, Alabama, which had been the scene of bloody police violence against civil rights marchers twenty-six years before, a meeting to observe the anniversary of that ""bloody Sunday"" demanded that ""our troops be brought home alive to fight for justice at home.""

The father of a twenty-one-year-old Marine in the Persian Gulf, Alex Molnar, wrote an angry open letter, published in the New York Time, to President Bush:

Where were you, Mr. President, when Iraq was killing its own people with poison gas? Why, until the recent crisis, was it business as usual with Saddam Hussein, the man you now call a Hitler? Is the American ""way of life"" that you say my son is risking his life for the continued ""right"" of Americans to consume 25 to 30 percent of the world's oil? ... I intend to support my son and his fellow soldiers by doing everything I can to oppose any offensive American military action in the Persian Gulf

There were courageous individual acts by citizens, speaking out in spite of threats

Peg Mullen, of Brownsville, Texas, whose son had been killed by ""friendly fire"" in Vietnam, organized a busload of mothers to protest in Washington, in spite of a warning that her house would be burned down if she persisted

The actress Margot Kidder (""Lois Lane"" in the Superman films), despite the risk to her career, spoke out eloquently against the war

A basketball player for Seton Hall University in New Jersey refused to wear the American flag on his uniform, and when he became the object of derision for this, he left the team and the university, and returned to his native Italy

More tragically, a Vietnam veteran in Los Angeles set fire to himself and died, to protest the war

In Amherst, Massachusetts, a young man carrying a cardboard peace sign knelt on the town common, poured two cans of flammable fluid on himself, struck two matches, and died in the flames. Two hours later, students from nearby universities gathered on the common for a candlelight vigil, and placed peace signs at the site of death. One of the signs read, ""Stop this crazy war.""

There was no time, as there had been during the Vietnam conflict, for a large antiwar movement to develop in the military. But there were men and women who defied their commanders and refused to participate in the war

When the first contingents of U.S. troops were being sent to Saudi Arabia, in August of 1990, Corporal Jeff Patterson, a twenty-two-year-old Marine stationed in Hawaii, sat down on the runway of the airfield and refused to board a plane bound for Saudi Arabia. He asked to be discharged from the Marine Corps:

I have come to believe that there are no justified wars.... I began to question exactly what I was doing in the Marine Corps about the time I began to read about history. I began to read up on America's support for the murderous regimes of Guatemala, Iran under the Shah, and El Salvador.... I object to the military use of force against any people, anywhere, any time

Fourteen Marine Corps reservists at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, filed for conscientious objector status, despite the prospect of a court-martial for desertion. A lance corporal in the Marines, Erik Larsen, issued a statement:

I declare myself a conscientious objector. Here is my sea bag full of personal gear. Here is my gas mask. I no longer need them. I am no longer a Marine. ... It, to me, is embarrassing to fight for a way of life in which basic human needs, like a place to sleep, one hot meal a day and some medical attention, cannot even be met in our nation's capital

Corporal Yolanda Huet-Vaughn, a physician who was a captain in the Army Reserve Medical Corps, a mother of three young children, and a member of the Physicians for Social Responsibility, was called to active duty in December 1990, a month before the start of the war. She replied: ""I am refusing orders to be an accomplice in what I consider an immoral, inhumane and unconstitutional act, namely an offensive military mobilization in the Middle East."" She was court-martialed, convicted of desertion, and sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison

Another soldier, Stephanie Atkinson of Murphysboro, Illinois, refused to report for active duty, saying she thought the U.S. military was in the Persian Gulf solely for economic reasons. She was first placed under house arrest, then given a discharge under ""other than honorable conditions.""

An Army physician named Harlow Ballard, stationed at Fort Devens in Massachusetts, refused to follow an order to go to Saudi Arabia. ""I would rather go to jail than support this war,"" he said. ""I don't believe there is any such thing as a just war.""

Over a thousand reservists declared themselves conscientious objectors. A twenty-three-year-old Marine Corps reservist named Rob Calabro was one of them. ""My father tells me that he's ashamed of me, he screams at me that he's embarrassed by me. But I believe that killing people is morally wrong. I believe I'm serving my country more by being true to my conscience than by living a lie.""

An information network sprang up during the Gulf War to tell what was not being told in the major media. There were alternative newspapers in many cities. There were over a hundred community radio stations, able to reach only a fraction of those tuned in to the major networks but the only sources, during the Gulf War, of critical analyses of the war. An ingenious radio person in Boulder, Colorado, named David Barsamian recorded a speech by Noam Chomsky made at Harvard-a devastating critique of the war. He then sent the cassette out to his network of community stations, which were eager for a point of view different from the official one. Two young men in New Jersey then transcribed the talk, put it in pamphlet form, in a shape easily photocopied, and placed the pamphlets in bookstores all over the country

After ""victorious"" wars there is almost always a sobering effect, as the war fervor wears off, and citizens assess the costs and wonder what was gained. War fever was at its height in February 1991. In that month, when people being polled were reminded of the huge costs of the war, only 17 percent said the war was not worth it. Four months later, in June, the figure was 30 percent. In the months that followed, Bush's support in the nation dropped steeply, as economic conditions deteriorated. (And in 1992, with the war spirit evaporated, Bush went down to defeat.)

After the disintegration of the Soviet bloc began in 1989, there had been talk in the United States of a ""peace dividend,"" the opportunity to take billions of dollars from the military budget and use it for human needs. The war in the Gulf became a convenient excuse for the government determined to stop such talk. A member of the Bush administration said: ""We owe Saddam a favor. He saved us from the peace dividend"" (New York Time, March 2, 1991)

But the idea of a peace dividend could not be stifled so long as Americans were in need. Shortly after the war, historian Marilyn Young warned:

The U.S. can destroy Iraq's highways, but not build its own; create the conditions for epidemic in Iraq, but not offer health care to millions of Americans. It can excoriate Iraqi treatment of the Kurdish minority, but not deal with domestic race relations; create homelessness abroad but not solve it here; keep a half million troops drug free as part of a war, but refuse to fund the treatment of millions of drug addicts at home. ... We shall lose the war after we have won it

In 1992, the limits of military victory became apparent during the quincentennial celebrations of Columbus's arrival in the Western Hemisphere. Five hundred years ago Columbus and his fellow conquerors had wiped out the native population of Hispaniola. This was followed during the next four centuries by the methodical destruction of Indian tribes by the United States government as it marched across the continent. But now, there was a dramatic reaction

The Indians—the Native Americans—had become a visible force since the sixties and seventies, and in 1992 were joined by other Americans to denounce the quincentennial celebrations. For the first time in all the years that the country had celebrated Columbus Day, there were nationwide protests against honoring a man who had kidnapped, enslaved, mutilated, murdered the natives who greeted his arrival with gifts and friendship

Preparations for the quincentennial began on both sides of the controversy. Official commissions, nationally and in the states, were set up long before the year of the quincentennial

This spurred action by Native Americans. In the summer of 1990 350 Indians, representatives from all over the hemisphere, met in Quito, Ecuador, at the first intercontinental gathering of indigenous people in the Americas, to mobilize against the glorification of the Columbus conquest

The following summer, in Davis, California, over a hundred Native Americans gathered for a follow-up meeting to the Quito conference. They declared October 12, 1992, International Day of Solidarity with Indigenous People, and resolved to inform the king of Spain that the replicas of Columbus's three ships, the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria, ""will not receive permission from the Native Nations to land in the western hemisphere unless he apologizes for the original incursion 500 years ago. . ..""

The movement grew. The largest ecumenical body in the United States, the National Council of Churches, called on Christians to refrain from celebrating the Columbus quincentennial, saying, ""What represented newness of freedom, hope and opportunity for some was the occasion for oppression, degradation and genocide for others.""

The National Endowment for the Humanities funded a traveling exhibition called ""First Encounter,"" which romanticized the Columbus conquest. When the exhibition opened at the Florida Museum of National History, Michelle Diamond, a freshman at the University of Florida, climbed aboard a replica of one of Columbus's ships with a sign reading ""Exhibit Teaches Racism."" She said: ""It's a human issue—not just a Red [Indian] issue."" She was arrested and charged with trespassing, but demonstrations continued for sixteen days against the exhibit

A newspaper called Indigenous Thought began publication in early 1991 to create a link among all the counter-Columbus quincentenary activities. It carried articles by Native Americans about current struggles over land stolen by treaty

In Corpus Christi, Texas, Indians and Chicanos joined to protest the city's celebrations of the quincentennial. A woman named Angelina Mendez spoke for the Chicanos: ""The Chicano nation, in solidarity with our Indian brothers and sisters to the north, come together with them on this day to denounce the atrocity the U.S. government proposes in reenacting the arrival of the Spanish, more specifically the arrival of Cristobal Colon, to the shores of this land.""

The Columbus controversy brought an extraordinary burst of educational and cultural activity. A professor at the University of California at San Diego, Deborah Small, put together an exhibit of over 200 paintings on wood panels called ""1492."" She juxtaposed words from Columbus's diary with blown-up fragments from sixteenth-century engravings to dramatize the horrors that accompanied Columbus's arrival in the hemisphere. A reviewer wrote that ""it does remind us, in the most vivid way, of how the coming of Western-style civilization to the New World doesn't provide us with a sunny tale.""

When President Bush attacked Iraq in 1991, claiming that he was acting to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, a group of Native Americans in Oregon distributed a biting and ironic ""open letter"":

Dear President Bush. Please send your assistance in freeing our small nation from occupation. This foreign force occupied our lands to steal our rich resources. They used biological warfare and deceit, killing thousands of elders, children and women in the process. As they overwhelmed our land, they deposed our leaders and people of our own government, and in its place, they installed their own government systems that yet today control our daily lives in many ways. As in your own words, the occupation and overthrow of one small nation ... is one too many. Sincerely, An American Indian

The publication Rethinking Schools, which represented socially conscious schoolteachers all over the country, printed a 100-page book called Rethinking Columbus, featuring articles by Native Americans and others, a critical review of children's books on Columbus, a listing of resources for people wanting more information on Columbus, and more reading material on counter- quincentenary activities. In a few months, 200,000 copies of the book were sold

A Portland, Oregon, teacher named Bill Bigelow, who helped put together Rethinking Schools, took a year off from his regular job to tour the country in 1992, giving workshops to other teachers, so that they could begin to tell those truths about the Columbus experience that were omitted from the traditional books and class curricula

One of Bigelow's own students wrote to the publisher Allyn and Bacon with a critique of their history text The American Spirit:

I'll just pick one topic to keep it simple. How about Columbus. No, you didn't lie, but saying, ""Though they had a keen interest in the peoples of the Caribbean, Columbus and his crews were never able to live peacefully among them,"" makes it seem as if Columbus did no wrong. The reason for not being able to live peacefully is that he and crew took slaves and killed thousands of Indians for not bringing enough gold

Another student wrote: ""It seemed to me as if the publishers had just printed up some 'glory story' that was supposed to make us feel more patriotic about our country. . .. They want us to look at our country as great and powerful and forever right. . . .""

A student named Rebecca wrote: ""Of course, the writers of the books probably think it's harmless enough-what does it matter who discovered America, really.... But the thought that I have been lied to all my life about this, and who knows what else, really makes me angry.""

A group was formed on the West Coast called Italian-Americans Against Christopher Columbus, saying: ""When Italian-Americans identify with Native people ... we are bringing ourselves, each of us, closer to possible change in the world.""

In Los Angeles, a high school student named Blake Lindsey went before the city council to argue against celebrating the quincentennial. She spoke to the council about the genocide of the Arawaks, but she got no official response. However, when she told her story on a talk show, a woman phoned in who said she was from Haiti: ""The girl is right. We have no Indians left. At our last uprising in Haiti people destroyed the statue of Columbus. Let's have statues for the aborigines.""

There were counter-Columbus activities all over the country, unmentioned in the press or on television. In Minnesota alone, a listing of such activities for 1992 reported dozens of workshops, meetings, films, art shows. At Lincoln Center in New York City, on October 12, there was a performance of Leonard Lehrmann's New World: An Opera About What Columbus Did to the Indians. In Baltimore, there was a multimedia show about Columbus. In Boston and then in a national tour, the Underground Railway Theater performed The Christopher Columbus Follies to packed audiences

The protests, the dozens of new books that were appearing about Indian history, the discussions taking place all over the country, were bringing about an extraordinary transformation in the educational world. For generations, exactly the same story had been told all American schoolchildren about Columbus, a romantic, admiring story. Now, thousands of teachers around the country were beginning to tell that story differently

This aroused anger among defenders of the old history, who derided what they called a movement for ""political correctness"" and ""multicultural-ism."" They resented the critical treatment of Western expansion and imperialism, which they considered an attack on Western civilization. Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Education, William Bennett, had called Western civilization ""our common culture ... its highest ideas and aspirations.""

A much-publicized book by a philosopher named Allan Bloom, The Closing of the American Mind, expressed horror at what the social movements of the sixties had done to change the educational atmosphere of American universities. To him Western civilization was the high point of human progress, and the United States its best representative: ""America tells one story: the unbroken, ineluctable progress of freedom and equality. From its first settlers and its political foundings on, there has been no dispute that freedom and equality are the essence of justice for us.""

In the seventies and eighties, disabled people organized and created a movement powerful enough to bring about the passage by Congress of the Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an unprecedented piece of legislation, setting standards which would enable persons with disabilities to contest discrimination against them, and ensuring they would have access to places where their disabilities would otherwise bar them

In the civil rights movement, black people disputed that claim of America's standing for ""freedom and equality."" The women's movement had disputed that claim, too. And now, in 1992, Native Americans were pointing to the crimes of Western civilization against their ancestors. They were recalling the communitarian spirit of the Indians Columbus met and conquered, trying to tell the history of those millions of people who were here before Columbus, giving the lie to what a Harvard historian (Perry Miller) had called ""the movement of European culture into the vacant wilderness of America.""

As the United States entered the nineties, the political system, whether Democrats or Republicans were in power, remained in the control of those who had great wealth. The main instruments of information were also dominated by corporate wealth. The country was divided, though no mainstream political leader would speak of it, into classes of extreme wealth and extreme poverty, separated by an insecure and jeopardized middle class

Yet, there was, unquestionably, though largely unreported, what a worried mainstream journalist had called ""a permanent adversarial culture"" which refused to surrender the possibility of a more equal, more humane society. If there was hope for the future of America, it lay in the promise of that refusal",Howard Zinn,Common Featuring Mary J. Blige,2002,"[89, 99]",2

I've been waiting on freedom to ring hell but ain't a thang changed
And I lost my brother in the struggle, and then he lost his mother
And I'm thinking about it who's mine's who gone raise my brother
Not to be a thug, stay in school, don't use drugs
Who'll teach him right from wrong and show them boys, true love

Just up the road, a pale blue water tower
With ""I Love Jenny"" painted in bright green
Hey that's my Uncle Bill there by the courthouse
He'll be lowering the flag when the sun goes down

[Bridge]
And this is My town
(Nana na na na)
Yeah this is my town
(Nana na na na)
Hey!

[Chorus]
Where I was born
Where I was raised
Where I keep all my yesterdays
Where I ran off cause I got mad
And it came to blows with my old man
Well I came back and settled down
It's where they'll put me in the ground
Yeah this is My town
(Nana na na na)
Yeah this is My town
(Nana na na na)
My town

[Verse 2]
There ain't much going on here since they closed the mill
That whistle still blows every day at noon
A bunch of us still go down to the diner
I wonder if that Interstate's still coming through
But come Sunday morning service at the Church of Christ
Well there ain't an empty seat to be found

[Bridge]
And this is My town
(Nana na na na)
Yeah this is my town
(Nana na na na)

This is My town
(Nana na na na)
Yeah this is My town
(Nana na na na)
My town

[Verse 3]
Well I bought and painted up that rusty tractor
You can't miss it, it's sitting right there in our yard
The County came and took that water tower
And that's Jenny with a baby in the car
Well we're off to Sunday service at the Church of Christ
And if we want a seat we better leave right now
And maybe later me and ol' T-Roy will show you around, our town

Can't change it, so I guess I'm gon' pray for the world

Some take up off, without the chance, to make it at all
Who woulda thought Skinny'd be the one that's, makin' this call
Lord, help me out, tell me where I went wrong
I'm tryna find a righteous path, although it's, never been long
I gotta do it for my sons, they tellin' me, ""Daddy be strong""
We gon' make it through these hardtimes
Even though they go and they come
Ya absolutely right, for somethin' happen to me on last Tuesday night
It's plain as day, man they... with this World Trade
Naw brave any order but confoldure
Better make it home when nothin' seems to matter
That's when, see, everything can go - any which way

And you'd swear those words could heal
And as I looked up into those eyes, his vision borrows mine

For I feel I've held him for all of time, and he said

104,I'd Rather,"I thought sometime alone
Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that
I thought it was the end
Of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I loved at home to be alone (alone)
And I tried to find
Out if this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah

And then I met someone
And thought she could replace you
We got a long just fine
We wasted time because he was not you
We had a lot of fun
Though we knew we were faking
Love was not impressed with our connection they were all lies, all lies
So I'm here cause I found this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Who holds my heart

I can't blame you if you turn away from me, like I've done you
I can only prove the things I say with time
Please be mine

I'd rather have bad times with (please be mine) you
Than good times with someone else (I know)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm (anytime)
Than safe and warm by myself (so sure baby)
I'd rather have hard times to gether
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart (my heart)

I'd rather have bad times with you (surely)
Than good times with someone else (surely)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm (oh yeah)
Than safe and warm by myself (all by myself)
I'd rather have hard times together

[Verse 1]
Been around the whole world
Still ain't seen nothing like my neighborhood
Out of all of the fancy satin and silk
My white cotton feels so good
Searched high and low for a place
Where I can lay my burdens down
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like the peace that I have found

[Chorus]
In the Little things (in the little things)
And the joy they bring
In the Little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring

[Verse 2]
Simple as a phone call just to make it known
That you're gonna be a little late
Pure as a kiss on the cheek and a word
That everything will be okay
Call in the morning from my little sister
Singing to me happy birthday
When you quest for fortune and fame
Don't forget about the simple things

[Chorus]
In the Little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring
It's the Little things (its the little things)
And the joy

[Bridge]
Give some good food
Give me some cute shoes
Give me some peace of mind
Give me some sunshine
Give me some blue skies

[Verse 3]
Running round in circles
Lost my focus
Lost sight of my goals
I do this for the love of music
Not for the glitter and gold
Got everything that I prayed for
Even a little more
When I asked to learn humility
This is what I was told

[Chorus]
It's little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring
In the little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring

[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
If I can choose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states, where tomorrow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2-ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow

And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed

And, if I can flow, with you
Holdin dat dough after the studio I roll with you

Sacario the name awaits the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets

Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week

But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

[Sacario] And the shop's there?

[Angie Martinez]
If they don't got em, they don't make em (Sacario: True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes

So please forgive me I'm just stingy
But how can you blame me?

Cause you got me so into it
I'm gone but I don't understand
So amazing, captivating, elevating
Any way you try to put it I wanna be your man
So if you (if you wanna put me on)
I don't mind it's alright, I'm for it
I would so adore it
Nothing turns me on more than being with you

Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prob'ly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry

I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems
Victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now
And it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick
He's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her—she won't even be at your funeral (ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what, I am dead—dead to you as can be!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry

All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team

Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Diddy: Fabolous, talk to 'em

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I assume I'm so into you
Cause even before we hit the bedroom I was friends wit you
If they ask, I ain't got to say ""whom?"" in them interviews
My sweet thing never believe the rumors, that been ain't true
The fact I had numerous friends is true
But you was wifey, could change me to a groom in a minute boo
Maybe, my sense of humor gets into you
But girl, they could make a perfume from the scent of you
I wanna take you where it feel like June in December too
So what you think about Cancun 'til the winter through?
I don't know what the other consumers you been with do
I put a day aside, to go to Bloomy's and spend with you
Like any other man, I wanna zoom to the clinic too
But I wanna see if me and my junior's identical
A dude put a wound on the skin of you
I swear to everything, that same afternoon, I'll be in the news
Feel me?

[Verse 2: P. Diddy]
C'mere girl, come and take a walk with me
So I can take you places you don't often be
C'mon ma, come and get lost with me
As far as them other chicks, can't get them off of me
Everlastin', love in a whole 'nother fashion
All I'm askin, is let me cash in
Cause I'd give all the passion, all of the Sean John fashion
In orderly fashion, perhaps when
You figure out, exactly what Diddy 'bout
Cause we could take this whole city out
Now who gon' stop us, who gon' knock us?
Top us, we can't find coppers to lock us
Lear jets and choppers, love hella proper
Seperate the weak from the obso-lete, hard to keep, I got ya
I rocked ya, word to Big Poppa, I got ya, yeah

Get your mind right

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Well this newcomer's known, to move with the seasons
Couple winter lodges, few summer homes
I'm there for every ""ooh"", ""um"", and moan
And make sure when the new Hummer roams, the shoes come in chrome
I ain't new at buying white, yellow, and cucumber stones
That send chills through a woman bones, but life gets gruesome alone
Even though I got the kinda bread that won't matter if a few crumbs are blown
Flights, I done flew some alone
Now I wanna wake up everyday with you in a new number zone
Mama mia, it's you I'mma phone
Just to erase all the negative views from your dome
And I promise this fellas G, it's so gangsta it'll calm all that jealousy
And drama you tellin me, so mama come yell at me
So I can put the top down, and we can ""Cruise/Cruz"" like Tom and Penelope
My charm is a felony.......

[Verse 2]
It's always times like these when I think of you
And I wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong, and I don't belong
Livin' in your precious memory

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I'll need you
And I'll miss you
And now I wonder

[Chorus]
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Oh, 'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight

[Bridge]
I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't

[Verse 1 (Reprise)]
Makin' my way downtown
Walkin' fast, faces pass
And I'm homebound
Starin' blankly ahead
Just makin' my way
Makin' a way through the crowd

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And I still need you
I still miss you
And now I wonder

[Chorus]
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you

113,The Ketchup Song (Hey Hah),"BLACK SCREEN

A desert wind moans sadly.  From somewhere within the wind
comes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters
singing ""My Favorite Things."" A series of sepia images of
anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after
another on the screen.

In the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title
FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:

TITLE: ""He who makes a beast of himself Gets rid of the pain
Of being a man.""
Dr. Johnson

The VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:

DUKE (V/O)
We were somewhere around Barstow on
the edge of the desert when the
drugs began to take hold.

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

A red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black
screen.

EXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

THE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred
miles an hour.  THE STONES' ""Sympathy For the Devil"" blares.

AT THE WHEEL

STRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,
BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.

BESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND
WRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY
UNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.

The music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths
up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.

DUKE (V/O)
I remember saying something like:
""I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe
you should drive...""

GONZO starts shaving.

2.


DUKE (V/O)
Suddenly there was a terrible roar
all around us and the sky was full
of what looked like huge bats, all
swooping and screeching and diving
around the car...

Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The
reflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close
to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

DUKE (V/O)
... and a voice was screaming: Holy
Jesus!  What are these goddamn
animals?

CUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -

DUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere.
GONZO casually looks over...

GONZO
What are you yelling about?

DUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench
makes GONZO nick his face with his razor.

DUKE
Never mind.  It's your turn to drive.

DUKE (V/O)
No point mentioning these bats.  I
thought.  The poor bastard will see
them soon enough.

DUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,
frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A
MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles
through the impressive stash.

DUKE (V/O)
We had two bags of grass, seventy-
five pellets of mescaline, five
sheets of high powered blotter
acid, a salt shaker half full of
cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-
colored uppers, downers, screamers,
laughers... Also a quart of tequila,
a quart of rum, a case of beer, a
pint of raw ether and two dozen
amyls.

3.


DUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the
SHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with
another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives
back into the car.

DUKE (V/O)
Not that we needed all that for the
trip, but once you get locked into
a serious drug collection, the
tendency is to push it as far as
you can.

THE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,
weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A
BAT?

EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

IN THE RED SHARK

GONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a
lousy driver.

DUKE (V/O)
The only thing that really worried
me was the ether.  There is nothing
in the world more helpless and
irresponsible and depraved than a
man in the depths of an ether binge.
And I knew we'd get into that
rotten stuff pretty soon.

The radio news wars with ""SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL"" on a tape
recorder.

RADIO NEWS
An overdose of heroin was listed as
the official cause of death for
pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby
whose body was found stuffed in a
refrigerator last week...

GONZO changes the station - ""ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET
JESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE"" vies with ""SYMPATHY""... He
sings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.
The RED SHARK fishtails.

GONZO
""One toke over the line, sweet
Jesus.""

4.


DUKE
(muttering to himself)
One toke.  You poor fool.  Wait
till you see those goddamn bats.

UP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD

A LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a
thumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down
the road...

GONZO
Let's give that boy a lift.

GONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side
of the road.

DUKE
We can't stop here - this is bat
country!

GONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The
HITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.

HITCHHIKER
Hot damn!  I never rode in a
convertible before!

Then the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the
sight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-
NORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.

DUKE
Is that right?  Well, I guess
you're about ready, eh?

The HITCHHIKER hesitates.

GONZO
We're your friends.  We're not like
the others.

DUKE
(hissing sharply)
No more of that talk or I'll put
the leeches on you.

DUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.

EXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

The HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED
SHARK screams down the road.

5.


GONZO sings along to the tape player.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out
and taking his chances.

DUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear
view mirror.

DUKE (V/O)
How long could we maintain, I
wondered.  How long before one of
us starts raving and jabbering at
this boy?  What will he think then?
This same lonely desert was the
last known home of the Manson family.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling
down GONZO's neck.

DUKE (V/O)
Would he make that grim connection
when my attorney starts screaming
about bats and huge manta rays
coming down on the car?

DUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with
the words, sometimes not.

DUKE (V/O)
If so - well, we'll just have to
cut his head off and bury him
somewhere.  Because it goes without
saying that we can't turn him loose.
He'd report us at once to some kind
of outback Nazi law enforcement
agency, and they'll run us down
like dogs...

DUKE
(out loud to himself)
Jesus!  Did I say that?

DUKE (V/O)
Or just think it?  Was I talking?
Did they hear me?

GONZO
(reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)
It's okay.  He's admiring the shape
of your skull.

DUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER
giggles nervously.

6.


DUKE (V/O)
Maybe I better have a chat with
this boy I thought.  Perhaps if I
explain things, he'll rest easy...

DUKE
(roaring over the
road noise)
THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY UNDERSTAND --

The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.

DUKE
(yells)
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs
into the back seat.

DUKE
That's good.  Because I want you to
have all the background.  This is a
very ominous assignment -- with
overtones of extreme personal
danger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!
This is important, goddamnit!  This
is a true story!...
(WHACKS the BACK OF
THE DRIVER'S SEAT
with his fist)


The CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.

GONZO
(screams)
Keep your hands off my fucking neck!

The HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS
HIM BACK DOWN.

DUKE (V/O)
Our vibrations were getting nasty --
but why?  Was there no communication
in this car?  Had we deteriorated
to the level of dumb beasts?

The HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.

7.


DUKE
(to HITCHHIKER)
I want you to understand that this
man at the wheel is my attorney!
He's not just some dingbat I found
on the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I
think he's probably Samoan.  But it
doesn't matter, does it?  Are you
prejudiced?

HITCHHIKER
Hell, no!

DUKE
I didn't think so.  Because in
spite of his race, this man is
extremely valuable to me.  Hell, I
forgot all about this beer.  You
want one?
(HITCHHIKER shakes
his head)
How about some ether?

HITCHHIKER
What?

DUKE
Never mind.  Let's get right to the
heart of this thing.  Twenty-four
hours ago we were sitting in the
Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills
Hotel...

INT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY

A uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE
through the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They
are the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL
BOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore
Slings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED
VERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.

DUKE (V/O)
... in the patio section, of
course, drinking Singapore Slings
with mescal on the side, hiding
from the brutish realities of this
foul year of Our Lord, 1971.

The DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and
shades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank
top undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious
conversation.

8.


DUKE
I'm telling you, the Salazar story
is getting too complicated.  The
weasels have started closing in.

The DWARF sneers.

DWARF
Perhaps this is the call you've
been waiting for all this time,
sir...

DUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...

DUKE
Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...

DUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A
MOVIE SPY.

DWARF
That was headquarters.  They want
me to go to Las Vegas at once and
make contact with a Portuguese
photographer named Lacerda.  He'll
have the details.  All I have to do
is check into my sound proof suite
and he'll seek me out.

GONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!

GONZO
God hell!  I think I see the
pattern!  This one sounds like real
trouble!  You're going to need
plenty of legal advice before this
thing is over.  As your attorney I
must advise you that you'll need a
very fast car with no top and after
that, the cocaine.  And then the
tape recorder, for special music,
and some Acapulco shirts...
(GONZO tucks his
khaki undershirt into
his white
bellbottoms -- he
means business!)
This blows my weekend, because
naturally I'll have to go with
you -- and we'll have to arm
ourselves.

9.


DUKE
Why not?  If a thing's worth doing,
it's worth doing right.

DUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them
with the (very large) check in his hand.

They sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it
swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.

DUKE
I tell you, my man.  This is the
American Dream in action!  We'd be
fools not to ride this strange
torpedo all the way to the end.

GONZO
Indeed.  We must do it.  What kind
of story is this?

EXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO emerge.

DUKE
The Mint 400!  The richest off-road
race for motorcycles and dune-
buggies in the history of organized
sport!
(handing parking
ticket to Valet)
-- a fantastic spectacle in honor
of some fatback grossero who owns
the luxurious Mint Hotel in the
heart of downtown Vegas... at least
that's what the press release says.

Their car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They
jump in.

DUKE
We're going to have to drum it up
on our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.

And they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-
bleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY

The PINTO races through shot.

DUKE (V/O)
Getting hold of the drugs and
shirts had been no problem...

10.


EXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY

The PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back
window full of Hawaiian shirts.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
... but the car and tape recorder
were not easy things to round up at
6:30 on a Friday afternoon in
Hollywood.

INT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY

TORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile
as GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four
Singapore Slings.

GONZO
O.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it.
We'll be there in thirty minutes.
(to DUKE -- hand over
the PHONE)
I finally located a car with
adequate horsepower and the proper
coloring.
(into PHONE)
What?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has
a major credit card!  Do you
realize who the fuck you're talking
to?

DUKE
Don't take any guff from these
swine.
(GONZO slams the
phone down)
Now we need a sound store with the
finest equipment.  Nothing dinky.
One of those new Belgian Heliowatts
with a voice-activated shotgun
mike, for picking up conversations
in oncoming cars.

GONZO
We won't make the nut unless we
have unlimited credit.

DUKE
We will.  You Samoans are all the
same.  You have no faith in the
essential decency of the white
man's culture.

11.


EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK

The PINTO races down street.

DUKE (V/O)
The store was closed, but the
salesman said he would wait, if we
hurried...

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK

They're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE
BANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.

DUKE (V/O)
But we were delayed en route when a
Stingray in front of us killed a
pedestrain.

Directly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered
corpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.

EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT

DUKE (V/O)
We had trouble, again, at the car
rental agency.

Behind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with
satisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out
a clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.

AGENT
Say... uh... you fellas are going
to be careful with this car, aren't
you?

DUKE
Of course.

DUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the
gas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.

AGENT
Well, good god!  You just backed
over that two foot concrete abutment
and you didn't even slow down!
Forty-five in reverse!  And you
barely missed the pump!

DUKE
No harm done.  I always test the
transmission that way.  The rear
end.  For stress factors.

12.


GONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box
of rum and ice into the RED SHARK.

AGENT
Say.  Are you fellows drinking?

DUKE
Not me.  We're responsible people.

He JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The
AGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.

GONZO
There's another worrier.  He's
probably all cranked up on speed.

EXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

STRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted
figures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.

DUKE (V/O)
We spent the rest of that night
rounding up materials and packing
the car.  Then we ate some mescaline
and went swimming.

The surf crashes in the distance...

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

DUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself
float up through the silvery bubbles...

DUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING
MOONLIT SURF.

DUKE (V/O)
Our trip was different.  It was to
be a classic affirmation of
everything right and true in the
national character; a gross,
physical salute to the fantastic
possibilities of life in this
country.  But only for those with
true grit...

EXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

DUKE's intense face.

DUKE
...and we're chock full of that!

13.


GONZO
Damn right!

DUKE
My attorney understands this
concept, despite his racial handicap.
But do you?!

The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.

DUKE (V/O)
He said he understood, but I could
see in his eyes that he didn't.  He
was lying to me.

GONZO
My heart!

GONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and
screeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.

GONZO (CONT'D)
Where's the medicine?

DUKE
The medicine?  Yes, it's right here.

DUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.

DUKE
Don't worry, this man has a bad
heart... Angina Pectoris.  But we
have a cure for it.

DUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO
falls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The
HITCHHIKER looks petrified.

GONZO
(suddenly flailing
his naked arms at the sky)
Turn up the fucking music!  My
heart feels like an alligator!
Volume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must
have bass!  What's wrong with us?
Are you goddamn old ladies?

DUKE
(turns up music to
full volume)
You scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch
your language!  You're talking to a
Doctor of Journalism!

14.


GONZO
(laughing uncontrollably)
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Somebody call the police!  We need
help!

DUKE
(to HITCHHIKER)
Pay no attention to this swine.  He
can't handle the medicine.
(he begins laughing)


GONZO
(to the HITCHHIKER)
The truth is we're going to Vegas
to croak a scag baron named Savage
Henry.  I've known him for years
but he ripped us off -- and you
know what that means, right?

GONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.

GONZO (CONT'D)
Savage Henry has cashed his check!
We're going to rip his lungs out!

DUKE
And eat them!  That bastard won't
get away with this!  What's going
on in this country when a scum
sucker like that can get away with
sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?

GONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.

The HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID,
AND FLEES.

HITCHHIKER
Thanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot.
I like you guys.  Don't worry about
me.

DUKE
(yells)
Wait a minute!  Come back and have
a beer!

The HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.

15.


GONZO
Good riddance.  That boy made me
nervous.  Did you see his eyes?
(laughing)
Jesus, this is good medicine.

DUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.

DUKE
(suddenly clambering
into the front seat)
Move over!!  We have to get out of
California before that kid finds a
cop!

DUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...

EXT. UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

THE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead
driving.

DUKE (V/O)
It was absolutely imperative that
we get to the Mint Hotel before the
deadline for press registration.
Otherwise, we might have to pay for
our suite.

GONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off
and the powder swirls away on the wind.

GONZO
Oh, Jesus!  Did you see what god
just did to us?

DUKE
God didn't do that!  You did it!
You're a fucking narcotics agent,
that was our cocaine, you pig!

GONZO
(waving his .357
Magnum at Duke)
You better be careful.  Plenty of
vultures out here.  They'll pick
your bones clean before morning.

DUKE
You whore!

GONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.

16.


GONZO
Here -- chew this.  It's your half
of the acid.

DUKE takes his half -- chews it.

DUKE
How long do I have?

GONZO
Maybe thirty more minutes.  As your
attorney, I advise you to drive at
top speed.  It'll be a goddamn
miracle if we can get there before
you turn into a wild animal.  Are
you ready for that?  Checking into
a Vegas hotel under a phony name
with intent to commit capital fraud
and a head full of acid.

DUKE (V/O)
Thirty minutes.  It was going to be
very close.

The RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard:
""DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20
YEARS; SALE - LIFE!!""

EXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK

The RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT.  A great banner
spanning the street announces the MINT 400.

DUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a
buckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the
TICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.

DUKE
I need this, right?

ATTENDANT
I'll remember your face.

DUKE stares -- losing it...

DUKE (V/O)
There is no way of explaining the
terror I felt.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

DUKE waits in line at the front desk -- RIGID WITH PENT UP
ENERGY.  GONZO's ahead of him -- muscling in -- trying to
queue jump and failing.

17.


DUKE (V/O)
I was pouring sweat.  My blood is
too thick for Nevada.  I've never
been able to properly explain
myself in this climate.

A COUPLE move off and DUKE jerks forward -- stops -- eyes
fixed on the stony FEMALE RESERVATIONS CLERK.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
Be quiet, be calm... name, rank,
and press affiliation, nothing
else...

DUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the
tension almost snapping him in two.  GONZO's FLAPPING
AROUND -- absolutely no success.

Something catches DUKE's eye... He REMAINS ROOTED -- his
eyes turning to the VEGETAL PAISLEY PATTERNS ON THE CARPET
WHICH ARE SHIFTING -- UNDULATING.  THE CARPET PATTERNS ARE
INEXORABLY CREEPING UP THE WALLS...

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
...ignore this terrible drug,
pretend it's not happening...

The LAST PEOPLE leave -- with A FINAL, STIFF MOVE, DUKE
comes face to face with the RESERVATIONS CLERK... AND
EXPLODES!

DUKE
HI THERE.  MY NAME... AH, RAOUL
DUKE... ON... ON THAT LIST, THAT'S
FOR SURE.  FREE LUNCH, FINAL
WISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE... WHY NOT?
I HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I
REALIZE OF COURSE...

As DUKE stares at her, BABBLING, her FACE BEGINS TO MORPH.
He tries to stop it happening by TALKING FASTER.

DUKE
... THAT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE
LIST, BUT WE MUST HAVE THAT SUITE.
YES.  JUST CHECK THE LIST AND
YOU'LL SEE.  DON'T WORRY.  WHAT'S
THE SCORE HERE?  WHAT'S NEXT?

DUKE sags -- grips the desk -- WHITE KNUCKLES.

18.


RESERVATIONS CLERK
(hands him an envelope)
Your suite's not ready yet.  But
there's somebody looking for you.

Her face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING...

DUKE
(shouts)
NO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
YET!

The FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN & GROWS FANGS.
DEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm
intensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.

GONZO
I can handle this.  This man has a
bad heart, but I have plenty of
medicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo.
Prepare our suite at once.  We'll
be in the bar.

GONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks
back -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green
jowls and fangs.

INT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY

The bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme.
DUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the
wall behind them.  DUKE has turned to stone...

GONZO
(to the bartender)
Two Cuba Libres with beer and
mescal on the side.
(opens the envelope)
Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us
in a room on the twelfth floor?

DUKE
Lacerda?

DUKE (V/O)
I couldn't remember.  The name rang
a bell, but I couldn't concentrate.
Terrible things were happening all
around us...

DUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY
onto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low.

19.


DUKE
Order some golf shoes.  Otherwise,
we'll never get out of this place
alive.  It's impossible to walk in
this muck -- no footing at all...

DUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared.

DUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED
into a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND
GNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER.

DUKE (V/O)
I was right in the middle of a
fucking reptile zoo.  And somebody
was giving booze to these goddamn
things!  It won't be long before
they tear us to shreds!

GONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER.

GONZO
If you think we're in trouble now
wait until you see what's happening
in the elevators.

GONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying...
as he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to
keep him in his line of vision.

GONZO
I just went upstairs to see this
man Lacerda.  I told him I knew
what he was up to...
(GONZO rallies --
turns fierce)
He says he's a photographer!  But
when I mentioned Savage Henry he
freaked!  He knows we're onto him!

DUKE
But what about our room?  And the
golf shoes?

A GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at
them, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS.

DUKE (CONT'D)
(grabbing GONZO
trying to hold him still)
Holy shit!  Look at that bunch over
there!  They've spotted us!

20.


Cut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing
next to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality.
GONZO is sitting in his original position.

GONZO
(downs his drink --
gets up)
That's the press table.  Where you
have to sign in for our credentials.
Shit, let's get it over with.  You
handle that, and I'll check on the
room.

DUKE
No, no.  Don't leave me!

Black screen.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK

A TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK,
protesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous
BELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.  A marlin spike is on
the floor next to DUKE.

BELL BOY
Four club sandwiches, four shrimp
cocktails.

DUKE
There's a big... machine in the
sky... some kind of electric snake...

DUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon
sign outside the window.  His eyes fill with a million
colored lights.

BELL BOY
... a quart of rum...

DUKE
... coming straight at us.

GONZO
Shoot it.

DUKE
Not yet.  I want to study its habits.

BELL BOY
... and nine fresh grapefruit.

21.


GONZO
Vitamin C.  We'll need all we can
get.

GONZO sees the BELL BOY out the door -- turns and lays into
DUKE.

GONZO
Look, you've got to stop this talk
about snakes and leeches and
lizards and that stuff.  It's
making me sick!

DUKE stares -- hears the drone of B52 BOMBERS...

On TV: The LAOS INVASION -- A SERIES OF HORRIFYING
DISASTERS -- EXPLOSIONS AND TWISTED WRECKAGE.

Newsreel footage of MAI LAI MASSACRE and the LIEUTENANT
CALLEY court-martial.

DUKE
What are you talking about?

GONZO
You bastard!  They'll never let us
back in that place.  I leave you
alone for three minutes and you
start waving that goddamn marlin
spike around -- yelling about
reptiles!  You scared the shit out
of those people!  They were ready
to call the cops.  Hell, the only
reason they gave us press passes
was to get you out of there...

A knock at the door.  DUKE and GONZO break out in a sweat.

DUKE
Oh my God!  Who's that?!

GONZO STICKS HIS GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND -- opens the door to
LACERDA -- BOUNCING WITH PUPPY DOG ENTHUSIASM.  GONZO stares
at a man he instantly hates -- watches him with deep
suspicion.

LACERDA
Duke?  I'm Lacerda your photographer.
Got your press passes?  Good, good.
Too bad you missed the bikes
checking in.  My, what a sight!

DUKE watches the B-52S DROP THEIR BOMB LOADS.

22.


Looking down to the thick, patterned carpet, DUKE sees the
BOMBS EXPLODE like vicious flowers.

DUKE looks up: LACERDA is a war photographer -- bruised,
filthy and blood spattered.  LACERDA approaches him --
talking a foreign language.

LACERDA
Husquavarnas.  Yamahas.  Kawaskis.
Maicos.  Pursang.  Swedish Fireballs.
Couple of Triumphs, here and there
a CZ.  All very fast.  What a race
it's gonna be.

DUKE screws up his eyes -- WILLS NORMALITY BACK.  LACERDA is
now just a keen photographer.L

LACERDA
Well, we start at dawn.  Get a good
night's sleep.  I know I will.

And with a cheerful wave, he's gone.  DUKE is in shock.

DUKE
(weakly)
That's good...

GONZO
I think he's lying to us.  I could
see it in his eyes.

DUKE
(even weaker)
They'll probably have a big net for
us when we show up.

DUKE's attention returns to the devastation on the TV...

GONZO
Turn that shit off!

GONZO kills the TV.

Black screen.

DUKE (V/O)
Never lose sight of the primary
responsibility.  Cover the story.
But what was the story?  Nobody had
bothered to say.

23.


EXT. DESERT - DAWN

Against A BIG ORANGE SUN, on a concrete slab, MEN FIRE
SHOTGUNS into the dawn sky.  Clay pigeons shatter.  The Mint
Gun Club.

Next to them, MOTORCYCLES REV -- preparing for the MINT 400
RACE: A hundred BIKERS, MECHANICS and assorted MOTORSPORT
TYPES milling around in the pit area; taping headlights,
topping off oil in the forks, last minute bolt tightening.

DUKE wanders through.

DUKE (V/O)
The racers were ready at dawn.
Very tense.  But the race didn't
start until nine so we had three
long hours to kill.

A sign by a long trestle table: ""KOFFEE & DONUTS."" DUKE
walks past -- ignoring the SMILING LADY behind the stall.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
Those of us who had been up all
night were in no mood for coffee
and donuts.  We wanted strong drink.
We were, after all, the Absolute
Cream of the National Sporting
Press and we were gathered here, in
Las Vegas, for a very special
assignment.  And when it comes to
things like this you don't fool
around.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

A real pit of iniquity.  Slot Machines.  Crap tables.  Smoke.
Drunken shouting.  The absolute cream of the NATIONAL
SPORTING PRESS.

DUKE is at the bar, engaged in drunken conversation with a
LIFE REPORTER...showing him his notebook.

DUKE
See...""Kill the body and the head
will die""... the Frazier/Ali fight...

MAGAZINE REPORTER
A proper end to the 60's... Ali
beaten by a human hamburger!

DUKE
And both Kennedy's murdered by
mutants.

24.


A SHOUT goes up from outside.  The sound of engines revving.

REPORTER
That's it!  They're starting!

In a sudden rush the PRESS CROWD make for the door taking
DUKE with them.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

MOTORCYCLES REV -- tension builds...

A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The MOTORCYCLES ROAR
AWAY.  A great cloud of dust goes up -- obscuring the RACERS
as they disappear into the desert...

A moment...

REPORTER
Well, that's that.  They'll be back
in an hour or so.  Let's go back to
the bar.

The CROWD turns and streams back into the tent.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

DUKE heads for the bar along with the REST.  It's packed.
Drinks are ordered.

A shout from outside the tent goes up:

VOICE OFF
Group 2!

The CROWD rushes for the door.  DUKE gets swept along.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

MOTORCYCLES REV.  A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The
MOTORCYCLES ROAR AWAY.  Another great cloud of dust goes up...

The CROWD head back for the bar.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

The CROWD surge back to the bar.

VOICE OFF
Group 3!

This time DUKE fights his way free of the CROWD.

25.


DUKE (V/O)
There was something like 190 more
bikes waiting to start.  They were
due to go off 10 at a time every 2
minutes.

DUKE hits the bar.

DUKE
Beer!

A middle-aged HOODLUM in a T-shirt booms up to the bar.

HOODLUM
God damn!  What day is this --
Saturday?

DUKE
More like Sunday.

HOODLUM
Hah!  That's a bitch, ain't it?
Last night I was home in Long Beach
and somebody said they were runnin'
the Mint 400 today, so I says to my
old lady, ""Man, I'm goin'."" So she
gives me a lot of crap about it, so
I start slappin' her around, and
the next thing you know two guys I
never seen before are beating me
stupid.

VOICE OFF
Group 4!

Outside, another batch of motorcycles roar away -- kicking
up more clouds of dust.

HOODLUM
Then they gave me ten bucks, put me
on a bus, and when I woke up here I
was in downtown Vegas, and for a
minute all I could think was, ""O
Jesus, who's divorcing me this
time?"" But then I remembered, by
God!  I was here for the Mint 400.
And, man, I tell you, it's wonderful
to be here.  Just wonderful to be
here with you people.

A silence.  A MAGAZINE REPORTER lunges across the bar --
grabs the BARTENDER.

26.


MAGAZINE REPORTER
Senzaman wassyneeds!

DUKE
(smacks the bar with
his palm)
Hell yes!  Bring us ten!

VOICE OFF
Group 5!

MAGAZINE REPORTER
(screams)
I'll back it!
(slides off his stool
to the floor)


Outside, motorcycles roar away.  The dust cloud billows into
the tent -- getting denser.

MAGAZINE REPORTER (CONT'D)
(on the floor)
This is a magic moment in sport!
It may never come again!  I once
did the Triple Crown, but it was
nothing like this.

A FROG-EYED WOMAN claws at the MAGAZINE REPORTER, tries to
haul him up.

FROG-EYED WOMAN
Please stand up!  You're a
correspondent for a major national
magazine who's name we can't get
clearance for!  Please!  You'd be a
very handsome man if you'd just
stand up!

MAGAZINE REPORTER
Listen, madam.  I'm damn near
intolerably handsome down here
where I am.  You'd go crazy if I
stood up!

A feverishly eager LACERDA appears out of the dust cloud, 3
cameras slung round his neck.

LACERDA
Club soda, please.

FROG-EYED WOMAN
(to MAGAZINE REPORTER)
Please!  I love Life!

27.


LACERDA
(to DUKE)
Man, it's great out there!

DUKE
Lunatics.

LACERDA grins.

VOICE OFF
Group 6!

LACERDA
Meet you outside!

LACERDA downs his drink -- hurries out through the crowd and
out into the cloud of dust.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Nothing.  Except for a THICK CLOUD OF DUST.

Barely visible, a motorcycle comes speeding into the pits.
The RIDER staggers off his bike.  The PIT CREW gas it up and
sends it back with a FRESH RIDER.

DUKE watches him disappear back into the dust cloud.

DUKE (V/O)
By 10 they were spread out all over
the course.  It was no longer a
race, now it was an Endurance
Contest.  The idea of trying to
""cover this race"" in any
conventional press sense was absurd.

A HORN HONKS.  A shiny BLACK BRONCO with DRIVER.  LACERDA
hangs out of the window.

LACERDA
It's great, isn't it?!  Jump in!

DUKE gets into the Bronco and they head into the DUST CLOUD.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

IN THE BRONCO.

DUKE hangs on with his beer.  Nothing all around but the
HUGE IMPENETRABLE CLOUD OF DUST.  LACERDA snaps madly away
at nothing at all!

28.


LACERDA
I'll just keep trying different
combos of film and lenses till I
find one that works in this dust!

The SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES RACING...

We hear music and voices singing:

BATTLE HYMN
""...As we go marching on
When I reach my final campground,
in
that land beyond the sun,
And the Great Commander asks me...""
[What did he ask you, Rusty?]
""Did you fight or did you run?""

A moment later, the Bronco races out of the dust.  DUKE
coughs, chokes, drinks beer.

BATTLE HYMN
(continuing)
[And what did you tell them,
Rusty?]
""We responded to their rifle fire
with everything we had...""

The sound of gun shots...

A DUNE BUGGY races toward them, loaded down with THREE
RETIRED PETTY OFFICERS, DRUNK AS HELL.  The radio blares:
""THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY.""

The dune buggy is COVERED WITH OMINOUS SYMBOLS: SCREAMING
EAGLES CARRYING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THEIR CLAWS.  A slant-eyed
Snake being chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and
stripes.  A MACHINE GUN MOUNT on the passenger side.  They
yell over the roaring engines.

DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
Where's the damn race?

DUKE
Beats me.  We're just good patriotic
Americans like yourself.

DUKE gives DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A NICE BIG GRIN.  In
response, the PASSENGER #2 narrows his eyes -- tightens his
grip on an automatic weapon.

DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
(suspiciously)
What outfit you fellas with?

29.


DUKE
The sporting press.  We're
friendlies.  Hired geeks.

The DRIVER and DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 exchange looks.

DUKE
If you want a good chase, you
should get after that skunk from
CBS News up ahead in the black jeep.
He's the man responsible for that
book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON.

DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #1
HOT DAMN!

DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2
A black jeep, you say?

And they ROAR away.

DUKE
Take me back to the pits.

LACERDA
No, no -- we have to go on.  We
need total coverage.

DUKE gets out of the Bronco.

DUKE
You're fired.

After a moment's hesitation, LACERDA and the BRONCO driver
roar away leaving DUKE alone in the cloud of dust.

DUKE (V/O)
It was time.  I felt, for an
Agonizing Reappraisal of the whole
scene.  The race was definitely
under way.  I had witnessed the
start; I was sure of that much.
But what now?

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT

MUSIC PUMPS OUT.  CRUISING IN THE RED SHARK IN VEGAS.  THE
SKY SWIRLS WITH MILLIONS OF NEON LIGHTS CHASING EACH OTHER
IN BAROQUE PATTERNS ACROSS GIGANTIC HOTEL SIGNS.  PSYCHEDELIC
LIGHT SHOWS TO LURE AND DERANGE THE INNOCENT.  CITY OF LOST
SOULS.

30.


DUKE
Turn up the radio!  Turn up the
tape machine!  Roll the windows
down.  Let's taste this cool desert
wind!  Aaah, yes!  This is what
it's all about!

DUKE, beer in hand, drives -- a big smile for the world.
GONZO scans The Vegas Visitor.

DUKE (V/O)
Total control now.  Tooling along
the main drag on a Saturday night
in Vegas, two good old boys in a
fire apple red convertible...
stoned, ripped, twisted... Good
people!

GONZO
How about ""Nickel Nick's Slot
Arcade?"" ""Hot Slots,"" that sounds
heavy.  Twenty-nine cent hotdogs...

DUKE
Look, what are we doing here?  Are
we here to entertain ourselves, or
to do the job?

GONZO
To do the job, of course.  Here we
go... a Crab Louie and quart of
muscatel for twenty dollars!

The Shark hits a bump.

GONZO
As your attorney I advise you to
drive over to the Tropicana and
pick up on Guy Lombardo.  He's in
the Blue Room with his Royal
Canadians.

They hit another bump.

DUKE
Why?

GONZO
Why what?

CUT to wide shot.  They are DRIVING AROUND IN CIRCLES in a
large casino parking lot, bumping over the dividers.

31.


DUKE
Why should I pay out my hard-earned
dollars to watch a fucking corpse.
I don't know about you, but in my
line of business it's important to
be Hep.

EXT. DESERT ROOM HOTEL - NIGHT

TWO BIG SCREAMING FACES.

DOORMAN #1
What the hell are you doing?!

DOORMAN #2
You can't park here!

DUKE
Why not?  Is this not a reasonable
place to park?

Reveal the RED SHARK parked on the sidewalk in front of the
Desert Inn.  TWO DOORMEN loom over the car hood.  The
MARQUEE says: TONIGHT.  DEBBIE REYNOLDS.

GONZO leaps from the car, waving a five-dollar bill at the
DOORMAN.

GONZO
We want this car parked!  We drove
all the way from L.A. for this show.
We're friends of Debbie's.

A pause, then... the DOORMAN pockets the bill, hands them a
parking stub.  DUKE and GONZO hurry into the hotel.

INT. DESERT FROM HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO walk through the lobby.  Black, mirrored,
sleek, classy.

DUKE
Holy shit!  They almost had us
there!  That was quick thinking.

GONZO
What do you expect?  I'm your
attorney.  You owe me five bucks.
I want it now.

DUKE shrugs and hands over the $5.

32.


DUKE (V/O)
This was Bob Hope's turf.  Frank
Sinatra's.  Spiro Agnew's.  It
seemed inappropriate to be haggling
about nickel/dime bribes for the
parking lot attendant.

A WINE-COLORED TUXEDO stops them at the entrance to the
ballroom.

WINE-COLORED TUXEDO
Sorry, full house.

GONZO
Goddamnit, we drove all the way
from L.A.

WINE-COLORED TUXEDO
I said there are no seats left...
at any price.

GONZO
Fuck seats!  We're old friends of
Debbie's.  I used to romp with her.

GONZO and the WINE-COLORED TUXEDO get into an ugly arm-
waving negotiation.

DUKE (V/O)
After a lot of bad noise, he let us
in for nothing provided we would
stand quietly at the back and not
smoke.

As DUKE and GONZO disappear through the door we can hear the
orchestra blasting out a HIGHLY BLANDIZED ""SGT. PEPPER'S
LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.""

A beat.

The door flies open and BOUNCERS manhandle DUKE and GONZO
out.  Despite the rough treatment they're both SCREECHING
WITH LAUGHTER.

GONZO
Jesus creeping shit!

DUKE
(tears streaming)
Did the mescaline just kick in?  Or
was that Debbie Reynolds in a
silver Afro wig?!

33.


GONZO
(in hysteria)
We wandered into a fucking time
capsule!

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT

DUKE DRIVES FAST into the night.  They're both LAUGHING
HYSTERICALLY.

DUKE
(in hysteria)
We wandered into a fucking time
capsule!

THEN... GONZO finds a TINY TEAR IN HIS JACKET...

GONZO
What's this?...

GONZO is instantly MOROSE.

GONZO
That scum...

GONZO twists round in the car -- SCREAMS back into the night.

GONZO
SCUM!  I know where you live!  I'll
find you and burn down your fucking
house!

EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS - NIGHT

A hundred foot high neon clown: BAZOOKO CIRCUS.

The RED SHARK pulls up beneath the sign.

DUKE
This is the place.  They'll never
fuck with us here.

GONZO
Where's the ether?  This mescaline
isn't working.

EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

Into the GLARING, CHASING LIGHTS of the entrance canopy
steps DUKE in EC/U holding a KLEENEX SOAKED IN ETHER TO HIS
NOSE.

34.


DUKE (V/O)
Ah, devil ether.  It makes you
behave like the village drunkard in
some early Irish novel... total
loss of all basic motor skills;
blurred vision, no balance, numb
tongue --
(throws away kleenex)
The mind recoils in horror, unable
to communicate with the spinal
column.  Which is interesting,
because you can actually watch
yourself behaving in this terrible
way, but you can't control it.

DUKE and GONZO approach the entrance with elaborate care-
taking one step at a time -- trying to keep ahead of the drug.

DUKE (V/O)
You approach the turnstiles and
know that when you get there, you
have to give the man two dollars or
he won't let you inside... but when
you get there, everything goes wrong.

THE ETHER KICKS IN:

DUKE and GONZO BOUNCE off the walls, CRASH into OLD LADIES,
GIGGLE HELPLESSLY as they try to pay -- HANDS FLAPPING
CRAZILY, unable to get money out of their pockets.

DUKE (V/O)
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and
you think: What's happening here?
What's going on?  Then you hear
yourself mumbling.

DUKE
(mumbling)
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of
mine.  Watch out!... Why money?  My
name is Brinks; I was born... Born?

GONZO
Get sheep over side... women and
children to armored car... orders
from Captain Zeep.

The ATTENDANTS indulgently escort them through the TURNSTILES.

35.


DUKE (V/O)
Ether is the perfect drug for Las
Vegas.  In this town they love a
drunk.  Fresh meat.  So they put us
through the turnstiles and turned
us loose inside.

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

Flames shoot up from below the casino.  Above, a HIGH WIRE
ACT with FOUR MUZZLED WOLVERINES, SIX NYMPHET SISTERS FROM
SAN DIEGO, TWO SILVER PAINTED POLACK BROTHERS, and THREE
KOREAN KITTENS.

The WOLVERINE chases a NYMPHET through the air.  TWO POLACKS
swing at it from opposite sides and they are instantly
locked in a death battle.

All plummet to the nets suspended over the GAMBLING TABLES
and SLOT MACHINES.  No one looks up.  The GAMBLERS REMAIN
INTENT ON THE SPINNING ROULETTE WHEEL, THE TURN OF THE CARD,
THE ROLL OF A DICE.

DUKE (V/O)
Bazooko Circus is what the whole
hep world would be doing Saturday
night if the Nazis had won the war.
This was the Sixth Reich.

Something causes DUKE to look down.  A dwarf carrying drinks
on a tray is tugging DUKE's pants leg trying to get him to
move out of the way.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
A drug person can learn to cope
with things like seeing their dead
grandmother crawling up their leg
with a knife in her teeth but,
nobody should be asked to handle
this trip.

GONZO and DUKE go upstairs walking past funhouse booths.
One of them is manned by an orangutan in costume.  A
FAIRGROUND BARKER grabs DUKE.

FAIRGROUND BARKER
Stand in front of this fantastic
machine, my friend.  For just 99
cents your likeness will appear 200
hundred feet tall on a screen above
downtown Las Vegas.

On a TV monitor a 200 FOOT HIGH DRUNKARD looms over the Las
Vegas skyline screaming OBSCENITIES.

36.


FAIRGROUND BARKER
99 cents more for a voice message.
Say whatever you want, fella.
They'll hear you, don't worry about
that.  Remember, you'll be 200 feet
tall!

ANOTHER BARKER
Step right up!  Shoot the pasties
off the nipples of this ten-foot
bull-dyke and win a cotton candy
goat!

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO sit on the revolving platform.  GONZO
stares -- glassy eyed -- coming apart.

GONZO
I hate to say this, but this place
is getting to me.  I think I'm
getting The Fear.

DUKE
Nonsense.  We came here to find the
American Dream, and now we're right
in the vortex you want to quit.
You must realize that we've found
the Main Nerve.

GONZO
That's what gives me The Fear.

DUKE
Look over there.  Two women fucking
a Polar Bear.

GONZO
Please, don't tell me those things...
Not now.
(signals the waitress
for two Wild Turkeys)
This is my last drink.  How much
money can you lend me?

DUKE
Not much.  Why?

GONZO
I have to go.

DUKE
GO?

37.


GONZO
Yes.  Leave the country.  Tonight.

DUKE
Calm down.  You'll be straight in a
few hours.

GONZO
No.  This is serious.  One more
hour in this town and I'll kill
somebody!

DUKE
OK.  I'll lend you some money.
Let's go outside and see how much
we have left.

GONZO
Can we make it?

DUKE
That depends on how many people we
fuck with between here and the door.

GONZO
I want to leave fast.

DUKE
OK.  Lets pay this bill and get up
very slowly.  It's going to be a
long walk.
(signals waitress who
comes over)


GONZO
(suddenly to waitress)
Do they pay you to screw that bear?

WAITRESS
What?

DUKE
He's just kidding.
(to GONZO)
Come on, Doc -- lets go downstairs
and gamble.

GONZO trembles with fear -- walks to the edge of the
turntable.

GONZO
When does this thing stop?

38.


DUKE
It won't stop.  It's not ever going
to stop.

DUKE carefully steps off the turntable.

GONZO, eyes staring blindly ahead, squiting in fear and
confusion, rooted to the spot, is carried away.

DUKE
Don't move you'll come around.

DUKE reaches out to grab GONZO, who jumps back -- keeps
going around.

The BARTENDER narrows his eyes at them.

DUKE steps onto the merry-go-round -- hurries round the
bar -- approaching GONZO from the blind side and shoves
GONZO from behind.  GONZO goes down with a hellish scream.
DUKE approaches him with his hands in the air.  Smiling.

DUKE
You fell.  Let's go.

GONZO refuses to move and stands tense, fists clenched,
looking for somebody to hit...an old woman perhaps?

DUKE (CONT'D)
OK.  You stay here and go to jail.
I'm leaving.

DUKE walks fast towards the stairs.  GONZO catches up with
him.

GONZO
Did you see that?  Some sonofabitch
kicked me in the back.

DUKE
Probably the bartender.  He wanted
to stomp you for what you said to
the waitress.

GONZO
Good God!  Let's get out of here!
Where's the elevator?

DUKE
(turning him in the
opposite direction)
Don't go near that elevator.
That's just what they want us to
do... trap us in a steel box and
take us down to the basement.

39.


EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO stumble out of the entrance.

DUKE
Don't run.  They'd like any excuse
to shoot us.

GONZO
(in an extended fall)
You drive!  I think there's
something wrong with me.

INT. MINT HOTEL CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THEIR SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE AND GONZO RUN MADLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR... DUKE TAKING
CARE NOT TO STEP ON THE PATTERNED PART OF THE CARPET.

GONZO STRUGGLES with the key in the lock.

GONZO
Those bastards have changed the
lock on us.  They probably searched
the room.  Jesus, we're finished!

The door SUDDENLY SWINGS OPEN.  DUKE AND GONZO fall inside.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

GONZO
Bolt everything!  Use all chains!

DUKE locks the door.  The suite is crowded with ROOM SERVICE
GOODIES.  DUKE turns to see GONZO staring at two hotel room
keys.  EVERYTHING STOPS.

GONZO
Where did this one come from?

DUKE snatches a key.

DUKE
That's Lacerda's room.

GONZO smiles a slow smile...

GONZO
Yeah... I thought we might need it...

DUKE
What for?

GONZO snatches the key back.

40.


GONZO
Let's go up there and blast him out
of bed with the fire hose.

DUKE
No, we should leave the poor
bastard alone.  I get the feeling
that he's avoiding us for some
reason.

GONZO
Don't kid yourself.  That Portuguese
son of a bitch is dangerous.  He's
watching us like a hawk.

DUKE
He told me he was turning in early...

GONZO utters an anguished cry -- slaps the wall with both
hands.

GONZO
That dirty bastard!  I knew it!
He's got hold of my woman!

DUKE
(laughing)
That little blonde groupie with the
film crew?  You think he sodomized
her?

GONZO
That's right, laugh about it!  You
goddamn honkies are all the same!

GONZO SLASHES A GRAPEFRUIT with a HUGE RAZOR SHARP HUNTING
KNIFE.  DUKE blanches.

DUKE
Where'd you get that knife?

GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- MANIACAL.

GONZO
Room service sent it up.  I wanted
something to cut the limes.

GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- INTO EIGHTHS!

DUKE
What limes?

GONZO SLICES -- SIXTEENTHS!

41.


GONZO
They didn't have any.  They don't
grow in the desert.

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!

GONZO
That dirty toad bastard!  I knew I
should have taken him out when I
had the chance.  Now he has her.

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO SLASHES INSANELY!

DUKE watches -- straight-faced.

DUKE (V/O)
I remember the girl.  We'd had a
problem with her in the elevator a
few hours earlier: my attention had
made a fool of himself.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)

An elevator door opens to reveal the SMILING FACES OF
LACERDA, THE BLONDE TV REPORTER AND HER CREW.

DUKE and GONZO stagger in.

LACERDA drops his smile.  He's standing beside the BLONDE TV
REPORTER.  A trembling GONZO moonily turns his eyes onto her.

BLONDE TV REPORTER
(to Gonzo)
You must be a rider.  What class
are you in?

GONZO
Class?  What the fuck do you mean?

BLONDE TV REPORTER
What do you ride?  We're filming
the race for a TV series -- maybe
we can use you.

GONZO
Use me?

DUKE (V/O)
Mother of God, I thought.  Here it
comes.

GONZO is TREMBLING BADLY.  There's a moment of uncomfortable
silence.

42.


GONZO
(suddenly shouting)
I ride the BIG ONES!  The really
BIG fuckers!

GONZO shows his teeth to LACERDA.  DUKE laughs trying to
defuse the scene.

DUKE
The Vincent Black Shadow.  We're
with the Factory Team.

TV CAMERAMAN
Bullshit.

GONZO stills -- becomes dangerous -- zeros in on the TV
CAMERAMAN -- groin to groin...

GONZO
Wait a minute, pardon me lady, but
I think there's some kind of
ignorant chicken-sucker in this car
who needs his face cut open.  You
cheap honky faggots!  Which one of
you wants to get cut?!

DEAD SILENCE.

Ding!  The elevator door opens, but nobody moves.  The door
closes.

Next floor.  Ding!  The door opens again.  A middle-aged
couple start to get in.  Change their minds.  The door closes.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

DUKE and GONZO run down the corridor.  GONZO LAUGHS WILDLY.

GONZO
Spooked!  They were spooked!  Like
rats in a death cage!

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO CRASH into their hotel suite -- BOLT THE DOOR.
GONZO stops laughing.

GONZO
Goddamn.  It's serious now.  That
girl understood.  She fell in love
with me.

END FLASHBACK.

43.


INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO with the BIG HUNTING KNIFE --
sliced grapefruit segments everywhere.

GONZO
Let's go up there and castrate that
fucker!

GONZO pauses -- A MAD THOUGHT -- turns to DUKE.

GONZO
(squinting suspiciously)
Have you made a deal with him?  Did
you put him on to her?

DUKE
(backing slowly
towards the door)
Look you better put that blade away
and get your head straight.  I have
to put the car in the lot.

DUKE (V/O)
One of the things you learn, after
years of dealing with drug people,
is that you can turn your back on a
person, but never turn your back on
a drug.  Especially when it's
waving a razor-sharp hunting knife
in your eyes.

INT. CASINO/LOBBY MINT HOTEL

The MAGAZINE REPORTER is on the telephone.

MAGAZINE REPORTER
Las Vegas at dawn.  The racers are
still asleep, the dust is still on
the desert, fifty thousand dollars
in prize money, slumbers darkly in
the office safe at Del Webb's
fabulous Mint Hotel...

DUKE walks past the REPORTER -- into THE CASINO, THE SAD,
MEAGRE CROWDS AROUND THE CRAP TABLES.  No joy.  DUKE watches.

DUKE (V/O)
Who are these people?  These faces!
Where do they come from?  They look
like caricatures of used car
dealers from Dallas.
(MORE)

44.


DUKE (V/O; CONT'D)
And, sweet Jesus, there are a hell
of a lot of them at four-thirty on
a Monday morning.  Still humping
the American dream, that vision of
the big winner somehow emerging
from the last minute predawn chaos
of a stale Vegas casino.

DUKE stops at the Money Wheel, puts down a two dollar bill
on a number, the wheel turns, he loses.

DUKE
You bastards!

DUKE (V/O)
No.  Calm down.  Learn to ENJOY
losing.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE walks back into the room.  We hear the LOUD STRAINS OF
THREE DOG NIGHT'S ""JOY TO THE WORLD.""

He walks to the bathroom and opens the door.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT

Submerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub.
Soap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface.  A
large empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor.  The
shower is on -- the tub overflowing.  THE TAPE RECORDER
PLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over
the sink.

DUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED
UP WHITE BLOTTER.

DUKE
You ate ALL THIS ACID?

No answer.

DUKE
(turning down the volume)
You evil son of a bitch.  You
better hope there's some Thorazine
in that bag, because if there's
not, you're in bad trouble.

GONZO
Music!  Turn it up.  Put that tape
on.

45.


DUKE
What tape?

GONZO
Jefferson Airplane. ""White Rabbit.""
I want a rising sound.

DUKE
You're doomed.  I'm leaving here in
two hours and then they're going to
come up here and beat the mortal
shit out of you with big saps.
Right there in that tub.

GONZO
I dig my own graves.  Green water
and the White Rabbit.  Put it on.

DUKE
OK.  But do me one last favor, will
you.  Can you give me two hours?
That's all I ask -- just two hours
to sleep before tomorrow.  I
suspect it's going to be a very
difficult day.

He switches on the tape. ""WHITE RABBIT"" begins to build.

GONZO
(coolly)
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll
give you all the time you need, at
my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but
you'll be wanting a cushion, so,
why don't you just lay one of those
$100 bills down there beside the
radio, and fuck off?

DUKE
How about a check?

GONZO
Whatever's right.

DUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and
leaves, closing the door behind him.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE goes across to the sofa and crashes -- exhausted.
Suddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom.

GONZO (V/O)
Help!  You bastard!  I need help!

46.


DUKE JUMPS up -- crosses to the bathroom door, muttering.

DUKE
Shit, he's killing himself!

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

DUKE RUSHES IN.  GONZO flails -- trying to reach the radio
with the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its
mounts.

GONZO
(snarling)
I want that fucking radio!

DUKE GRABS THE RADIO.

DUKE
Don't touch it!  Get back in that
tub!

GONZO
Back the tape up.  I need it again!
Let it roll!  Just as high as the
fucker can go!  And when it comes
to that fantastic note where the
rabbit bites its own head off, I
want you to THROW THAT FUCKING
RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!

DUKE stares down at GONZO.

DUKE
Not me.  It would blast you through
the wall -- stone dead in ten
seconds and they'd make me explain
it!

GONZO
BULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this.

HIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE.

DUKE
Jesus.

GONZO
Do it!  I want to get HIGHER!

DUKE considers this.  He's had enough.

47.


DUKE
Okay.  You're right.  This is
probably the only solution.
(holds the PLUGGED IN
TAPE/RADIO over the tub)
Let me make sure I have it all
lined up.  You want me to throw
this thing into the tub when ""WHITE
RABBIT"" peaks.  Is that it?

GONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.

GONZO
Fuck yes.  I was beginning to think
I was going to have to go out and
get one of the goddamn maids to do
it.

DUKE
Are you ready?

He switches ""WHITE RABBIT"" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS
AND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.

Meanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a
good two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when ""WHITE
RABBIT"" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.

GONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A
TIDAL WAVE.

DUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF
THE BATHROOM.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE slumps onto the sofa.

SILENCE.

GONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused.  HE
WAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at
DUKE.  DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.

DUKE
MACE!  YOU WANT THIS?

GONZO stops -- hisses.

GONZO
You bastard!  You'd do that,
wouldn't you?

48.


DUKE
(laughs)
Why worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing
in the world like a Mace high.
Forty-five minutes on your knees
with the dry heaves...

GONZO
You cheap honky sonofabitch...

DUKE
Why not?  Hell, just a minute ago,
you were asking me to kill you!
And now you want to kill me!  What
I should do, goddamnit, is call the
police!

GONZO
The cops?

DUKE
There's no choice.  I wouldn't dare
go to sleep with you wandering
around with a head full of acid and
wanting to slice me up with that
goddamn knife!

GONZO
(mumbles)
Who said anything about slicing you
up?  I just wanted to carve a
little Z on your forehead.  Nothing
serious.

GONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.

DUKE
(menaces him with the MACE)
Get back in that tub.  Eat some
reds and try to calm down.  Smoke
some grass, shoot some smack --
shit, do whatever you have to do,
but let me get some rest.

GONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.

GONZO
Hell, yes.  You really need some
sleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn.
What a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't
let me keep you up.

49.


GONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair
up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next
to the clock.

DUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He
collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.

DUKE (V/O)
Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom.
Just another ugly refugee from the
Love Generation.

The WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his
face.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL
BEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.

DUKE (V/O)
My attorney had never been able to
accept the notion -- often espoused
by former drug abusers -- that you
can get a lot higher without drugs
than with them.  And neither have
I, for that matter.

The pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL
LIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the
foreground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior
of A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.

INT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT

A slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the
action is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.

DUKE (V/O)
I recall one night in the Matrix.
There I was -- a victim of the Drug
Explosion.  A natural street freak,
just eating whatever came by.

A ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The
sound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.

ROAD-PERSON
Anybody want some L...S...D...?  I
got all the makin's right here.
All I need is a place to cook.

The camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.

INT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Still in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a
HUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.

50.


DUKE (V/O)
I decided to eat only half at first.
Good thinking.  But I spilled the
rest on the sleeve of my red
Pendleton shirt.

DUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the
door to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in
slow-motion.

MUSICIAN
What's the trouble?

DUKE
(also in slow-motion)
Well, all this white stuff on my
sleeve is LSD.

The MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A
long pause.

Cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-
cut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.
We cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the
men's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...
sucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The
STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.

DUKE (V/O)
With a bit of luck his life was
ruined -- forever thinking that
just behind some narrow door in all
his favorite bars, men in red
Pendleton shirts are getting
incredible kicks from things he'll
never know.

INT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT

The STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking
lost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a
TV white noise snowstorm.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE sits staring at the TV.

51.


DUKE (V/O)
Strange memories on this nervous
night in Las Vegas.
(he gets up, pours
himself a drink)
Has it been five years?  Six?  It
seems like a lifetime -- the kind
of peak that never comes again.
San Francisco in the middle sixties
was a very special time and place
to be a part of.  But no
explanation, no mix of words or
music or memories can touch that
sense of knowing that you were
there and alive in that corner of
time and the world.  Whatever it
meant.

DUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.

EXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE

We are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.

DUKE (V/O)
THERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION,
AT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE
SPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A
FANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT
WHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,
THAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I
THINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE
OF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE
FORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY
MEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T
NEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY
prevail.  We had all the momentum;
we were riding the crest of a high
and beautiful wave...

DUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

DUKE (V/O)
So now, less than five years later,
you can go up on a steep hill in
Las Vegas and look west, and with
the right kind of eyes you can
almost see the high water mark --
that place where the wave finally
broke and rolled back.

52.


The memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.
Suddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi
shouting ""WOODSTOCK ÜBER ALLES!""

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN

A harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking
like shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.

DUKE (V/O)
The decision to flee came suddenly.
Or maybe not.

DUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of
fruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.

BELL BOY
Room service!

The BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already
stacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.

DUKE (V/O)
Maybe I'd planned it all along --
subconsciously waiting for the
right moment.  The bill was a
factor, I think.  Because I had no
money to pay for it.

DUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.

DUKE (V/O)
Our room service tabs had been
running somewhere between $29 and
$36 per hour, for forty-eight
consecutive hours.  Incredible.
How could it happen?

DUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED
LUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room --
empty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...

DUKE (V/O)
But by the time I asked this
question, there was no one around
to answer.

DUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.

53.


DUKE (V/O)
My attorney was gone.  He must have
sensed trouble.

QUICK CUT TO:

EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY

GONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of
brand-new fine cowhide luggage.

DUKE (V/O)
Panic.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY

DUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --
leaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both
ways, then hurries away down the corridor.

DUKE (V/O)
It crept up my spine like first
rising vibes of an acid frenzy.
All these horrible realities began
to dawn on me.

INT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY

An anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the
elevator descends.  He searches his pockets...

DUKE (V/O)
Here I was, alone in Las Vegas,
with this goddamned incredibly
expensive car, completely twisted
on drugs, no cash, no story for the
magazine.  And on top of everything
else I had a gigantic goddamn hotel
bill to deal with.

DUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.

The door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN
HANDCUFFS.

DUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors
close.

DUKE (V/O)
I didn't even know who had won the
race.  Maybe nobody.

54.


INT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

DUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering
MANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.

DUKE
(muttering to himself)
How would Horatio Alger have
handled this situation?

EXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY

Motoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN
with a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves
at the CAR BOY.

DUKE (V/O)
Stay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a
relatively respectable citizen -- a
multiple felon, perhaps, but
certainly not dangerous.

The CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The
back seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint
400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
Luckily, I had taken the soap and
grapefruit and other luggage out to
the car a few hours earlier.  Now
it was only a matter of slipping
the noose...

DUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!

CLERK'S VOICE
MR. DUKE!

DUKE freezes.

CLERK'S VOICE
Mr. Duke!  We've been looking for
you!

DUKE (V/O)
The game was up!  They had me.

DUKE
(to himself)
Well, why not?  Many fine books
have been written in prison.

55.


Resigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK
arrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS
HAND.

CLERK
Sir?
(thrusts out a TELEGRAM)
This telegram came for you.
Actually, it isn't for you.  It's
for somebody named Thompson, but it
says 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does
that make sense?

DUKE
(barely able to speak)
Yes... It makes sense.

DUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.

The CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous
stash inside.

CLERK
I checked the register for this man
Thompson.  We don't show him but I
figured he might be part of your
team.

DUKE
He is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to
him.

He fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.

SECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word
or two.

CLERK
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's
signature on the telegram from Los
Angeles.  When we knew he was right
here in the hotel.

DUKE
You did the right thing.  Never try
to understand a press message.
About half the time we use codes --
especially with Dr. Gonzo.

CLERK
Tell me.  When will the doctor be
awake?

56.


DUKE
(tenses)
Awake?  What do you mean?

DUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.

CLERK
(uncomfortably)
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem,
would like to meet him.  Nothing
unusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet
all our large accounts... put them
on a personal basis... just a chat
and a handshake, you understand.

DUKE
Of course.  But if I were you, I'd
leave the Doctor alone until after
he's eaten breakfast.  He's a very
crude man.

DUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.

CLERK
But he will be available?  Perhaps
later this morning?

DUKE
Look.  That telegram was all
scrambled.  It was actually from
Thompson, not to him.  Western
Union must have gotten the names
reversed.  I have to get going.  I
have to get out to the track.

CLERK
There's no hurry!  The race is over!

DUKE
(taking off)
Not for me.

He waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.

CLERK
Let's have lunch!

DUKE
Righto!

EXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY

DUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.

57.


A ""YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS"" sign flashes past.

Bob Dylan plays: ""Memphis Blues Again -- ""Aaww, Mama, can
this really by the end...?""

A sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.

DUKE (V/O)
Jesus, bad waves of paranoia,
madness, fear and loathing --
intolerable vibrations in this
place.  Get out!  The weasels were
closing in.  I could smell the ugly
brutes.  Flee!

DUKE drives fast.

DUKE
Do me one last favor Lord: just
give me five more high-speed hours
before you bring the hammer down;
just let me get rid of this goddamn
car and off of this horrible desert.

A sign flashes ""YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.""

A patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.

DUKE (CONT'D)
You evil bastard!  This is your
work!  You'd better take care of
me, Lord... because if you don't
you're going to have me on your
hands.

The patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.

DUKE (V/O)
Few people understand the psychology
of dealing with a Highway Traffic
Cop.  Your normal speeder will
panic and immediately pull over to
the side.  This is wrong.

DUKE floors the gas pedal.

DUKE (V/O)
It arouses contempt in the cop heart.

THE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.

58.


DUKE (V/O)
Make the bastard chase you.  He
will follow.  But he won't know
what to make of your blinker signal
that says you're about to turn right.

DUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.

DUKE (V/O)
This is to let him know you're
looking for a proper place to pull
off and talk.

AN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.

DUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.

DUKE (V/O)
It will take him a moment to
realize that he is about to make
180 degree turn at speed... but you
will be ready for it, braced for
the G's and the fast heel toe work.

The patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.

EXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY

The patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE
stands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Just what the FUCK did you think
you were doing?!

DUKE smiles.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
May I see your license.

DUKE
Of course, officer.

DUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer
can -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.

DUKE (V/O)
I knew I was fucked.

The COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for
DUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.

59.


HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Could I have that, please?

DUKE
Why not?  It was getting warm anyway.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --
glances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars
of soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
You realize...

DUKE
Yeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I
understand that.  I knew it was a
crime but I did it anyway.  Shit,
why argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
That's a strange attitude.

He looks at DUKE thoughtfully.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
You know -- I get the feeling you
could use a nap.  There's a rest
area up ahead.  Why don't you pull
over and sleep a few hours?

DUKE
A nap won't help.  I've been awake
for too long -- three or four
nights.  I can't even remember.  If
I go to sleep now, I'm dead for
twenty hours.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Okay.  Here's how it is.  What goes
into my book, as of noon, is that I
apprehended you... for driving too
fast, and advised you to proceed no
further than the next rest area...
your stated destination, right?
Where you plan to take a long nap.
Do I make myself clear?

DUKE
How far is Baker?  I was hoping to
stop there for lunch.

60.


HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Not my jurisdiction.  The city
limits are two point two miles
beyond the rest area.  Can you make
it that far?

DUKE
I'll try.  I've been wanting to go
to Baker for a long time.  I've
heard a lot about it.

The PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Excellent seafood.  With a mind
like yours, you'll probably want to
try the land-crab.  Try the Majestic
Diner.

The PATROLMAN slams the door shut.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

DUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.

DUKE (V/O)
I felt raped.  The Pig had done me
on all fronts, and now he was going
off to chuckle about it -- on the
west side of town, waiting for me
to make a run for L.A.

DUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he
signals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn
he sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn
their eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER
drops his thumb.

DUKE
Great Jesus, it's him.

DUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE
WAY HE CAME.

EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.

DUKE
They've nailed me!  I'm trapped in
some stinking desert crossroads
called Baker.  I don't have much
time.  The fuckers are closing in.
They'll hunt me down like a beast!

61.


INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

GONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.  Mexican
Day of the Dead masks hang from the walls -- flame-red demons.

GONZO
Who?  You sound a little paranoid.

EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE screams -- sweat pouring.

DUKE
You bastard!  I need a lawyer
immediately!

INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

GONZO
What are you doing in Baker?
Didn't you get my telegram?

EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE
What?  Fuck telegrams.  I'm in
trouble.  You worthless bastard.
I'll cripple your ass for this!
All that shit in the car is yours!
You understand that?  When I finish
testifying out here you'll be
disbarred!

INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

GONZO
You're supposed to be in Vegas.  We
have a suite at the Flamingo.  I
was just about to leave for the
airport.

INT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket.

GONZO'S VOICE
You brainless scumbag!  You're
supposed to be covering the National
District Attorney's conference!  I
made all the reservations... rented
a white Cadillac convertible... the
whole thing is arranged!  What the
hell are you doing out there in the
middle of the fucking desert?

62.


DUKE stares at the telegram.

DUKE
Never mind.  It's all a big joke.
I'm actually sitting beside the
pool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking
from a portable phone.  Some dwarf
brought it out from the casino.  I
have total credit!  Can you grasp
that?
(shouts)
Don't come anywhere near this place!
Foreigners aren't welcome here!

DUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

C/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.

DUKE (V/O)
Well.  This is how the world works.

C/U An IGUANA basks in the sun.

DUKE (V/O)
All energy flows according to the
whims of the Great Magnet.

C/U Barrel of the gun.  It fires.  An explosion of desert
dirt.

DUKE (V/O)
What a fool I was to defy Him.

The IGUANA sits unfazed.

DUKE (V/O)
Never cross the Great Magnet.  I
understood this now...
(another blast from
the gun)
... and with understanding came a
sense of almost terminal relief.

DUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the
thuds of the explosions echo away.

EXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY

The RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.

63.


DUKE (V/O)
I had to get rid of The Shark.  Too
many people might recognize it...
...especially the Vegas Police.
(tight C/U of DUKE)
Luckily, my credit card was still
technically valid.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

DUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE
WHITE WHALE.

DUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top.

DUKE (V/O)
This was a superior machine -- ten
grand worth of gimmicks and high
price special effects.  The rear
windows leapt up with a touch like
frogs in a dynamited pond.  The
dashboard was full of esoteric
lights and dials and meters that I
would never understand.

EXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON

A GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S
CONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.

DUKE (V/O)
If the Pigs were gathering in
Vegas, I felt the Drug Culture
should be represented as well...
and there was a certain bent appeal
in the notion of running a savage
burn on one Las Vegas hotel and
then just wheeling across town and
checking into another.

The WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately
attended by impressed MINIONS.

DUKE (V/O)
Me and a thousand ranking cops from
all over America.  Why not?  Move
confidently into their midst.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON

DUKE enters -- old Levis, grubby sneakers, 10 peso Acapulco
shirt coming apart at the seams, 3 day growth, eyes hidden
behind mirror shades.  He heads for the check-in line.

64.


DUKE (V/O)
My arrival was badly timed.

THE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS.  200 of them, on vacation, all
dressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts,
Arnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.

Ahead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK.
The POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side,
weeping.  The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.

POLICE CHIEF
What do you mean I'm too late to
register?  I'm a police chief.
From Michigan.  Look, fella, I told
you.
(waves a POSTCARD)
I have a postcard here that says I
have reservations in this hotel.

CLERK
(prissily)
I'm sorry, sir.  You're on the
""late list."" Your reservations were
transferred to the... ah...
Moonlight Motel, which is out on
Paradise Boulevard...

POLICE CHIEF
I've already paid for my goddamn
room!

CLERK
It's actually a very fine place of
lodging and only sixteen blocks
from here, with its own pool and...

POLICE CHIEF
You dirty little faggot!  Call the
manager!  I'm tired of listening to
this dogshit!

FRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF.

CLERK
(solicitously)
I'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you
a cab?

The POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...

DUKE (V/O)
Of course, I could hear what the
Clerk was really saying...

65.


CLERK
(IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION)
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead --
I've been fucked around, in my
time, by a fairly good cross-
section of mean-tempered rule-crazy
cops and now it's MY turn. ""Fuck
you, officer, I'm in charge here,
and I'm telling you we don't have
room for you.""

DUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.

DUKE
Say.  I hate to interrupt, but I
wonder if maybe I could just sort
of slide through and get out of
your way.  Name's Raoul Duke --
Raoul Duke.  My attorney made the
reservation.

DUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE
goes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he
was some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The
CLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.

CLERK
Certainly, Mr. Duke!

DUKE
My bags are out there in that white
Cadillac convertible.  Can you have
someone drive it around to the room?

ALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.

DUKE
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild
Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and
a night's worth of ice delivered to
my room, please?

CLERK
Don't worry about a thing, sir.
Just enjoy your stay.

DUKE
Well, thank you.

DUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the
elevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of
beer and toasts them.  The doors close.

66.


INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY

DUKE rams the key home -- swings the door open.

DUKE
Ah, home at last!

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON

DUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud.

A 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.

GONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a
drug-addled grin on his face.

DUKE
You degenerate pig!

GONZO
It can't be helped.  This is Lucy.
(laughing distractedly)
You know--like ""Lucy In The Sky
With Diamonds.""

LUCY eyes DUKE venomously.

GONZO
Lucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!
Remember what happened at the
airport!  No more of that, okay?

LUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his
arm round her shoulder.

GONZO
Lucy... this is my client.  This is
Mr. Duke, the famous journalist.
He's paying for this suite, Lucy.
He's on our side.

DUKE flops onto the sofa.

GONZO
Mr. Duke is my friend.  He loves
artists.

DUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of
artwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in
charcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.

GONZO
Lucy paints portraits of Barbra
Streisand.

67.


LUCY
I drew these from TV.

GONZO
Fantastic.  She came all the way
down here from Montana just to give
these portraits to Barbra.  We're
going over to the Americana Hotel
tonight to meet her backstage...

DUKE's voice rises above GONZO.

DUKE (V/O)
I desperately needed peace, rest,
sanctuary.  I hadn't counted on
this.  Finding my attorney on acid
and locked into some kind of
preternatural courtship.

DUKE
Well, I guess they brought the car
round by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF
OUT OF THE TRUNK.

DUKE fixes GONZO hard.

GONZO
Absolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.
(to LUCY)
Now, we'll be right back.  Don't
answer the phone if it rings.

LUCY
(makes one-fingered
Jesus freak sign)
God bless.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY

DUKE collars GONZO -- serious.

DUKE
WELL?  What are your plans?

GONZO
Plans?

DUKE
Lucy.

68.


GONZO
(struggling to focus)
Shit.  I met her on the plane and I
had all that acid.
(he shrugs)
You know, those little blue barrels.
I gave her a cap before I realized...
she's a religious freak... Jesus,
she's never even had a drink.

DUKE
Well... It'll probably work out.
We can keep her loaded and peddle
her ass at the drug convention.

GONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.

GONZO
Listen, she's running away from
home for something like the fifth
time in six months.  It's terrible.

DUKE
She's perfect for this gig.  These
cops will go fifty bucks a head to
beat her into submission and then
gang fuck her.  We can set her up
in one of these back street motels,
hang pictures of Jesus all over the
room, then turn these pigs loose on
her... Hell she's strong; she'll
hold her own.

GONZO's face twitches badly.

GONZO
Jesus Christ.  I knew you were sick
but I never expected to hear you
actually say that kind of stuff.

DUKE
It's straight economics.  This girl
is a god-send.  Shit, she can make
us a grand a day.

GONZO
NO!  Stop talking like that.

DUKE
I figure she can do about four at a
time.  Christ, if we keep her full
of acid that's more like two grand
a day.  Maybe three.

69.


GONZO
You filthy bastard.  I should cave
your fucking head in.

DUKE
In a few hours, she'll probably be
sane enough to work herself into a
towering Jesus-based rage at the
hazy recollection of being seduced
by some kind of cruel Samoan who
fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her
to a Vegas hotel room and savagely
penetrated every orifice in her
body with his throbbing,
uncircumcised member.

GONZO starts crying.

GONZO
NO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I
wanted to help her!

DUKE
You'll go straight to the gas
chamber.  And even if you manage to
beat that, they'll send you back to
Nevada for Rape and Consensual
Sodomy.  She's got to go.

Pause.

GONZO
Shit, it doesn't pay to try to help
somebody these days.

A silence.

DUKE (V/O)
The only alternative was to take
her out to the desert and feed her
remains to the lizards.  But, it
seemed a bit heavy for the thing we
were trying to protect: My attorney.

GONZO
We have to cut her loose.  She's
got two hundred dollars.  And we
can always call the cops up there
in Montana, where she lives, and
turn her in.

DUKE
What?... What kind of goddamn
monster are you?

70.


GONZO
It just occurred to me, that she
has no witnesses.  Anything that
she says about us is completely
worthless.

DUKE
Us?

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET

DUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.

DUKE
Hotel Americana?  I need a
reservation.  For my niece.  Listen,
I need her treated very gently.
She's an artist, and might seem a
trifle highstrung...

In the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the
door.

GONZO
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet
Barbra...

DUKE (V/O)
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to
be done.

EXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK

The WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps
LUCY and her paintings from the car.

DUKE (V/O)
Lucy was a potentially fatal
millstone on both our necks.  There
was absolutely no choice but to cut
her adrift and hope her memory was
fucked.

GONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --
waves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting
to come down...

GONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands
together as if washing his hands of the situation.

GONZO
Well that's that.  Take off slowly.
Don't attract attention.

71.


They pull out into traffic.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK

GONZO
I gave the cabbie an extra ten
bucks to make sure she gets there
safe.  Also, I told him I'd be
there myself in an hour, and if she
wasn't, I'd come back out here and
rip his lungs out.

DUKE
That's good.  You can't be subtle
in this town.

GONZO
As your attorney, I advise you to
tell me where you put the goddamn
mescaline.

DUKE
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.

GONZO
Right.  Let's find a good seafood
restaurant and eat some red salmon.
I feel a powerful lust for red
salmon...

The electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The
sun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson
tune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING

GONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.

In the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.

DUKE
Come on, we're going to be late.

GONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth
with a towel.

GONZO
This goddamn mescaline.  Why the
fuck can't they make it a little
less pure?  Maybe mix it up with
Rolaids or something.

72.


INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
(crackling and
booming over the
lousy sound system)
On behalf of the prosecuting
attorneys of this county, I welcome
you to the Third National DA's
Conference on Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs.

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman
type -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads:
NATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. ""If You Don't Know, Come To
Learn... If You Know, Come To Teach.""

A BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS
AND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod
dress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be
WITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around
20 REDNECKS.

A dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles
distort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.

At the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI
wingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name
tag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.

GONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,
CRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.

GONZO
(lowers his voice)
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider,
but I didn't believe they were real.
Not like this.  Not hundreds of them!

DUKE
They're actually nice people when
you get to know them.

GONZO
Man, I know these people in my
goddamn blood!

DUKE
Don't mention that word around here.
You'll get them excited.

GONZO
This is a fucking nightmare.

73.


DUKE
Right.  Sure as hell some dope-
dealing bomb freak is going to
recognize you and put the word out
that you're partying with a thousand
cops.

COP IN BACK
SSSSHHH!

DR. BLUMQUIST -- a ""drug expert"" -- takes the stage.

DR. BLUMQUIST
We must come to terms with the Drug
Culture in the country... country...
country...

The sound systems echoes.

DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)
The reefer butt is called a ""roach,""
because it resembles a cockroach...
cockroach... cockroach...

GONZO
(whispers)
What the fuck are these people
talking about?  You'd have to be
crazy on acid to think a joint
looked like a goddamn cockroach!

DUKE (V/O)
It was clear that we had stumbled
into a prehistoric gathering.

DR. BLUMQUIST
Now, there are four states of being
in the cannabis, or marijuana,
society: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and
Square.  The square is seldom if
ever cool.  He is not ""with it,""
that is, he doesn't know ""what's
happening."" But if he manages to
figure it out, he moves up a notch
to ""hip.""

DUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.

DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)
And if he can bring himself to
approve of what is happening, he
becomes ""groovy."" After that, with
much luck and perseverance, he can
rise to the rank of ""cool."" A cool
guy... cool guy... cool guy...

74.


COP IN BACK
Dr. Bloomquist, do you think the
anthropologist, Margaret Mead's
strange behavior of late might
possibly be explained by a private
marijuana addiction?

DR. BLUMQUIST
I really don't know, but at her
age, if she did smoke grass, she'd
have one hell of a trip!

Roars of laughter.

GONZO
I know a hell of a lot better ways
to waste my time than listening to
this bullshit.

He stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and
plunges down the aisle to the door.

COP IN BACK
Down in front!

GONZO
Fuck you!  I have to get out!  I
don't belong here!

COP IN BACK
Good riddance!

He stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to
the stage.

The lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER
MADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.

FILM NARRATOR
KNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE
MAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be
able to see his eyes because of
Tea-Shades, but his knuckles will
be white from inner tension...

DUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF
who necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.

FILM NARRATOR
... and his pants will be crusted
with semen from constantly jacking
off when he can't find a rape
victim...

75.


DUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness,
he gets up, hand over mouth.

DUKE
Pardon me, I feel sick.

FILM NARRATOR
He will stagger and babble when
questioned.  He will not respect
your badge.  The Dope Fiend fears
nothing.  He will attack, for no
reason, with every weapon at his
command -- including yours...

DUKE heads for the exit.

DUKE
Sorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling
sick...

FILM NARRATOR
BEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a
suspected marijuana addict should
use all necessary force immediately.
One stitch in time [on him] will
usually save nine on you.

DUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.

INT. CASINO BAR - DAY

DUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING
COP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT
ATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.

DA
I'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't
have much trouble from drugs where
I come from...

GONZO
You will.  One of these nights
you'll wake up and find a junkie
tearing your bedroom apart.

DA
Naw!

GONZO
They'll climb right into your
bedroom and sit on your chest with
big Bowie knives.  They might even
sit on your wife's chest.  Put the
blade right down on her throat.

76.


DA
Not down in my parts.

DUKE joins them.

DUKE
(to WAITRESS)
Rum and ice, please.

DA
(looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG)
You're another one of these
California boys.  Your friend
here's been tellin' us about dope
fiends.

DUKE
They're everywhere.  Nobody's safe.
And sure as hell not in the South.
They like warm weather... You'd
never believe it.  In L.A. it's out
of control.  First it was drugs,
now it's witchcraft.

DA
Witchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!

The BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the
conversation.

GONZO
Read the newspapers.

DUKE
Man, you don't know trouble until
you have to face down a bunch of
these addicts gone crazy for human
sacrifice!

DA
Naw!  That's science fiction stuff!

DUKE
Not where we operate.

GONZO
Hell, in Malibu alone, these
goddamn Satan worshippers kill six
or eight people every day.  All
they want is the blood.  They'll
take people right off the street if
they have to.

77.


DUKE
Just the other day we had a case
where they grabbed a girl right out
of a McDonald's hamburger stand.
She was a waitress, about sixteen
years old... with a lot of people
watching, too!

The BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more
furiously.

DA
What happened?  What did they do to
her?

GONZO
Do?  Jesus Christ, man.  They
chopped her goddamn head off right
there in the parking lot!  Then
they cut all kinds of holes in her
head and sucked out the blood!

DA
(DA ad-libs a
summation of the crime)
And nobody did anything?

DUKE
What could they do?  The guy that
took the head was about six-seven,
and maybe three-hundred pounds.  He
was packing two Lugers, and the
others had M-16s.

GONZO
They just ran back out into Death
Valley -- you know, where Manson
turned up...

DUKE
Like big lizards.

GONZO
... and every one of them stacked
naked...

DA
Naked!?

DUKE
Naked.

78.


GONZO
Yeh, naked!... except for the
weapons.

DUKE
They were all veterans.

DA
Veterans?!!!?

Agog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes
the glass -- faster and faster...

GONZO
Yeh.  The big guy used to be a
major in the Marines.

DA
A major!

GONZO
We know where he lives, but we
can't get near the house.

DA
Naw!  Not a major.

GONZO
He wanted the pineal gland.

DA
Really?

GONZO
That's how he got so big.  When he
quit the Marines he was just a
little guy.

DUKE
Usually, it's whole families.
During the night.  Most of them
don't even wake up until they feel
their heads going -- and then, of
course, it's too late.

The glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.

DUKE (CONT'D)
Happens every day.

DUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.

79.


DUKE (CONT'D)
Three more rums.  Plenty of ice.
Maybe a handful of lime chunks.

WAITRESS
Are you guys with the police
convention upstairs?

DA
We sure are, Miss.

WAITRESS
I thought so.  I never heard that
kind of talk around here before.
Jesus Christ!  How do you guys
stand that kind of work?

GONZO
(grinning)
We like it.  It's groovy.

The WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.

DUKE
What's wrong with you?  Hell,
somebody has to do it.

GONZO
Hurry up with those drinks.  We're
thirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine
a Bloody Mary.

DA
(whacks his fist on
the bar)
Hell, I really hate to hear this.
Because everything that happens in
California seems to get down our
way, sooner or later.  Mostly
Atlanta.  But that was back when
the goddamn bastards were peaceful.
All we had to do was to keep 'em
under surveillance.  They didn't
roam around much... But now Jesus,
it seems nobody's safe.

GONZO
(with a conspiratorial
nod)
You're going to need to take the
bull by the horns -- go to the mat
with this scum.

80.


DA
What do you mean by that?

GONZO
You know what I mean.  We've done
it before and we can damn well do
it again!

DUKE
Cut their goddamn heads off.  Every
one of them.  That's what we're
doing in California.

DA
(stupefied)
WHAT?

GONZO
Sure.  It's all on the Q.T., but
everybody who matters is with us
all the way down the line.

DUKE
We keep it quiet.  It's not the
kind of thing you'd want to talk
about upstairs.  Not with the press
around.

DA
(recovering slightly)
Hell, no.  We'd never hear the
goddamn end of it.

DUKE
Dobermans don't talk.

DA
What?

GONZO
Sometimes it's easier to just rip
out the backstraps.

DUKE
They'll fight like hell if you try
to take the head without the dogs.

DA
God almighty!
(muttering in a daze)
I don't think I should tell my wife
about this.  She'd never understand.
You know how women are.

81.


DUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back.

DUKE
Just be thankful your heart is
young and strong.

DUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the
swirling ice in drink.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.

GONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the
bathroom.  Immediate sounds of retching.

The phone message light is blinking.  DUKE opens a beer,
picks up the phone.

DUKE
What's the message?  My light is
blinking.

CLERK (V/O)
Ah, yes.  Mr. Duke?  You have one
message: ""Call Lucy at the Americana
Hotel, room 1600.""

DUKE
Holy shit!

DUKE slams the phone down.  GONZO emerges from the
bathroom -- looking like death.

DUKE
Lucy called.

GONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.

GONZO
What?

The telephone rings.  DUKE answers.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY

A worried CLERK speaks in to the phone.

CLERK
Mr. Duke?  Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm
sorry we were cut off a moment
ago... I thought I should call
again, because I was wondering...

82.


INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - DAY

DUKE
WHAT?
(hand over the PHONE)
What was that crazy bitch said to
him?
(screams)
There's a war on, man!  People are
being killed!

CLERK (V/O)
Killed?

DUKE
IN VIETNAM!  ON THE GODDAMN
TELEVISION!

CLERK (V/O)
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible
war.  When will it end?

DUKE
Tell me.  What do you want?

In the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his
stash from the lining.

CLERK (V/O)
The woman who left that message for
you sounded very disturbed.  I
think she was crying...

DUKE
Crying?  Why was she crying?

CLERK (V/O)
Well, uh.  She didn't say Mr. Duke.
But since I know you're here with
the Police Convention...

DUKE
Look, you want to be gentle with
that woman if she ever calls again.
We're watching her very carefully...
this woman has been into laudanum.
It's a controlled experiment, but I
suspect we'll need your cooperation
before this thing is over.

CLERK (V/O)
(hesitantly)
Well, certainly... We're always
happy to cooperate with the police...

83.


DUKE
Don't worry.  You're protected.
Just treat this poor woman like
you'd treat any other human being
in trouble.

CLERK (V/O)
What?  Ah... yes, yes, I see what
you mean... Yes... so, you'll be
responsible then?

DUKE
Of course.  And now I have to get
back to the news.  Send up some ice.

He hangs up.  GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.

GONZO
Good work.  They'll treat us like
goddamn lepers after that.

DUKE
(slowly, carefully)
Lucy is looking for you.

GONZO
(laughing)
No, she's looking for you.

DUKE
Me?

GONZO
She really flipped over you.  The
only way I could get rid of her was
by saying you were taking me out to
the desert for a showdown -- that
you wanted me out of the way so you
could have her all to yourself.
(laughing again)
I guess she figures you won.  That
phone message wasn't for me, was it?

A look of stunned realization from DUKE...

INT. FANTASY COURT ROOM - DAY

LUCY is on the witness stand.

LUCY
Yessir, those two men in the dock
are the ones who gave me the LSD
and took me to the hotel.

84.


A doomed DUKE and GONZO await their fate.

LUCY
I don't know for sure what they
done to me, but I remember it was
horrible.

JUDGE
Twenty years... and Double
Castration!

The JUDGE bangs his gavel.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY

DUKE is madly stuffing his suitcase.

GONZO
Wait!  You can't leave me alone in
this snake pit.  This room is in my
name.

DUKE KEEPS PACKING.  GONZO is looking worried.

GONZO
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call
her.  I'll get her off our backs.
You're right.  She's my problem.

DUKE
It's gone too far.

GONZO
Relax.  Let me handle this.
(dials the PHONE,
snaps angrily at DUKE)
You'd make a piss-poor lawyer.
...Room 1600, please.
(to DUKE)
As your attorney, I advise you not
to worry.
(nods towards bathroom)
Take a hit out of that little brown
bottle in my shaving kit.

DUKE goes in the bathroom.  He finds a little bottle -- a
label: ""DRINK ME.""

DUKE
What is this?

85.


GONZO
You won't need much.  Just a little
tiny taste, that stuff makes pure
mescaline seem like ginger-beer.
Adrenochrome.

DUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.

DUKE
Adrenochrome...

GONZO
(into PHONE)
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got
your message...what?  Hell, no, I
taught the bastard a lesson he'll
never forget... what?  No, not
dead, but he won't be bothering
anybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left
him out there, I stomped him, then
pulled all his teeth out...

DUKE (V/O)
I remember thinking, ""Jesus, what a
terrible thing to lay on somebody
with a head full of acid.""

DUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies
it -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...

GONZO
(to PHONE)
But here's the problem.  That
bastard cashed a bad check
downstairs and gave you as a
reference.  They'll be looking for
both of you.  Yeah, I know, but you
can't judge a book by its cover,
Lucy.  Some people are just
basically rotten... Anyway, the
last thing you want to do is call
this hotel again; they'll trace the
call and put you straight behind
bars... no, I'm moving to the
Tropicana right away.  I have to
go, they've got the phone tapped.
Yeah, I know, it was horrible, but
it's all over now... OH MY GOD!
THEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN!
(throws the PHONE
down; shouts)
No!  Get away from me!  I'm innocent!
It was Duke!  I swear to God!
(MORE)

86.


GONZO (CONT'D)
(stomps the PHONE; moans)
No, I don't know where she is.
You'll never catch Lucy!  She's
gone!  I swear, I don't know where
she is!  DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME!
(slams the PHONE down)


GONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.

GONZO
Well.  That's that.  She's probably
stuffing herself down the
incinerator about now.  That's the
last we should be hearing from Lucy.
(fumbling with the
hash pipe)
Where's the opium?

DUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY
STRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...

DUKE (V/O)
I remember slumping on the bed, his
performance had given me a bad jolt.
For a moment I thought his mind had
snapped -- that he actually believed
he was being attacked by invisible
enemies.  But the room was quiet
again.

DUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.

DUKE
Where'd you get this?

GONZO
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.

DUKE
Jesus... what kind of monster
client have you picked up this time?
There's only one source for this
stuff -- the adrenaline gland from
a living human body!

GONZO turns to smile at DUKE.

87.


GONZO
I know, but the guy didn't have any
cash to pay me.  He's one of these
Satanism freaks.  He offered me
human blood -- said it would take
me higher than I've ever been in my
life.
(laughs -- struts
round DUKE -- eyes
bright with expectation)
I thought he was kidding, so I told
him I'd just as soon have an ounce
or so of pure adrenochrome -- or
maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland
to chew on.

DUKE (V/O)
I could already feel the stuff
working on me -- the first wave
felt like a combination of mescaline
and methedrine -- maybe I should
take a swim, I thought...

DUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...

GONZO
Yeah, they nailed this guy for
child molesting.  He swore he
didn't do it. ""Why should I fuck
with children?"" he says. ""They're
too small."" Christ, werewolf is
entitled to legal counsel.  I
didn't dare turn the creep down.
He might have picked up a letter
opener and gone after my pineal
gland!

GONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS
GOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.

DUKE
Why not?  We should get some of
that.  Just eat a big handful and
see what happens.

GONZO
Some of what?

DUKE
(spitting words)
Extract of pineal!

88.


GONZO
(STARING AT DUKE WITH
A STRANGE SMILE)
Sure.  That's a good idea.  One
whiff of that shit would turn you
into something out of a goddamn
medical encyclopedia.

GONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.

GONZO
Man, your head would swell up like
a watermelon, you'd probably gain
about a hundred pounds in two
hours...

A CLOVEN HOOF BURSTS THROUGH GONZO'S SHOE.

DUKE
Right!

GONZO
... grow claws... bleeding warts.

GONZO'S CHEST EXPANDS -- BONY RIBS BURSTING HIS SHIRT.

DUKE
Yes!

GONZO
... then you'd notice about six
huge hairy tits swelling up on your
back...

A TAIL LASHES, HOOFS STRIKE THE FLOOR.  GONZO TOWERS -- A
FLAME RED DEMON!

DUKE
Fantastic!

DUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY
at the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM.  His
heels are dug into the mattress with both KNEES LOCKED,
EYEBALLS SWELLING.

GONZO-DEMON LOOMS AGAINST THE CEILING.

GONZO
you'd go blind... your body would
turn to wax... they'd have to put
you in a wheelbarrow and...

GONZO'S VOICE FADES AWAY -- DUKE'S frenzied gaze reveals
GONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE.

89.


GONZO
Man I'll try about anything; but
I'd never touch a pineal gland.

DUKE
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY!  What
happened?!  What about the glands?

GONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily...
towards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...

GONZO
Jesus, that stuff got right on top
of you, didn't it.

VEINS stand out on DUKE's forehead.  He is purplish-red.
OVER THE TOP!  Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!

DUKE
Maybe you could just... shove me
into the pool, or something...

GONZO shakes his head disgustedly.

GONZO
If I put you in the pool right now,
you'd sink like a goddamn stone.
You took too much.  Jesus, look at
your face, you're about to explode.

GONZO sits back down... watching the TV.

GONZO
Don't try and fight it, or you'll
get brain bubbles.  Strokes,
aneurysms.  You'll just wither up
and die.

DUKE FALLS TO THE GROUND, WRITHING, CATATONIC, SINKING INTO
PARALYSIS.

AND THE SOUND, SUDDENLY AND STRANGELY, OF THE VOICE OF
RICHARD NIXON AND HIS DISTORTED FACE ON THE TV SCREEN.

NIXON
Sacrifice... sacrifice...
sacrifice...

DUKE PASSES OUT.

BLACK SCREEN

90.


INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

Darkness.  Insanely, somewhere NILSSON plays -- ""Put the
lime in the coconut and mix em all up...""

DUKE (V/O)
What kind of rat-bastard psychotic
would play that song -- right now,
at this moment?

DUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in.  He lies,
awkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been
there days -- months.

DUKE (V/O)
When I came to the general back
alley ambiance of the suite was so
rotten, so incredibly foul.  How
long had I been lying there?  Hours?
Days?  Months?  All these signs of
violence.  What had happened?

DUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE
SIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving
whisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights
replace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,
pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered
on a shattered mirror.

DUKE (V/O)
There was evidence in this room of
excessive consumption of almost
every type of drug known to
civilized man since 1544 AD.

DUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --
HOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.

DUKE (V/O)
But what kind of addict would need
all these coconut husks and crushed
honeydew rinds?  Would the presence
of junkies account for all these
uneaten french fries?  These
puddles of glazed ketchup on the
bureau?  Maybe so, but then why all
this booze?  And these crude
pornographic photos smeared with
mustard that had dried to a hard
yellow crust...

DUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT
RAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.

91.


DUKE (V/O)
These were not the hoof prints of
your normal god-fearing junkie.  It
was too savage, too aggressive.

QUICK FLASHBACK:

GONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER:

BACK IN THE ROOM:

DUKE stares at the smashed mirror.

DUKE (V/O)
Grim memories and bad flashbacks.

In the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN
VOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS.

DUKE unzips and pisses.  THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE
MAGNUM .357!

DUKE (V/O)
Something ugly had happened.  I was
sure of it...

DUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.

The SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.

DUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out
of the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE
SMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...
sleeping on the sofa.

The ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.

A hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO
grappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is
muffling her screams with an ice bag.

MAID
Please... please... I'm only the
maid.  I didn't mean nothin!...

DUKE
(jumps up from the
bed, flashing his
press badge)
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!

92.


GONZO
(to DUKE)
She must have used a pass key.  I
was polishing my shoes in the
closet when I noticed her sneaking
in-so I took her.

DUKE shakes his head.

DUKE
(barks at the MAID)
What made you do it?  Who paid you
off?

MAID
Nobody.  I'm the maid!

GONZO
You're lying!  You were after the
evidence.  Who put you up to
this -- the manager?

MAID
I don't know what you're talking
about!

GONZO
Bullshit!  You're just as much a
part of it as they are!

MAID
Part of what?

DUKE
The dope ring.  You must know
what's going on in this hotel.  Why
do you think we're here?

MAID
(blubbering)
I know you're cops, but I thought
you were just here for that
convention.  I swear!  All I wanted
to do was clean up the room.  I
don't know anything about dope!

GONZO laughs.

GONZO
Come on, baby don't try to tell us
you never heard of the Grange Gorman.

93.


MAID
No!  No!  I swear to Jesus I never
heard of that stuff!

DUKE
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Maybe she's not part of it.

MAID
No!  I swear I'm not!

GONZO
(long pause)
In that case, maybe she can help.

MAID
Yes!  I'll help you all you need!
I hate dope!

DUKE
So do we, lady.

GONZO
(helping her up)
I think we should put her on the
payroll.  See what she comes up with.

DUKE
Do you think you can handle it?

MAID
What?

GONZO
One phone call every day.  Just
tell us what you've seen.  Don't
worry if it doesn't add up, that's
our problem.

GONZO hustles the MAID to the door.

MAID
You'd pay me for that?

DUKE
You're damn right.  But the first
time you say anything about this,
to anybody -- you'll go straight to
prison for the rest of your life.
What's your name?

MAID
Alice.  Just ring Linen Service and
ask for Alice.

94.


GONZO
Alright, Alice... you'll be
contacted by Inspector Rock.
Arthur Rock.  He'll be posing as a
politician.

DUKE
Inspector Rock will pay you.  In
cash.  A thousand dollars on the
ninth of every month.

MAID
Oh Lord!  I'd do just about anything
for that!

GONZO
You and a lot of other people.

DUKE
The password is: ""One Hand Washes
The Other."" The minute you hear
that, you say ""I fear nothing.""

MAID
I fear nothing.

She repeats the password several times while they listen to
make sure she has it right.

GONZO
Oh, and don't bother to make up the
room.  That way we won't have to
risk another of these little
incidents, will we?

MAID
Whatever you say, gentlemen.  I
can't tell you how sorry I am about
what happened...

GONZO
Don't worry, it's all over now.
Thank God for the decent people.

She smiles, repeating to herself ""One Hand Washes The Other""
as GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.

CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.

A grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.

GONZO ON TAPE
... Thank God for the decent people.

95.


DUKE sits in the middle of the wrecked suite with his
mangled tape recorder in front of him.

DUKE (V/O)
Memories of that night are extremely
hazy...

DUKE fast forwards through the tape -- SEARCHING: ""Awwww,
mama... can this really...be the end...?""

EXT. SAFEWAY SUPERMARKET - DAY

The WHITE WHALE waits -- gleaming -- beautiful.

DUKE (V/O)
There is a definite obligation,
when you boom around Vegas in a
white Coupe de Ville, to maintain a
certain style.

DUKE and GONZO burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping
basket loaded with COCONUTS, GRAPEFRUIT and TEQUILA.  They
send DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.

The trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather
at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with
junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.

DUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects
a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO
pulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering
CROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!

A GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.

DUKE places another coconut.  SMASH!  Milk and white meat
flies everywhere.

SHOPPER #1
Hey!  Is that your car?

DUKE
Sure is.

SMASH!  Coconut fragments fly.

DUKE
Any of you folks want the milk?
We're after the meat.  This is
honest coconut essence.  Real meat.

SMASH!

96.


SHOPPER #2
Meat, hell!  Look what you're doing
to that car!

GONZO
Fuck the car.  They should make
these things with a goddamn FM radio.

SMASH!

DUKE
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is
sucking our dollar balance dry!

SHOPPER #3
Someone should stop them!

SMASH!

DUKE
You poor fools don't understand, do
you?  This car is the property of
the World Bank!  That money goes to
ITALY!

SHOPPER #3
Somebody should call the police!

GONZO
Police?  Are you people crazy?

GONZO confronts the CROWD, hammer in one hand, a coconut in
the other.

GONZO (CONT'D)
You folks every heard of ole
Patrick Henry?  Know what he said?!

Silence -- the CROWD uncomprehending of this STONE DEGENERATE.

GONZO (CONT'D)
(ROARS)
GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH!

GONZO brings the hammer down on the hood.  CLANG!

A gasp from the CROWD.  Getting ugly.

GONZO (CONT'D)
In Samoa we LOVE THE CONSTITUTION!

SHOPPER #3
Bullshit.

97.


The CROWD move in.

SHOPPER #1
Call the goddamn police!

GONZO SWINGS THE HAMMER.  CLANG!

SHOPPER #4
Look what they've done to that
beautiful car!

DUKE jumps in behind the wheel.

DUKE
This crowd is not rational.  They
can't relate to us.  Let's go!

A final CLANG!  GONZO jumps in.

DUKE floors the accelerator -- screams at the CROWD.

DUKE
You people voted for Hubert Humphrey!
You killed Jesus!

They swerve round and through the CROWD.

DUKE (V/O)
The crowd broke ranks.  Nobody
wants to be run over by a Coupe de
Ville.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE FAST-FORWARDS... PLAYS THE TAPE...

VOICE ON TAPE
You found the American Dream?  In
this town?

DUKE ON TAPE
We're sitting on the main nerve
right now...

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO (wearing a single black glove) talk
conspiratorially to a 3RD MAN.  A PLACID ORANGUTAN in a bow
tie sits next to him.  THE BAR IS REVOLVING FASTER THAN
NORMAL.  DUKE IS INSANELY TALKATIVE -- WIRED!

98.


DUKE
The manager told me a story about
the owner of this place...about how
he always wanted to run away and
join the circus when he was a kid.
Well, now the bastard has his own
circus, and a license to steal, too.

3RD MAN
You're right -- he's the model.

DUKE
Absolutely!  Pure Horatio Alger...
Say...

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE playing the tape.

DUKE ON TAPE
... how much do you think he'd take
for the ape?

DUKE fast-forwards again -- searching... TRAFFIC NOISES.
SCREECH OF BRAKES.

VOICE ON TAPE
Holy God!...

A TERRIBLE GRINDING NOISE.

EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT

RENTAL AGENT
Holy God!, how did this happen?

DUKE
They beat the shit out of it.

RENTAL AGENT
The top's completely jammed!

The CAR RENTAL AGENT wrestles with the trashed car.

DUKE
Yeah, something's wrong with the
motor...

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE ON TAPE
... The generator light's been on
red ever since I drove the thing
into Lake Mead on a water test...

99.


A HUGE SPLASH...

The tape's gone too far.

DUKE
No, no.  Shit...

DUKE races the tape BACKWARDS... Then, SIRENS HOWL.

DUKE ON TAPE
Where's the ape?  I'm ready to
write a check.

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS BAR - NIGHT

DUKE is standing in the middle of A SEMI-DESTROYED BAZOOKO
CIRCUS REVOLVING BAR.  Mirrors are broken.  People are
recovering from some kind of battle.  THE BAR SPINS MADLY.
DUKE IS INSANELY WIRED.

3RD MAN
Forget it, he just attacked an old
man... he took a bite out of the
bartender's head!  The cops took
the ape away.

DUKE
Goddamnit!  What's the bail?  I
want that ape!  I've already
reserved two first-class seats on
the plane.

DUKE (V/O)
There was every reason to believe
that we had been heading for
trouble, that we'd pushed our luck
a bit far...

INT. WHITE WHALE ON THE STREETS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

GONZO SCREAMS ABUSE out of the window at a Ford alongside
the VOMIT STREAKED WHITE WHALE.  DUKE MAKES A SUPERHUMAN
EFFORT TO STAY ON THE ROAD.

GONZO
Hey there!  You folks want to buy
some heroin?

In the Ford: TWO COUPLES -- MIDDLE-AGED AMERICAN FACES
FROZEN IN SHOCK -- stare straight ahead.  GONZO leans out --
close to them.

100.


GONZO
Hey, honkies!  Goddamnit, I'm
serious.  I want to sell you some
pure fucking smack!

No reaction.

GONZO
Cheap heroin!  This is the real
stuff!  You won't get hooked.  I
just got back from Vietnam!  This
is scag, folks.  Pure scag!

The lights change.  The Ford bolts.  DUKE keeps pace with
them.

GONZO
Shoot!  Fuck!  Scag!  Blood!
Heroin!  Rape!  Cheap!  Communist!
Jab it right in your fucking
eyeballs!

The MAN IN THE BACK SEAT suddenly loses control -- enraged,
lunges against the glass, trying to get at GONZO.

MAN IN CAR
You dirty bastards!  Pull over and
I'll kill you!  God damn you!  You
bastards!

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

BACK IN THE SUITE:

The tapes runs:

MAN IN CAR ON TAPE
You dirty bastards!

An ugly squeal of brakes.

GONZO ON TAPE
Shit, he was trying to bite me!  I
shoulda maced the fucker!

DUKE fast forwards the tape.  The TAPE MANGLES -- the sounds
ski to a halt...

DUKE grabs the nearest tool -- uses it to hook out the tape,
then realizes... IT'S GONZO'S RAZOR-SHARP FOLDING KNIFE... A
CHILLING MOMENT...

DUKE turns the knife over... THERE'S A DRIED CRIMSON SPOT ON
THE BLADE... OR IS IT DRIED MASHED POTATOES?

101.


READ ON TO FIND OUT!

DUKE
(remembering)
Back door beauty!

DUKE (V/O)
The mentality of Las Vegas is so
grossly atavistic that a really
massive crime often slips by
unrecognized.

DUKE SCRAPS A LITTLE OF THE CRUST -- TASTES IT...

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
The possibility of physical and
mental collapse is very real... No
sympathy for the devil; keep that
in mind.  Buy the ticket, take the
ride...

HE HEARS THE SOUNDS OF SOMEONE BEHIND BEATEN UP...

VOICE OFF
Shit!  Faggot!  Bastard!

EXT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT

WHACK!  SHADOWY FIGURES beat up a MAN -- give him A GOOD
KICKING.  BRUTAL AND UGLY.

DUKE (V/O)
North Vegas is where you go when
you've fucked up once too often on
The Strip and when you're not even
welcome in the cut-rate Downtown
places.

PAN to reveal a seedy diner -- THE NORTH STAR CAFE in the
background.  Through the window -- DUKE and GONZO sit at the
counter.

INT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT

DUKE (V/O)
The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed
like a fairly safe haven from our
storms.  No hassles, no talk.  Just
a place to rest and regroup.  I
wasn't even hungry.

GONZO stuffs a hamburger down PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE
BEATING going on outside the window.  Duke reads a newspaper.

102.


DUKE (V/O)
There was nothing in the atmosphere
of the North Star to put me on my
guard...

GONZO
(to WAITRESS)
Two glasses of ice water with ice.

The WAITRESS brings the ice water.

DUKE (V/O)
She looked like a burnt out
caricature of Jane Russell.  She
was definitely in charge here...

GONZO gulps down his glass of water and hands her a napkin.

DUKE (V/O)
He did it very casually, but I knew
that our peace was about to be
shattered.

DUKE
What was that?

GONZO shrugs.

The WAITRESS stands at the end of the counter with her back
to them while she ponders the napkin... She turns.

WAITRESS
What is this?

GONZO
A napkin.

THE WAITRESS slams the napkin down on the counter.

WAITRESS
Don't give me that bullshit!  I
know what it means!  You goddamn
fat pimp bastard.

GONZO
That's the name of a horse I used
to own.  What's wrong with you?

WAITRESS
You sonofabitch!  I take a lot of
shit in this place, but I sure as
hell don't have to take it off a
SPIC PIMP!

103.


GONZO GOES VERY VERY STILL AT THIS...

DUKE (V/O)
Jesus.  I thought, what's happening?

DUKE picks up the napkin.  On it is printed in careful red
letters: ""BACK DOOR BEAUTY?""

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
The question mark was emphasized.

WAITRESS
(screams)
Pay your bill and get the hell out!
You want me to call the cops?

GONZO
Spic pimp?

GONZO's hand goes inside his shirt.  He PULLS OUT THE RAZOR-
SHARP HUNTING KNIFE.

GONZO KEEPS HIS EYES ON THE WAITRESS.  He walks about six
feet down the aisle and lifts the receiver of the pay phone.
He SLICES IT OFF, then brings the receiver back to his stool
and sits down.

DUKE (V/O)
I was stupid with shock -- not
knowing whether to run or start
laughing.

GONZO
(casual)
How much is the lemon meringue pie?

DUKE (V/O)
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but
her brain was functioning on some
basic motor survival level.

WAITRESS
(blurting -- on automatic)
Thirty-five cents!

GONZO
(laughing)
I mean the whole pie.

The WAITRESS MOANS.  GONZO places a $5 BILL on the counter.

GONZO
Let's say five dollars.  Okay?

104.


GONZO walks round the counter TAKING THE PIE OUT OF THE
DISPLAY CASE.

DUKE (V/O)
The sight of the blade had triggered
bad memories.  The glazed look in
her eyes said her throat had been
cut.  She was still in the grip of
paralysis when we left.

DUKE IS ROOTED TO THE SPOT.

GONZO urges him out the door.  The camera retreats with them.

The WAITRESS STANDS THERE -- PETRIFIED.  Alone in a lousy
bar at night.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE's face as he stares at the knife -- remembering...

GONZO (V/O)
Drive!  Drive!  Drive!  We have
fifteen fucking minutes to get me
on that plane!

EXT. ROAD ON OUTSKIRTS OF LAS VEGAS - DAY

The WHITE WHALE, looking like shit -- it's TOP HALF UP,
TORN, SLAPPING IN THE WIND -- ROARS THROUGH AN INTERSECTION
as the light turns red.

DR. GONZO FRANTICALLY PAWS OVER A MAP.

DUKE drives -- SILENT AND FURIOUS -- sick to his stomach
with the PSYCHOTIC GONZO.

GONZO
What are you doing?  You were
supposed to turn back there!

DUKE (V/O)
We had abused every rule that Vegas
lived by -- burning the locals,
abusing the tourists, terrifying
the help.  The only chance now, I
felt, was the possibility that we'd
gone to such excess that nobody in
the position to bring the hammer
down on us could possibility
believe it.

DUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.

105.


GONZO
Jesus Christ!!!

There, crossing the road in front of them, is LUCY -- her
paintings under her arm -- looking lost.  SHE LOOKS UP WITH
A VAGUE SENSE OF RECOGNITION...

DUKE throws the car into a SKIDDING REVERSE TURN AND ROARS
OFF.

EXT. DESERT ROAD OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - DAY

THE WHITE WHALE TEARS DOWN THE DESERTED FREEWAY.  GONZO
looks wildly around.

GONZO
Goddamnit!  We're lost!  What are
we doing out here on this
godforsaken road?

GONZO sees that THEY'RE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT
RUNWAY.

GONZO
The airport is over there!

DUKE
Never missed a plane yet.

DUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the
WHALE down into the grassy freeway divider.  WHEELS CHURNING,
HE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight
up, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER
A FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the
RUNWAY.

GONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He
throws a worried look at DUKE.

DUKE
I'll drop you right next to the
plane.

They SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET
ENGINE SCREAM.

GONZO
No!  I can't get out!  They'll
crucify me.  I'll have to take the
blame!

106.


DUKE
(irritatedly)
Ridiculous!  Just say you were
hitchhiking to the airport and I
picked you up.  You never saw me
before.  Shit, this town is full of
white Cadillac convertibles.  I
plan to go through there so fast
that nobody will even glimpse the
goddamn license plate.  You ready?

GONZO
Why not?  But for Christ's sake,
just do it fast!

EXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY

DUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.  GONZO
JUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.

DUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.

DUKE
Hey!

GONZO stops -- turns.

DUKE
Don't take any guff from those
swine.  Remember, if you have any
trouble you can always send a
telegram to the Right People.

GONZO
Yeah... Explaining my Position.
Some asshole wrote a poem about
that once...

GONZO pauses.

GONZO
Probably good advice, if you have
shit for brains.

GONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT
TO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND
LEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.

DUKE (V/O)
There he goes -- one of God's own
prototypes -- a high powered mutant
of some kind never even considered
for mass production.  Too weird to
live and too rare to die.

107.


DUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH
THE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT

On the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find
DUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his
typewriter.

DUKE
We are all wired into a survival
trip now.  No more of the speed
that fueled that 60's.  That was
the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.
He crashed around America selling
""consciousness expansion"" without
ever giving a thought to the grim
meat-hook realities that were lying
in wait for all the people who took
him seriously...

DUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly
rises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT
IMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.

DUKE
All those pathetically eager acid
freaks who thought they could buy
Peace and Understanding for three
bucks a hit.  But their loss and
failure is ours too.  What Leary
took down with him was the central
illusion of a whole life-style that
he helped create...

RISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30
FEET HIGH.  DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE
CAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...

DUKE
... a generation of permanent
cripples, failed seekers, who never
understood the essential old-mystic
fallacy of the Acid Culture: the
desperate assumption that somebody...
or at least some force -- is
tending the light at the end of the
tunnel.

HIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX
SURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON
SIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT
LIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.

108.


EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

A BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE
DRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out
of the back seat as he takes a bump.

DUKE (V/O)
There was only one road back to L.A.
US Interstate 15, just a flat-out
high speed burn through Baker and
Barstow and Berdoo, then on to the
Hollywood Freeway straight into
frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,
just another freak in the Freak
Kingdom.

DUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING
facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon
sign that flashes beer.

DUKE
Ahhh.  Wonderful.

DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.

INT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY

DUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all
about the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON
WHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE
RAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD
MAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden
bar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.

PROPRIETOR
What'll you have?

DUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.

DUKE
(doubtfully)
Ballantine Ale...?

THE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES AND
RELAXES.

DUKE
Hard to find it served like this
anymore.

As he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE
AMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY
PIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack
reads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.

109.


PROPRIETOR
Where ya comin' from, young man?

DUKE
Las Vegas.

PROPRIETOR
A great town, that Vegas.  I bet
you had good luck there.  You're
the type.

DUKE
I know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.

PROPRIETOR
(trustingly)
That's a fine combination.  You
can't lose.

A LOVELY GIRL appears.  Seeing DUKE, she smiles.  CAN THIS
REALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY?  She approaches him... and...
KISSES THE PROPRIETOR.

DUKE
(caught off guard... muttering)
Oh, my God!...

PROPRIETOR
(not understanding)
This is my granddaughter...

DUKE
(recovering)
Don't worry...
(leans forward in confidence)
... and I'm actually the District
Attorney from Ignoto County.
(winks)
Just another good American like
yourself.

A MOMENT.  THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.

Wordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the
back of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.

WHO FEELS ASHAMED.

DUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.

EXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY

A CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.
Gets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...

110.


A state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.

Somberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags
step off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...

DUKE switches on the ignition.  Something rolls off the
trembling dash... DUKE catches it...

ONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...

DUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.  THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --
TEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.

DUKE
HOLY SHIT!!!

DUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT
THE MARINES.

DUKE
GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!

DUKE ROARS AWAY.  AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS
IN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE
CONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

The TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY

DUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!

DUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.

DUKE (V/O)
My heart was filled with joy.  I
felt like a monster reincarnation
of Horatio Alger... a man on the
move... and just sick enough to be
totally confident.

The WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK.

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

Once again, I find myself with my friends
Dancin' the night away, it's like the party never ends

It goes sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights
Wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in stars and stripes
(Eclectic electric, ladies of the evenin', drinkin' booze and minglin')
Mashin' to the music, I can do anything
Freaky dicky star speckles and pink butterflies
And life is nice, so nice

Sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights

115,Forgive,"I always said that'd be it
That I wouldn't stick around
If it ever came to this
And here I am
So confused
How am I supposed to leave?
When I can't even move

In the time it would have took to say
Honey I'm home how was your day?
You dropped a bomb right where we live
And just expect me to forgive

Well that's a mighty big word for such a small man
And I'm not sure I can
Cause I don't even know now who I am
It's too soon for me to say forgive..

I should ask but I won't
Was it love or just her touch
Cause I don't think I wanna know
So get you some things
And get out (get out, get out)
Don't call me for a day or two
So I can sort this out

Well you might as well've ripped the life
Right out of me
Right here tonight
And through the fallin tears you said
Can you ever just forgive?

Well, thats a mighty big word for such a small man
And I'm not sure I can
Cause I don't even know now who I am
It's too soon for me to say forgive..",Rebecca Lynn Howard,Rebecca Lynn Howard,2002,"[100, 95, 74, 71, 75]",5

When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven
We're in heaven!

[Verse 1]
Oh, thinking about our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me coming back for more

[Chorus]
Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in Heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven (We're in heaven)

Now, nothing could change what you mean to me
There's a lot that I could say
But just hold me now
'Cause our love will light the way

There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life
I know I was born and I know that I'll die
The in-between is mine
I am mine

And the feeling gets left behind
All the innocence, lost at one time
Significant behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight

The ocean is full 'cause everyone's cryin'
The full moon is lookin' for friends at hightide
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied
I only know my mind
I am mine

And the meaning that gets left behind
All the innocents lost in one time
Significant, behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight

Significance between the lines

Baby, if you wit' it, just clap yo' hands
Stop playin' girl, back that ass up and
Spend that cash dog, drink the Henny and
Freak that girl like you tryna have a baby cuz

Everybody's out to fuck tonight
The fine women, they out to fuck tonight
My niggas, they down to fuck tonight
Ladies, fellas, the won't stop players

[Fat Joe]
Came through the door, seen it before
Hands touchin' the ceiling, booty streakin' the floor
You ever felt good to the point you so sure that
All the attention in the club is yours
Got your hair done up, shades Christian Dior
Leave us, trade a little happy on your Vickey draws
Gettin' your dance on hard, who could wish for more
And your crew's all but know it's a horse
Got the Don all warm and it ain't the Hen'
Feelin' like the Don woman, you could wrestle her chin
Shorty, come a little closer while the record spin
I wanna freak a little longer, can they play it again

Repeat 1

Yo, got my mind on my money, money on my mind
And to let you know, you just as good as gold
It's like we got our own little private party goin' on
And the scene just changed into shores of San Juan
It's so intimate, we so into it
Such a tender thing, but fuck I'm innocent
Grindin' so hard you gotta know what I'm thinkin'
Laughin' cuz I'mma kidnap you for the weekend
Now we at the pad about to crack a case
Playin' the couch like Ceasar's, she feedin' me grapes
Not for nuttin' hon, the sex is great
But you know you got to go, I got checks to chase... next

Repeat 1

[Ginuwine]
If you're wit' it grab your friends, follow Joe and me
Cuz it's on, it's on
Went in and got the Cris' and a pound of weed
It's on, it's on

[Fat Joe]
Now mami, let's get serious, cuz by the looks of it
It seems your sexuality is just a little curious
You got a friend, we could gather then split
If not, I got a girl for every girl I get
There's a drop in the lot and it whip so fast
We hit the swiss hotel before you finish your glass
And you know you wanna be where the cake is at
Where the pockets just like calories, extra fat
Mami, your body like Malery on Natural Born Killer
She like, they got money but ya'll are more realer
She wanna roll wit' us, pretty much to crit' us
No beatin' around the bush, just beatin' it 'till you bit us

119,American Child,"I was ten, I was thin, I was playing first base
With a secondhand glove and dirt on my face
In nowhere, Virginia
Who'd ever figure that kid in the yard would go very far

It was 419 Lakewood, had no silver spoons
Just an old beat-up upright that played out of tune
Now I'm singing and living the life that I love
And when I count my blessings, I thank God I was an American child

An American child
'Cause dreams can grow wild born inside an American child

Seven pounds, three ounces, she's got my nose
And she's into my heart as deep as it goes
With a promise that's more than just someone's last name
Anyone's equal, in late August came an American child

An American child
'Cause dreams can grow wild born inside an American child

My grandfather would have been eighty today
But in '45 he fell down beside an American child

Everyday I need an ounce and a half, S.P
The only flower that you know, with a bounce and a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash so I could roll up
Hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)
So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could (uh-huh)
You got beef with Styles P, I come to splatter the hood

Smoke like a chim-in-ney {*inhaling*}, matter fact I
Smoke like a gun, when a killer see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did; add to that
That I smoke like the hippies did, back in the 70's
Spit with the finishin' touch - get this, that
I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes, I get high when
Bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?
Like the M-5 pedal when it's touchin' the floor
I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'mma never give a fuck (that's right) cause I'm better than you

I'mma smoke till my lungs collapse; I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful; I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious and I know what a hour do (I know dat)
High for a livin', gots ta ride for a livin'
With my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)

Back and fourth to the studios
Hopping out limousines, rocking the latest jeans
Jordan's, fresh
T-Shirt, new
And even though these things are true
It's hard work and sometimes I just want to go home
And tell my girl...

[Chorus]
Braid my hair
C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my hood, feeling good
No worries or no cares
Baby, use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama in my life
While you braid my hair...

You may think that I'm complaining
But that's not the case, all I'm saying
Is my body gets weak, my mind gets tired
I need sleep, but I got to keep
Travelling on the road
Doing these shows
New York to Cali
Dallas to Philly
It's the rules of the game, that I chose to play
But sometimes I want to say
Baby won't you...

Do it anyway you want
Baby take it slowly
Front to back, side to side, criss cross

Put it down like you love me

In my ear
Tell me what I want to hear
I swear
I can't wait for you to braid my hair...

C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my hood, feeling good
No worries or no cares
Baby, use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama in my life
While you braid my hair...

Do what you want to do
Baby its up to you
Sit me between your legs
Girl won't you braid my hair
Baby make me feel alright
And make it last all night
And take away the stress and drama in my life
Won't you braid my hair...

I know she said it's alright
But you can make it up next time
I know she knows it's not right
There ain't no use in lying

Maybe she thinks I know something
Maybe maybe she thinks it's fine
Maybe she knows something I don't
I'm so, I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying

[Chorus]
It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go
And often times we're lazy
It seems to stand in my way
Because no one, no, not one
Likes to be let down

[Verse 2]
I know she loves the sunrise
No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes
And I know that when she said she's going to try
Well it might not work because of other ties and
I know she usually has some other ties
And I wouldn't want to break them, no, I wouldn't want to break them
Maybe she'll help me to untie this but
Until then, well, I'm going to have to lie too

It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go

Back when I was young
Couldn't wait to grow up
Get away and get out on my own
And looking back now
Ain't it funny how
I've been trying to get back home, yea
When my low self esteem
Needs a man loving me
And I find me a perfect catch
Then I see my friends
Having wild weekends
Then I don't wanna get quite so attached
Just as soon as I get what I want
I get unsatisfied

They all want curls
And the brunettes wanna be blonde

And the night, it is aching
Two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed
And the day it is breaking

For love and only love

Let's go places no one else has been

Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley t'bacca

M' Sisters a nurse at the old folks home
Mama still cooking too much for supper
And me I’ve been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
No, I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

Deliah plays that ol' church pian'a
Sitting out on her daddy’s farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singin' in the choir
Me, I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord, I've been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
Lord, I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when
Long time gone

Tryin' to beat the big deal
Playin' down on Broadway
Gettin' there the hard way
Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah I’m gonna be a star

Now, me and Deliah singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin’

They've got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank

Maybe tonight
We could close the door and lock ourselves inside
Take time to feel
I don't want to miss the chance to be so real
The days all fly away and I forget the truth
Everything that matters, is, in this room

When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me

My heart is yours
And every part of me still wants to give you more
More time to love
'Cos you never know when life will leave us
I want to take in all the beauty here
Oh, let the world around us just disappear

When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me
Oh lie next to me

When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be

151,The Impossible,"[Verse 1]
My dad chased monsters from the dark
He checked underneath my bed
And he could lift me with one arm
Way up over top his head
He could loosen rusty bolts
With a quick turn of his wrench
He pulled splinters from his hand
Never even flinched

[Pre-Chorus]
In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry
But the day that grandpa died, I realized

[Chorus]
Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

[Verse 2]
Then there was my junior year
Billy had a brand new car
It was late, the road was wet
I guess the curve was just too sharp
I walked away without a scratch
They brought the helicopter in
And Billy couldn't feel his legs
Said he'd never walk again

[Pre-Chorus]
But Billy said he would and his mom and daddy prayed
And the day we graduated, he stood up to say

[Chorus]
Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

[Bridge]
So don't tell me that it's over
Don't give up on you and me
'Cause there's no such thing as hopeless
If you believe

Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon light
A corner bar, and it just seemed right
So I pulled up

[Verse 2]
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
And he walked up, and said: ""What'll it be?""
I said: ""The good stuff""

[Verse 3]
He didn't reach around for the whiskey;
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said: ""You can't find that here

[Chorus 1]
Because it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

[Verse 4]
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said: ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends

[Verse 5]
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""

[Verse 6]
He said ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey

[Chorus 2]
Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

[Outro]
He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up
Because that's the good stuff
That's the good stuff""",Kenny Chesney,Kenny Chesney,2002,"[57, 51, 49, 42, 28, 24, 22, 22, 24, 26, 23, 23, 28, 32, 32, 37, 42, 54, 63, 70]",20

And my father served in the army in the 50s
He lost his right eye in a training combat mission
He came home
He put a flag up on the farm I was raised on
I lost him six months prior to the attacks on New York City and The United States and that flag that flew out in that yard it's flown there everyday
He raised me right and he never bitched one time about loseing his eye
I never heard him cry about it one time
He was glad to go do it and that's why we're free today and it's our turn to stand on what our fathers and forefathers did for us and make sure we don't let'em down

For another night in a row
This is becoming too routine for me

Lead you on

My friends over you

Please tell me everything

From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard
I sell it whipped un-whipped, it’s soft or hard
I'm the, neighborhood pusha
Call me Subwoofer, cause I pump base like that, Jack
On or off the track, I'm heavy cuz
Ball 'til you fall cause you could duck to the Feddy Govs
Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes
Benz convoys with the wagon on the side
Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram?
I'm tryna show y'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting, be damned if I'm hurting
Legend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland
Platinum on the block with consistent hits

I bake them cakes as fast as I can
And you can tell by how my bread stack up
Then disguise it as rap so the Feds back up
Watch it, like my whip, like my chick topless
Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got wholes for a dozen
Even 11-5 if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help

And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill
Filthy, the word that best defines me

Glock with two tips whoever gets in the way

Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake

Will this be an amputation?

To tell her I hate

Think of her think of me
Think about us, it's a intimacy
I'm trying to strum like guitars in this beat
And consider riding she'll kick the blahzay spleen
Plus you got a man, but he ain't quite me
The type of man that try to give you what you need
And he wanna know where you are, where you be
Where you going, where you today, where you started to be, damn
If I was him I wouldn't even leave
I would trust you what you say that you are where you been
Say he the type of nigga that's still cheap
Take his girl on a date and they go to Mickey D's
See, I'm the type that try to stab in a jeep
Try to take you out to see things and occasionally creep
Yeah, your man is doing things I can't really see
Don't sound too good, it sound tainted to me

How many years does it take for a record to blow?
I'm doing exactly how many licks it took for my hoes
Spending your cash flow cause she was so out ho
Scandal love, cause love full of scandal
Too much chick for that ass she couldn't handle that
Well it's the same tainted love in the music business
People they lose their brain just to get up in this
Let's be a star for a day, everything in life is just okay
People say things they don't really wanna say
Hey but it's okay, cause you're a star for the day
People a smile at you when they really wanna frown
Well a that's just the way tainted folk get down
Just keep it real and, we'll see
When the situation is tainted love is always free

Love is always free

You say you love me, but is it really real?
Would you, fix me green tea if I'm feeling ill
Could you, give me a back rub to sooth after a long day?
Dinner by candlelight but you're the main entree
And if so, I do the same with other treats to give you
Trailing rose pedals from your door to beneath your pillow
With a bucket of champagne on your night stand
Experience with someone who want in they lifespan
The same...

[Outro: Dwele]
Real love, real, real, everybody knows that love's real love
Someone to trust in you for real
Everybody need love; that's real
I would never want nothing tainted
Wait a minute, what you feel?
Faded if your loving was tainted
True, oh, I know true love is hard to find
Just let it find you; for real
If you found love to keep it real
Keep love from being tainted, being tainted

With an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot (Turn left)
Where your wife really love me cause the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, start the 3-wheel Benz (Skrtt)
Hyper white lights, ultra-violet lens
Sumitomo tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the horn go, (Uh uh) boy can you top that
I'ma show you some shit, rookie, press that button

Four 15's, didn't see no wires
And then I heard (Boom) from the amplifiers

Up and down and up they goin'
Bodies on the Roadster, Lexus, you know what
That hard-top Bimmer, yo Ma, that's your truck
I'm comin' up, the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up to bubbly
430 Lex with the convertible top
And the rims keeps spinning every time I stop
Got a Superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a old school Caddy with a diamond in the back

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!

Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis

Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""

Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

You, and your mans, and them just took over the floor
Started doing your thing
And it made me notice you even more
The way you turned around and looked at me seemed as though
You must've somehow felt me staring on the low
Something tells me you're the kind of guy I'd like to get to know

[Chorus]
I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights

[Verse 2]
Why is this the first time that I'm seeing you around?
Could you be visiting, or are you new in town?
Yeah, whatever the case
I'm feeling you right here and right now
Your smile and all the love you showing lets me know that you
Like what you see and wanna get to know me too
This could very well be the start of something special
Happy that I met you

[Chorus]
I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights
I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights

[Bridge]
I didn't think that I'd come here tonight
Meet someone like you
Start feeling the way I do
Seems like we've known each other most of our lives
After one conversation, this must be right

[Chorus]
I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights
I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights
I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights
I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie

[Lil Wayne]
Ay, let me slide in the Benz with the fished-out fins
Hit the mall wit my girlfriends, dish out ends
Cause you know it ain't trickin if you got it
Copped baby girl what she desired
It's chump change ma, marijuana scholar
Know'n what I got up in my styrofoam cup - that purple stuff
It was given to me at birth to stunt
So that's why I cop the Bentley with the leather and the furry cups

[Baby]
Hey, hold on mami them whips on dubs
Cadillac Truck, 28's, no rubs
Slide in the Benz, fins, bubble-eyed lens
Car show in New York, y'all know who wins
It's the Birdman daddy, with the Gucci Prada
Slant back Cup Truck, no rims - can't holla
It's that Louie Fendi on Ostrich streets
It's the tailor-made daddy, mami do you love me?

[Hook: TQ]
Baby, I'm a stunna
I ain't gon change it
Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?
Cause I'm about to bring it
Oh baby, can't stop the stun, no, no

[Baby]
Pop one, pop two with the new Nike shoes
Royal blue jag on 'em 22's
Slippers, white to breate, 500 Degreez
In that Cadillac Truck on 'em 23's
I'm the boss of the game with the money and fame
All these, naked women that pop champagne
And these, marble floors stay high as Rick James
If you know my name then you know my game

[Lil Wayne]
It's Lil Whodi from the hot block with serious flow
Gotta get dough, cha'll won't feel me broke
But, y'all don't hear me though
Til I'm rolling down my window where my grill is show
And you know I probably pump it through the hood on them 24's
Word, rims poking out the side of the err
Glock, have ya ribs poking out the side of your shirt
I'm a 17 nigga and I ride through the turf

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
Hey, and my pinky glow cause my rings is so...
Blingy blingy, yo stop blinking though
We smoke stinky stinky dro
And we don't cop them incy wincy o's
And we don't stop, nah, we blow
Fuck the pee-ple
Everywhere we go we smell like ick yo
Birdman, my Paw so that make me go.. fly like an eagle, fasheezy

[Baby]
See they think cause I stay English turn
That stunna don't ever OZ to burn
I go in each over and ball like a dog
Me and my niggs ball like a dog
Cars on my streets, all on the lawn
Ice in my teeth, all on my arm
Tats in my face, my back and my arm

[Lil Wayne]
Tats in my face, my back and my arm

[Hook]

[Outro: Mannie Fresh]
Yo, there it is, ya lil' low life
See, I'm a Bro-fessional - you a rookie
Fuck, a game so serious I could sell a hooker some pussy
That's some serious shit
Oh yeah, believe that
Who we rollin wit?
We rollin wit Cash Money
Oh, I forgot about peace - Peace!

184,Wherever You Will Go,"[Verse 1]
So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

[Chorus]
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

[Verse 2]
And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To want you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

[Chorus]
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

[Bridge]
Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

[Breakdown]
I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

[Chorus]
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

185,Tonight I Wanna Be Your Man,"Baby light a couple candles, lock the bedroom door
Put on some sweet soul music, throw a blanket on the floor
Surrender to my patient hands
All week I've been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man

It hit me just this morning, when I passed you in the hall
I swear I caught you lookin, like you dont know me at all
Let me show you who I am
All week I've been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man

And I'll always be, your cover when your cold
And when the world winds up against you, im the safe place you can go
But now and then, we need to find some time to be in love, just be in love

Now the whole worlds in bed sleepin, I think were finally alone
And if the telephone starts ringin, we'll pretend like were not home
Cause any fool would understand
That all week ive been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man

Mhhmh, mmhmmmhm

So let me show you who I am
All week ive been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man

[Verse 1]
Never thought that we would ever be more than friends
Now I'm all confused 'cause for you, I have deeper feelings
We both thought it was cool to cross the line
And I was convinced it would be alright
Now things are strange, nothing's the same
And really I just want my friend back

[Chorus]
And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Oh can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Holdin' on)
Said my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'd hate to walk away from you as if this never existed
'Cause when we kissed, the moment after, I looked at you different, yeah
Lately, I gotta watch what I say
'Cause you take things personal nowadays
You used to laugh, now you get mad
Damn, I just want my friend back

[Chorus]
And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Oh can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Holdin' on)
Said my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Can't get you out of my system)

Oh oh oh, oh oh, yeah
What happened to the one I used to know? (Oh, yeah, yeah)
The one I used to laugh and joke with?
The one I used to tell all my secrets?
We used to chill and be down for whatever, whenever together, yeah

And my mind's gone half crazy (Oh) 'cause I can't leave you alone (I'm going half crazy, baby)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me (Oh) holdin' on (Over you, yeah)
Said my mind's gone half crazy (Yeah) 'cause I can't leave you alone (And I just don't know)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (I said I just don't know what to do now)
(Listen, we used to chill)
And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Yeah, we used to hang)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Yeah, we used to do, we used to do some many things together, yeah)

You could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doing, imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

[Chorus]
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face?

[Verse 3]
Everyone is changing, there's no one left that's real
So make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel
Cause I am lost without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

And you could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I will save you from all of the unclean
I wonder what you're doing, I wonder where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

Can you take it all away?

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?

No-nobody told me what you thought
Nobody told me what to say

Told you when to run away
Nobody told you where to hide
Nobody told you what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Showed you when to run away

Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face

190,You Know That I Love You,"[Intro]
Mmm, I really gotta know
If you trust me, do you trust me now?
Hey, I really gotta know

[Verse 1]
You know that I love you
And that ain't gon' change
And though you're not here with me now
My love for you stays the same
Don't worry about those other girls
They can't take your place
You're the only woman in my world
And you can't be replaced

[Chorus]
(Girl, you know)
You know that I love you
(Ooh, girl)
Girl, you're everything to me
(Ooh, girl)
Just let me show you
(Ooh, baby)
Just how much you mean to me

[Verse 2]
It's been such a long time
Since I've been with you
My friends say I should play around
They wish that they could have what I found in you
You know I'm not that other guy
Who broke your heart, mmm
You're still the only woman in my world
Even when we're apart

[Chorus]

Believe me, what I say is true
(You know it's true now)
You know my heart belongs to you
(And only you, and you can't be replaced)

[Chorus]

It's time for you to strike back
They're looking at you
Whitney Houston
Muhammad 2 G
They're watching your every move

They're watching you

[Chorus 1]
Why you looking at me
Don't get mad at me
Because I'm still going to be me
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)

(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)
Whatchulookinat
I feel your eyes on me
You been telling lies on me
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)

(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)

[Verse 2]
See I don't understand
Why you keep peeping me
When you don't even like me
You're after me and my man
Don't think you're stressing me
Because your lies don't excite me, no no

[Chorus 2]
(Never thought)
Never thought, Never thought
(Never knew)
Never knew that you would do this to me
Do this to me
(Try to ruin me) Ruin me
(Be my enemy) Be my enemy
(Never thought)
Never thought, Never thought, Never thought

Would act as if you're cool with me
So why you looking at me

Telling lies
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)
Tell me
(Whatchulookinat)
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)
Whatchulookinat

[Verse 3]
Oh you know you're wrong
Don't want to respect my song
But it's okay because either way
My following is real strong
You try so hard to show the whole world what I do
Now I'm turning the cameras back on you
Same spotlight that once gave me fame
Trying to dirty up Whitney's name

[Chorus 2]
(Never thought)
Never thought, Never thought
(Never knew)
Never knew that you would do this to me
Do this to me
(Try to ruin me) Ruin me
(Be my enemy) Be my enemy
(Never thought)
Never thought, Never thought, Never thought

Would act as if you're cool with me

You been telling lies on me

Whatchulookinat
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)

[Verse 4]
Messing with my reputation
Ain't even got no education
Trying to mess with my concentration
Don't even have a clue of what I'm facing
All you know you need to stop it
Defaming my name for a profit
God is the reason my soul is free
And I don't need you looking at me

[Chorus 1]
Why you looking at me
Don't get mad at me
Because I'm still going to be me
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)
Whatchulookinat
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)

I feel your eyes on me
You been telling lies on me

Why you looking at me
Don't get mad at me
Because I'm still going to be me
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)

I feel your eyes on me
You been telling lies on me

192,Blue Jeans,"[Intro: Jazze Pha]
Ladies and gentlemen, MJM presents Yasmeen
Woo, Jazze Pha, woo-weh, Blue Jeans, I like them

[Yasmeen]
I've been checkin' you, and like the way you walk
Your sexy b-boy style, that confidential throne
So let me take a minute to introduce myself
Cuz you don't need to know anybody else

[Chorus: Yasmeen]
Here's my number you can call
Anytime you wanna talk
That's exactly where I'll be
When you wanna get at me
And if you wonder what to do
That's got me into
It's ya blue jeans, the way you rock in them blue jeans, baby

[Yasmeen]
No one makes me feel, the way you do inside
Sensation is so real, it hit me day or night
Some people, nice and safe
Some where and near ya heart
Wouldn't wanna loose this, love before we start
You got everything, that I want, that I want
You got everything, that I need, that I need

[Chorus 2X]

[Ghostface Killah]
Days went by and it was plain to see
That I finally figured out why you started diggin' me
It was the jeans not the rings, couch fit, scene
Round the same time when Rae dropped C.R.E.A.M
I still had rock, but very little stones
And messin' wit you, had me not comin' home
And word on the streets is that you got me whipped (word up)
It got back and had a brother on flip (word)
How they know I had brought that whip
It's all good, that's just one of my gifts
Cuz the love it when my stomach touch ya body
Baby, my tongue game is mad crazy
Enough about me, Ton' Starks, sugar, I drove the Arc
Noah taught me how to parallel park
I may hit you while I'm writin' my darts
And like 15 to 20 minutes, you heard baby, that's from the heart

193,All You Wanted,"[Verse 1]
Drop back, fall into a kiddy pool
Spread out in the front yard of a white trash lower middle class home
How appropriate that this is where I chose to relax
Though the thought of the act might offend you
I never wanted to offend you

[Chorus]
I was the one to break your fall, but now I'm gone
(Shedding better layers, fucking everything we wanted up)
You were the hits I took
You were the smoke in my lungs
(Please don't get offended
You were everything I wanted, but)
Now you're just another sing-along for lonely nights and drunken drives home
And you say you're fine without me, but you take me everywhere that you go
Oh, you should let me go

[Verse 2]
I hope this song makes your playlist
The ones you make and think I don't notice
That every one has your favorite song you didn't know until I showed it to you
We grew apart
We're not setting off fireworks from my car anymore
Retrace your steps to your backyard and find out exactly where this all fell apart
'Cause I don't want to keep you here any longer
I know it's hard but if you give up you'll feel stronger, I promise

[Chorus]
I was the one to break your fall, but now I'm gone
(Shedding better layers, fucking everything we wanted up)
You were the hits I took
You were the smoke in my lungs
(Please don't get offended
You were everything I wanted, but)
Now you're just another sing-along for lonely nights and drunken drives home
And you say you're fine without me, but you take me everywhere that you go
I hope this song makes your playlist

[Bridge]
So I can give you something sentimental
Something you'll always remember me for
The words that I wrote
And the way that they felt
I just hope they feel better now

[Chorus]
I was the one to break your fall, but now I'm gone
(Shedding better layers, fucking everything we wanted up)
You were the hits I took
You were the smoke in my lungs
(Please don't get offended
You were everything I wanted, but)
Now you're just another sing-along for lonely nights and drunken drives home
And you say you're fine without me, but you take me everywhere that you go

194,Wasting My Time,"I don't want to see you waiting
I've already gone too far away
I still can't keep the day from ending
No more messed up reasons for me to stay

Well this is not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I've wasted my time
You can't stop the feeling, there is no reason
Just make the call and take it all again
Whoa-oh again

Months went by with us pretending
When did our light turn from green to red?
I took a chance and left you standing
Lost the will to do this once again

Well this is not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I've wasted my time
You can't stop the feeling, there is no reason
Just make the call and take it all
I'm wasting my time
I've wasted my time again
Whoa-oh again

I see you waiting
Look so lonely
I see you waiting
I see you waiting

Well this is not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I've wasted my time
You can't stop the feeling, there is no reason
Just make the call and take it all

195,Addictive,"[Verse 1 - Rakim]
You off the planet, wherever you at you stand out
Plus you specialize in freakin your man out
Put it all in one pot lets see if it pan out
Stick ya hand out, I got it all planned out
Layin out the way, I set a date to wed on
Plus you got your head on, you my queen from here on
Lookin like lady Revlon with all red on
She fiending till I'm in her arms, I'm King
Put the silk bedspread on
Rose pedals and scent candle lit
Victoria's Secret set on
Rough sex turnin her on
So ghetto, innocent but scandalous just bling and fur on
Million dollar habit, she said its a fetish she gotta have it
Once she get it, she holla thats it
Keep the waters rapid
The hotter its automatic

Oh shit, she OD'n again I got an addict

[Verse 2: Truth Hurts]
He breaks me down, he builds me up
He fills my cup, I like it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes in late, but it's okay
He do, I do, he knows the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on his team, he keeps me clean
And gives me things, he makes me scream

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
He's so contagious, returns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I've waited for
He keeps me guessing, spontaneous
He's so persuasive and I'm his lady

[Verse 3: Truth Hurts]
Oh! Tonight is waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm taken, ain't no use in fakin
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I've got

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Rakim]
Thinking of a master plan
You know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a gram
Now it's kilos to C-notes and high fashion brands
We ball like we own the world
The only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathing hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you tryin to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up, but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill' and I'mma quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out

199,What's Luv?,"Hi, I'm the Rap Critic! Let's talk about Fat Joe… technically for the first time, since, ""Lean Back"" was by Terror Squad, even though he just happened to be rapping on about 77% of it. Now, I want to correct a little mistake I made in that episode, because I had said that it was Big Pun who was the leader of the Terror Squad and that when he died, the head of the group changed over to Fat Joe, but in actuality, it was Fat Joe that founded Terror Squad, and then Big Pun joined them later. Which is weird to me, because, I mean, Big Pun is, like, Mr:

""Rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children
Like Amityville drill the nerves in your cavity filling""

I mean, he always came off as the guy in charge, and Fat Joe, *sample lyric from Twins* I mean, he's not bad, I don't want you to think that he sucks, but… he's… when your standing next to:

""A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support""

You're gonna look like second in command, whoever you are. And in addition, it was kinda Big Pun who became more popular than him in such a short amount of time, with hits like ""Still Not a Player"" charting around 98, and Fat Joe not really having a big hit until 2002 with this song ""What's Luv"", and guess what? Both of them were ""Thugs Need Love Too"", songs. Although like I've always said, you can talk about anything as long as you make it interesting, and with Pun, he had the asshole rap personality down pat. You see, the man was so brash and upfront with his delivery, it was kind of endearing:

""Bet Ya Man Can't do it like this
He can't work the middle, cause his thang too little""

""I don't wanna be a player no more
(I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot)""

And that's what made him likable: the over-the-topness of his lyricism made him enjoyable to listen to, as well as having outstanding rhyming abilities, and in addition, Pun was just more fun. I mean, for a guy who looked like this… he knew that he had to do something to compensate for his appearance, and so when making a love… okay, it's just a sex song, there's nothing lovey dove about this:

""I rip my prick through ya hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers""

But, when making this kind of song, he always came off as a guy who did not take himself too seriously

""Litte brown hairs everywhere""

However, with Fat Joe… well, like I said, he's not bad, he just came off like he was trying to fit in with the crowd and not stand out at all. I mean, for God's sake, he had Ashanti singing the chorus, who was, at the time, the go to ""Thugs need love"" singer for Ja Rule's songs. In fact…

What's love? (Got to do, got to do with it babe) {Yeah, Yeah, Y'All}
What's love?

Is that Ja Rule on the chorus with Ashanti? Well, he's not in the video, but that's obviously his voice. Jeez, Fat Joe, were you just trying to trick people into thinking this was a Ja Rule song? I mean, he doesn't have a verse anywhere in here, so what other purpose was he here for? Or maybe, his presence was so ubiquitous around this time, the very essence of Ja Rule just started spilling into other ""Thugs need Love too"" songs

*singing*: what's love… *Ja: Got to do… go to do with it, babe*
*look confused* (Just … keep singing) Wha… what's love … *Ja: it should be about us….*

Okay, we've wasted enough time, is this song by itself any good? Well, let's start off by actually looking at that chorus

What's love? (Got to do, got to do with it babe) {Yeah, Yeah, Uh}

Okay, so this is an obvious homage to the Tina Turner Song ""What's Love Got to Do with It""

It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that

[Hook:]
Oh what's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion

And this song is about a woman trying to protect her feelings by devaluing the idea of love as nothing more than a chemical reaction to an arousing stimuli so that she can convince herself that it's meaningless. It's about someone who doesn't want to be hurt again, and it uses the verses to build up to the theme of the chorus. Okay… so what's THIS song about

What's love? (Got to do, got to do with it babe) {Yeah, Yeah, Uh}

So, they just start the song with ""What's Love Got to Do with it""… with what? What's love got to do with what? What are you referring to when you say ""it""? What, was there something in the intro I missed? What did they say there?

""Irv Gotti!""

What's love got to do with Irv Gotti? The point I'm trying to make is, when you have a phrase like, ""What's Love Got to do with it?"", you need to have a lyric that it has something to do with first. I know what you're referring to, but you haven't told me why you're referring to it. It just feels like, ""Hey, you know this song exists, so we're referencing it!"" And that's not even in Rap Music, that's English! A pronoun like ""it"", refers to a noun, something you did not give me! But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe they explain

What's love? It should be about us, it should be about trust babe

Okay, so now we're given a little context! She's saying that love SHOULD be about them being together, and it SHOULD be about trust. Okay, so from that, I can assume that the singer and rapper are in a relationship, and things aren't going so well in that relationship. Well, let's see how the rapper, Fat Joe responds to what she says

Yeah, slow down baby
Let you know from the gate I don't go down lady

*long pause*… well--*cut*

Girl you get me aroused how you look in my eye
But you talk to much man your ruinin' my high

…Well--*cut*

You say you gotta man & your in love

Okay, BACK UP a minute! Let me try to figure this out. So, the chorus is all about how Love is supposed to be about trust and being together. I got that. And then, the first thing you thought to say to jump off from that is...

Yeah, slow down baby
Let you know from the gate I don't go down lady

So, this is kinda the conversation I'm picturing here:

Girl: Hey, babe, I love you, but I just want to make sure that our relationship is based on us trusting eachother
Guy: I don't do oral sex
Girl:… okay, I don't think that directly relates to what I was talking about…
Guy: …you can… ""Trust"" that I'll never do oral sex?
Girl: This isn't gonna work out…

And NEXT, you say

Girl you get me aroused how you look in my eye
But you talk to much man your ruinin' my high

Which is not exactly the most romantic follow-up to telling a girl you won't go down on her

You say you gotta man and you're in love

Wha, wait a minute, wait a minute… YOU'RE not her boyfriend? Well, who the hell are you? Wait, are you the person that she's cheating on her boyfriend with? I guess that gives the chorus better context, because now it's like she's saying ""I'm cheating on my boyfriend purely because I want to have sex with you, so what does love have to do with what we're doing?"" My question is, ""who said it did?"" If you're obviously only having a one night stand with this guy, and you have a freaking boyfriend back home, I'm pretty sure no one's under the assumption that love has anything to do with this, so why did YOU bring it up? That's liking asking ""What do cleaning products have to do with fishing""? Well, nothing, they're not even close to the same category, but now that you brought it up, I think that there must be something there. With this song, if you listen to any of the lyrics, it's obvious that it's not about being in love, it's about sex, but it feels like they threw the word love in there to make people think it's a love song. You see, this is why I hate these ""Thugs need love too"" songs. There's always this air of deception. Like, ""oh we said love a lot in the chorus, but naw, I'm not REALLY trying to get in a relationship"". Dude, just SAY that you want a one night stand. I guarantee you that your groupies are gonna be down for it. You don't need to lie to them

You say you gotta man and you're in love
But what's love gotta do with a little menage

Nothing. Love has nothing inherently to do with a three way. However, if you wanted to, you could go into how one of you may be confusing love for sex, or that someone is conflicted about how they feel about the other, but you never do that. Both of you seem pretty comfortable with what's going on. There's no ambiguity about what's happening here. There shouldn't be this many questions floating around

Me & you
Could just slide for a few
& she could come too
That's love!

That's love? But wait, I thought it was clear that there was no love involved with in this situation! Why does that change now that this third girl is involved. What, do you love her? I don't… ah, whatever...

Mommy, I know you got issues
You gotta man
But you need to understand
That you got something with you

Hold on, is he telling her to go back to her boyfriend? Because it sounds like he's saying, ""Hey girl, you've got a man, but you need to understand that you've got something there. You've got love, and a caring relationship, even though it's not perfect. Well, that'd be interesting… judging from the rest of the song, though, that's probably not what he means, but that last line is so vague, I have no idea what he's talking about. She's got something with her? What, a meatball sub that she didn't finish, i mean,  he is FAT Joe, so, okay, that can't be it, maybe he's just using a vague phrase to talk about how hot she is?

Ass is fat, frame is little

Thought so

Tattoo in your chest with his name in the middle

…Why would you bring that up? Do you, like, get a kick out of knowing the name of the person she's cheating on?

I'm not a hater I just crush a lot

Oh okay, he's not being malicious, like, he doesn't hate the guy who this girl is cheating on, he just really likes sex. Although, I think it's funny that he uses the edited version of the phrase from the Big Pun song ""Still Not a Playa"", because in both cases, I'm pretty sure the edit was intended to mean that he gets easily smitten with a lot of chicks, and you know, develops a crush on them. However, when I first heard the edited version, well, I'll just say that the verb ""crushing"" doesn't exactly lend itself to a positive image when describing the sexual exploits of overweight men. I hope the women were always on top, is what I'm trying to say

Not my fault cause they love the kid
Maybe the chain or the whip
I don't know what it is

You. you don't know what it is? You just, can't figure out why women would possibly be attracted to a popular rapper who brags about popping bottles and driving fancy cars, and your deductive reasoning led you to believe these women were purely attracted to your necklace? Well, gee, Fat Joe, I hate to burst your bubble, but these girls were only attracted to your winning personality. Women just can't get enough of the fact that you tell them they talk too much, and they swoon and sigh over your complete refusal to reciprocate oral sex

You came here with the heart to cheat
So you need to sing the song with me

Yep, you already made the choice to ruin the trust in your relationship. Don't be shy now just because he made a song about it

When I look in your eyes there's no stoppin' me
I want the Don Joey Crack on top of me

She wants that Don Joey Crack on top of her? Like, Fat Joe's butt? I… I didn't know you were into that, Ashanti. No wait, I'm sorry, apparently, one of Fat Joe's aliases is Joey Crack, which I'm guessing was his drug dealing name. Wait, no, No, that doesn't make any sense, since Drug dealers usually use code names that DON'T directly allude to drugs. No respectable drug kingpin would name himself, ""Mikey the illegal drug dealer"". It kinda ruins the point of having a code name. So, no, I'm not convinced: this line is totally about Fat Joe sitting on Ashanti

Don't want your stacks (Yeah)
Just break my back

You know, I don't think her light, airy singing voice is matching the topic she's talking about. Like, she's singing as if she's talking about something innocent, like ""I don't want your cash, just hold my hand!"" when she's actually singing something along the lines of, ""I don't want any money, just rupture my spinal cord"". But hey, maybe she's into that sort of thing. Maybe she just really likes having her body squashed by obese men. I mean, really, listen to this again, and imagine a fat guy across the room about to bellyflop Ashanti

""Come on… and put it oooon me…. on me…""
*imitating Ashanti's portly lover*: ""I'mma put it on ya, girl!""

Okay, that's enough of that. Overall, I'd give this song a 2.5 out of 5. The beat's fun, and admittedly, the chorus is enjoyable enough to sing along to, but it all falls apart as soon as you start to look into the construction of the lyrics. Fat Joe, while not terrible, seems to just lack the energy and personality it takes to make this type of song forgivable, so I'm just left with yet another bland character who has sex with someone else's girlfriend, and when you don't do or say anything to liven it up, fellas, it gets kinda old. Well, I'm the Rap Critic, I analyze the lyrics, because no one else does *comes towards the camera*",Rap Critic,Fat Joe Featuring Ashanti,2002,"[46, 43, 31, 27, 24, 19, 15, 15, 11, 7, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, 23, 36, 68]",28

A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew

[Chorus]
There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
Till you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

[Verse 2]
Till you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet

Told a little white lie
No, my back don't really hurt

Be who I wanna be
I got no one to answer to
Soon as I turn the key

207,Down A** Chick,"Abstract

This essay examines spaces within hip-hop culture where hip-hop feminist thought and activism might make significant interventions. It offers an exploratory examination of hip-hop feminism in an effort to map out an agenda for the twenty-first century. The essay is not concerned with hard-and-fast answers to the combination of feminism and hip-hop but rather with what hip-hop feminism might add to current conversations surrounding race, class, gender, and sexuality. By examining the conscious/commercial rap dichotomy, the discussions surrounding video models, lyrics by rapper Jean Grae, and the work of contemporary women authors, this essay opens the door for further dialogue about women, rap, and hip-hop feminism
I know I’m on the right path
To who I’m gonna be at last
So don’t rush me
I know I’m wrong and right
At the same time both, I’m the dark and light
And they say life means everything to live
At the same time I got everything to give
So don’t rush me Don’t rush me

    -Jean Grae, “Don’t Rush Me”

Trying to capture the voice of all that is young black female was impossible. My goal, instead, was to tell my truth as best I could from my vantage point on the spectrum. And then get you to talk about it. This book by its lonesome won’t give you the truth. Truth is what happens when your cumulative voices fill in the breaks, provide the remixes, and rework the chorus

    -Joan Morgan, When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost: A Hip-Hop Feminist Breaks it Down
[79]
The epigraphs from rapper Jean Grae and hip-hop feminist Joan Morgan hint at the varieties and contradictions embedded in hip-hop feminism.1 The third-wave feminist leanings, along with black feminist and womanist agendas, make for a study in shifts and unevenness. The third wave represents the generation of feminists that hip-hop feminism is a part of. This generation of feminists is best represented theoretically in anthologies such as Listen Up: Voices from the Next Feminist Generation (Findlen 1995), To Be Real: Telling the Truth and Changing the Face of Feminism (Walker 1995), The Fire This Time: Young Activists and the New Feminism (Labaton and Martin 2004), Colonize This! Young Women of Color on Today’s Feminism (Hernandez and Rehman 2002), and Catching a Wave: Reclaiming Feminism for the 21st Century (Dicker and Piepmeier 2003). The black feminist and womanist agendas are agendas that hip-hop feminists, the majority of whom are black women, share with their foremothers who saw their struggles with gender oppression as intimately connected to their struggles with race and class oppressions. They were women whose agendas kept firmly in sight the survival of the entire people. A hip-hop state of mind—one that freely samples, mixes, and remixes—influences the theoretical underpinnings of hip-hop feminism as well as the activism of hip-hop feminists. This essay highlights some of the ways hip-hop feminist agendas have taken shape while always keeping in mind, as the epigraphs from Jean Grae and Joan Morgan show, there won’t be just one truth but multiple ones. In fact, sometimes the contradictions that make for the “wrong and right . . . dark and light” of it will help feminists to better do what Joan Morgan suggests feminism needs to do—be “brave enough to fuck with the grays” (1999, 59). This essay is an exploratory essay that seeks to examine the various articulations of hip-hop feminist expressions as a way to provide a starting point and possible template for a hip-hop feminist agenda

Women have been representing in hip-hop culture ever since the mid 1970s, when the culture got its start in the South Bronx, and they represent still. They have been and still are B-girls, women breakers, graffiti artists, deejays, and emcees. Today, we can add to the mix women writing and thinking about the culture who call themselves hip-hop feminists. I take the stance that hip-hop is a cultural phenomenon that expands beyond rap music. Hip-hop has been defined by many as a way of life that encompasses everything from way of dress to manner of speech. Hip-hop as a culture originally included graffiti writing, deejaying, break dancing, rap music, and the oft-forgotten fifth element, knowledge. [80] It has recently expanded to include genres such as film, spoken word, autobiographies, literature, journalism, and activism. It has also expanded enough to include its own brand of feminism. The writing of third-wave black feminist writers such as Ayana Byrd, Denise Cooper, Eisa Davis, Eisa Nefertari Ulen, Shani Jamilla, dream hampton, Joan Morgan, Tara Roberts, Kristal Brent-Zook, and Angela Ards is expanding black feminist theory and black women’s intellectual traditions in fascinating ways. What started out as a few young black feminist women who loved hip-hop and who tried to mesh that love with their feminist and womanist consciousness is now a rich body of articles, essays, poetry, and creative nonfiction. But what exactly is a hip-hop feminist? And what does hip-hop feminism do? I maintain that although we now have a relatively clear idea of what constitutes a hip-hop feminist, we are less certain about what a hip-hop feminist agenda should be

Hip-hop feminists are women and men who step up and speak out against gender exploitation in hip-hop. From the Feminism and Hip-Hop Conference at the University of Chicago in 2005 to the B-Girl Be conferences in Minneapolis and countless symposiums and smaller conferences on the status of women in hip-hop to the list serves and Yahoo groups devoted to women, feminism, and hip-hop, there appears to be a surge in women and men thinking and talking about gender issues in hip-hop and combining that talk with action. From the publication of several key essays and Joan Morgan’s pivotal book When Chickenheads Come Home To Roost in the 1990s to the Spelman women who wanted to initiate a dialogue with Nelly to Essence Magazine’s “Take Back the Music” campaign, we can begin to see the ways this movement’s knowledge-building and consciousness-raising have taken shape. It might be too soon to talk about the impact that the movement has had, but it is not too soon to think about some of the key concerns and agendas that the movement seems to be taking up. I aim to flesh some of this out by building on some of the work that I did in my book Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture and the Public Sphere (2004) and by examining a few areas where women have used hip-hop to claim a public voice. I want to look at the spaces where hip-hop feminism can make interventions as starting points for a possible feminist agenda in hip-hop. However, they will not all be feminist spaces or even have outright feminists messages. Instead, they are spaces where hip-hop feminists, activists, and thinkers can possibly evoke change

Krista Ratcliffe (2006) writes about giving her students a feminist literacy through which to read society. Elaine Richardson carefully details the ways in which the young women who listen to and love hip-hop process the images and have thoughtful and critical conversations about the culture and the music when she examines female hip-hop literacies in her book Hiphop Literacies (2006). [81] And it has me thinking seriously about what a hip-hop feminist literacy would allow us to do and why we need one. Thinking of recent controversies such as Don Imus calling the Rutgers women’s basketball team “nappy-headed hoes” and Michael Richards’s meltdown in which he boldly and blatantly brandished the n-word at black men he thought were hecklers and the quick way just about everyone quickly made a move to blame hip-hop has me seriously considering what a worldwide hip-hop feminist literacy could give us in these situations. Would we continue to have conversations that blame rappers for white racist men doing what white racist men do all day every day? Or would we instead be able to really look at the nuances of the situation and see, for example, that while there was some racism underlying Imus’s statement, the sexism and underlying homophobia were palpable. And like racism, the sexism and homophobia predates hiphop in Imus’s politics and certainly in this country that deals with both on a regular. But even as we had these conversations and teased out these issues with our hip-hop feminist lens, we would still be able to critique hip-hop for its sexism and homophobia as well. We just wouldn’t blame hip-hop when people old enough to know better show their true colors, colors they have been showing all along. The fact is that young women who listen to rap music and participate in hip-hop culture already have critiques of sexism and misogyny. They have things to say about the culture and the world around them if we are prepared to listen. This essay is therefore an attempt at understanding what they might offer the larger society the next time we have such public pedagogical moments as those offered by Imus and Richards

So, Shorty’s a Feminist?

Several black and third-wave feminists have started to approach the tenuous relationship between rap music/hip-hop culture and feminism in their writing. They offer a variety of different feminist perspectives on rap, rappers, and women. Some condemn the sexism in rap and encourage others to do the same. Others offer complicated analyses that critique the larger societal issues that contribute to rap’s sexism, production, and consumption. Some offer third-wave feminist critiques that question how one can be a child of the hip-hop generation, love the music, and still critique and actively speak out against the sexism. They all offer examples of how feminists have begun to deal with, think about, and write about rap music and hip-hop culture

Most hip-hop feminists believe that some of the needs of the hip-hop generation require new strategies and different voices. They have a strong [82] relationship to the “self,” and they connect their personal narratives with theoretical underpinnings and critique. They hold themselves and their peers responsible for effecting change in the present and future by encouraging people to recognize and combat their own complicity. In terms of rap music and hip-hop culture, they want to find ways to move beyond counting the amount of times a particular rapper says the word “bitch” or “ho” to a focus on what they consider to be larger issues and concerns. For example, they also want to begin to complicate understandings of women’s complicity in the objectification of women especially as it pertains to video-hoes. And as Joan Morgan reminds us, “the focus of Black feminists has got to change. We can’t afford to keep expending energy on banal discussion of sexism in rap when sexism is only part of a huge set of problems” (1999, 76). They are concerned with and spend a lot of time writing about black women’s relationships with black men. They want to encourage a dialogue between black men and women, men rappers and women

A hip-hop feminist is more than just someone who likes to listen to rap music and feels conflicted about it. A hip-hop feminist is someone who is immersed in hip-hop culture and experiences hip-hop as a way of life. Hip-hop as a culture, in turn, influences his or her worldview or approach to life. In fact, one of the reasons why Elaine Richardson, Aisha Durham, Rachel Raimist, and I decided to edit Home Girls Make Some Noise: A Hip-Hop Feminism Anthology (2007) was because we wanted to think about hip-hop feminism beyond the conflicted, “I’m a feminist and I love hip-hop, woe-is-me” standpoint. We wanted to create a space to talk across disciplines through activism, the arts, and academia to better understand the very important and vital work going on in this area. Hip-hop feminists are working as community activists. They are working for reproductive justice. And they are trying to think about ways to combat the growing prison-industrial complex in relation to women of color and the equally astounding HIV/AIDS rates. And they are also still very much concerned with representations of women of color in rap music videos and the harm that these images can do. So, I want to move now to one area that hip-hop feminism continues to grapple with: the video vixen

Shorty Wants to be a Star: Video Vixens Representing Women of Color?

In her groundbreaking book, Prophets of the Hood, Imani Perry notes the following about the recent trends in hip-hop music videos: “It seemed to happen suddenly. Every time one turned on BET (Black Entertainment [83] Television) or MTV, one encountered a disturbing music video: Black men rapped surrounded by dozens of black and Latina women dressed in bathing suits, or scantily clad in some other fashion. Video after video proved the same, each one more objectifying than the former. Some took place in strip clubs, some at the pool, at the beach, or in hotel rooms, but the recurrent theme was dozens of half-naked women” (2004, 175). With the release of Karrine Steffans’s tell-all memoir, Confessions of a Video Vixen (2005), the topic of women, music videos, and objectification is once again on everyone’s minds. But even more so, the questions surrounding objectification have become complicated in important ways. No longer can we make claims about what is happening to the women in the videos without complicating the discussion by adding their voices. Although Steffans says that she wrote the book as a cautionary tale for little girls who want to grow up and be video girls, the book reads more like a how-to with just enough name-dropping and gossip to fill inquiring minds. In fact, with the release of It’s No Secret by Carmen Bryan, rapper Nas’s ex-girlfriend and the mother of his child, it seems as if some marketing person in the publishing industry figured out a way to capitalize on mixing the current Zane-inspired erotica fervor with hip-hop glitterati in order to cater to a gossip-obsessed culture and recent trends in reality programming. These kinds of books appeal to a variety of people because of the way they play into the genres listed above. However, what does come across clearly as one reads the Steffans’s memoir and Bryan’s tell-all are the ways in which some women have chosen to buy into the sexism and misogyny that limits the roles that women can play in hip-hop culture

The issues of representation and objectification in hip-hop offer many variables that all must be considered if we are going to have a meaningful conversation about the topic. The ways in which the men artists and male and female video directors objectify the women in their lyrics and videos is one aspect. The ways in which the women video models and hip-hop artists choose to objectify themselves in a quest to make money and earn a living is another. And the way these images straddle the very thin line between validation of black women bodies and objectification is yet another aspect. The truth of the matter is that we are now in a(n) historical moment where the bodies of women of color flood popular culture in ways that they never have before. As hip-hop culture expands and dominates mainstream popular culture, the hip-hop video becomes more than just a music video. The impact of these videos on women of color is vast. Hip-hop music videos are spreading representations of U.S. women of color around the globe. [84]

I have written elsewhere that hip-hop culture did not spring up full grown on its own and that it builds on other legacies that exist in the culture and the community that we are not always willing to own (see Pough 2001). Others have noted that hip-hop does not exist in a social-cultural vacuum, that as a part of the larger culture it takes on elements of the larger culture as well (see Potter 1995; Rose 1994). So when we look at the hip-hop centerfolds that exist in Source Magazine and XXL, with their monthly “Dime Piece” and “Eye Candy” sections, we cannot discuss them in isolation and certainly not without at least mentioning the long-running Jet Magazine “Beauty of the Week.” And when we talk about the ways in which hip-hop videos are similar to pornography, we cannot have the conversation without looking at the ways in which pornography has infiltrated the larger culture as well. Can you say “girls gone wild”?

None of this is meant to take away from the damage that these pornographic images of women of color in hip-hop do. What I do want to look at, however, are the ways in which these tropes impact our thoughts about women of color and how they in turn impact the lives of young women. The words of women like Zulaika Jumaralli (2005) who claim “Music Videos Broke My Spirit” come to mind as I think about the power of these videos and the impact that they have. I think of women like the black women students at Duke, who, outraged by the recent alleged gang rape of a black woman by white members of the university lacrosse team, loudly proclaim, that they are “not your video ho.” In an article written by Fiona Morgan (2006), these students share stories of being expected to be sexually available and inappropriately propositioned by white men on campus just because of their race. One student says, “As a black female, you go to a party. You’re expected to dance. You’re expected to be sexually provocative. You are expected to want to be touched, to be grabbed, to be fondled.” Another student adds, “As if they’re reenacting a rap video or something. As if we’re their video ho, basically. We can’t just be regular students here. We can’t just go to a party and enjoy ourselves” (F. Morgan 2006). As much as we try to move away from allowing negative images to impact our lives, there are real implications that we need to contend with. Add to this the multiple stories of black women who have traveled to other parts of the world only to be approached as if they are a video vixen by the men in the countries they are visiting, and we can see how far these attitudes about women of color extend

I also think about the hip-hop feminist warriors who are bringing wreck in the public sphere by talking back—women like the Spelman women, who wanted to initiate a dialogue with Nelly after viewing his derogatory video [85] “Tip Drill,” only to have that attempt at dialogue stilted and to receive criticism themselves for being elitist college women looking down their noses at the women who are making an honest living in the video and the poor artist who only wants to share his art with the world. While I offer the statements above in a tongue-in-cheek manner, several interviews in which Nelly spoke about his “ordeal” painted the Spelman women in this way. I am also informed by hip-hop feminist writers like Karen R. Good, who, fed-up with the whole images, representation, and objectification debates, offers her own treatise:
But as of late, many of hip-hop’s children have been playing the cheapest trick: depending on undulating female, colored bodies to entice weak minds and compensate for weak rhymes. Or our bodies are used for verbal target practice. I am way past anger. Shock went the way of “Bitches Ain’t Shit.” Don’t feel like being sad. I just wonder about the worth of a black girl. You know, like the difference between what happens when little white girls go missing and little black girls go missing. Or get raped. Pissed on. That type of shit. . . . That said, not one more lecture. I put my hands up. Man, if you want to swipe a credit card down the crack of a woman’s behind, or Miss, if you want to let yo ass be the machine, fine. To each his own. The culprit is not hip-hop, which is undergoing a beautiful evolution, by the way (hear Mos Def’s “The Rape Over”), it’s our reliance on the baser nature as opposed to the higher mind. Hip-hop is the thinker’s form. (2005, 29–30)As I think about the video vixen and her relationship to a hip-hop feminist agenda, I do so keeping the fervor and the sentiment of these very different responses to the images in mind. As the black women students at Duke remind us, the images have the power to hurt. As the negative backlash to the Spelman women shows us, when we speak out or try to initiate a dialogue, we open ourselves up for criticism. And as Karen Good reminds us, the images are not the sum and total of hip-hop and certainly not what is representative of the culture, which is in constant evolution. But they do exist and we do need to interrogate them. And when we do, we need to add to the mix the voices, stories, and reasons these women give for participating in the objectification. Only then will we get a more nuanced and complicated discussion of the video vixen

By adding their voices, we indeed get a discussion that highlights the gray areas that Joan Morgan writes about. These women see the videos as their entry into the world of stardom. They are aspiring actresses, models, singers, and even rappers themselves. They gladly pose in the magazines and preen in the videos, and the best and brightest of them are paid very well [86] to do so. Some even make up to $3,000 a day.2 These are not necessarily the poor, victimized women of old. Some of them have a critique of the business, and they recognize their role in a society in which sex sells. Video girl Tawny, interviewed by Jeanne Amber for Essence Magazine, notes: “If video girls are being exploited, then every female artist who is out there being sexy should be blamed too. To me, it’s all bull——” (Amber 2005, 165). Former video model, BET host, and entrepreneur Melyssa Ford notes of her own career and decisions:
I’m the highest-paid video girl to date. I’ve endured all the snide comments and ignorant remarks from people who presume to know me because I’m on their television screens and in the pages of their magazines. But I’m not the promiscuous twit I’m often mistaken for. I am a business-woman who has used videos to launch a multimedia career. My product is me. Besides being the lead girl in hip-hop and R&B videos, I am a sex columnist for a men’s magazine. I star in my own DVD. I’ve hosted television shows, and I’ve produced my own calendar, which I sell on the internet. My job is to sell fantasy and perfection. When the cameras go on, I detach myself and play the sexy vixen who will turn a nigga out. (quoted in Byrd and Solomon 2005, 219–20)The fact is, these women are making decisions—decisions informed by a variety of variables—to be in these videos, to pose for these magazines. While I do not pretend that their decision-making takes away from the systems of oppression surrounding them that make not making the decision to objectify themselves difficult, I do not want to ignore the agency, real or imagined, that these women have. How does their agency complicate our discussions of objectification? I don’t pretend to have the answer to this, and I don’t even want to suggest that there is one cut-and-dry answer. But I do know that as feminists, we can no longer have these conversations without including their voices and their stories. And when we add their voices and stories to the mix, they bring with them those dark and light, wrong and right mixtures that Jean Grae raps about and the subtle shades of gray that Joan Morgan writes about

The video vixen’s agency is important, and the work of visual artist Ayanah Moor adds layers to this conversation by thinking about the ways these women may be exhibiting agency even as they participate in the demeaning videos. Her collection of video shots, “STILL,” is one example of the way Moor uses her art to complicate the discussion. The text that goes along with the montage of video stills represented in the collection states: [87]
STILL Images of women surrounding male rap stars in music videos is as common as the jewel encrusted subject matter of today’s rap lyrics. Females are seen in packs hovering around male rap stars, playing the part of enthusiastic cheerleader or die-hard groupie. Rap music videos sell not only hiphop culture, but also the very image of its women. They serve as eye candy designed to satisfy an assumed male video audience, affirming critiques of the culture as hyper masculine and misogynist. STILL is a series of photographs from contemporary rap music videos. These artworks invite a second look at the hip-hop video vixen, displaying an interest in moments unintended by music video narratives. Some stills reveal agency rather than victimization, while others provide reminders of the narrow representations of women in hip-hop. (Moor 2006)Moor’s “STILL,” the hip-hop feminist discussions surrounding video models, and the video models voices and stories show, I hope, what a rich space the issues of video images and representation can be if we think about issues of agency in more complicated ways. Combining these might allow us to better interrogate the following questions. For example, what does it mean that hip-hop has the capability to make a woman a pseudosuperstar, sought after by magazines and video directors based on solely on how she looks? And how does this further complicate our understandings of how black women respond to things like the ideal beauty image? Does the influx of other kinds of beauty—meaning black and women of color—into the mainstream disrupt the norm? Does it simply add yet another impossible ideal for women to yearn for that now makes women of color, particularly black women, vulnerable in ways that they haven’t been in the past? All of these questions are complicated and warrant far more space than this cursory look at possible hip-hop feminist agendas allows. But they are spaces in which hip-hop feminism can make meaningful interventions. I will now move to another space in which there are possibilities for a hip-hop feminist agenda by examining female emcee Jean Grae

Shorty Got Love for the Game: Jean Grae,Hip-Hop, Feminism, and change (Or ... Simply... I wish she were a feminist...)

What would happen if we had feminist emcees moving millions toward a critique of gender that motivated them toward change? Why haven’t we had any women emcees with this kind of feminist agenda? What would happen if we could harness the power that rap music has to make people dance and make them work toward change in women’s lives? When studying [88] feminism in relation to hip-hop, one thing becomes abundantly clear: most women emcees are not checking for the F word. They won’t claim it. Won’t label themselves with it. Will not touch it. This is not to say that there are no feminist women rappers. However, the fact remains that as much as we champion and claim certain women rappers for their lyrics, their outreach activities, their “positive” messages, or their “prowoman” messages, very few women rappers will go on record saying that they are feminist

Taking a page from black feminist theorist Patricia Hill Collins, who in her essay “What’s in a Name? Womanism, Black Feminism, and Beyond” (1999) ultimately comes to the conclusion that quibbling over what we call ourselves is less important than the work we do to evoke change, I posit that while we cannot in good conscience place the label of “feminist”—hip-hop, thirdwave, black feminist, or womanist—on most contemporary women rappers, we can—as feminist scholars and activists—use the music they produce and the issues they raise to begin to enact change. In this regard, rising hip-hop artist Jean Grae becomes an interesting case study for hip-hop feminism even if she denounces feminism for herself: “I’m not a feminist by any means, I just want people to enjoy the music” (Thomas 2004). In much of her music to date—her two CDs, Attack of the Attacking Things: The Dirty Mixes and This Week, as well as her EP, The Bootleg of the Bootleg—we can easily see the concerns of hip-hop feminists put to music

Grae’s two albums and EP have garnered critical acclaim, and just about every review I have read noted her stellar lyrics and vocal delivery but bemoaned the production and the lack of killer beats. What comes across in most interviews is the fact that she is going to make music and have a career on her own terms. We won’t see her taking off her clothes to sell records. But she is quick to stop interviewers who want to label her the Anti–Lil’ Kim, Anti–Foxy Brown, or Anti-Trina. She does not have a problem with her fellow women rappers. She has a problem with an industry that won’t allow a fullness of black womanhood to be represented. She notes: “You know what, that’s not me. That’s not how I live. And that’s not how I do. But there are females that do. I think it’s messed up that there is not an opportunity for someone who is not doing that to have an equal chance. And that is the problem. It’s like there has to be some choice . . . have some other shit. Balance it all out. Apparently for some odd reason, that is not allowed” (Bloom 2004). She knows what she is willing to do and she knows what she has to offer: “I want to break the formula, and make history for myself. I want people to know I’m a skilled writer and lyricist that isn’t afraid to be honest. I’m stubborn. I refuse to change myself [89] for a machine” (Dyer 2004). I have to admit, when it comes to hip-hop, I am all about the lyrics. The beat is important, yes—couldn’t be a true hip-hop head and not acknowledge that. But the beat is not going to make me buy the record. In fact, I’m much more excited when the beat takes me back to the essence, the simple boom bap. So, the reviews that bemoaned the lack of cutting-edge production and beats on Jean Grae’s CDs didn’t faze me. Her lyrics blew me away. Her lyrics, style, and delivery are like one part Jigga, two parts Nas, a healthy dose of gender consciousness, race consciousness, and, lo and behold, a pinch of a global awareness for good measure

On her first album, Attack of the Attacking Things, Jean Grae critiques the sexism in hip-hop. In the song “Knock” she raps, “Ask me bastard if I’m signed / I rhyme sick / but niggas is quick to turn they back on spitters with clits / Hit em with this, and ridiculous phrase flow that exit my lips / Hey yo, I mean my face, though / they still want chicks with tits and ass out / my respect is worth more than your advance cash-out.” In the song “What Would I Do?” she raps: “I’m Jean Grae, honorable team player for years / Emceeing on the low, in videos devoid of the hoes / For sho’ it’s crunch time / I’m the one they sent to piss your label off / they won’t fuck with me unless I’m parading and taking it off.” She is very conscious of the sexism in the music industry and the exploitation of women in particular. And her lyrics and her interviews show that she is raging against that machine

Perhaps what is most worthy of mention is the way that the song “What Would I Do?” aims to inspire change. The chorus asks: “What, what, what would I do? / If like my people said, I left it to you. / Tell me what, what, what would I do. / If I didn’t try a verse, if I didn’t rhyme. / Tell me what, what, what would I do. / If I just hated and did nothing to change it” The chorus makes the listeners question themselves as well. For all of us complaining about the status of hip-hop, what are we doing to change it? Listening to Attack of the Attacking Things is almost like reading Joan Morgan’s When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost. Although the outright feminist agenda is missing from Jean Grae’s album, the themes that come out in Morgan’s book about the need for change and the vulnerability of wanting to be loved are all there

Perhaps the most poignant representation of a hip-hop feminist state of mind and potential agenda comes across in the song “P.S.” from Grae’s latest CD, This Week. The song is a series of e-mails, which are basically apologies to people she has wronged in the past, a friend she betrayed, a lover she [90] cheated on, and herself. The song calls to mind the hip-hop feminist need to question our complicity in our oppression. She questions it and owns it. In the last verse she raps:
Dear Jean
I see you’re doing big things
Congratulations, hey I even saw that big ring
Who would of thunk it huh? LOL
You even seem content
I notice that you’re more focused
Drinking less as well
Anyways it’s been too many months having henny days
I think it’s plenty brave, plus you get your pennies saved up
And say what?!? Second album?
Whatever happened to the thought of ending rapping?
Still living in Manhattan?
Sidetracking note, just on the low
All apologies, I used to hate your fucking guts
Please pardon me, tried to kill you more than once
I’ve acted horribly, and all my pessimism towards your life
Still bothers me
But you’re a big girl now
You’ve fought and made it through
Best of luck homie
And everything I say is true
XOXO Space Smiley Face dot dot dot
Comma Much Love, youThe fact that the speaker in this rap is writing this particular e-mail to her “self” is telling; it brings to mind many questions about how young black women internalize the negative influences bombarding them. Hip-hop feminist writings have dealt with some of these issues. What has been criticized as a self-absorption and an excessive focus on the individual in most hiphop feminist writings is really a genuine concern and a search for meaning, particularly what it means to be a young woman in often dangerous urban environments; what it means to be a woman who participates in and loves a culture that doesn’t always love you; and how you deal with it when some of the hatred aimed at you becomes internalized and affects how you treat others and how you feel about yourself. Jean Grae’s “P.S.” is all of those hip-hop feminist questions and issues put to music. And in a world where young black women grapple with so many images that objectify and sexualize them, such artistry is needed. I move now to a discussion of one of the most [91] problematic images that young women who listen to contemporary hip-hop face: the ride-or-die chick

Shorty Wanna Ride? Ride or Die Chicks and Real Black Girls
But got a women that ain’t afraid
To tuck the toast in the escalade
Pop on niggas that showin me shade
But only for the Rule ’cause that’s my baby
Got me a down ass bitch with red hair, that don’t care
Blazed by the shots and flares
Girl c’mon, follow me, and bust back at police
Conceal ya heat
-- Ja Rule, “Down Ass Bitch”Shorty, you ridin’ with me?
Stic tell ’em bought them RBGs
I like ’em real trill
Gold in the grill
Cold as Pam Grier swoll in the rear
Hard, smart, strong in the heart
Sexy thong when we alone in the dark
Dark skin, red bone, slim in the waist
Them legs so long
Queen earth, jean skirt, head wrapped up
Pimping them converse
And she down for the dirt
For better or for worse
Got my gun in her purse
In case a nigga get searched
She got a mind like Assata
A body like Trina
A heart like my momma
Nigga tell me have you seen her?
-- Dead Prez, “Real Black Girl (Revolutionary Love)”Finding a way to combine feminism and hip-hop in politically meaningful ways is one of the premier goals of hip-hop feminism. This is not easy work. The negative lyrics of most contemporary hip-hop are enough to make even the most die-hard hip-hop feminist contemplate giving up the music and the culture. Articles by dream hampton (2001) and Eisa Nefertari Ulen and Tara Roberts (2000) both speak volumes about the frustration of being a hip-hop head who is also a feminist. [92]

The fastest-growing prison population statistically in this country is black women. They are going to jail largely because of their relationships with men who are involved with criminal activities. They are going to jail for things like smuggling drugs; they are women like Kemba Smith, who simply fell in love with the wrong man and was too afraid to leave. As Smith recounts, “At age 24, without so much as a parking ticket on my record, I was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison—without parole. Technically, I was convicted of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine, but I contend that I went to jail for dating a drug dealer.” She was finally pardoned as a last minute act of President Clinton, but she still feels that justice was not served. She notes, “You’d think I’d have been doing cartwheels when I was released. Truthfully, my feelings were in conflict. It was tough to leave behind the incredible women I met in prison—especially since many of them were victims of the same laws that put me away” (Booth 2001, 86). The incarceration rate for black women continues to grow because of the messages young women are getting from the videos. Messages from contemporary rap lyrics about being a “down ass chick” are everywhere, and they are not just coming from men. Women rappers also rap about the illegal things they would do for their men

In my book (Pough 2004), I critiqued the image of the ride-or-die chick as it is represented in hip-hop, the girl willing to do whatever she can for her man, a girl that the lyrics of Ja Rule’s “Down Ass Chick” call to mind. I urged black feminists in particular to look at these representations as a threat to young black womanhood and to find ways to have conversations with young women and reach out to them before we lose an entire generation. The situation was and still is that dire for me. However, I’d like to complicate things just a little by thinking about what I see as another version, albeit a revolutionary version, of the down ass chick. The recent revolutionary but gangsta messages from rap group Dead Prez have also included some interesting messages for what they call Real Black Girls—girls who are “down for the dirt, / for better or for worse, / got my gun in a purse / in case a nigga get searched.”

Given the hip-hop feminist fondness for all things ’70s and revolutionary, it is easy to see how a RBG (Real Black Girl/Revolutionary but Gangsta) image is more appealing than a Down Ass Chick. The reggae beat of the song and the reggae chant of the first stanza calls to mind those Black Panther sisters we see in all the footage of that time but never hear about. Or the revolutionary sisters who are still in prison as political prisoners for their acts against the establishment but whose names we have yet to learn, let alone start a Free (fill in the blank) Movement for. [93]

Now, I’m not going to argue that down ass chicks and real black girls are problematic for the same reasons. That’s not the point of the comparison. The point of the comparison is to look at the ways in which a mentality of being down for whatever—even when that whatever is revolution—can add to the growing black women prison rate. The point is also to complicate our thinking about hip-hop in ways that stop us from creating dichotomies that place rappers like Ja Rule in one category labeled commercial, negative, and therefore bad, and rappers like Dead Prez and others in another pile labeled conscious, underground, revolutionary, and therefore good. The point isn’t to single out Dead Prez, because they do build on a legacy of the Black Power Movement that had its own gender issues to work out. Even though one would hope that in the twenty-first century conscious rappers would not be replicating those dated and retrograde ideas in such problematic ways. And even though I have no problem with the concept of doing what we have to do for the revolution, per se, I have to ask, if we are talking about a revolution, then what is my role in it, brother? Is a woman’s role in the revolution still pussy power and prone and now I have to conceal your weapon to boot? All of that aside, my point in using Dead Prez’s “Real Black Girl’s (Revolutionary Love)” as an example is simply to say that if we are pushing hip-hop feminism forward as a movement concerned with creating change in the culture and eventually change in the world, we cannot be one-sided with our critiques. Everyone gets called out if they need to be called out. Thinking about “Real Black Girls” as a derivative of the “Down Ass Chick” is one area that we could exam that would allow us to break apart some of the false dichotomies between conscious and commercial hip-hop

In her novel Picture Me Rollin’ (2005), Black Artemis tells the tale of a young woman who has been released from jail on a mandatory gun possession charge. The protagonist, Esperanza, was dating a street entrepreneur who dabbled in armed robbery when she got caught in the getaway vehicle with a gun that he gave her. She was the only one out of the crew to serve time, mainly as a lesson because she refused to testify—to snitch—against the guys. When the novel opens, Esperanza is being released from jail, and throughout the novel she grapples with several things. The first is “Thug Life,” an obsession with rapper 2Pac Shakur that is so delusional she thinks that the rapper is still alive and chilling in Cuba with Assata Shakur. The second is her newfound knowledge of women of color feminism, thanks to her older sister’s community college course books. And the third is her old life as a drug dealer and generic ride-or-die chick for her drug dealer boyfriend Jesus. Esperanza [94] tries throughout the novel to make a better life for herself, and Black Artemis does an excellent job of showing another side—a female side—of growing up in the urban environments and landscapes made famous by hip-hop

The character Esperanza offers some insight that we all need to consider as we grapple with and complicate the down ass chick. In the prologue to the novel, Esperanza is getting ready to be released from prison and is having a talk with fellow prisoner and roommate Isoke, a political prisoner jailed for her activity with the Black Liberation movement. Isoke is trying to get Esperanza to move beyond an embrace of 2Pac’s “Thug Life” in order to join the larger struggle. Isoke also works in the prison library, so she has given Esperanza a lot of things to read. At this point, however, if it isn’t related to 2Pac, Esperanza is not really interested in reading it. When Isoke flat-out asks her if she is going to be a thug or a revolutionary the older political prisoner lectures to Esperanza: “Because I’m afraid that brother 2Pac was wrong. Thug Life is not the new Black Power. It makes no sense to rage against the machine without purpose or principle. You cannot be both a gangsta and a soldier, Esperanza, so you must choose.” In response to this, Esperanza sighs and thinks “neither ’cause either way I’ll end up back in this muthafucka or dead.” When Esperanza speaks, she responds, “All I know is that I am never coming back here” (Artemis 2005, 2). Esperanza’s words bring the connection between the lyrics of Ja Rule’s “Down Ass Chick” and Dead Prez’s “Real Black Girls” home in powerful ways. We can see that when it comes down to it, there really isn’t that much difference between the oppression and the limitations placed on women; that patriarchy in criminal circles is not better or worse than patriarchy in revolutionary circles; that patriarchy in gangsta rap is no worse or better than patriarchy in conscious rap

What the novel and the lyrics highlight to me is a real need for hip-hop feminism to be engaged with all aspects of black girls’ lives—we don’t want to be accused of being irrelevant to young black women in the ways that some of us have categorized academic black feminism. It makes no sense to pick and choose images and the artists who create the images and lyrics by deeming some negative and some positive, all the while creating false dichotomies. The issues and the artists are much more complicated than these simplistic readings allow. Rappers like 2Pac Shakur, Dead Prez, Common, Mos Def, and others are nothing if not complicated and sometimes conflicted young men. A cursory look at their work shows us that. Hip-hop feminism needs to be bolder in its critiques, even if it means calling out the so-called good guys every once and a while. [95]

Shorty Wrote this Book Yo!: Hip-hop and Feminism, Is it Fiction?

In her 2001 novel, The Haunting of Hip-Hop, author, lecturer, and scholar Bertice Berry tells the chilling tale of a Harlem brownstone haunted by souls tortured due to U.S. racism and oppression. One of the souls, a former enslaved African, has a message for the hip-hop generation: “We gave the drum back to your generation in the form of rap, but it’s being used to send the wrong message” (Berry 2001). The novel tells the story of rap producer Harry “Freedom” Hudson and his lawyer Ava Vercher

If Freedom represents hip-hop in the novel, then Ava represents the consciousness that echoes in hip-hop’s ear and tries to keep it on a righteous path. Ava Vercher is a new-age Afrocentric womanist with uplift tendencies. Freedom is a producer who makes two kinds of music: one is the kind of commercial music record companies want and the other is “music that no major record label would ever release because it was filled with the messages of love he longed for and the revolution he dreamed of starting” (Berry 2001, 16). You see that the ghost of the enslaved African has been haunting Freedom ever since he was a child, and he hopes to influence Freedom to do the right thing with the drum before it is too late

I’ve found the most compelling representations of hip-hop feminist representations in hip-hop literature. This is not to say that we should discount the music or the nonfiction writings of hip-hop feminists but simply to offer other spaces within hip-hop culture in which people are trying to imagine a better way. I closed Check It While I Wreck It with the call for us all to imagine a better way to use the culture of hip-hop to enact change. I believe that some women writers of popular fiction have begun to do just that

In the “Reader’s Guide: A Conversation with Black Artemis” at the end of her first novel Explicit Content, Black Artemis defines hip-hop fiction as fiction “about hip-hop as a subculture, as something that gives people voice and their lives meaning.” For her, “hip-hop is a form of cultural power and whether that power is a force for progress or destruction depends on how people use it, whether you use it on the street or in the studio, for fun or for profit, to build or destroy” (2004, 338). Of the recent trend to call urban fiction hip-hop fiction, she notes:
I think that street life should be referred to as street life fiction, period, and that the term “hip-hop fiction” should be reserved for novels that are about hip-hop. Eventually, there’ll be some works that can be referred to as both, but something that has nothing to do with hip-hop subculture should not [96] be referred to as hip-hop fiction, especially if it perpetuates the myth that hip-hop is all about violence, drugs, misogyny, etc. These phenomena are not the sum total of hip-hop, and hip-hop is not the only subculture in which those elements exist so it is wrong to treat them as if they are one and the same. (2004, 339)Her distinction has caused me to rethink many of my earlier definitions about what constitutes hip-hop fiction and cinema. The distinction is necessary and important for those of us looking for ways to more fully use the youth culture to enact change. And it does not rely on a dichotomy of positive and negative, conscious and commercial. The work simply has to be about one of the elements of hip-hop culture to be classified as such

Black Artemis’s Explicit Content documents the story of two women rappers, one black and one Latina. The novel explores what it is like to be a female with rapping skills trying to gain recognition in the music industry. It follows the women into the world of hip-hop and examines their hopes and dreams. It’s also a novel about female friendship, with just enough drama to keep the average hip-hop head focused and interested. The two women are a rap duo to rival all rap duos until a gangsta rap label comes between them. Of her work Black Artemis notes, “in these times when hip-hop is often used as a cultural weapon of destruction, my mission as a hip-hop artist and activist is to tell stories that relay the power of hip-hop as a tool of transformative expression” (2004, 340). The activist in her comes across in her fiction. It is fiction with a mission; in the tradition of the poets and playwrights of the Black Arts Movement who created art for people’s sake, Black Artemis’s art has an activist goal and agenda in mind

Another writer who has political threads in her work is L. A. Banks. Her Vampire Huntress Legends focus on the life of spoken word artist and vampire huntress, Damali Richards. She is the Neturu, which means God’s divine power latent within humans. She is the only Neturu to span two millennia. Damali uses her art—her spoken word music—to bring the light. Her lyrics are about hope in a time of hopelessness. And her band is also her vampire hunting crew. When I asked Banks why she decided to write horror and focus on vampires, she replied: “I wrote this series because I’m a mother living in the urban environment—and horror, because I have been horrified by what I see on the nightly news, and hear on the trolleys and subways, and by what I read in the newspapers. Vampires—because they suck blood, in a metaphor, they suck the life-blood out of the community as predators, and really have no sense of mortality or moral compass. I [97] wanted to create a cautionary tale, but one that also delved into the social, economic, and political infrastructure within our own society that creates predators” (Pough 2005, 168). Each of the novels in the series uses art to highlight the pitfalls of excessive materialism. Each of the novels work as metaphors for the age-old fight between good and evil. However, by making Damali a young spoken word artist, Banks is making a huge statement about the power at hand for young women, the power to change the world. And as for hip-hop, she hasn’t given up hope. Banks notes, “I see plenty of room for Hip-hop as an awesome catalyst, and I’m not so ready to give up on all Hip-hop artists, their messages, or their lyrics. I think what has happened, as metaphorically alluded to in the novels, is that vampires have infiltrated the genre of music, have co-opted the culture, and have twisted it. But there are still some very young, savvy, ready-to-stand-for-their-beliefs young folk out there. . . . that’s the message, that’s my hope. . . . guess it’s really my prayer” (Pough 2005, 171). Like Black Artemis, L. A. Banks has a mission in her art, and that mission is in line with many of the goals that hip-hop feminists have set out. Their novels offer hope and a spark for hiphop culture, at least in terms of having a political mission aimed at change. Race, class, sex, gender, and the intersections of these are present in this new fiction in startling, surprising, and uplifting ways. Writers like L. A. Banks and Black Artemis, rappers like Jean Grae, and the hip-hop feminists that I have mentioned here can in varying degrees be seen as pushing the hip-hop feminist agenda forward. They represent—along with the video vixens and the women hip-hop heads who buy the music and support the culture—a small sampling of women in contemporary hip-hop culture. Together their stories offer versions of the truth that Joan Morgan suggests we could achieve. Together they also give us a glimpse at the possibility for change and a sign that hip-hop feminism just might be on the right path to what it is going to be at last. And then we might be a little less concerned with “what it do” because we would be so awed by all that the movement has done

Endnotes

1. I realize that the word “shorty” as a term that is often used to refer to women in hiphop culture and rap music is problematic. Although not as derogatory as some other terms, such as “chickenheads,” “bitch,” “ho,” and so forth, it is still a term that more often than not objectifies women. It is also a term in hip-hop culture that refers to younger people, often children. Because “shorty” is used within the culture to refer to women and children, [98] it can be argued that the term therefore infantilizes women; thus, it is not a term I use lightly. I use “shorty” throughout this essay because of its multiple meanings, because it showcases just how fraught the relationship between hip-hop and feminism is. And I also use it because it calls forth the generational issues between hip-hop feminists and older black feminism. In a sense, hip-hop feminists are the shorties, the next generation of feminists on the “come up” ready to continue the legacy of black women’s intellectual traditions and activism

2. Most of my information about the dreams and aspirations of video models and how much they make comes from a survey of the interviews and photo spreads I’ve read of in the Source Magazine’s monthly “Dime Piece” section and XXL’s monthly “Eye Candy” section. Each month these magazines pick a video girl to highlight. And while most of the “coverage” is the photo shoot of the scantly-clad woman, there is usually a two- to three-page write-up and interview of each girl. And it is in these limited spaces that we get their voices, hopes, and dreams

210,How You Remind Me,"[Verse 1]

Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling

This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream ""Are we having fun yet?""

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no

[Verse 2]
It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause living with me must have damn near killed you

This is how you remind me of what I really am

With me getting in the way, my violent side
So I take my face and bash it into a mirror
I won't have to see the pain, pain, pain

This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked-up feelings again

My hurt inside is fading, this shit's gone way too far
All this time I've been waiting, oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking, I'm done, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything, and, oh, I cannot give anymore

My mind's done with this, okay, I've got a question
Can I throw it all away? Take back what's mine
So I take my time guiding the blade down the line
Each cut, closer to the vein, pain, pain

Anticipating all the fucked-up feelings again

It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta

We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch

I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home

And think of me and smile and say

It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right""
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine

But you weren't there
Right when I needed you the most
And now I dream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad

[Chorus]
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk

Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk

[Verse 3]
Father's hands are lined with guilt
For tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end
Just look at where we are
We made it out
We still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad

[Chorus]
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind

Too late, so wrong, so long

224,I Should Be Sleeping,"[Verse 1:]
I never knew there were such great movies
On tv at 3 am
I'd never guessed that at midnight tuesday
I could have pizza ordered in
I've never been a real night owl
But these days i'm all turned around
There's only one thing i'm sure of right now

[Chorus:]
I should be sleeping
'stead of keeping
These late hours i've been keeping
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move
Even though i'm feeling so right
I'm so happy still i know i
Should be sleeping
Instead of dreaming about you

[Verse 2:]
I never knew that i was funny
'til i went and made you laugh
Never liked a girl to call me honey
But you did and i liked that
I keep thinking about your smile
Trying to read between the lines
Looks like i'll be up for a while

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
After just three dates
And one great kiss
It's way too soon
To be obsessing like this

Conversion, software version 7.0
Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world?
How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

More wood for their fires, loud neighbors
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

Same old story back again
'She's not a lover, she's just a friend'
I'm sick and tired for you to blame on me
Now you think it's funny
Now you wanna spend your money on girls
But you forgot when you were down that I was around
Call my lover, hang up, call again
What in the world is happening?
Listen in, but don't yell at me
Isn't it ironic? All you wanna do is smoke chronic
Boy, you forgot when you were down who was around

I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore (anymore)

Memories don't live like people do
I'm sick for ever believing you
Wish you'd bring back the man I knew
Was good to me, oh, lord
Everytime you say you're coming

How well you forgot when you were down
And I was around

227,In The End,"[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

My first song was like forty-eight bars with no hook
You hear me flippin' thru my pages out my favorite notebook
The microphone was in the closet (What?) No headphones, we lost it
Niggas scared to get some water, roaches hangin' over the faucets
No AC, Tez'll break a sweat just tryin to make beats

Always flirtin' with all his customers, and flat broke
Nappy smokin' blacks out on the back po'ch
I'm thinkin' I got everything a country boy could ask for

[Big V]
Now what we do to get here? (Say dat boy!!)
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw (Say dat boy!!)
Hey now we hurt some, suffered for more, takes what we work for
Hated for for the cussin', but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on, but it was hard - stepped up, took charge
Ran through what we scared of, but what was we afraid for?
Look at what we made of, hard times done made us
Being here is alright, but must believe we want more!

A long time, a gravel road, to cash and fame and sold my soul
To Hell and back, and back and forth, with same jeans and nappy 'fro

Yo, case closed

Chased away by the black suits, shades, and clothes
We above the law
Feds can't touch me y'all
Highly ranked black blank I.D. card
So disregard what you think you saw
Put that phone down now
Who you think you calling huh?
One little flash then good night there
Just open your eyes honey look right there
Thank you mission completed
I mean it we won't be defeated
You seen it we did it even with weapons depleted
Galaxy defenders don't act like you don't remember
Taking contenders and proving they only pretenders
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
The Men In Black is back to protect the world
When the enemy is near the elite is here
So have no fear just let me see you

234,One Mic,"[Produced by Chucky Thompson and Nas]

[Intro]
One time, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop, glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back—fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with 9s out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now!

[Chorus]
Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (all I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me—fuck all of them!
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up, shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, too many 9s
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way: they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now!

[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (that's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (there's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know)
All I need is one mic (this is all I need)

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you only if they know what your weakness is
I have none, too late to grab guns
I'm blastin' ‘cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed
Body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range
Niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me ‘cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true
She came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace
Lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon ‘cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now

[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I need is one mic (all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (fuck the cars, the jewelry)
All I need is one mic (to spread my voice to the whole world, baby)",Nas,Nas,2002,"[99, 98, 87, 79, 57, 45, 44, 43, 47, 58, 63, 70, 79]",13

Here it is again sneaking up on us uh-uh uh yeah
This is the part you know I don't like
We say goodbye and then we kiss goodnight uh-uh uh yeah
I know it's one o'clock and you said you would be gone by 10
So much for those 8 hours I swore that I'd get in

Chorus:
I know I should get some sleep
I am at the beginning of another long week
But I don't want you to go
No i dont want you to go
I guess another minute wouldn't do no harm
Why not spend it in each other's arms
Cuz I don't want you to go
No I don't want you to go

We always say just one more kiss uh-uh uh yeah, uh-uh uh yeah
But it always seems to never end like this uh-uh uh yeah, uh-uh uh yeah

Now baby I don't wanna be fictitious

I'll give you my last dime
Spend all my time
It's yours whatever is mine...

238,What If She's An Angel,"There's a man standing on the corner
With a sign saying, 'Will work for food'
You know the man, you see him every morning
The one you never give your money to

You can sit there with your window rolled up
Wondering when the lights going to turn green
Never knowing what a couple more bucks
In his pocket might mean

What if he's an angel sent here from Heaven
And he's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in his face
Knowing deep down it could have been his saving grace
What if he's an angel?

There's a man and there's a woman
Living right above you in apartment G
There's a lot of noise coming through the ceiling
And it don't sound like harmony

You can sit there with your TV turned up
While the words and his anger fly
But come tomorrow when you see her with her shades on
Can you look her in the eye?

What if she's an angel sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
But what if she's an angel?

A little girl on daddy's lap
Hiding her disease with a baseball cap
You can turn the channel, most people do
But what if you were sitting in her daddy's shoes?

Maybe she's an angel sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

When I hear you stop and laugh out loud
When you're fallin' fast asleep
When you're in the middle of a crowd
When you're lyin' close to me
When I hear you softly say my name
When you're high and when you're low
When you don't need me to explain
'Cause you already know
When you smile that way
I know, every night and day

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

When you're drivin' in your car
When you dance and sing to the radio
When you're walkin' underneath the stars
Anywhere and everywhere you go
When you're dressed up or you're dressed down
When you're talkin' on the phone
With a million people all around
Or when you're all alone
When you're near, or you're far
You're in my heart no matter where you are

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you

Use my heart and not my eyes to navigate the darkness

Came from the dirt, I emerged from it all
Without a stain on my shirt; you can blame my old earth
For the shit she instilled in me, still with me, pain plus work
Shit, she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm callin' guts every time, drag my nuts every time, homie
We make a great combination, don't we?

Is my list of things to do today

There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet

Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch

Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

Wouldn't change the course of fate
But cutting the grass just had to wait
Cause I've got more important things
Like pushing' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today like

Start living, that's the next thing on my list

Raise a little hell, laugh 'till it hurts
Put an extra five in the plate at church

Stay up late, then oversleep

Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start living', that's the next thing on my list

Grease don't pop on the stove no more
Moved on up
Double shot Hennessey fill my cup
Luda choke smoke in a big black truck
Should I wild out? (WHAT THE FUCK?!)
Act like my rims ain't clean
How you gonna act like my neck don't bling?
Haters get sprayed like Afro-Sheen
But they don't ever really wanna pop them thangs
Cane, cane sugar man, Luda don't go
And I stop at a light, pulled up so slow
But I'm out for the night, so pass that 'dro
So daddy come home in a Cadillac brome (Cadillac brome?)
Now don't it sound absurd?
Claim College Park where they flip them birds
Trick car alarms, then bend them curves
Chop chop, chunk it up, fat man herb

Keep a couple rolled and I hit the club
In the back door (NIGGA WHAT?!)
Act like I don't make clout
How you gonna act like I don't get loud?
How you gonna act like I don't rock crowds?
And leave a lot of people with a gap tooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
But I guess what you don't really know don't hurt
With a vest and a pump, hear the shotgun squirt
My folks on the block, man, they got that work (They got that work?)
Don't it smell so good?
In Southwest where they rep that hood
Protect your chest, they up to no good
And come through flossin', they wish y'all would

How you gonna act like I just ain't strapped?
How you gon' act like I don't push 'Lacs?
Black El-Dorado, fifth wheel on back
Itchy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze
With a mac, with a Glock, I'mma make 'em say please
In the back, on block so the cops they freeze
And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed (You got a nose bleed?)

Seas in sights, all night
Never thought that this could take control of me

Always on my mind and dreaming of you
It feels so right but I know it is wrong
That I know I gotta man, just can't leave you alone

Buying me, shopping sprees, diamond rings

Never could understand a thing like me
To utter this from the seen of your face
I'm caught up in love with my secret love

Never thought that I would feel this way
All the things that I believed in went away
Right from the start, you took my heart
I'm in love, what can I say

You just can't leave me, see me alone

Heading to the rapids with some discount beer
It was a long train tussle but we had no fear

But it sure goes fast, just like that

We were brave, we were crazy, and we were mostly

Talked a good game when we were out with the guys
But in the back seat we were awkward and shy
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain
And I guess there are some things that are never going to change

I didn't tell her that I loved her, how much I cared
Or thank my pops for all the talks and all the wisdom he shared
Unaware, I just did what I always do
Every day the same routine before I skate off to school
But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest?
Instead of takin' a test, I took two to the chest
Call me blind, but I didn't see it comin'
Everybody was runnin', but I couldn't hear nothin'
Except gun blasts, it happened so fast
I don't really know this kid, though I sit by him in class
Maybe this kid was reachin' out for love
Or maybe for a moment he forgot who he was
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was, I know it's because

Little Suzy, she was only twelve
She was given the world with every chance to excel
Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud, but no respect for herself
She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations just different faces
Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her, she deserved much better
Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules, so you would think he was cool
He was never really one of the guys

Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim?
No matter what you say, it don't take away the pain
That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies

Will it ever make sense? Somebody's got to know
There's gotta be more to life than this

Johnson City, Tennessee
I was gassin' up my Firebird
When I heard her callin' me...mmm hmm
Said, 'Which way are you headed, boy
Do you need some company'

She had me stoppin' at a quick mart
Before we made it out of town
Next thing she was runnin' at me
Tellin' me to lay that hammer down
Cause there's a man right behind me
Doin' his best to slow me down

Smokin' stolen Marlboro lights

It was about five until five on Friday
We were all getting ready to go
And the boss man started screaming
And his veins began to show
He said you and you come with me
Cause you're going to have to stay
My heart was thumping I was jumping
I had to get away

Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance

[Verse 2]
Well I was talking with my baby
Over a small glass of tea
He asked the loaded question
It seems unreal to me that
He said how do you feel about me
My mind was racing I was pacing
But the words just wouldn't come
And there was only one thing
Left to do I feel it coming on

[Chorus]
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense

272,Always On Time,"Hi, I’m the Rap Critic. Let’s talk about Ja Rule. Yeah… remember him?

Well, if you do, you, you’ll remember that he was one of the more successful 2Pac Knock-offs that tried to capatilize off of his likeness in the aftermath of his death, as made obvious by the bald head, red bandana, and perpetual shirtlessness, but whereas 2Pac’s musical material, no matter how controversial or disagreeable, at least came across as genuine, intricate, insights of a man trying to sort out his world, Ja Rule’s music came across as very… watered down, to say the least

First of all, he sang WAY too much for a hardcore thug, as he kept claiming to be. Secondly, he sang WAY too much for someone who CAN’T SING. *montage of Ja Rule singing* And Third, he had all of the mannerisms of 2Pac with absolutely none of the substance. And fourth, we already had a late 90’s, eastcoast version of 2Pac. His name was DMX!

And this is a comparison that must be noted, because not only did DMX arrive on the scene about a year before Ja Rule, but he also had an energy, griminess, and passion in his rhymes that made Ja Rule look like a corny knock off. X had diversity in his topics, ranging from hardcore anthems to tracks about multiple personalities to songs detailing his life like “Slippin’”. His material was not only more clever and diverse, but also grittier, making you believe every word he viciously growled. That, coupled with the fact that, in 1998, both his first and second albums went number one in the same year, and you can bet your ass people were trying to imitate the formula. Not by trying to achieve the same intensity or ability as DMX, but by taking his exact aesthetic, and watering it down to hell

Now, Ja and DMX were actually cool with each other at first, that is until right around the release of his second album, Rule 3:36, which is about the time Ja started going from run-of-the-mill gangsta rapper to employing one of the worst trends in HipHop: the “thugs need love too” songs. These were Ja Rule’s Bread and FREAKING butter: songs with females on the chorus singing soulfully about how much they need Ja Rule and declaring their loving loyalty to him while he, in return, spits rhymes about hardcore sex and how much of a gangsta and playa he still is, despite his relationship with her. By the end of 2002, there was a never-ending torrent of “I wanna be gangsta for the fellas and lovey-dovey for the ladies” songs that dominated the airwaves for a while, the biggest single of which was “Always On Time”, which is pretty much the first and last song from him that you really needed to hear when it comes to this topic. Everything that’s done right and wrong is on this song, and mostly, it’s done wrong, so let’s check it out

""Always there when you call (Buckshots, hah), always on time""

RIGHT THERE! That’s exactly what I’m talking about. Smooth, R and B singer crooning about love for the girls, but we’ve still gotta be hardcore, so I gotta talk about shooting guns!... Despite the fact that that has nothing to do with the mood she’s trying to set. Like, in reality, this wouldn’t work

*singing* Yeah, boy, You know I love you! Tell me what you say to that! *pause* *guns go off* Holy shit! What the fuck!

“Gave you my.... baby be mine”
What… what did you give him?
“And I gave you my all, now baby be mine”

Oh… why was that edited out the first time? Did the first take have a… different word there?

“Gave you my....” *...you know… “baby be mine”

Although, the word she actually says here is “I gave you my all”, but then she says, “Now baby, be mine”. And, seeing that the context is, “Yeah, I don’t always answer my phone, but when you need me, I’m there, giving you my “ALL” and since, after giving him her “all”, she still doesn’t know whether or not he wants to be with her, I’m going to forgo any thought that she’s talking about spending quality time together as a loving couple and just assuming she’s talking about her… you know…

BUT, it’s just innocuously worded enough that someone could interpret it in a more innocent context, and that’s a great way that R and B writing works: you can easily deduce a sexual or emotional context from what they’re saying. However, when the verses are coming from a rapper who’s still trying to be hardcore…

“C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other”

Goodbye, subtlety…

""I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain""

Yeah, I know I’ve done very disrespectful things to you in the past, but, hey, you know who I am! I’m a rich rapper! And besides, love is SUPPOSED to be about being hurt. That’s why I’m doing things that hurt you! I’m ONLY trying to verify the enduring power of our love!

""So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints""

Yeah, so just sign these papers that will nullify your restraining order and… WHHA?!

""Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids""

I’m sorry, did you mention something about a restraining order a little while ago?

""Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile""

I guess not! She had a freaking restraining order on you! Look, I understand that people get into relationship problems, but if it’s come to the point of trying to legally restrict a person from being near you, we’ve tread into some dangerous territory

""While I'm smackin you fast and hittin you all wild""

That line about restraining orders is really ruining the rest of this song

""[With Ashanti] But we share somethin so rare,""

Yes, most couples DON’T have what we have between us, namely a document stating that we can’t be within 100 feet of each other

""But who cares?""

The court that drafted it?

“Baby, I’m not always there when you call, but I’m always on time”

Are you still singing this chorus? Why do you like this guy? He’s obviously not worth your time!

“Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together”

See, even Ja Rule wants you to get over him! He’s done nothing to illustrate why he’s not a good person! Like he said, get a grip!

It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather”

Oh wait, was he saying “pull it together” and “get a grip” because he wants her to overlook his shortcomings, because they’ve “been through worse”, as he says? My bad, I guess. I thought he was having a moment of clarity, realizing he was a horrible person and telling her to move on from him. But what a foolish presumption, because most of these songs are about how “girl, you know that I’m a bad boy, and you like the fact that I’m a bad boy, and we’re terrible for each other, but we just can’t stay away from each other, because we love the fact that we’re not supposed to be together *points finger in mouth* and blegh! You know, where Wale handled this topic with nuance and gave the proper weight to the subject, Ja Rule’s songs exploit that angle, and that’s what annoys me. The way this chorus is sung, it treats the topic with no gravity whatsoever, and tries to make the whole thing cute while Ja’s lyrics in the verses outline just how stupid it really is

""Like the stormy nights you wrote a ""Dear Ja"" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather""

Okay, here’s an instance where she did something pretty crappy to him, but I’m fairly sure that she did this in response to something HE did

""Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches""

You know, like casually referring to her as a bitch, or living by the phrase “M.O.B.”, which means that he values money and material items over bitches, a derogatory term that he just called her, as in “Why did you cut up my car? Don’t you remember? I value material items more than I value you! See, this is why things aren’t working out! You don’t understand me!""

“I got two or three hoes for every V”

Or, you could look at the fact that he sees no shame in telling you that he has other girls

“And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy”

And he keeps them high off of drugs to incapacitate them… like a pimp or… wait, is this song about a pimp and his relationship with a prostitute? Yeah, dude, I think it is! I mean, listen to that chorus again!

“I’m not always there when you call, but I’m always on time”

That’s something a prostitute would say to her pimp, “yeah daddy, I may not always answer my phone, but I’m always on time with my money!” Dear God, why didn’t I see it before!

""Believe me, this pimp game is very religious""

Seriously, why didn’t I notice this? This is basically a song about how a pimp makes a girl feel special so that she’ll sell her body for him, and Ashanti is the chick who’s going for it! I mean, if that ISN’T what this song is about, and Ja Rule writing a love song can be this easily misconstrued as a pimp-ho relationship, well, I guess that just shows how terrible he is at it

""I play hard, there's so many women I fathered""

Wait, “fathering” someone means that you’ve been a father to a person. So, you’re bragging about the fact that you have a lot of daughters? I mean, contextually, this should be another line about how many women you’ve had sex with, but if you’re saying you “fathered” them, that verb specifically means to be a father to someone, so… unless raising multiple daughters was a thing that rappers bragged about in the early 2000’s, this line is very wrongly worded

“Oh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life
Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes”

Hold on, so now, Ja Rule is the one concerned about her faithfulness? You just told us that you have two hoes for every car you own. As far as we know, you’re the only one who’s had sex with anyone else, so excuse me if I don’t show sympathy to your speculations that probably arise from the fact that you’re afraid your girlfriend might have the exact same morality code as you!

And you could say that this is a lust song, that’s it’s not meant to be taken as a song about intimate relationships as much as sexual attraction, but then what’s the excuse for cutesy lines like this:

""But we share something so rare
But who cares, you care""

Dude, I know what this really is. This isn’t a morally elusive song for the purpose of telling us a real story about two people struggling between lust and genuine attraction, this is a morally elusive song for the purpose of fooling girls into thinking he has a softer side to make them believe he’ll treat them special, all the while flagging the “but I’m a complicated thug” card that’s supposed to make it okay for him to have sex with other women because he “just doesn’t want to be committed yet”!

It’s obvious, it’s manipulative, and it’s a perfect example of why I don’t like these songs when they’re done this way. And that’s not to say that I don’t like Rap love songs in general, or that hardcore rappers shouldn’t make love songs. It can be done right. Look at the quintessential “thugs need love too” song, “All I Need” by Method Man

“Back when I was nothing You made a brother feel like he was somethin
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray You would rub me on my back and say ""Baby it'll be okay""”

This is a great example of a rap love song that doesn’t come across as either corny or pandering

""I'm realizing that you didn't have to fuck wit me
But you did, now I'm going all out kid And I got mad love to give,""

Sure, to some people, this may not sound super romantic and sweet, but this brand of HipHop isn’t about that: it’s raw, it’s reality, and it sounds authentic, and it doesn’t need to be sugar-coated, which is what they did for “Always On Time”, to cover up the fact that it’s not about love, it’s about manipulating women into thinking that Ja Rule gives a crap about you, and it barely bothers to hide it. Sorry, but I just hate the mood of this song. Ashanti here is desperately trying to get her to love him, begging him to be hers, and the only thing he does is talk about how awesome he is. It’s annoyingly lop-sided in regards to who’s giving them self to the other. I’d give this song a 1 out of 5, because, you know, Ashanti was an okay singer

Twist the game
(Chooga Chooga Chooga Chooga)
Train comin'
Full speed!
Ain't nothin' stoppin' this muh'fucka
Puttin' it down
(Ch- Chooga Chooga Chang)
In my hometown
(My niggas keep pickin' me up)
I got it rockin' at the show
All year a motherfucker stompin' in the flo'
(Boom boom)
Losing control!
(Eyes closed)
Hands up
Bobbin' the dome
And you can call it what you wanna
(You wanna)
But you better keep your eyes on it
I've been told ya over and over
I don't feel like talkin' no more
It's about to go down
(Just like I told ya)

I told y'all
(I told y'all)
It was 'bout to happen, but y'all wouldn't listen to me
Now you see it's poppin' off

Break it down, break it down, break it down for me

Move over
Makin' 'em diesel
(Fueled up)

(Mwa!)
Clear the road
Block it off
Hold it back
Make a path for it

Carolina street sweeper
My brother keep her
You better believe her
Good as a bag of Afghanistan reefer
I can't fuck with me and y'all can't neither
(Hear me rap)
You'll need bulletproof speakers
(My impact)
Will kill 79 people

The levels start to jumpin' on the needle
Then sparks start to shootin' out the speakers
DJ just just can't catch the needle
Clubs call the beaver for the flavor of the Petey

(I told y'all)
It was 'bout to happen, but y'all wouldn't listen to me

Now you see it's poppin' off

[Verse 3]
When they ask me where I'm from I say
Greenville and Raleigh
Durham, Chapel Hill, Greensboro, Charlotte
Fairfield, Rocky Mount, and Tarboro
Pine Tops, Lil' Washington, Farmville
New Bern, Kinston, Snow Hill, Falkland
Please don't get me started
I could call 'em out til' tomorrow
Carolina's list alone is 16 malls
I'm bout to make a role call
Calling up, all out ""Could Timbaland please report to the office!""
You can't miss kickoff
Watchin' these niggas get their shit off
Sending adrenaline rush through the whole park
Dust to dawn
From the club to the barn
From port to port
(Nigga!)
From yard to yard
I done brought it from the far beyond
Stated claim
Got a name, got it painted and framed
Motherfucker!

It was 'bout to happen, but y'all wouldn't listen to me

I call mami Montana, bandana
Tied her hands up - this is gangsta love
Threw on a rap CD, we gangsta fucked
This ain't R&B smooth, I ain't a R&B dude
Poured a glass of Army, got mami in the mood
Then she stripped for me like the ""Moulin Rouge""
I think I might wife her
Y'know, powder blue Rocawear suit, white Nike her
Add mami to the cypher
R-O-C for life cuz, the gang, motherfucker

You get your own 2002, she through ridin'
Keep yo' ass tight up in Versace
That's why you gotta watch yo' friends
You gotta watch me, they connivin' shit

But everybody ain't as horny as me
And your body's - callin', me...

Uhh, yeah
Mami shot through the pad with the Mark Jacobs bag
The thick stitched seam and her favorite ass jeans
Y'all know the first date wearers
To make objects bigger than they appear like a rear view mirror
Oh, her shoe game is real
She gave 'em the Christian Louboutin's with the four inch heels
But honestly my favorite type of gear
Is a scrungy for her hair and LaPearla underwear, clear?

It's goin' down, the rhythm projects 'round the next sound
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect, now
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot of a super future-esque style

The combination of a vocal caress
With lungs that gasp for breath from emotional stress
With special effects and a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage

Once again it is
Composed sentences altogether venomous
The four elements of natural force
Projected daily, through the sound of the source

Everybody on board as we blend, the sword with the pen
The mightiest of weapons swinging right from the chin
To elevate mental states long gone with the wind
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends

It's goin' down, style and simulation, readily
Trekking through the weaponry of a pure pedigree
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me
Whatever the weather be, we advancing steadily

It's going down sub-terrestrial high
A rhyme regiment that's calling the shots
Execution of collaborative plots
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop

No one scared of getting dirty 'cause we came from the mud
And we hungrier than ever, he rise, she rise
We rise together, birds of a flock
More like birds of a feather

When we giving up? Never

Eighty thou' strong and the fans all screaming
We get knocked down and we coming up swinging
And we putting in work, all done in brotherhood

Since William Andrews and Bartkowski

If you rep the A-town, then you feel just like me

Together, we rise on the rest

Killin one from the top of the stash and I'm feelin buns
Plus I'm do' low at a table

Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk

Suck your t's and in your front and lemme squeeze somethin

I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-

Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See ain't nothing changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin' at the airport who got laid off
I take my shades off

Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat running like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stones, gather no moss
Mommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah, then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music, we stay relentless

Just what kind of love keeps breakin' a heart
No matter how hard I try
I always make you cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
All that's happenin' here is a long goodbye

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I ask my heart did we really, give our love a chance (Just one more chance)
But I know without a doubt, we turned it inside out
And if we walked away would it make more sense
But it tears me up inside, just to think we could still try

How long must we keep runnin' on a carousel
Goin' 'round and 'round and never gettin' anywhere, on a wing and prayer

Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know

But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else

Promise to love you the best I can""

293,Bouncin' Back (Bumpin' Me Against The Wall),"[Chorus 2x: Mystikal and Pharrell]
You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me
You ain't seen bouncin' back

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
I really be throwin' my words
Standing 'em up, and jammin' on the one
That ain't nobody but Neptunes bammin' on the drum
Swift flip kicks landing from the tongue
More dramatic than Batman and Robin, ba na na na na na
The one that be handling business, be sharper than a thumb tack
The one that be dropping these albums, showing 'em how to come back
And you gone respect me, appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, cause you sorry that you done that
I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much want to see the rest
I'm coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set
I ain't even started yet
So if you ain't ready you better get ready
Know I do it better when I'm being opposed
Ah stick ya chest out, keep ya chin up
And sometimes you gotta get knocked down to get up

[Chorus 2x: Mystikal and Pharrell]
You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me
You ain't seen bouncin' back

[Verse 2: Mystical]
No matter what happened, that's only once, it's shame on you
You come up and here and do it again then its shame on me
Sometimes we be getting in trouble you didn't want learn
Sometimes we be getting so rude you ain't want see
I accept my wages like the way that I fail
I grow, I take strides and but 'em under my belt
I learned from you just like you learned from me
I plead, I pray for peace and perfect harmony
Somebody say fool you better keep on rapping
Stop that trippin', causin it ain't gone happen
I told them look you better mind yo business
Change yo' way of thinking and keep on living
Done started some trouble and you ain't been out since
Cause you stuck inside scared watching CNN
Just take the precaution so yo life a be better
Tell my friends to call me I ain't accepting no letters

[Chorus 2x: Mystikal and Pharrell]
You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me
You ain't seen bouncin' back

[Verse 3: Mystical]
Oh you heard about it, yeah you had to
Hmm-huh, I know you change ya mind you ain't the only one with bad news
I know that they made you feel strange huh
You was right in the middle complaining and forgot what you was cryin bout
It could be you time and it might be
You can't do nothing about it, its God will thats just how life be
One day it hit 'cha then its gone
And I'm serious and you ain't never even gone feel it until it hit home
That's when the pain run sharper and deeper
You ain't eat that's when the days feel slow and long
I know you miss 'em so it's time to uplift 'em
Try to pick the pieces up and find a way to drive on
I tell you the truth so don't lie to me
Get back Satan don't bother me
And that's the way its gotta be
And when its over and done with I hope you proud of me

With the tank tops and the flirty words (hey baby)

I said it'd cost her a name

Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age 24

Hope that she'd care

The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames a huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, ‘cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in

So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never! 'Member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me ""God's Son"" with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (uhh)

[Chorus]
I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)",Nas,Nas,2002,"[98, 95, 97, 95, 91, 90, 87, 93, 97, 91, 92, 92, 89, 90, 90, 91]",16

Make a connection

Faraway from that life so young
That's when you used to know
Many dreams since then you've had
Have come and gone that time might show
But stress, don't you let it
Don't you forget it
Trust you'll find your way to love
Hope is what your heart is made of

Don't you forget your way home
For that little girl
Hold on to your world
And don't you forget it
Don't you forget your way home
For that little girl

You're worlds apart
From first where life would start
Understanding what it means to have got
Nothing but your heavy broken heart
The memory of what used to be
With change comes responsibility

Don't you forget where you are
Ain't where you've been
Life's lessons that
Made you into a woman

Don't you be afraid
Cause a heartbeat away
Is all and everything
That's ever meant me, and will mean to you
No need to cry, you can dry your eyes
Cause you can count on the love that trough the years
Helped you face your fears and subside your tears
Everything will be okay
Don't you be afraid (no oo oo..)
Don't you be afraid (na na na na)

And don't you forget it

When moonlight crawls along the street
Chasing away the summer heat
Footsteps outside somewhere below
The world revolves, I let it go
We build our church above this street
We practice love between these sheets
The candy sweetness scent of you
It bathes my skin, I'm stained in you
And all I have to do is hold you
There's a racing within my heart
And I am barely touching you

Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you is
Insatiable
Turn me on
Never stop
Wanna taste every drop
My love for you is
Insatiable

[Verse 2]
The moonlight plays upon your skin
A kiss that lingers takes me in
I fall asleep inside of you
There are no words
There's only truth
Breathe in, breathe out
There is no sound
We move together up and down
We levitate, our bodies soar
Our feet don't even touch the floor
And nobody knows you like I do
Cause the world, they don't understand
But I grow stronger in your hands

Turn the lights down low
Take it off

My love for you is

Kissin' for hours, talkin', makin' plans

So much to say
Can't close my eyes when I'm with you
Insatiable, the way I'm loving you

Ten million ways to love somebody

Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble

The day you leave will cry a river

309,Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning),"[Verse 1]
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

[Chorus]
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

[Verse 2]
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?
Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

[Chorus]
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

I'm not a real political man

Mothers on the stoop
Boys in souped-up coupes

Feel broken down

Something's got to change, because

I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around

Went to the bank took out a loan
Went and bought the perfect stone
Called up her dad on the phone
I'm talking him to dinner Sunday night

Destination anywhere
This road decides to go
Underneath the desert sky
I find a place to hide and rest my weary bones
This underpass will shade the heat
As my mind drifts off to sleep...

There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare and your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight
In the moonlight
The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes
You let me know that for all my life
You would always be my only girl
But that's another place in time
Back when you were mine
In another world

A car stops way up ahead
I climb inside her hair is red
I thank her for the ride
She talks the miles away
I nod and smile and try to say
Anything to be polite
But as the darkness ends the day
Another voice whisper's my name

There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare and your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight
In the moonlight
The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes
You let me know that for all my life

322,Just Let Me Be In Love,"My breath is short, my heart is beating fast
Every time I smile at her she's smiling back
If I'm dreaming, please just let me sleep
Anyone can see that she's too good for me
Oh, give her time, she'll find out soon enough
Just let me have and hold her 'til she does

What we've got going on is so incredible
This chemistry between us feels so wonderful
But knowing me, I'll probably
Find a way to mess it up
Who knows, who cares, right now
Just let me be in love

Don't concern me with reality
Don't convince me she's too heavenly
Forget the future, disregard the past
Those are questions I don't want to ask
To my heart, all that matters is tonight
Just let me live this moment in her eyes

What we've got going on is so incredible
This chemistry between us feels so wonderful

Find a way to mess it up

323,I Miss You,"[Intro: DMX]
I know that my savior lives
And at the end, He will stand on this earth
My flesh may be destroyed
Yet from this body, I will see God
Yes, I will see Him for myself
And I long for that moment

[Verse 1: DMX]
Grandma, I really miss you, and it ain't been the same
I drop a tear when I hear your name
Mary Ella Holloway, why you gotta be so far away?
Used to say, ""Don't worry, it's gon' be okay""
But it ain't – it's like when you left, you took the Lord with you
Why couldn't I come when He came to get you?
Damn, I really miss you… I had to say it again
I remember the time when I was like 10
Crept up in the neighbor's yard, yeah, bein' hard headed
You told me I would get it – you said it!
And boy did I get it, but after you spanked me, you hugged me
Kissed me on my forehead, told me that you love me
And I saw that it hurt you more than it hurt me
I thought, how bad could this hurt be?
I know now, that's why it's only done out of love
What I wouldn't give for one mo' hug, from grandma

[Chorus: Faith Evans (DMX)]
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)

[Verse 2: DMX]
What I'm about to say a couple of family members is gon' hate me
But I'ma let you know what's been goin' on lately
Now you know since you left a lot of things with your kids done changed
Yeah, Jackie's still crazy, don't know what's up with James
Ain't seen Jerry in a while, you know he walk like you
And Renée's back in jail, you know she talk like you
Riculah's(?) doing real good now, she workin'
Rhonda's still runnin' around, trickin', jerkin'
Buckeye's buggin', he done lost his mind
And Jarvis? Back out of jail, doin' fine
Kylie? He done changed, it ain't all about self
As for my father... well, that's somethin' else
But that's my dog, he hold his grandmother down
My great grandmother, makin' a lot of trips out of town
But that's a good thing, and if I could only hear you sing
Once more, oh Lord, the comfort it would bring

[Chorus: Faith Evans (DMX)]
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)

[Verse 3: DMX (Faith Evans)]
You left behind a mother, eleven kids, eleven grand-kids
And since then, two of your grand-kids done had kids
They had a boy named Tacoma, Xavier's brother
That's right, Xavier's made you a great-grandmother
I thank you for the best times of my life
I thank you for when you first met her acceptin' and lovin' my wife
I thank you for those Sunday dinners, they were vital
I thank you for my life, I thank you for the Bible
I thank you for the songs that you'd sing in the mornin'
(Amazing Grace…) while I'm yawnin'
I thank you for the two beatings you gave me
'Cause I know somewhere along the line the lesson I learned from the two beatings saved me
And when you died I cried like a baby, I begged the Lord to take me
'Cause no one else could give me what you gave me
But life, like everything, comes to an end
I pray I go to Heaven to see you again – Amen

[Chorus: Faith Evans (DMX)]
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)

I was just out of the service thumbing through the classifieds
When an ad that said, ""old Chevy"" somehow caught my eye
The lady didn't know the year or even if it ran
But I had that thousand dollars in my hand

[Verse 2]
It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn
With thirty years of dust and dirt on that green Army tarp
And when I pulled the cover off, it took away my breath
What she called a Chevy was a sixty-six Corvette

[Verse 3]
I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills
What a thrill I got when I sat behind the wheel
I opened up the glove box and that's when I found the note
The date was nineteen sixty-six and this is what he wrote

[Chorus]
He said, ""My name is Private Andrew Malone
And if you're reading this, then I didn't make it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of mine, now it belongs to you
And though you may take her and make her your own
You'll always be riding with Private Malone""

[Verse 4]
Well, it didn't take me long at all, I had her running good
I loved to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood
I had her shining like a diamond and I'd put the ragtop down
All the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her through town

[Verse 5]
The buttons on the radio didn't seem to work quite right
But it picked up that oldie show, especially late at night
I'd get the feeling sometimes, if I turned real quick I'd see
A soldier ridin' shotgun in the seat right next to me

[Chorus]
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
He told me to take her and make her my own
And I was proud to be riding with Private Malone

[Bridge]
Well, one night it was raining hard, I took the curve too fast
I still don't remember much about that fiery crash
Someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out
They didn't get his name, but I know without a doubt

[Chorus]
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
And I know I wouldn't be here if he hadn't tagged along
Yeah, that night, I was riding with Private Malone
Oh, thank God, I was riding with Private Malone

[Verse 1]
There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it something I said
To make you turn away
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now

Won't change the fact that you're gone...no, no
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
The time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
(Guess that's my life without you)
And maybe I could change my every day
But baby I don't want to

[Bridge 2]
So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you (take my mind off missing you)
And I know in my heart

Here's what I tell everyone
I was born by God's dear grace
In an extraordinary place
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

It's a big ol' land with countless dreams
Happiness ain't out of reach
Hard work pays off the way it should
Yeah, I've seen enough to know that we've got it good
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

There's a lady that stands in a harbor for what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes the price that it cost to be free

I pledge allegiance to this flag
And if that bothers you, well, that's too bad
But if you got pride and you're proud you do
Hey, we could use some more like me and you
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

Yes, there's a lady that stands in a harbor for what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes the price that it cost to be free

No, it ain't the only place on earth

Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants

All that pressure you applyin it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin your sleeves off

Said a storybook thug
He was the kind
That made you wonder how he put down the love

He had a hickey in his pocket
A phat rock in his ear
He made my heart stop pulpitating
Every time he came near

He has a spanking new Range for that tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin
He was plaided
And his head was cornrows

He has his wrists bling-blinging
And his long legs was bow
He tried to push up on me
But I knew he had me at go

[Chorus x2:]
I do
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you

So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out playa
Balling out of control

[Verse 2:]
Me and my crew started grooving
Made our way to the floor
It's time to activate my plan
And give this hottie a show

I shook my hips
Took a dip
Roll my tongue 'cross my lips

And when he took his place to dance wit me
I felt fingertips on the small of my back
So I had to react like I was playing hard to get
And told that boy to step back

But when I looked deep in his eyes
All I could see was his soul
I'm 'bout to make this guy my man
That I can tell you
Fa 'sho

Watch me
Drop, drop
Shake it
For the fellas who know

Watch me pop
Pop my hips

343,Goodbye,"Sometimes
What may be the best thing for you to do
Sometimes that's the hardest thing for you to do
And that, that's real cuz
I know I love you, I know how I feel about you
But I also know that dont make everything all right
And for that reason I gotta say goodbye

(Verse 1)
Tell me have you ever been in
A situation where the best thing you could do
Was the hardest thing you've ever done
But you try to do what's right
And I know deep down inside
That I really wanna be there by your side
But I can't stand to see you cry
Not when it's because of me

(Chorus)
When it's over
I'll never love another
I'm always thinking of her
I'm doing this because of her
Don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna let her see me cry
Looking out the window and wondering why
Did we have to say all those things
That we said last night
Baby, I don't wanna say goodbye
So I'm just standing here wondering why
I just don't like to see when you cry
So I say goodbye

(Verse 2)
Do you think that cuz I packed your stuff
That inside I'm really really crackin' up
Cuz you're wrong, I just hide it good
Cuz I know that's what you need girl
And there's more to life than loving yourself
You gotta learn to love somebody else
And that's why I do the things that I do

(Chorus)
When it's over
I'll never love another
I'm always thinking of her
I'm doing this because of her
Don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna let her see me cry
Looking out the window wondering why
Did we have to say all those things
That we said last night
Baby, I don't wanna say goodbye
So I'm just standing here wondering why
I just don't like to see when you cry
So I say goodbye

(Verse 3)
There's no one in this world that can ever take your place
All the love that we shared, it can never be erased
And I know that it hurts so bad
And I'm sorry, you're the best I had

And no one in this world can ever take your place
All the love that we shared, it can never be erased
And I'm lonely and it hurts so bad
And I'm sorry, you're the best I had

348,From Her Mama (Mama Got A**),"[Verse 1: Alex Oliver]
'Member growing up, as a buck blowing up
Even then taking drugs, get in trouble and disrupt
Adults would erupt, consult my mom and such
They would try to tell stories, stop me from acting up
Teacher tell a tale of a woman that would tail
If you told a tall story it gets gory in detail
Oh well, I guess they failed I was strongly against it
I should mention...tale got my attention
Beautiful woman, stalks juvenile students
In dead of night, in ya’ sights stops where ya' heading
You're full fright, it’s alright, just asks a question
Makes you feel, there's no need to be threatened
Flowing black hair, glowing beauty that's rare
Cover her face they'd swear, and she makes you wanna stare
She speaks her words, your death's ensured
And if you run away, your fate's still secured
Once upon a time, a woman was so fine
Men thought she was divine, and deserved her own shine
Her jealous husband with overzealous children
And he felt threatened she got men's attention
He's overbearing, when they’re all staring
He’s glaring at her and snapping at her
Then they're feeling distant, when it gets consistent
She starts to wary, their marriage hairy
Sh-sh-she meets a jerry that treats her fairly
Its getting scary wants to remarry
He thinks she’s sexy, she thinks he's sexy
What happens next B, you should guess see
Husband finds out, in a rage all about
Takes a knife to her mouth, stretch the whole thing out
No one will think that you're pretty again
Blood on the floor, screams hear all of them
She dies of suicide right in front of the man
But the tale says that she will rise again
With vengeance in hand, take revenge on all man
She'll take a knife and stab you til’ you die, take ya' skin
Why is this fiction stuck in my dome?
Why I'm thinking about story when I'm on my own?
I'm remembering this story when I'm walking home
Strange feeling, but I guess I'm not alone

[Chorus: Alex Oliver]
Ma said beware of the slit mouth woman
Ma said beware of the slit mouth woman
Ma said beware of the slit mouth woman
Of the slit mouth woman
Of the slit mouth woman
You encounter her, then it must be fate
Can't get away, something you can't shake
No right answer everything's a mistake
Suffer same fate if you see her face

[Verse 2: Alex Oliver]
In the park for this story, so I move a lil' quickly
Remark softly ""I'm sickly"" and I feel a bit chilly
Yea it's dark and stormy and I feel a bit silly
But this arc ain't really 'bout the tale of two cities
Walking home, see an attractive Asian
I'm contemplating attempts at persuasion
Mouth's half covered, I'm ignoring information
Approaches me, for conversation
She asks “am I pretty?” and I couldn't say no
Hand reaches for her mask, takes it off so slow
Scar from her mouth to each ear lobe
She asks ""am I pretty now?"" and I'm just froze
Withdraws large, blood smeared sheers
Paralyzed right here
See her insides from her mouth, ear to ear
Turn around, try to run, in hopes to get clear
But her footsteps are near, I always hear
Still try to book it even if though I know
She's in the corner of my eye no matter where I go
Get back to my apartment, close all compartments
Feel my heart my stop, then proceed to vomit
Can't go to sleep, can't even eat
Peep every few hours, trying to fight the sleep
Doze off for second I reckon, but then
There's a blade in the air followed by a door slam

[Chorus B: Alex Oliver]
Ma said beware of the slit mouth woman
Ma said beware of the slit mouth woman
Ma said beware of the slit mouth woman

I will not forsake
The colors that you bring
The nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me
I listen through your ears
Through your eyes I can see

And you are such a fool
To worry like you do
I know it's tough
And you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now
My, oh my

Sharp shooter into breaking hearts
A baby gigolo, a sex pistol
Hollering at everything that walks
No substance just small talk
Know why you feeling on that girl's behind
You gotta sleazy one track mind
Working your work until you think you find
Who's going home with you tonight

[Missy]
I changed all the credit cards
And switched the lock to all my doors
You thought my heart would be destroyed
Look around cause I'm chillling boy
Whatcha go and get your lawyers for
I, makes my dough in just one show, you know
Your lawyer shoulda let you know, you know
When you sue me, you gonna be broke you know
Ain't know you way you could bring me down
Any chick that you stick is real sleazy
Before I need you, I betcha gon' need me
You ain't want me anyway way, you wanted to be me

While I, work my ass off and you just lounge
You slump, bump, son of a gun

Oh who you give it to
Who you gonna steal it from
Who's your next victim

Oh gonna be a showdown, knock down drag out

But now you up on dem knees, still jocking me

Memories overtaking me
I try to face them but
The thought is too much to conceive

Everything else just stays the same
So now I step out of the darkness
That my life became 'cause

I just needed someone to talk to
You were just too busy with yourself
You were never there for me to
Express how I felt, I just stuffed it down
Now I'm older and I feel like
I could let some of this anger fade
But it seems the surface I am scratching
Is the bed that I have made

[Verse 2]
So where were you?
When all this I was going through
You never took the time
To ask me just what you could do

And I wanna be together when you runaway (Its NB Ryders)
Just me and you (Same Klick new title)
Just you and me
Will you runaway with me

The day I wrote these words for you I cried
Could of died that day a happy and complete man
Cuz in the palm of my hands
Everything that I dreamed for and more
And you know I'm down for yours
Forever and life the reason why I made you my wife is because
You see me for me the real me and love me unconditionally
And even with the circumstances that I had you still gave me a chance
And that's why I live and breathe for you and the kids
And you give me more than what this thing could ever give to me
And now my life is satisfied and complete visions are coming true
Yea of me and you placing rings on each others fingers saying ""I do""
You stuck with me through my thick and my thin to go back and live life over
Again
Nah this is my destiny it was worth the agony to get the ecstasy

(Chorus)
We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me
You are my everything
I wanna run away with you
Do do do do do do do do

I never ever met a shorty that was quite like you
And even though it was wrong I fell in love with you
Now we sit here not really knowing what to do
But I'm sure that you know I'll give the world for you
If I could runaway with you I wouldn't even think twice
I promise girl I'll put it all on the line
I know forever seems to be a long time
But thats what I'm seeing when I look into your eyes
And it don't matter what your friends might say
Cuz I know deep inside you feel the same way
You could tell me what u want but I could read your mind
So quit lying to yourself and put ya hand in mine
I get excited everytime you come close
And being right here with you is what I love the most
So any time your feeling lonely inside
We could runaway together and leave this world behind

We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me
You are my everything
I wanna run away with you
Do do do do do do do do

Waking up in the morning and your still not there
Can't we runaway and escape somewhere
Missing your soft touch your lips next to mine
Holdin up your hands as you look in my eyes
What must of happened to the love we both felt inside
Emotions were strong and the feeling was right
Now we don't speak anymore you went your own way
If thats what loves about then I was mislead
Go ahead and take your time if thats what you need
My loves for you forever my heart for you bleeds
Things happen for a reason so I ask my self should I be strong
And wait or move on to someone else
I know you still love me I could feel it inside
You always kept it real no games no lies
If your ever feelin lonely feel the need to get away
Call me up I'll be there together we'll run away girl

Holla at you when I come off tour

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
I got this Spanish chica, she don't like me to roam
So she call me ""cabron"" plus ""maricon""
Said she likes to cook rice so she likes me home
I'm like, ""Un momento, mami, slow up your tempo""
I got this black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talking out her neck, making her fingers snap
She like: ""Listen, Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap
You better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me""
I got this French chick that love to French kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
""Ma cherie amour, tu es belle""
Merci, you're fine as fuck but you giving me hell
I got this Indian squaw, the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with: red dot or feather
She said: ""all you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough""
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian and black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken.. damn I'm getting fat

An appetite for destruction but I scrape the plate

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I got this young chick, she so immature
She like, why you don't buy me Reeboks no more
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick that plays her part
And if it goes down, y'all, that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the NARCs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma she's always on the scene
God damn she's fine but she parties all the time!
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
That means I'm new-school, pop pills and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first class seat

A hypochondriac who says ouch before I whip it out
Got a chick from Peru that sniff Peru
She got a cousin at customs that gets shit through
Got this weed head chick, she always catch me doing shit
Crazy girl.. wanna leave me but she always forgets
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick
'Cause she kept bootlegging my shit, man
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull
She like, ""Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?""
I'm like, ""Excuse me, Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
You was dead broke and naked, and now you want half""

My baby knows me better than I do
Funny how a woman has that over a man
I can do anything with her here beside me
Leaning on her is where I make my stand

[Chorus]
Where would we be without the love of a woman
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong
The true pure undying love of a woman
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone

[Verse 2]
My daddy was a wild one when he was younger
Everybody told my mama he'd be hard to tame
Full of himself he said 'sir' to nobody
But you oughta see him come a runnin' when mama calls his name

[Chorus]
Where would we be without the love of a woman
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong
The true pure undying love of a woman
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone

[Verse 3]
A man goes crazy trying to catch his feelings
Too much pride or maybe the words come out wrong
But that's okay 'cause he's still her hero
Steady as a rock, her love keeps rolling along

[Chorus]
Where would we be without the love of a woman
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong
The true pure undying love of a woman
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone

The doctor gave me 30 days
But I must have had my momma's will
And God's amazing grace

Even if this love's to die for
Because your bags are packed and I ain't crying
You're walking out and I'm not trying to change your mind
Because I was born to be

The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

[Verse 2]
I don't believe in self-pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
Though my life is changing fast
Who I am is who I want to be

The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed

Who loves her kids and never stops

It be a buck-fifty, your chance of runnin is infinte

When I surface, if not chips to Benz is the purpose
On your team I'll pull the curtain, a beautiful hurtin
'til my eyes see the blood, that mean the creep start workin
Niggas never learnin that they eyes keep lurkin
Have ya janitor pumpin your X5 murkin
Skid marks the street, your heart skips a beat
Beef? Nigga overcook that meat
Get no sleep, only rest is in between the blink
My life story was written in blood, permanent ink
Killer instinct, R.I.P. 'em
Gotta think like that cause forever I be needin 'em
Plan flawless, mistakes never repeatin 'em
Some love, some hate me, bitches in the head beatin 'em

Fiends are rushin when the mack blow, dead in my castle
And in the blink watch how quick life pass you

But wait, you don't think I live a pop life now
That's hate, you could get popped right now

And I'm a fuckin drama king like my nigga Kayslay

374,God Bless The USA,"[Verse 1]
If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away

[Chorus]
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston,
And New York to L.A
Well there's pride in every American heart
And its time we stand and say

[Chorus]
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free

And when I sleep you're, you're everywhere

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
Shit I ain't choose to rhyme; rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin' - like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now, but it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer? That sucks for you
'Cause this is Bubba's moment - I put my mother on it
I said my momma; it seems as if I love her don't it?
So buckle up, cause it's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's, and my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk - gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth; but ain't no joke inside
This is complicated - at least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million, then I'll call it quits
But until that day, y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw you crank it cause I just leap through you
What you need to do, is just admit you love me
The South has always been Dirty but now it's gettin' ugly

[Chorus]
Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
Though I am country, don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger, with every song I hear
'Cause y'all been bullshittin', spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days and came with somethin' that truly matters
On goes the saga - of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrow, if I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now; I hate it came to this
How else can I say it I don't speak no other languages
I'm fairly ripped now, so this the jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha? That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem' bows - fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just forget what we discussin'
This that new South - take a picture of me
'Cause I'm a fuckin' legend, and this is gettin' ugly

[Chorus]
Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Now this thang is jumpin' - ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special, this whole moment came from nothin'
Now you see it triples; I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets hatin' broads clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin' to live, you with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin', then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law - they can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions; I wanna see you wylin'
And if Bubba dies tonight - know he was smilin'

[Chorus]
Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

Ha ha, it's gon' get (uglyy - in here!)
Thck-thck (Huh, in here! Huh, in here!)
It's gon' get (ugly - in here!)

377,The Star Spangled Banner,"[Verse]
Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream
'Tis the star-spangled banner! O long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more
Their blood has wiped out their foul footstep's pollution
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation
Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation
Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust""
And the star-spangled banner forever shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave",Whitney Houston,Whitney Houston,2002,"[97, 80]",2
378,Never Too Far/Hero Medley,"[Verse 1]
You're with me
Til the bitter end
What we have transcends
This experience
Too painful to
Talk about
So I'll hold it in
Til my heart can mend
And be brave enough to love again

[Pre-Chorus]
A place in time
Still belongs to us
Stays preserved in my mind
In the memories there is solace

[Chorus 1]
Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
Always remember
Love

[Verse 2]
There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

[Chorus 2]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

[Bridge]
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

[Chorus 2]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

381,Where I Come From,"[Verse 1]
Well I was rolling wheels and shifting gears
Around that Jersey Turnpike
Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
Said sir you broke the limit in that rusty old truck
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from

[Chorus]
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

[Verse 2]
Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
The sign said finger-licking
Well I paid the tab and the lady asked me
How'd I like my biscuit
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it

[Chorus]
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

[Verse 3]
I was chasing sun on 101
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
Said no thanks ma'am, back home
We like the girls that sing soprano

[Chorus]
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

[Verse 4]
Well I was headed home on 65
Somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
That's rolling on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
No, but you might have seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa

[Chorus]
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

Where I come from it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of back porch picking
Where I come from trying to make a living
Working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from

Staring up at heaven

While the storm clouds gather far across the sea
Let us swear allegiance to a land that's free
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair, as we
Raise our voices in a solemn prayer

Stand beside her and guide her
Through the night with a light from above
From the mountains, to the prairies
To the oceans white with foam
