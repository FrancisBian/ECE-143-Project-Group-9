Eric beat me to it
Or should I call him Killmonger ?
No, that is stupid
Thought I could defeat Thanos
But he’s purple and big
And when he snapped his fingers
Everyone disappeared

First it was Bucky
Then all of my people
And then it was me
This guy’s just evil
And then we lost Groot
I feel bad for rocket
He’s just a raccoon
Who kept it solid

Wasn’t feeling so good
Heard he said it to Tony
Thought he needed a sandwich
That boy's pretty boney
But it turned out he was fading too
That poor little dude
The infinity gauntlet
Has some powerful jewels

One controls time
One controls space
And one controls mind
That shit’s amazing

One day I’ll come back to Earth
Take a walk through Uganda
When I make it back home
I’ll shout this is Wakanda
Then I’ll kiss Nakia on her face
I’ll get me a taste
I will hug her so tightly
I will leave her no space

That was a joke
She needs her space
And she needs her time
But I stay chasin’

1,Without Me,"[Verse 1]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)

Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke

Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose

3,Happier,"[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but

9,Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree,"[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way",Brenda Lee,Brenda Lee,2018,"[11, 18, 21, 23, 36, 30]",6
10,A Holly Jolly Christmas,"(Ding-dong-ding)
(Ding-dong-ding)

(Ding-dong-ding) Have a holly jolly Christmas
(Ding-dong-ding) It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer

(Ding-dong-ding) Have a holly jolly Christmas
(Ding-dong-ding) And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me

(Ding-dong-ding) Have a holly jolly Christmas
(Ding-dong-ding) And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year

Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me

(Ding-dong-ding) Have a holly jolly Christmas
(Ding-dong-ding) And in case you didn't here
Oh, by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year

11,Jingle Bell Rock,"[Verse 1]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now, the jingle hop has begun

[Verse 2]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

[Bridge]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

[Verse 2]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

[Bridge]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

[Outro]
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock",Bobby Helms,Bobby Helms,2018,"[13, 15, 26, 33, 50]",5

Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

Uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Khalid]
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2: Halsey]
17, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned 23
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

You probably thik that you are better now, better now
You always say that cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Would've gave you anything, would have gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that cause your not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Would've gave you anything, would have gave you everything (whoa)

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speaking to my friends, no
You know all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow them out and open your eyes
We were looking forward for the rest of your lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rolling, rolling, rolling
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinking handy but I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this (get this) outta my head

I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool

Another foreign for a bigger chain
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better things

21,Lucid Dreams,"[Chorus]
I still see your crosshairs in my zoom
Can't take back the kills that you gave me
It’s to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot buff you
So I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were my guns
Listening to my heart instead of my head
I found a tactical
Double pump was magical
I will never forget you
[x2]

[Verse 1]
You took too long to switch up
Now I'm in my grave
You know that they want me dead
I take space crystals to make me fly far away
I know it's all in my head
I have double pump dreams where I can’t get a hit
Thinking of you when I die
You were my everything
Thinking of trippling
Now I'm just better off dead

[Verse 2]
I'd do it over again
I didn't want them to nerf it
Watch it throw me the game
I should've switched to the tac
Did it all in the past
But I want it to last
You were made out of glitches (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew broke guns had the best kill rate
You gave me a way that was full of mistakes
I gave you my time and you wasted it

[Bridge]
You made my aim break
You made my wins fake
You made my aim break
You made my wins fake
You made my aim break
You made my wins fake
You made my aim break again

Can't take back the kills that you gave me

They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history""

I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, got me bending sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz

I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits

I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks
Where I’m from we don’t say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top
I made a million off socks
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
Locked up, they fighting with locks
Locked up, they swinging they knifes
I can't be living this life
No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice
My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace
I'll show you I'm destined to get it
I be outside with the glizzy
Toting that fire, I be trippin'
I just might die how I'm livin'
Ain't take no bath, but I'm drippin'
Niggas ain't catching me slipping, ayy, yeah
I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag is terrific (Glee, glee)
Ain't seen my dad in a minute
But I can't be mad, I got millions
I just pulled up in a lemon

Fuck a protest, let's start a fight in here
I just stepped up in the party, all my snipers here
I be rocking Tom Ford, poppin' Molly, though
Now I'm eatin' calamari, no more sloppy joe
Choke sandwich in my mansion, tryna save for dinner
I'ma start a moshpit in the Staples Center
All you niggas bitter, it's alright, though
Codeine in my liver, I'm sippin' hydro
I'm blowin' nitro, smokin' jetpack
Hatin' on a street nigga, can't respect that
I wanna jump out in a crowd, but I be scared to do it
'Cause if they pull on me the wrong way, I'ma go to shootin'

Yeah, red bottom kicks, I feel like stompin' in here
No oatmeal and grits, I'm eatin' codfish in here

54,You Say,"[Verse 1]
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You, I find my worth; in You, I find my identity

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Bridge]
Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God
You'll have every victory

You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing

57,Be Alright,"[Verse 1]
I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look, said I was gettin' some head, get-gettin' some head
Ran down on a bitch, she almost pissed on her leg
Bitches think they fuckin' with me, must be sick in the head
Why don't you chill with the beef and get some chicken instead?
Got the crown, shut it down, have them hype up in the 6
If she dead, let her lay, won't bring no life into this bitch
Lookin' this good should be a sin, you should call me cinnamon
Cardi B, bad bitch, those is fuckin' synonyms
We see who winnin' (See who winnin'), we see who got it (See who got it)
You see I'm still in the bank makin' deposits (Cash)
You see who switched up sides and who was solid (Who was solid)
You see who stuck to the code and who forgot it
Talk about it, bitch

Yeah, but now I don't stay near as long

Like He use me as his vessel, like He use me as an instrument

They want me slingin' metal like the Devil, but I'm Heaven-sent

Presiento un problema
Yo soy servicial con sus deseos

78,This Is It,"[Verse 1]
Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high
There's a trail through the trees to a cliff where Carolina meets the sky
Oh, and there's a view I just can't describe
No, we're not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait
Okay, you can open your eyes

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know that you've been waiting and talking to your friends
Wondering if and wondering where and wondering when
Well, I've been waiting too, holding on to this ring
For the right words to say, for the right time and place, for me to get on one knee

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world here together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, well this is it
This is it

[Bridge]
Now you're walking down the aisle
And I can't help but smile

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, it's what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, I can see forever
So take my hand, just take it in (Take it in)
This is a moment we won't forget (Won't forget)
On top of the world, here, together
Surrounded by our family and our friends
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss
This is it
Yeah, this is it",Scotty McCreery,Scotty McCreery,2018,"[84, 96]",2

More drank, more smoke, and more cars

Look, I ain't tryna throw no shade
'Cause I can't see 'em in my lane
As long as my rent gettin' paid
I can care less what a bitch think (huh)

Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?
Okay
Yeah, yeah
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

[Verse 3]
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

84,The Christmas Song,"[Verse 1]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nippin' at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Bridge]
They know that Santa’s on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Refrain]
And so I’m offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Piano Break]

[Refrain]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas—

[Outro]
Oh, merry Christmas
Oh, merry Christmas to you",Lauren Daigle,Lauren Daigle,2018,[90],1
85,Envy Me,"[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep (Now I lay me down to sleep), ayy
I pray the Lord my soul to keep (I pray the Lord my soul to keep), yeah, ayy
Like a locksmith, I got the keys (Like a locksmith, I got the keys), yeah, ayy
Pull up, make opp niggas bleed (Pull up, make opp niggas bleed), yeah, ayy
I got water like overseas, yeah, ayy (Overseas)
Bitch, I ball like NBA (Bitch, I ball like NBA), yeah, ayy
Bitch, I ball like MVP (Bitch, I ball like MVP), yeah, ayy
I got money, they envy me (I got money, they envy me)

[Verse]
I'm with the gang, I'm with the mob, what was you thinkin'?
Remember them days, and that shit was hard, a nigga been thinkin' (Yeah)
I put a four in a twenty ounce, a nigga been drinkin' (Yeah)
If you with the squad, I give you my heart, lil' nigga, I mean it (Yeah)
I was fighting some demons, in the field, bitch, I'm deep in (Deep in)
I was raised in the deep end (Deep end), I know niggas be sinkin' (Sinkin')
Take your bitch and go deep in, but I gave her back, why you tweakin'? (Tweakin')
Come around with that rah-rah, we leave you dead on the cement (On the cement)
With the gang, we ain't playing fair
Matter fact, we don't play at all
OG 'Woods in the air
But we bought the Runtz so we smoke it all
Putting on a front, boy, you better fall
We gon' kill 'em dead, we gon' kill 'em all
Might spend a ten when I'm in the mall
I was on the bend with it in my drawers
Hit that smoke and I'm blackin' (Blackin')
Hit that smoke and I black out
If he run, blow his back down
I was gone but I'm back now
These niggas gon' fold, but I never back down
In the school, I was trappin' (Trappin')
In the school, you was class clown (Class clown)

[Chorus]
Ayy, now I lay me down to sleep, ayy
I pray the Lord my soul to keep, yeah, ayy
Like a locksmith, I got the keys, yeah, ayy
Pull up, make opp niggas bleed, yeah, ayy
I got water like overseas, yeah, ayy
Bitch, I ball like NBA, yeah, ayy
Bitch, I ball like MVP, yeah, ayy
I got money, they envy me",Calboy,Calboy,2018,[91],1
86,Yosemite,"[Chorus: Gunna]
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed
Two-tone Patek
In the Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVS's on me got my Gucci shirt wet
Put a M in my bag, gon' get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when it end with a S

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down, where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number fours
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watching my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said I'll be there in 10 but I got there in four

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
I left her wide open, no self control
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Took nothing but five minutes, she hopped in and drove
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm

[Chorus: Gunna & Travis Scott]
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed (Yeah!)
Two-tone Pateks
In the Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVS's on me got my Louis shirt wet
It's a M in my bag, I'ma get used to these racks (used)
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when it end with a S

[Outro: NAV]
La Flame on a island, me and Cash, Gunna hopped on a Learjet
Got Pradas every color and I got CC's you ain't seen yet
Said I'd kick the cup and now I'm asking, ""Where the codeine at?""
30 pointers and up, Eliantte drippin', my whole team wet",Travis Scott,Travis Scott,2018,"[92, 100, 84, 85, 86, 79, 58, 53, 43, 25]",10

88,Good Form,"[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Eardrummers
Mhm, Young Money, uh huh, mhm
Yo, espere, espera, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm

[Verso 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, espere, espere, espere, ok, espere
Você vê uma vadia má chegando, ei, qual o problema?
Eu estou sendo notícia, eu e a Nunu quando eu chego
Eu digo ao manobrista: Estacione o meu Benz e traga o baseado
Yo, espere, espere, espere, ok, espere
Ele me vê linda toda vez que ele passa minhas fotos
Talvez eu deixo a arma te acertar se você aprontar
Agora ponha as mãos para o alto, é um assalto
Me passe o dinheiro

[Pós-Verso: Nicki Minaj]
Porque eu tenho sido a vadia má, Barbie Tingz
Exibindo o corpão, todo mundo fica em cima do meu pau
Eu tenho que ser franca, chupe um pau se você duvidou de mim
Sem parar, sem parar, sem parar, sem parar
Quem tá incomodando a Barbie? Quem tá incomodando a Barbie Todo mundo
Oh, você tem que ver, honestamente, na minha odisseia
Eu sou a pior vadia, eu nem sei como falar
Coloque o boné pra trás e relaxe, você está no fundo de um Sedã

[Pré-Refrão: Nicki Minaj]
A vadia tem mais moedas do que uma sala de jogos
Então nunca vamos odiar os tabloides
Eu deixo os meus filhos na sala de recreação
Pra que a gente não se encontre no mesmo espaço

[Refrão: Nicki Minaj]
Eu digo pra ele comer o biscoito, pois é bom para ele
E quando ele come o biscoito, fica em boa forma
Ele sabe que eu nunca traio, pois sou boa para ele
Talvez eu tenha filhos dele, as enfermeiras gritam ""empurre"" pra ele
Eu deixo ele comer o biscoito, pois é bom para ele
E sempre que ele come o biscoito, ele fica em boa forma
E quando eu monto nele, eu faço gostoso
Eu fico tipo: ""Oh, ele me ama, oh, ele me ama"", bom pra ele
Vamos, vamos, vamos
Eu fico tipo: ""Oh, ele me ama, oh, ele me ama"", bom pra ele
Vamos

[Verso 2: Nicki Minaj]
Eu tiro o top tão rápido que pago peitinho
Então ele tenta meter igual a um carro capotando
Eu fico lambendo só pra limpar com esse punho
E quando eu deixo minhas vadias, todas nós dizemos: Beijinho, beijinho
Eu estou vestindo o novo De La Renta, parecendo o Pernalonga
Pois tudo que quero são os quilates e muito dinheiro de droga
Eu só sou leal àqueles que atiram pra mim
Isso é um assalto, me passe o dinheiro

[Pós-Verso: Nicki Minaj]
Porque eu tenho sido a vadia má, Barbie Tingz
Exibindo o corpão, todo mundo fica em cima do meu pau
Eu tenho que ser franca, chupe um pau se você duvidou de mim
Sem parar, sem parar, sem parar, sem parar
Quem tá incomodando a Barbie? Quem tá incomodando a Barbie Todo mundo
Oh, você tem que ver, honestamente, na minha odisseia
Eu sou a pior vadia, eu nem sei como falar
Coloque o boné pra trás e relaxe, você está no fundo de um Sedã

[Pré-Refrão: Nicki Minaj]
A vadia chama mais atenção que um teclado
Antes de você me chupar, use uma joelheira
Eu mexo nas cordas como num saquinho de chá
Estou exibindo minha joia brincando de estátua

[Refrão: Nicki Minaj]
Eu digo pra ele comer o biscoito, pois é bom para ele
E quando ele come o biscoito, fica em boa forma
Ele sabe que eu nunca traio, pois sou boa para ele
Talvez eu tenha filhos dele, as enfermeiras gritam ""empurre"" pra ele
Eu deixo ele comer o biscoito, pois é bom para ele
E sempre que ele come o biscoito, ele fica em boa forma
E quando eu monto nele, eu faço gostoso
Eu fico tipo: ""Oh, ele me ama, oh, ele me ama"", bom pra ele
Vamos, vamos, vamos
Eu fico tipo: ""Oh, ele me ama, oh, ele me ama"", bom pra ele
Vamos

[Verso 3: Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Barbie (Sim?), eu acho você anormal (Ooh)
Eu acho você estilosa, essas outras vadias são aprendizes (Haha)
Quando você faz sua bunda pular como as batidas do meu coração
E se você me deixar comer sua buceta, então será a semana do tubarão
""Olá, queria falar com o Tunechi?"" ""Posso saber quem está falando?""
Todo mundo tem um suco sem uma jarra pra colocá-lo
Eu quero ter e comer o bolo, e depois eu já estou faminto
Eu me sinto o Adão, mas estou prestes a comer a maçã em cima de você
Relógio no lado certo, agora vocês estão no meu tempo
Por favor, saia de cima do meu pau, antes que ele exploda
Os olhos parecendo que eu estou em algum lugar de Taiwan
Chapado pra caralho como sempre, oi, mãe
Olha cara, eu darei um chute na sua bunda com os meus sapatos sofisticados
Seja meu tamborete
Disse ao meu advogado pra só me ligar se tiver boas notícias
Daí meu telefone começou a tocar fora do gancho, que preguiça

[Saída: Nicki Minaj & Lil Wayne]
Porque eu tenho sido a vadia má, Young Money é um exército
Ele não curte brinquedos, mas ele transa com a Barbie
É o presidente, Mônica é como eles me chamam
Nicki, a ninja, Nicki, a patroa
Nicki, a Harajuku, ah
Remix, baby

89,Millionaire,"[Chorus 1]
They say ""Love is more precious than gold""
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

[Verse 1]
I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep, as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She made me a millionaire

[Verse 2]
When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say ""That boy is sure livin' in luxury""
Sweet luxury

[Chorus 2]
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

[Chorus 2]
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire",Chris Stapleton,Chris Stapleton,2018,"[95, 96, 96]",3

Talkin' relationship goals, this could be us, yuh

Preservation of the peace, an ideal world

Hangin' pictures like niggas swingin' from his dick
We so different, you thought these didn't exist (M-M)
The Megalodon never seen on his wrist
I'm from the South where they never make it this rich
God is the greatest, but Satan been on his shit
Walkin' the pavement, I pray I'm illuminated
Over a decade and never nobody's favorite
Pot and kilo go hand in hand like we Gamble and Huff
My amigo, a million grams and we countin' 'em up (M-M)
You was dead broke, I let you hold a pack
You paid for it, but I fucked around and stole the track
Screaming ""gang gang,"" now you wanna rat
Racketeering charges caught him on a tap
Lookin' for a bond, lawyers wanna tax
Purple hair got them faggots on your back
(M-M-Maybach music)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, ""I need you""
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, ""I need you""
Stay up, I know these times ain't true
Real life, what's free? (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Fed investigations, heard they plottin' like I trap
20 mill' in cash, they know I got that off of rap
Maybe it's the Michael Rubins or the Robert Krafts
Or the billionaire from Marcy, and the way they got my back, uh
See how I prevailed now they try to knock me back, uh
Locked me in a cell for all them nights and I won't snap, uh
Two-fifty a show and they still think I'm sellin' crack, uh
When you bring my name up to the judge, just tell him facts
Tell him how we fundin' all these kids to go to college
Tell him how we ceasin' all these wars, stoppin' violence
Tryna fix the system and the way that they designed it
I think they want me silenced (Shush)
Oh, say you can see, I don't feel like I'm free
Locked down in my cell, shackled from ankle to feet
Judge bangin' that gavel, turned me to slave from a king
Another day in the bing, I gotta hang from a string
Just for poppin' a wheelie, my people march through the city
From a cell to a chopper, view from the top of the city
You can tell how we rockin', soon as I pop up we litty
Poppin' like Bad Boy in '94, Big Poppa and Diddy
And niggas counted me out like my accountant ain't busy
That's five milli' in twenties, sit up and count 'til I'm dizzy
Phantom 500 thousand, hundred round in a stizzy
Is we beefin' or rappin'? I might just pop up with Drizzy like

[Chorus: Meek Mill & JAY-Z]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, ""I need you""
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, ""I need you""
Stay up, I know these times ain't true (Run it down)
Real life, what's free?

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
In the land of the free, where the blacks enslaved
Three-fifths of a man, I believe's the phrase
I'm 50% of D'USSÉ and it's debt free (Yeah)
100% of Ace of Spades, worth half a B (Uh)
Roc Nation, half of that, that's my piece
Hunnid percent of TIDAL to bust it up with my Gs, uh
'Cause most of my niggas won't ever work together
You run a check up but they never give you leverage
No red hat, don't Michael and Prince me and 'Ye
They separate you when you got Michael and Prince's DNA, uh
I ain't one of these house niggas you bought
My house like a resort, my house bigger than yours
My spou- (Come on, man)
My route better, of course
We started without food in our mouth
They gave us pork and pig intestines
Shit you discarded that we ingested, we made the project a wave
You came back, reinvested and gentrified it
Took niggas' sense of pride, now how that's free?
And them people stole the soul and hit niggas with 360s, huh
I ain't got a billion streams, got a billion dollars
Inflating numbers like we 'posed to be happy about this
We was praisin' Billboard, but we were young
Now I look at Billboard like, ""Is you dumb?""
To this day, Grandma 'fraid what I might say
They gon' have to kill me, Grandmama, I'm not they slave
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, check out the bizarre (Ah)
Rappin' style used by me, the H-O-V
Look at my hair free, carefree, niggas ain't near free
Enjoy your chains, what's your employer name with the hairpiece?
I survived the hood, can't no Shaytan rob me
My accountant's so good, I'm practically livin' tax free
Factory, that's me
Sold drugs, got away scot-free
That's a CC, E-copy
Guilt free, still me
And expect me to not feel a way to this day
You would say y'all killed me
Sucker free, no shuckin' me, I don't jive turkey
Say ""Happy Thanksgiving,"" shit sound like a murder to me
Smoke free, all of y'all callin' out toll free
Label rob you for millions yet you wanna put a hole in me
Sugar free, seasoned but I'm salt free
You lay a hand on Hov, my shooter shoot for free
I promise World War Three
Send a order through a hands free
Kill you in 24 hours or shorter, you can't ignore the hand speed
On god, it's off the head, this improv but it's no comedy

Tant de haine au sommet, c'est un endroit solitaire
Quand tu te rends compte que tes ennemis ne sont pas les seuls serpents
Et ton épouse ne sait que ce que tu n'effaces pas
Le monde ne te connaît que par tes pires erreurs
Alors, casse leur le cul, c'est le seul moyen
Pied au plancher sur Stony, hey
Se crasher et revenir avec un visage gonflé
Et quand je suis sur la route, X tiens-moi la porte
On terrorise, on ne négocie pas
Si t'es qu'une pute, on s'associera pas
J'viens à ton anniversaire si tu me dois du gâteau
Avec un masque noir, c'est comme ça qu'on exfolie
Alors pardonnez-moi, mon cœur est en travers du chemin
Je suis mon instinct, il n'y a pas de logique en Ye
C'est tout ce que je dis, s'il se trouve dans une affaire
Avant de le mettre en prison, comme mettre un chien en cage
Pas d'effets de l'âge, non je ne pourris pas
Tu es sombre comme ces jours, et tu t'es fait avoir
Parce que les cercueils sont déposés sous une pierre tombale
Parce que même quand tu mourras, ils jetteront toujours la pierre sur ta tombe
Alors suis le troupeau, tu ne peux digérer la haine
Mon esprit l'emporte sur tout ce qu'un érudit pourrait dire
Je ne sais pas comment me comporter, nous on sort des raves
Disloquer un bras, il suffit de le mettre en place
Parce que les damnés, ne le sont pas, toute la douleur et angoisse
Ont fait de moi l'homme que je suis, donc je ne me plains pas
Ces choses sont en train de changer, plus de lames qui tombe
Il n'y a plus de célébrité, il n'y a pas de honte à se moquer
Elle veut te donner le cookie, espèce de Famous Amos
Elle t'a donné sa chatte, mais t'as pas payé pour son anus
Maintenant ton nom est entaché par les plaintes qu'ils dépeignent
L'accusé est coupable, personne ne blâme le plaignant
Je dois le dire en termes simples, pendant que vous attendez les inculpations
Parce que si le jury a dit que t'es coupable, l'addition est salée
Donnez-moi une minute, ma meuf vient de s'évanouir
Mon bébé pleure, tu comprends ce que je dis ?

I remember I had walked home that day
Content with all my misery
Told myself it'd get better, no clue what there was next for me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather
But the summer rays were kissing me, I—
I was lost

[Verse 1]
So I took a different path
In the distance he awaited me
Had no weapon, I'm guessin' his hands were just enough for me
Was no question, I'm guessin' he laughed just at the sight of me
I was lost

I was lost

[Verse 2]
And there he was, his presence was alarming
As he approached, was casual, we talked 'bout self-harming
He told me, ""Kid, you shouldn't be walkin' on your own""
He smiled and laughed, and pat my back
He asked, ""How far are you from home?""
I said, ""Maybe 30 minutes""
His frequency distorted quick, I seen it in his image

You ever woke up on a train track, with no motherfuckin' clothes on?
Death before your eyes, you prayin' to God, but ain't no response
Tryna scream for hope, just a shoulder that you can lean on
But ain't nobody comin', so you scream on and scream on and scream on
While this evil fuck laugh at you
Train getting closer, you still surprised that he battered you
Tears falling harder and harder, minutes get minuscule
Could've had a son or a daughter, now what you finna do?
You finna die here on this train track
'Cause clearly after death, ain't no way you can find your way back
Thinking 'bout your previous memories, going way back
All them fucking dreams 'bout a diamond chain and a Maybach
Now your time finally up
Ask yourself this final question, is you going down or up?
Recollectin' all the moments that you never gave a fuck

If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I heard you said I ain't the type for you
I don't regret it though, I learned from it
They should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us (Woo)
Took you out when I had no money
Only person that you ever cared about was you, that's why it's so funny
You want somebody that'll keep you warm at night
Then, tell me, why you actin' cold to me?
You ain't the only one to blame, no, I'm the one that made you rich
When I bought every lie you sold to me
Yeah, heard you threw away the pictures
But you still got the memories of us
So I guess I don't really make a difference
Flippin' through 'em in your head
Got you texting me all hours of the night
Yeah, you told me that you needed distance
What's the deal with you?
You say you want a man that keeps it real
Then why you mad when I get real with you?
You want someone to pay the bills for you
Went from feelin' you, now I feel for you, liar

I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?

[Verse 2]
Look, let me guess, you want to stay friends?
Tellin' people that's how we been?
Tellin' everybody, yeah, that we was barely speakin'
Ah, that's kinda funny, why'd you call me every day then?
It's immaturity, you goin' off the deep end
You just want somebody you can chill and get some drinks with, cool
Then don't hit me on the weekend
Tellin' me you missed the way we talked and how I listen, yeah
Why you playin' with my mind, huh?
Why you playin' with my time, huh?
Told me, ""We should let it go and put it all behind us""
That's what I did, now you askin' me what I done, I was
Waitin' for this day, I saw it comin'
I think you just like attention, tryna tell me all your problems
I got issues of my own, I ain't got time for all this drama
You told me that you don't really wanna talk—then why you callin', huh?

When the bitch get to sparkin', it'll hit a nigga's spleen, boy
Too much powerslidin' make a nigga lean, boy

Ich weiß noch nicht einmal, so ""Wieso habe ich sie gefickt?""

Ain't this what they've been waitin' for?
You ready? Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
And the matter of time I spent on some locked-up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
Seen my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, ""Yeah, I do""
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said achoo
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please, 'fore them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lion-hearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawlin', went straight to walkin', with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches ménagin', fuckin', suckin' and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga, I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flyer
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater, rest in peace
Hater, rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga, and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga!

Hold up, wait a minute (Minute), y'all thought I was finished? (Whoa)
When I bought that Aston Martin, y'all thought it was rented? (Yeah)
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm lieutenant
I’m the type to count a million cash then grind like I’m broke
That Lambo my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
'Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no
All I know is murder, when it come to me
I got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOA's, I done did the KOD's
Every time I'm in that bitch, I get to throwin' 30 G's

If you ain't about that murder game, then pussy nigga, shut up!
If you diss me in your raps I'll get yo' pussy-ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet like that little engine I could
Boy, I slide down on your block (Block), bike on 12 o'clock (Rah)
And they be throwin' deuces on the same nigga they watch (Meek Milly)
And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still callin' them shots
And these lames talkin' that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids, that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin' on me, hoes waitin' on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money, have yo' friends turn in yo' enemies
And when there’s beef, I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go for 40, ain't no 10 a key
Hold up, broke nigga turned rich (Rich), love the game like Mitch

I knew about it and I-
Wanted to tell him, I felt funny as ever
But when I told him, he went runnin' to tell her, damn
Remember I was down bad, I'm talkin' under the cellar
Now the Rolls Royces come with umbrellas
For the rain and all the pain that we been through

Catch a case, pay a lawyer, take a deal money
Now you tapped out and got no appeal money
Callin' home like niggas done did you wrong
But when you had that money you could've put niggas on
And the moment they put cuffs on you, your bitch was gone

I'm that nigga, but I never got my head up my ass
You doin' good, but I'm ready for bad
And you won't never catch me frontin' 'cause I'm used to bein' second to last

Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
All the young'uns in my hood popping percs now
Gettin' high to get by, it's gettin' worse now
You gotta tell 'em put them guns and them percs down
Them new jails got ten yards in 'em and that's your first down, uh
And I ain't come here to preach
I just had to say somethin' 'cause I'm the one with the reach
Youngin' gotta quarter ounce, he tryna turn into Meech
Ain't had no daddy, he's had to learn from the streets
I used to be a honor roll student, damn
Then I turned to a beast
The first time I seen a nigga get some blood on his sneaks
He had on Air Max 93s but was slumped in the street
His mama cryin', that did somethin' to me, oh Lord
The shit I'm doin' for my hood I won't get an award
I used to sell Reggie, damn how' I get to the Forbes?
I take a shot, if I miss I'm gettin' them boards
Ain't quittin' no more, like give me some more
We wearing Old Navy, it felt like Christian Dior
Was dead broke but rich in soul, was we really that poor?
Was we really that dumb? 'Cause we carry a gun
And every nigga in my neighborhood carryin' one
'Cause we had nightmares of our mamas gotta bury her son
I'm speakin' to you as a prophet as rare as they come, uh
Gunshots sound like music hangin' out the Buick
Why you wanna be a shooter?
Mama told me not to do it but I did it
Now I'm locked up in a prison
Callin' mama like ""I shouldn't have did it""
Watch my dream shatter in an instant
I'm on a visit posin' for the picture
Like I'm going for my prom or somethin'
Like I ain't facing time or somethin'
Ridin' for these niggas like that shit ain't hurt my mom or somethin'
Only one gon' get me commissary or even buy me somethin'
When it all fall down
I can't call y'all now
Even if I hit your phone
That won't get me home
Seen so many different times, these niggas did me wrong
Shit that's the reason that I did this song

[Verse 2]
Shit we was kids used to play on the step
A couple years later we flirtin' with the angel of death
I was 11 years old, I got my hands on the TEC
When I first touched it that shit gave me a rush
My homie's dying I'm like ""Maybe we next""
That just made me a threat
Knowin' the niggas smoke my daddy it just made me upset
Made me a man shit I was five when God gave me my test
Go to court with a court appointed and he won't say he objects
Now it's you against the state and you ain't got no cake
Jail overpopulated they ain't got no space
I know a young'un that got murked ain't get to drive no Wraith
But he in the hearse on the way to church, I know his mom gon' faint
When she smell like embalment fluid, cologne all on her baby
Pastor said he sendin' you home, she goin' crazy
When they drop that casket all in the ground, who gon' save me?
How could you blame me? When I'm tryna stay alive and just survive and beat them odds when niggas die by twenty-five
When I stop fearin' for my life, when I decide to change my mind And stop totin'
Tryna smoke the pain away, they lock us up for smoking
Put 'em on probation, lock 'em up if you ain't perfect
Victim to the system like a rain drop in the ocean
They closin' all the schools and all the prisons gettin' open

[Outro]
Yeah
See comin' from where I come from
We had to beat the streets
Beat the system, beat racism, beat poverty
And now we made it through all that we at the championship",Meek Mill,Meek Mill,2018,[70],1

Cook that shit up, Quay

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with shawty, know she’ll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' ’em hell
She ain't tryna go with me, I'ma pay her
I crush a lot, baby girl, I'm a player
Connect the dots then I plug up the scale
If we get caught, they gon' give me the chair
Fuck the law, make 'em earn what they pay 'em

[Verse 1]
Ain't no back and forth with no bitches, this ain’t tennis
Rolls Royce truck, bitch, it ain’t rented
And they braggin' ’bout bitches, I promise we hit 'em
I flooded my wrist, let the bros split a million
At this point I'm heartless I ain't got no feelings
Buy every building in the hood for my children
Like a Drake song, got your vibe feelin’ groovy
With no phone, we can make us a movie
I ain't in my bag, I still got my feet out
If we wanted smoke with y'all, you couldn't be out
Free the bros, buy my shit off the kiosk
I'm at the vibe with the spot, this the creep house
Lil' shawty suck it like she just took her teeth out
Five percent tint on the whip, you can't see out
Ready to set it off, Queen Latifah
These niggas talk like bitches, see what they be 'bout

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with shawty, know she'll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' 'em hell
She ain't tryna go with me, I'ma pay her
I crush a lot, baby girl, I'm a player
Connect the dots then I plug up the scale
If we get caught, they gon' give me the chair
Fuck the law, make 'em earn what they pay 'em

[Verse 2]
Ain't no complaining, money coming in
Put it all up, do it all again
First you get a mil', then it's times ten
Youngest out the crew, AMG Benz
Stand up like a man, take it on the chin
They got consequences in this life of sin
Laugh about it, go in Gucci, spend a ten
When you come home, we gon' all win
Go in any club and make it thunderstorm, this shit reckless
He gon' knock you off with his Rollie on
Drive the Rolls Royce like a hotbox, really came from nothin'
Only ride with my security because I can't be armed
Can't get caught with another gun
They gon' know me when I'm gone
They hear my pain inside my songs
It's like a switch, I cut it on
Pills kick in, gettin' in my zone
Do my job, ain't see no wrong
I'm never talkin' on them phones
Feds gon' try to do us wrong
Man, they got my nigga Long
Lately I just been alone
My cup, my strap, this microphone
Nobody know what's goin on
Just glad I made it off the road
Granddaddy showed me life is a gamble
Ever since I been on them dice
They gon' suck it up like a bowl of rice
I'ma give it to them niggas every time

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with shawty, know she'll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' 'em hell
She ain't tryna go with me, I'ma pay her

126,Oodles O' Noodles Babies,"[Intro]
This shit right here for my Oodles o' Noodles babies
His ma’ smoked the crack while she was pregnant so he can't even help that he crazy
He goin' to jail, it’s inevitable, forreal

[Verse 1]
I ain't have nobody to give me no hope
I hope my momma ain't doin' no coke
I used to wish that my daddy was livin'
I had a dream that I seen him as ghost
I used to act up when I went to school
Thought it was cool, but I really was hurt
Wanted my family to come to my games
My mama couldn't make it 'cause she was at work
Lived with my grandma, she took me to church
Really no I ain't wanna go
Remember I kissed my aunt in the casket
And her forehead was cold
I was like 4 years old
We couldn’t afford no clothes
It was hand me down
Who would think a nigga get a Grammy now?
Got a black judge tryna tear me down
All this jail time probably wear me down
Turn the lights off in the bathroom
Screaming, ""Bloody, Bloody, Bloody Mary"" now
Havin’ nightmares about Candyman
With the tool on me like a handyman
Killed my lil' cousin, I’m like, ""Damn it, man""
Had to see the footage on a camera, man
On the pavement, with his brains out
With the white sheet, he was laid out
Wanna ask 'Ye, ""Is this a choice?""
It was like this when I came out
What the fuck is you really complaining 'bout?
I know niggas that's never gon’ make it out
This that shit you won't see in the media
Poor get poorer and the rich gettin' greedier
Lot of daddies goin' back and forth out of jail
Lot of sons growin' up and repeating them
This the belly of the beast, you won't make it out
Man, this shit was designed just to eat us up
And my momma told, ""Nigga, keep it up
You gon' end up in prison, just sweepin' up""
Remember, nobody never believed in us
When they see us now, they can't believe it's us, no

[Interlude]
I think it's funny how
We used to go to school, play SEGA's
And then, next thing you know, you runnin' 'round with Glock .40s
We ain't never believed in the police, they was shootin' us

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they called it the projects, they put us in projects
What they gon' do with us? Can't call the cops yet
You might just get popped at
'Cause they the ones shootin' us
I'm on my mom's steps, it's like a bomb threat
The violence pursuing us, I ain't meet God yet
'Cause I'm on the block where
It's just me and Lucifer, look what they do to us
They know we in poverty
When I went to court, the judge said, ""Meek, you a menace to society""
Huh, you said, you would give me a chance, your honor, why would you lie to me?
16 more years of probation, you know you gon' get some more time on me, huh
Whole hood goin' crazy, babies havin' babies
She was fourteen, actin' like she eighty
Got pregnant by a nigga that was locked up in them cages
And the story goes on, if you make it, you amazing (Word up)

[Outro]
See, I got homie that's a billionaire
And I be tryin' to explain it to him like
If your mom ain't on crack or if she got a job and she doing eight hours a day
And your daddy in the graveyard or in the jail cell, who the fuck gon' babysit?",Meek Mill,Meek Mill,2018,[85],1

Bought her baby Gucci strollers (Strollers)

Can't play around, I had to grow up (Grow up)
Check out my neck, hell of a glo-up (Glo-up)
These niggas cap and that shit blow up
My dawg rappin', hope he blow up
I need my checks without no hold-ups
I put my city on my shoulders
I told the truth in every story that I told 'em
I fucked around and showed 'em

[Verse 1]
All of my whips got that new car smell
Don't get it twisted, from the 'partments, I just park well
I don't fuck with him, that nigga flawed, send him to voicemail
Catch up with him, push up on him, tell him how we all feel
Made myself a millionaire, only took a year, dawg
Thinkin' bout what I been through, I can make a tear fall
Late night with them youngins, we was creepin', could've killed y'all
We ain't gon' do that internet beefin', that's for bitches, dawg
I went up to space so they hatin', they can't lift off
I can make your bitch eat my kids, every drip drop
I come from trenches, we can't come outside in flip flops
I done came so far, sittin' on the floor, watchin' the tip-off

It broke my heart but I didn't quit
I had to ball with no assist

Go with his move, he gon' get flipped (Yeah)
I had to hustle for a meal, yeah
And now I'm hustling in these M's, yeah
Gave Jock and Dee 200 years
Whenever they call, I let 'em hear
Them lawyers I got gon' lift they spirit
Them niggas know I keep it real, yeah
Sometimes I feel like the floor is giving in on me
I work so hard but I can't stop 'cause they depend on me
I tried to holler, she didn't talk, but now her friend want me
I see through all, and my life flawed, need no lens on us

[Verse 1]
Word on the street, they got a lil' bitty hit out
Really run Atlanta, I can make a nigga get out
If anything, I have more respect for you bitches
Nigga, you a bitch, we don't shoot and miss (Nah)
Glock-19 unfold and it spit out
Double R underneath the door when I get out
Clutchin' on my fans, had to tell lil' bro to chill out
How the fuck your whole gang down the road and you still out?
Undercover rat, pussy nigga, you a sellout
Every show I get either packed or it sell out
I been ballin' hard, you on the bench, you gotta sit out
Know a nigga mad, he can't even put a hit out
Middle of the winter, drop top with a mink on
Bad lil' vibe, yeah, she say that's her theme song
I done made a whole million dollars off a flip phone
No Soulja Boy, that bitch ain't even have a ringtone

[Chorus]
Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen

[Verse 2]
Call overseas, tell them youngins to spin again
I don't throw rocks and hide my hand 'cause I'm a man
Million cash in the book bag, I'm a big dog
Threw my shot at any nigga, bitch, I think I'm Chris Paul
Sippin' all these meds, nigga gotta be throwed off
I was gettin' head, fucked around and I dozed off
Rolls Royce truck, crank it and let the nose out
Everything I said, I went did it, boy, I'm the chosen child

[Chorus]
Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen

[Verse 3]
Safe deposit boxes on fleek
And my bank account, I don't touch it, I'ma get it out the street
Got your vibe all on my drip, she say you cheap
And she know I'm havin' money, buy her titties, ass, and teeth
Catchin' three flights every day, the only time I get some sleep
Kept it real and they be cappin', really you can't compete
I spend it all on bullets, niggas don't wanna beef
Got a D-boy swag, pull up SRT
I ain't playin' with nobody, nobody gon' play with me
Got a driver for my car, he take me from A to Z
Got some homies on the yard I probably'll never see
If the money was the issue I promise they'd be free
They was sleepin' on me bad, they fucked around, woke up a beast
Switch it up, I went romantic, took my shawty out to Greece
Every city that I go to, gotta link up with the street
I'm too humble for 'em, guess that's why they thinkin' I was sweet

[Chorus]
Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date

Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 1]
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit

And I'm like ""Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh

[Verse 2]
The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Shako ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (hey)
Uh, take you to the smoke shop

[Break]
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

And I'm like ""Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

I'm on house arrest but I'ma take one
That pussy bitin', so I paid to get her lace done
That nigga dissin' on the 'Gram, but I ain't say nothin'
I ain’t trippin, I’ma get him when that day come
I'm on house arrest but I’ma take one
That pussy bitin', so I paid to get her lace done

I ain't trippin', I'ma get him when that day come

I'ma lay on lil' buddy for 'bout eight months
If I whack him now, everybody gon' say somethin'
He tryna cop deuces, I don't tolerate none
He tried to pull up to the corner but he can't come
Yeah, we ran down fooly, he a wankster
He portrayin' to the media he gangsta
That pussy bitin', got me thinkin' about a ring or some'
That pussy bitin', make a nigga wanna sing or some'
Lil' cracker fucked up and then he put a bracelet on
So I'm slidin' in a Tahoe with a ray gun
I'm gettin' the money, I ain't even gotta pay for it
That pussy so good, I give her everything she want

Niggas gettin' kidnapped just to show you that it's real
Niggas gettin' snatched, showin' you niggas know right where you live
When you dissin' me, nigga, that better be really how you feel
'Cause I ain't takin' no apologies, I don't care if it's sincere
I'm on 1800 block, still posted with the steel
I don't even care, I got a couple mill' still in the field
I'm a bussiness man, how I give a pussy nigga the deal
Like an engineer, I give a pussy nigga the drill
I be lovin' when we vibin', I be lovin' when we chill
And that pussy so damn good, it make a nigga shed a tear
Slidin' lowkey booted, he a shooter, I recruited him
Better keep that toolie if he move then you shootin' him

159,Lucky You,"[Bridge]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
F*** the system, I'm that brother, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
F*** you too, woo!

[Chorus]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bulls***, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood s***, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't f** with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not f*** with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
I run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
B**** I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
S*** get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, everybody just really want me to get tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these people to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Took the wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a f*****' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Bridge]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the f*****' recognition
F***'s the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, f*** the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
F*** you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the f*** happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any f*****' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
F*****' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
F*** it, I'm goin' for the jugular
S*** is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherf***
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya d**** in the f*****' back, *** (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this s***, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a f*****' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherf*****, know I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice",Ajay Jones,Eminem Featuring Joyner Lucas,2018,"[89, 92, 93, 85, 78, 74, 64, 55, 28, 13, 18, 6]",12

Я хочу рассказать тебе историю
Ты знаешь, я дорожу тобой
Надеюсь, в ней не слишком много чувств

[Припев: Lil Wayne]
Я вижу ниггеров в этой сучке, опустошающих бутылку за бутылкой
Напиваются с этими сучками
И когда они уходят, за ними следуют
Засыпают с этой сучкой, ничего о ней не зная
Затем она впускает нас, мы забираем все твоё дерьмо
И когда ты просыпаешься, она помогает тебе попытаться найти это, я люблю это

[Куплет 1: Lil Wayne]
Я зависаю с сучками, которые зависают с сучками
Которые зависают с богатыми ниггерами
Я говорю ей: «возьми их», она говорит: «У меня уже есть ты»
Я говорю: «Нет, сучка, возьми его»
И они такие милые, и у них длинные волосы
Он напился и спит на её сиськах
Затем она подаёт нам сигнал, мы входим с АК
""Это ограбление!"" Она кричит, словно жертва
Теперь ты чувствуешь себя так глупо
Я курю траву, мне так кайфово, словно я Ceelie
Ссыкун дрожит, что ты там сказал?
Следи за языком, Милли Ванилли
Ты можешь быть подставлен, ты можешь быть обманут
Сучкой, к которой у тебя есть чувства
Потому что ты думал, что она ангел
Но эта сучка - не ангел, я использую её нимб вместо фрисби
И ты рассказываешь про свои дела - она передаёт это мне
Ты рассказываешь этой суке о своих чувствах
Она вливала тебе в уши сладкую ложь
Ложь текла даже сквозь её зубы
Она знает, где тебе спрятаться, чтобы рассказать мне, где ты спрятался
Она знает, когда тебе стоит уйти, чтобы рассказать мне, когда приходить
Мы врываемся в твой дом и забираем всё
Пока сучка на отдыхе с ним
Так что её не обвиняют, мы не цепляемся
Мы узнаем адреса и не оставляем беспорядка
Ты заметишь пропажу только когда начнёшь искать её
И подумаешь, что стоит ещё подумать
Она спросит тебя: ""Что-то не так?"", ты ответишь: ""Ничего, отдыхай""
Она спросит: ""Что пропало?"", ты ответишь: ""Откуда ты узнала, что что-то пропало?""
Он почешет голову, она скажет: ""Возвращайся в постель""
И сделает ему минет. Чувак, не доверяй сукам
И она сказала: ""Ооо...""

[Припев: Lil Wayne]
Я вижу ниггеров в этой сучке, опустошающих бутылку за бутылкой
Напиваются с этими сучками
И когда они уходят, за ними следуют
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin’
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don’t ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!""
And if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told ya""
She gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""
We're waitin’ outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissin’ so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain’t here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
Liz, that’s enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
We have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
Now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (uh)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick, that's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
Let me, let me take this call real quick
(… lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do?
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge her
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what, I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Kendrick Lamar]

Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you
(Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it

I know I’d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me ('cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)

Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

Well, it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words were ""do not disturb""
Checkout was supposed to be noon but we slept in 'til three

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

[Verse 2]
Well, I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
We danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away?
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah

[Bridge]
We left the lights
We left the crowd
We left the world and locked it out
She left a picture in my head
She left the night I can't forget, but

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it

Eu dou atenção à quem dá mas reciprocidade não se cobra, é um facto
Niggas se matam para comprar um telefone X, eu quero roupa no guarda fato
Eu sinto teu cheiro de longe mano, não subestima o meu olfato
Pego um, pego dois, quantos rappers forem, meto todos mesmo num prato

Her hair's a perfect mess, falling out of that dress

Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone

And through the paper-thin walls, you can hear the neighbor’s cigarette cough

Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

Saturday nights, your works shoes are stilettos
Smell of cheap perfume

You got wrapped up in other plans
But this ain't the way the story ends

Blessed boys under 21, steady flexin'
I'm gettin' too rich, can't do flights with connections

Codeine what I sip, that shit come in straight from Texas
Reach for my chain, you'll get beat just like Nexus
Lamborghini dreams, but you still drive a Lexus
I'm a young king, I might fuck Alexis Texas
But I ain't on no Drake shit, I won't get her pregnant
Damn, young Juice WRLD, boy, you reckless
And I feel you, until I get her naked
When I get up in it, I might have to stay in
Well if she goin' like that, let's run a train then
Fuck, I think I nutted in her, I might need a playpen
And a stroller
How I get this deep? We rode her like a Rover
No games, but I XBOX control her
She do the gang like a nerd doin' homework
.40 in my pants, that bitch thought it was a boner
If I go broke, I'ma juug off Motorolas
But now I'm up in France, Lil Boat, that's my mans
We get the green and then we fly around like Peter Pan

I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

208,Simple,"[Verse 1]
The way your fingers fit in mine
It's five plus five, not rocket science
This day in time, that's hard to find, it's true
The road we're on ain't a traffic jam
It's a Sunday drive on a piece of land
It's paradise as long as I'm with you

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

[Verse 2]
We used to live on Instagram
Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history
An epiphany that all we need is us

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin', love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E

Wanna see the look on your face
When I drop my clothes and I get naked
Not for you, but for him

How could you play me when the love I gave was real
I even took you back and you still had no chill

[Припев: XXXTENTACION]
Не плачь, не уходи
Не буду лгать - я чертовски тебя люблю
О да!

[Куплет 1: Lil Wayne]
Ты смотришь в облака
Это я поднимаюсь или они опускаются?
Я вижу смерть за углом
А знак разворота выглядит как улыбка
Что же мне теперь делать? Кто меня теперь найдет и как?
Некуда идти, кроме как по кругу
Еще один ниггер, который потерял голову
Нет, гребаный король, который забыл свою корону
Я не номер один и это правда
Я номер 9-27-82
Дальтоник, даже если я синий
Моя тарелка полна, это не моя любимая еда
Но я голоден, так голоден
Мне нужно мое родовое дерево рядом с денежным деревом
С кучей листьев в Эдемском саду
С кучей Eves, фруктовым пуншем
Я пью из фонтана молодости
Так что, если я умру молодым - обвиню сок
Похороните меня в Новом Орлеане
И напишите на плите: «Не плачь, следи за ней»
Верни меня к жизни
Потерять жизнь ради жизни
Но если рай настолько хорош, как о нем говорят
Я хочу трехкратное продление моей чертовой жизни
Покойся с миром

[Припев: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Не плачь (не плачь, не плачь)
Не уходи (почему? ну почему?)
Не буду лгать, я чертовски тебя люблю
Не плачь (не плачь, не плачь, не плачь)
Не пойди (почему? почему? почему? ну почему?)
Не будет лгать (не плачь, не плачь)
Я чертовски тебя люблю (не плачь, не плачь)

[Куплет 2: Lil Wayne]
Талант дан Богом, будь благодарен
Слава не дана, будь смиренным
А тщеславие появляется само, будь осторожен
Оставайся на своей собственной полосе, пристегнись
А иногда, когда нет музыки
Мы рождаем наши собственные рога, рум-бум-бум-бум
Эта женщина перенесла будущее
И Tunechi родился как «dun-dun-dun-dun»
Не называйте это возвращением
Было темно, а теперь солнце
Мне тяжело, но я повернул назад
Колеса отвалились, я поехал на ободах
Это самоубийством – вопрос жизни и смерти
Это более новые дни и это голубые небеса
Я сказал себе: «Это просто ты и я»
Затем повеял ветер и он свел меня с ума
Господь знает, кто я там
Я делаю последнее дыхание
Мама скажи, чтобы я был осторожен
Голос в голове дает мне нагоняй
Я получил контроль над сознанием
Я потерял контроль, но знал, что найду его
Я позволил Богу контролировать то, что я не могу
Невозможно контролировать слезы, позволить им падать и катиться

[Припев: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Не плачь (не плачь, не плачь)
Не уходи (почему? ну почему?)
Не буду лгать, я чертовски тебя люблю
Не плачь (не плачь, не плачь, не плачь)
Не пойди (почему? почему? почему? ну почему?)
Не будет лгать (не плачь, не плачь)

Your daddy had a lakehouse
He had me paint it that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free

And headed straight for the pier

And watched all of our friends pair off with one another

I can't let these niggas knock me off my pivot
God sat me down and talked to me, I listened
I was in that cell, he told me that I’m gifted
I don't make it in the booth, then I'ma make it in the kitchen
I’m special with the mic, special with the whippin'
I ran out of money, had to pay attention
All the people that was 'round me, they ain't have my best interest
You ain't have my best interest
You lazy with yo' loyalty and yo' position
And now I gotta execute 'cause you don’t listen
That throwaway on me dumpin’ with precision
I know shawty only on my trail 'cause she see a ticket
I’m readin' between the lines and peepin' they intentions
Can't have you niggas around me, shit gon’ go to missing
I had to press that bump, I had to feel it
You know if it ever come down to it, a nigga with it
All these drugs got the whole world jiggy
Hoes comin' out they clothes and niggas trippin'
Why hit the top to go back to the bottom?
All these bitches fallin' for me like it's Autumn

They freed me so I'm right back to that mon-yun
Somebody tell these niggas they don't want none

They sent my nigga Cool on the fuckin' run
When they let him out of prison, I'll be 31
I knew I was a star when I was sellin' hard
Everybody told me I would make it when I was on the block
See, before this rap shit, I was jackin' cars
I couldn't get all my time 'cause I was doin' fraud

It hurt me to my heart, heard they gave him 25

Litterally, I don't know that though
""I'd live for you"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then, you ignore them still
And these questions, they're for real like
Who would you live for? Who would you die for and?
And would you ever kill?

I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place rule my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
A crumble underneath the weight
Pressures of a new place rule my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me

But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
If you need anyone, I'll stop my plans
But you'll have to tie me down and then break both my hands

But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air

224,Belly,"[Intro: Gunna]
Ah-ah-ah, hey
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus: Gunna]
You niggas bogus, I see the imposers
I used to sell yola, trap on Motorolla
Spittin' these vocals, labels think I wrote it
Slippery wet paints, the coupes are candy-coated
Just left the bank, I need a bag to hold this
The streets like a farm 'cause all we ride is horses
Let my face tell it, we done made a fortune
I'm ridin' with my dawg and he ain't gotta question

[Verse 1: Gunna]
I got a bitch like Keisha off of Belly
Police got dogs and they can't even smell me
Keep me a cup, I got a lean belly
20s on me, I call 'em green relish
Balmain my jeans, if not, they embellished
Too many vibes, they think I'm R. Kelly
PH in the sky, we got 'em already
PJ in the sky and I don't wanna land it
Creepin' at night, the VLONE bandit
I prayed to the sky and none of this was handed
Worked all my life and now I understand it
Crawled up like a mouse, but I could never tell it
I got the sweetest sauce like jelly
Try disrespect me, you all get beheaded
I got the drip, they call me Dripavelli
I held him down, that nigga was my celly
Fuck you fuck niggas, devil made me heartless
Thank God, came and got me, used to shop at Target
They cut out the coupe before we hit the market
We don't pack our bags 'cause we gon' shop regardless
Backend, I'm back in, paid up for the party
I done came a long way from openin' up for Carti
Shades and my bracelets Cartier Carti
Police's cases, all that we avoidin'
The lean in my cup gettin' more and more muddy
I shown all my love, I've never been a bully
Got every color VLONE hoodie
Just jumped in the game and still I ain't no rookie
I got this sauce, cream and puddin'
I came with the drip, got everybody lookin'
Cherish your blessings, easily could be tooken
Send a front in, it's easy to get a book in

[Chorus: Gunna]
You niggas bogus, I see the imposers
I used to sell yola, trap on Motorolla

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Yeah, cash all my backends, I bought me a Patek
Addicted to cabbage, the money relax me
My mom and them happy, I bought them a mansion
I still rock the fitted, but I don't be cappin' (Skrrt)
These camouflage denim like I just went campin'
They still can't believe that I made it, they happy
I been gettin' money before I was rappin'
I'm ridin' in the Wraith like I play with the actors
No pleadin', arraignment, ain't takin' no charges
My young nigga's solid, I know that he got me
He keep his mouth closed, I'ma buy him a foreign
Penthouse, hotel suite whenever we're tourin'
How foreign my tint is, I still rock the Jordan
Packin' out shows, love my fans, they important
And I'm still in the trap, in the hood like a motor
Spend thousands on fragrance, she fuckin' my odor
I just started rappin', I made me some millions
Man, shout out Atlanta, I'm runnin' my city
These bracelets came healthy, they cost me a 50
I leveled it up, I've been handlin' business
Gettin' 20 a night, every day, different city
I just keep puttin' this syrup in my kidneys
This the big one, boy, this not the Jubilee (Jubilee)
I got Gunna with me, rockin' VLONE, Supreme (Yeah, yeah)

You niggas bogus, I see the imposers

227,Can't Be Broken,"[Chorus: Thomas Troelsen]
You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
They can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornado's too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you
(errr!)

[Chorus: Thomas Troelsen]
You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen (Yeah)

I ain't finna break or fix the brakes
You hear me late, I'm laughing in your face
Now fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil a day
For like a million days
At least the bills are paid, the children safe
Want to get away? No, I'm here to stay
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A
You saw the news today
Got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break

Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
It takes a lot to change a man
Hell, it takes a lot to try
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die

Nobody knows what waits for the dead
Nobody knows what waits for the dead
Some folks just believe in the things they've heard and the things they read
Nobody knows what awaits for the dead

I'm glad I can't go back to where I came from
I'm glad those days are gone, gone for good
But if I could take spirits from my past and bring 'em here
You know I would
Know I would

Nobody speaks to God these days
Nobody speaks to God these days
I'd like to think he's lookin' down and laughin' at our ways
Nobody speaks to God these days

When I was a child, they tried to fool me
Said the worldly man was lost and that a Hell was real
Well I've seen Hell in Reno
And this world's one big old Catherine wheel
Spinnin' steel

[Chorus 2]
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
It takes a lot to change your plans
And a train to change your mind
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die

As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted

[Chorus: Lil Wayne / Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin’
The sky is fallin’, fallin' down
I turn into news, and this is the apocalypse
People livin’ on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stoppin' this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne) / Both]
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling, falling down
I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I'll be waiting, I’ll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactic, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you (for you, for you)
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)",Lil Wayne,Lil Wayne Featuring Nicki Minaj,2018,[26],1
234,Famous,"[Chorus: Reginae Carter]
Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky (Yeah)
You must be famous
This is how you live your life, different city every night (Yeah)
You must be famous, famous

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'ma be on the TV, mama, Pac voice
People point at me, say, ""Oh my God""
They got a point
Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
It's mind-blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image, but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, ""Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me""
'Cause superstars don't sparkle, superstars beam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream
I'ma be on the TV, mama

[Chorus: Reginae Carter & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights (Woo!)
All the lighters in the sky (I must be famous)
You must be famous (Yeah, oh my God I must be famous)
This is how you live your life (Yeah)
Different city every night (I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Rich and famous, it's better to be rich and famous
Message to my lawyer: ""Don't let me make these bitches famous""
You know entertainers, sex, drugs and entertainment get so instantaneous
Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twist the light bulb when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself, 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives; ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself, unless I ask, ""Am I dreamin'?""
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass
And I heard, ""Can you look this way? Can you look this way?""
Flash! I must be famous

[Chorus: Reginae Carter & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights (Yeah!)
All the lighters in the sky (You must be famous)
You must be famous (I'ma be on the TV, mama!)
This is how you live your life (Yeah, yeah)
Different city every night (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
You probably thought that my career, be short and sweet
You wish that I was in your shoes, I'd take them off 'cause life's a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we shine deep
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, ""Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me""
'Cause superstars don't twinkle, superstars gleam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream
I'ma be on the TV, mama

[Chorus: Reginae Carter & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous (Oh my God, I must be famous)
This is how you live your life
Different city every night (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

236,Open Letter,"[Intro]
Ah-em

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
A few bitches left me, yhat only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes, it's now or next
Can’t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin’ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

[Verse 2]
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags on mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious""
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' sober-headed
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

[Outro: Jacida Carter]
You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, ""Y'all young. You know y'all young."" But I said, ""Be the best father you can be,"" you know. And truly, he is that.",Lil Wayne,Lil Wayne,2018,[47],1

[Chorus]
If lovin' me is wrong, I don’t wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time I thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I’m never home, one time I thought I was home and it was only the matrix

[Verse 1]
Off button, pause button, stop button, lock button
Belly button, big ol' titties, she pop buttons, head buttin'
Versace button down unbuttoned to the top button
Percocets, that's my buttons, hit the pop button
Psychopath, blunt big, big as Mama June off the diet plan
Smokin' science lab
I should have a tattoo that say, ""I am nothin' like my dad""
Jesus Christ, amen
My hand in the psychic's hand, she see righteous plans
I see business plans then I lose my mind and my attention span
She see empty hands like, ""Oooh, Lordy,"" smellin' like Cool Water
Just got them new Cartier, the Rollie was too salty
That’s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
My little bitch body a trophy
Naked pics, five in the morning, sunglasses, smilin’ emoji
Pull up on the opps, surprise party
Better get up and stand up like Bob Marley
That is your homie, he died for ya
Check your home screen, that's God callin’ (Hello?)
We makin' an impact, my nigga
We not just black, nigga, we rich and black, nigga
And all them bitches they been after niggas
They run away then they come limpin' back, nigga
Amen, feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse to get on my flyin' horses?
That’s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
My lil' bitch body'll solve it
And when you say, ""Timber,"" please, will you whisper?
My nigga, I'm quietly fallin', shhhhh

[Chorus]
If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, every time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

[Bridge]
Hello? Hello? Rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
I got rich nigga problems, lil whoadie

[Chorus]
If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time I thought I was wrong, I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home every time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace, I rest in peace and harmony
I don't talk, I speak, after I pray, I preach
I don't play, I cheat, after I stay, I leave
The fork in the road, grab the fork and eat
Turn that piggy bank to some hog head cheese
But you doin' nothing, well they say, ""Nothin' ain't never worth nothin', but it's always free""
Psychopath
Blunt thick, thick as Mama June off the diet plan, smokin' science lab
I should have tattoo that say, ""I'm nothin' like your man""
Jesus Christ, Amen!
My hand in the psychic' hand
She see righteous plans, I see power plans
She take my hands put 'em in her pants
Do the hyphy dance then I wipe my hands
Feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse to get on my flyin' horses?
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie

[Refrain]
You got penny pinch nigga problems, lil whoadie
On the bench nigga problems, lil whoadie
I got a bitch nigga problem, lil whoadie
More bitches more problems, lil whoadie
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
What is this nigga problem, lil whoadie?
I got rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Yea

Mack in here
Pooh in here
Scoob in here with me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tell them hoes get they mind right, tell them niggas back up
Man, I heard the truth is hard to swallow, do you have cups?
Used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
Tell ’em get they iron right before Iron-Man come
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
I’ma cut this music down, tell 'em put they APs up
Tell 'em throw they pride out, roll the windows back up
Money in the air, who said white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
Let me get the phone and the car once it's gassed up
AK-47 make a sittin' duck stand up
I could let it blast, but I much rather have one
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
Then them hoes get passed down, then them hoes get passed up
Sittin’ on this money to me feel like a cactus
I’m stickin' to this shit, you would’ve been have hopped yo' ass up

Tell 'em, I got hittas woadie (Hittas woadie)

Nigga, I'm a ass with that semi; call me semicolon
Yeah I got hittas woadie, yeah I got plenty woadie
They kick the door and kill yo’ ass and leave the children snorin'
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, make me feel important
I made some green in the past and now it's good as golden, yeah

I'm so lifted, I'm so lifted
I wrote my will in hieroglyphics (In hieroglyphics)
Weezy, where you been? The people miss you
Crickets
I got hittas and they not kidders, that's my niggas
You got niggas but they not hittas, they got jitters
They get hit up, I'm placin' figures on your niggas
Takin' bidders, yo' bae, yo' niggas, don't make a difference
I got shooters, on pharmaceuticals​, they armed and brutal
Armed intruders, 'cause we don't doodle, we draw conclusions

Yeah, if it's beef, we over-ate, nigga
Bap, bap, bap, bap, it's no debate, nigga
Yeah, there go the bass, nigga
You niggas starve, we let food go to waste, nigga
Choke your punk ass out, neck brace nigga
I do the same shit I learned on sex-tapes with her
New money, call it cake, fresh-baked, nigga
Hungry, bullets eatin' off your chest-plate, nigga
I hope this bitch don't think that I'mma have faith in her (No-no)
Bitch screamed when the dick was halfway in her

[Verse 2]
When the dick was halfway in her
Damn, you ain't dead yet? I'm amazed, nigga
Guess what? I'm comin' back with that gauge, nigga
Leather face, but I’m feeling like suede nigga
Got you dizzy, turning over in your grave, nigga
I could shoot this bitch and still drive straight, nigga
Bap, bap, bap, bap, I'm irate, nigga
5'5"" stuntin' like I'm 5'8"", nigga (What?)
Bumbu out the glass, no chase, nigga (Bumbu)
Only smoke on gas, no brakes, nigga
No brakes, road rage, my new money gonna die of old age
When they shoot, we don't race, we gon' need our own space
Need a piece of that pie, we gon' need it homemade
I be comin' home late, bad bitch, long face
She do every single thing but rub me the wrong way
'96 Dom P, I have that with Corn Flakes
And I never been intrigued by the patterns on snakes
You could dump a dead body, man, I think I know a place
She gon' suck the prototype then swallow all the proteges, nigga

[Chorus 2]
Lookin' like a open safe, nigga
We in this bitch, lookin' like Miss Oprah's safe, nigga (We're safe)
My homie caught a whole case (Whole case)
Celebratin' like he got a cold case, nigga (Oh!)
Whew, wait, nigga
Had to take a smoke break, nigga
A smoke break, nigga

[Verse 3]
I stick her hands in the fan blades, nigga
That's when she told me where her man stayed, nigga
I ran up in that bitch on a rampage, nigga
In the morning, brains in the pancakes, nigga
My bitch classy and she keep her classmates with her
Your bitch ashy and she keep a ashtray with her
Had to do it one time for my skate niggas
Skate up on you, blam-blam, skate away, nigga
Kick push, that means grind and get paid, nigga
These pay cuts bleed through the Band-Aid, nigga
So walk it like you talk it, sashay, nigga
Skate up on you, blam-blam
Okay nigga, I just left José nigga, I just left José, nigga
Federales on my ass, fuckin' had a boat chase, nigga
They didn't see no face, nigga
Your bitch spent the whole day with us
If she open her fuckin' mouth, knock all the white out, no racism
That's cold, homies, pump that bass, nigga
And sometimes we close the safe, nigga
But there ain't no code to break, niggas
I capitalize off my own mistakes, you lowercase, nigga
Your bitch cut her legs when they was on my shoulder blades, nigga
Don't hate (Don't hate) call an ace, an ace, nigga
Got Mack with me up in this bitch and a MAC just in case, nigga
I'm a Scarface, nigga, fuck your human race, nigga
I'm on base, nigga, yeah Lil Tunechi safe, nigga

[Chorus 3]
Uh, lookin' like an open safe, nigga
We in this bih lookin' like an open safe, nigga
Ya, uh, lookin' like an open safe, nigga

240,Took His Time,"[Chorus]
Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef

I put my pride to the side, off safety
And look alive, look alive

[Verse 1]
Smoke one, ready to po' one, tote one, scared of no one
You never know when your close ones is a pussy 'til your nose run
Bickin' back bein' bool, trigger happy his goons
Bigger mansion and pool, I need a map for this room
Don't need a casket to view 'em, you can leave the rats in the sewers
I'm speedin' past in the newest soft top like the Jewish
Thrasher Sweatshirt, Vans on, all the bitches hands on
Fucked your bitch for a Sams card, a SIM card and an Android
Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet
Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head, bad hair day
In broad day like ""let's play,"" lil' kids playin' jump rope
Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show
Where the paper and the drugs though, at your neighbor with the snub-nose
I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns
All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone
Swallowin' all my unborns, say it taste like a love song
In the cut like a cutworm, keep it cool, keep the cup warm
Rum-bum-bum-bum-bum, if they come for 'em, I tell 'em

[Chorus]
God took his time when he made me
Got my pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
God took his time when he made me

[Verse 2]
Sorry, boys, bar is closin', where we goin' for breakfast?
Put pressure on the precious, and put extra on the extras
Extra ready for my presents, extra sexy but she selfish
Just want me to see selfies of the pelvis, overwhelmin'
Talkin' money over salmon in Italian in Australia
Fuck it even have some salad, I'm just valuin' the value
Wake up and smell the azaleas sang her prayers like Mahalia
I just don't know what to tell ya, but, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Devil lies jumpin' at ya, comin' from what's comin' at ya
I come from where they come at ya, in a way you can't come back from
I attack from every crack, while you been chillin', I been active
I been still inside the action, you been actin' I been buildin'
You been blabbin', you been bickerin'
I been blackin' I been sippin' like the Dracula
I been feelin' like Galactus
Got a million in the mattress, a gazillion in the pantry
If you don't know that I'm the answer, you should kill who you been askin'

[Chorus]
Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety

241,Mess,"[Chorus]
Because my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
Fuck it, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Verse 1]
She gon' have to excuse my ex
I'ma have to excuse her pets
She gon' have to be juicy wet if she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
Nigga, to the left, nigga, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture, but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning
Dirty Devil, I'm a mess

[Bridge]
But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into XO
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

[Chorus]
'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more one's, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Verse 2]
Yes, no pressure, it’s a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess

[Bridge]
I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into Petrol
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

[Chorus]
'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more one's, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey care less
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Outro]
Yes, fuck it, more ones, fuck it, more ones
Fuck it more ones, fuck it, more ones
I'm​ making a mess with all of these ones
Fuck it, more ones, fuck it, more ones

But fuck it, more one's",Lil Wayne,Lil Wayne,2018,[74],1
242,Let It All Work Out,"[Intro: Sampha]
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Work out, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm in this bitch
Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch
But now I’m in this bitch
Yeah, I'm in this bitch
Tunechi, you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
""Don't let the money come between us""
I’m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ’em
’Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it’s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, ""Relax, Tune, baby don’t stress out""
But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though
She said, ""Let that shit work itself out""
""Let that shit work itself out""

[Interlude 1: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
C5
Yeah, back in this bitch
Tune you left this bitch
Like you knew this bitch was gon' let your ass back in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
But ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Cita, you a psychic
'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out

[Interlude 2: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, ""Tune, you knew me for way too long""
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, ""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out, let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out, let it all work out""

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Sampha & Jacida Carter]
Yeah, and he said
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
Let it all work out (Phew)
""Let it all work out""
(But he said, ""Remember this:"")
""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out""
(""Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch"")
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(""And don't forget what I did this, bitch"")
""Let it all work out""
(""Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch"")
""Let it all—""
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(""Now I'm out this bitch"")
""Let it all work out""
(""I'm out this bitch"")
""Let it all—""

243,Used 2,"[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
I used to walk a thin line, now I'm walking chin high
I used to fuck and get tired, now I fuck her ten times
She used to make me dick rise, now she make me ribeyes
She used to make me six-nine, now she make her friend try
She used to make me love her, now she make me realize
It's money over bitches 'till the day I dizz-ie
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago, if he dies, he dies

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Find out where he reside and find out where he hide
Run up in that bitch like, ""Hey,"" pop-pop-pop, peace sign
Percocet, promethazine, you can call me P-Rod
Taking shots at my team, you must be getting senile
You goin' at my slime then you're going at me, slime
Your blood all over the scene, it look like red cheap wine
I'm smoking on a key lime, you look like tea time
Look like honey to my beehive, I close your sweet eyes
Shoot ya in ya head, give ya ass three eyes
And you still ain't seen a fucking thing until you C5
I remember you, I was never into you
I tell my shooters, shoot you and whoever resemble you
And every member who had been a friend of you or kin to you
They in it too, and bitches too, they mention you, they dentures loose
Run up in a nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
Safe code now nigga, cough it up or spit it out
Oh my God I'm flipping out, flipping out then dipping out
I tried to turn the fuckin' page, oh my God, I ripped it out

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side

If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah, run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I used to know you niggas, I don't know you niggas
I just ignore you niggas, I don't bro you niggas
With my bros will smoke you niggas, like we grow you niggas
Kill your ho too nigga, and your go-to niggas
I've been riding 'round the city with the safety off
Glock nine and it's pretty like a baby doll
You niggas bitches and it's pissing all the ladies off
My finger sitting on the trigger like a La-Z-Boy
If there was beef, I'm in the kitchen with the apron on
Put his words on the plate, that nigga ate 'em all
And I ain't wit' the talking, but damn now he talking
Nigga spilled the beans, damn, now it's coffee
Looking for your pussy ass like I got a warrant
I throw on the ski mask, that's a private party
Bullets jumping off your ass like they shock absorbant
Rock your bells, LL, nigga locked and loaded

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I used to smoke to get high now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the beast side
I feel like Ivan Drago lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?
I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
Used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi

[Verse 1]
Ayy, somebody grab him some clippers (Zzzzt)
His fuckin' beard is weird
Tough talk from a rapper payin' millions for security a year
""I think my dad's gone crazy,"" yeah, Hailie, you right
Dad's always mad cooped up in the studio, yellin' at the mic
You're sober and bored, huh? (I know)
'Bout to be 46 years old, dog
Talkin' 'bout ""I'ma call up Trick Trick""
Man, you sound like a bitch, bitch
Man up and handle your shit (Ugh)
Mad about somethin' I said in 2012
Took you six years and a surprise album just to come with a diss (Huh)
Homie we get it, we know that you're the greatest rapper alive
Fuckin' dweeb, all you do is read the dictionary and stay inside
Fuck ""Rap God,"" I'm the Rap Devil
Comin' bare-faced with a black shovel
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle
His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'

I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body
And put some white chalk around it (Ayy!)

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about the fact you actually blackballed a rapper
That's twice as young as you (Let's talk about it)
Let's call Sway
Ask why I can't go on Shade 45 because of you (Brrt)
Let's ask Interscope
How you had Paul Rosenberg tryin' to shelf me (Huh?)
Still can't cover up the fact
Your last four albums is as bad as your selfie
Now tell me, what do you stand for? (What?)
I know you can't stand yourself (No)
Tryin' to be the old you so bad, you Stan yourself (Ha)
Let's leave all the beefin' to 50 (Please)
Em, you're pushin' 50
Why you claimin' that I'ma call Puff?
When you the one that called Diddy (Facts)
Then you went and called Jimmy (Facts)
They conference called me in the morning (What?)
They told me you mad about a tweet
You wanted me to say sorry (What?)
I swear to God I ain't believe him (Nah)
Please say it ain't so (No)
The big bad bully of the rap game can't take a fuckin' joke
Oh, you want some fuckin' smoke (What?)
But not literally, you'll choke
Yeah, I'll acknowledge you're the G.O.A.T
But I'm The Gunner, bitch, I got you in the scope (Brra!)
Don't have a heart attack now (No)
Somebody help your mans up (Help!)

Hello Marshall, my name's Colson
You should go back to Recovery (Wouh)
I know your ego is hurtin'
Just knowin' that all of your fans discovered me (Hi!)
He like, ""Damn, he a younger me
Except he dresses better and I'm ugly
Always making fun of me.""
Stop all the thuggery, Marshall, you livin' in luxury (Ayy)
Look what you done to me
Dropped an album just because of me
Damn, you in love with me!
You got money but I'm hungry
I like the diss but you won't say them lyrics out in front of me
Shout out to every rapper that's up under me
Know that I'll never do you like this fuckery
Still bitter after everyone loves you
Pull that wedgie out your dungarees (Ayy)
I gotta respect the OGs and I know most of 'em personally (Ayy!)
But you're just a bully actin' like a baby
So I gotta read you a nursery (Pussy)
I'm the ghost of the future
And you're just Ebenezer Scrooge (Facts)

I ain't know it would be you

Fuck Kells!

[Verse 4]
We know you get nervous, Rabbit
I see Mama's spaghetti all over your sweater
I wish you would lose yourself on the records
That you made a decade ago, they were better
Accordin' to them, you're a national treasure
To me, you're as soft as a feather
The type to be scared to ask Rihanna for her number
Just hold her umbrella-ella-ella
""I'm not afraid,"" okay Oscar the Grouch, chill on the couch (Fuck)
You got an Oscar, damn
Can anyone else get some food in their mouth? (For real)
They made a movie about you, you're in everybody's top ten
You're not getting better with time
It's fine, Eminem, put down the pen
Or write an apology
Over the simple fact, you had to diss to acknowledge me
I am the prodigy
How could I even look up to you? You ain't as tall as me
5'8"" and I'm 6'4"", seven punches hold your head still
Last time you saw 8 Mile was at home on a treadmill
You were named after a candy
I was named after a gangster (Brr!)
And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you! (Thank you!)
I just wanna feed my daughter
You tryna stop the money to support her
You the one always talkin' 'bout the action
Text me the addy, I'm pullin' up scrappin'
And I'm by my fuckin' self, what's happenin'
EST captain, salute me or shoot me
That's what he's gonna have to do to me
When he realizes there ain't shit he could do to me
Everybody always hated me, this isn't anything new to me
Yeah there's a difference between us
I got all of my shit without Dre producin' me (Ayy!)
I know you're not used to me
Usually one of your disses should ruin me
But bitch I'm from Cleveland
Everybody quiet this evenin', I'm readin' the eulogy (Shh!)
Dropped an album called Kamikaze
So that means he killed him
Already fucked one rapper's girl this week
Don't make me call Kim!

I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)

Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently so now they're startin' to enter it
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin’ like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
She fucked thy niggas, see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'

She agree to my demands too
Brought the demon out her ass too

You done pulled the demon out the man, pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands, asked the demon, ""Can we dance?""
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past

A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands

[Chorus 2]
A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand

Yeah, brought the demon out the man, ooh
She agree to my demands too
You done brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out her ass too

[Verse 2]
Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently, so now they're startin' to enter it
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin’ like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
She fucked thy niggas see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'

[Bridge 3]
A demon, with demands
A demon, with demands

[Refrain]
You done pulled the demon out the man, pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands, asked the demon, ""Can we dance?""

246,Perfect Strangers,"[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Mmm...

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women
Puttin' cups up, gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

[Verse 1]
Damn, love don't live here
Love, I don't live here
She say, ""Why you leave your shit here?""
I'm tryna be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight
But, we don't even make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout ""What about how she feel?""
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
""Baby where my keys at?""
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back
Her teeth smacked

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

[Verse 2]
I was talkin' to myself the other day
My homies call me cray, my mama tell me, ""Pray""
She say, ""I need a day"", I said, ""I need a bae""
She said, ""Believe in faith
Ma, they love me either way""
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say ""Don't sweat your alarm""
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like, ""Let go my arm!""
She said...

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore​
Talking to the man in her mirror
I've been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
And she say, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
She say, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's what's fucked up

She say we don't make love anymore

Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror,, my hero
He helped me see like a eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes

[Verse 1]
Hasta la vista, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro
So my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it, my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that is a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
It's tattooed, it can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks

Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya

Even through the cracks, I see no cracks in me though

Daytime start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl
Thank God Weezy back
Order is restored, all is right with the world
Last time become lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the motherfuckin' best rapper, a-live

I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don’t want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm
Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can’t part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard

God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me drown

So pull me up from down below
’Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most

At this point I'm willing to give you
But Thailand kissed me, your heart is mine
We will keep yourself in front of you

Baby, had a great nap in hand
More and more neglected, fear in your favorite music

Uh, no
I'm hungry!

Yes, I'm a woman and I have more power than I have
One day, his fate unites
I have the power, to love and keep my confidentiality
Love, who took the children
They are boys too, but we do not have much love
You probably have a lot of things
We are confident that time is over
Darling, adjust your hand
He is my daughter, I will be your husband
I see the front of my eyes

Without feet and legs and scan more
When I read in court, do well

But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit

But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him

Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit

Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh, no, she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take, not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?

You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it

Don't fall on my face

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Look)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, ""He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up!""—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)—Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a ******, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Ha-ha)

Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall… bitch (Yeah)

Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Looking for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no
Majoring in Undecided

Never dreamed anybody else would like them
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf

I bought a ring and she said, ""I do""
But everybody else said, ""Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?""

She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die a happy man

I remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama
""You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen""
Well I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now Lauren's showing, got one on the way
Yeah that's two under two, hey, what can I say?

Никаких ошибок, да вы не ошиблись - правда

Но сорвался с цепи словно Kala Brown

Твою мать, завали хлебало, когда я базарю
Lil' bitch, постой, чем ты талантив?
Писать комментарий?
Про мой талант?
Ох сука я не понял
Ты вообще кто такой там?
Чтобы писать эти строки
И свое мнение никчемное обо мне

Ты меня затронул - миллион просмотров, попадаешь в топы
Тебя упомянул - для меня фейл - для тебя победа
Миллиард мнений, твое как 5 копеек
Ты не послушав трэк, написал рецензию
Чтобы собрать клики, но бич разбудил зверя

Не пойми не верно, но мы снова в деле
Дерьмолист переделан, так что дерьмо делаем
И ты получишь дисс, потому что какого хрена это дерьмо на слуху вообще?

Ты понимаешь хоть, как презираю этот «choppy flow»
Который копируют - нет видимо
Выкинь аудио, из моей Audi yo, adiós
Люди любят Lil Yachty, но не меня - я понял

Никого не обижу - это не мой стиль
Я всего на всего просто MC
Может со «Stan» вам не по пути?
Может вам нравится сироп и lean

Может мне надо все это в строгости
Размешать и встряхнуть бы весь мир
Poul просит остыть - меня все хотят слить

Таблетку надо мне - окей, я ее сьем
Старый Eminem - нового убил
Этот труп лежит окровавленный
Теперь я одержим злыми чарами
Я выражение ЗЛОГО во плоти

Я прибью Whitestrip на мой член
Зажму его в тиски, подвешу на забор на шипы
Буду бить, а шары пока в руках - теребить их

Как рубильник, как вице президент Mike Pence
Кину на асфальт и проедусь на sidekick
После это все кину на spike strip

Лучше это делать, чем слушать ваши у микро бредни, Ваши трэки все - о снеге и брюлликах
И Госпади Исуси, сколько еще раз я услышу, как вы трахать будете (мою сучку)

Не увидишь никогда на мне бриллиант
Оттачиваю не камни, а стиль
Принес раздор и поделил их
Па полюса два и твой череп пнул изнутри
Сука,  я ваш клуб будто бы дубинкой разбил

Зачем звук сбавлять?
Не сильно кричал же, наваливай Valium
Ибо я не знаю, как закрывать вам пасть
Наплевать на выбор, какой калибр брать сейчас

Я делаю ставку «сто тысяч баксов», что ты Развернешься скажешь «Какого черта ,парень?»
«Этот хрыч злится, что его альбом отсосал сейчас
И теперь он вымещает злобу на нас»

Ууу

На прошлой неделе
Фанатка прислала e-mail
С диском «Of The Mathers LP”
Сказала «учиться» мол «стиль мой
Вернется мгновенно»

Ууу

Я суке ответил, что если так сделал бы
Стал бы таким же, как все эти рэперы
Особенно гребанный клон мой с Recovery (не осознал бы)

Что ж, пальцем bang, куры wang
MGK, Igg’ Azae', Lil Pump, Lil Xan вы копия Lil Wayne
Я должен убрать их всех - выбирай ник нейм

Я уже сыт по горло - оставаться скромным
Но слухи ходят мол я - все еще голодный
Вурчишь как пустой живот - слышу бубнеж твой
Это больше походит на mumbo-jumbo

Моя эра разнесет вас - придет время
Че ты сделаешь ? Некуда убегать  будь уверен
Я с тобой разделаюсь и схожу в туалет на тебя

Если ты не Joyner, не Kendrick, ни Cole, то ты покойник
Собираюсь наехать на каждого, кто захочет
Когда ты в BURGER KING, то ты ожидаешь Whopper

Но бургер можно
Получить в McDonald's
Если стейка хочешь
То непременно Revival выбрать стоит

Хватит претворяться, мол я подсунул вам Slider
Может мой вокал срочно заавтотюнить надо?

И тогда бы ты купил альбом, но говорить что я не тот
Лишь потому, что ты не понял или не успел за строчкой
Потому что ты тупой или отстал умом
Но типа умник со своим  анализом-разбором
Но художником не стать вам
Я к себе жестокий, больше, чем вы вместе взятые
Не стану идеалом, но всегда буду за правду
Когда здохну даже, про меня все скажут
Что я смог что-то, при том, что
Променял 5 десяток на ликер как алкоголик
Но я больше не мог затыкать пробкой факт тот
Что я на самом дне в итоге

Если не вырваться вмиг - из пасти зла вырвать жизнь
Не вижу смысла на меня вам бузить
Эпичмент мне дали - мои враги умирают
Я буду стрелять по крайней мере, пока все не лягут

Я с east side - меня врасплох не застать
Теперь видишь, почему я не сплю по ночам?
Даже не моргаю - не кимарю, не качаю в бит
Я чихаю, сука, даже глаза не закрыв

Оооу, парень, этот BET сайфер слабым был -
Это мусор - Существо даже не оранжевое
О боже, просто ужас

Привет, все мои дальтоники
Все, кто видит пожарников - зелеными
Аквамарин или все же это розовый напиток
Это финики, а выглядит, так будто бы - оливки
Это яблоко? нет это персик - смотри

Что ж пальцем bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang

От Charlamagn один хейт
Чтобы я там не сказал
Награди меня «Ослом дня»
Почему бы нет?

В 18ом зачет мне
Я выскажу вам всем
Все что вам  сказать хотел
Добро пожаловать на скотобойню, бич
Приглашаю всех - это не конец

Чувствую себя животным
Поставил эту черту, а может к черту?
Вижу теперь, как эти люди уходят
Так не должно быть
Все не по целям в итоге

Я вижу, как фэнов - все меньше втрое
Поступать правильно пытался просто
Но общественность уже вердикт выносит
Или не решили?

Я решимостью переполнен был
И подвергал критике его поклонников
Но если бы вернуться в прошлое
Я бы все точно - переобмолвил
Поддержал бы тех, кому он мечту обещал, но бросил

Я думаю сработало - эти строки
Потрепали ему нервы серьезно
И он боится просто поговорить со мной
Знает, что я на словах его уничтожу

Я знаю он их слышал точно
Ведь уже отправил спец-службы Agent Orange
Чтобы встретиться со мной, узнать хочу ли я на него Напасть и связан ли с террором

Я ответил только если с поэтами, текстами
Но мой биф это все для медиа прессы

Стоп, стоп, стоп

Я сказал мой биф - это мясо, а прессе
Набейте рот плотью
И да биф - это типа член мой
Да вы критиковали альбом
Так получите пальцы средние

И это не сеанс терапии
Они выжали все - будто в сушилке
Не собираюсь сглаживать в пресс
Просто вынес этот бит в хим чистку",Eminem / Obzorov,Eminem,2018,"[95, 59, 39, 8]",4

You better? Been around, like hella, propellers
Wanna know who you with, don't tell 'em
Come on fellas, that ain't none of your biz'
Got on your body suit, you know I'm on your ass today
Would you let me hit it thrice if I asked today?
She know my stick nothing but magic babe
I be swinging it back and forth, 'til you in your casket, bae, mm

Girl, you want my best side, mm
Bet she from the westside, mm, mm

Okay, say it loud, say it proud, you want it more
We open door, hit the couch, then the floor
I cut it up, like a scissor, love galore
She never bored, there's so much shit we can do
You free to say whatever, baby, if you askin' me
No limit when I'm in it, got a Master P
I'm hoping I don't have a fast release
Got me focused like I'm out here tryna get my Masters see, mm
Throwin' up the peace sign, mm
Girl, I'm from the Eastside, mmm, mmm

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I'm lovin' your light, vulnerable
Lettin' your guard down, it's honorable
'Specially when the past ain't been that
Friendly to you but there’s magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
To keep alive in the winter time, ayy, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
I raise you, you raise me, let's turn this whole life 'round
You can confide in me
I could take the weight up off your shoulder blades
And try to store the pain inside of me
Like why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you God-sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneakin' glances thankin’ God that he drew you like that
Beautiful black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile, I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Count on your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your shame, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the Matrix
Before I had you this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed to grow some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessing that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heart
Beating you smart
'Cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions, you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Say she from the west side, mmmm
And she seen my best side, mmmm, mmm

268,Mercy,"Inside this fantasy, it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy, when her legs are open
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall
A fading memory, when my mind is frozen

(Let's go
Let's go)

I can see a frozen point in time
Where her figure still awaits
Tongue of fire tracing lips outline
Where frozen breath originates

With one motion of her wanting eyes
She strips everything away
This one moment is intensified
And the colors all fade to grey

I am in the only place that I want to be
Though we know that it ends eventually
But it's all right 'cause right now, we're frozen

""I want to forget mistakes they've helped me make
It's better to be broken than to break""

Inside this fantasy
It seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy, when her legs are open
True life behind the wall
Where men and angels fall
A fading memory, when my mind is frozen

(Let's go
Let's go)

I can see a frozen point in time
That is easy to retrace
Light and darkness are both intertwined
The elements are in their place

One motion of her wanting mind
The real world begins to fade
And all the hateful things I have become
Temporarily go away

Inside this fantasy
It seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy, when her legs are open
True life behind the wall
Where men and angels fall
A fading memory, when my mind is frozen
Frozen

When my mind's frozen
I'll take you anywhere you want to go
Far from anything that feels like home (Let's go)
You are anyone I want to be
(It's here and now, and now it's only you and me)

It's never enough (Mm, that's true)
I want to stay here (Yeah and I do too)
Breakin' it down (Takin' it down)
With smell, touch
Taste, sight and sound

How long will I be here without you near?

270,Cry Pretty,"[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keepin' it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Verse 2]
Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9""]
Ben Jordans giymem, Audemars saat takmam
Patlamalar yaratır molotoflar atarım
Hepiniz sanki hiç yıkanmamışçasına tüttürüyorsunuz
Ben araba egzozundan duman patlatırım
Davet edilmediğim partilere giderim, sokaklar bana ihtiyaç duyuyor gibi hissediyorum
Ferrari Spyder'ım C Breezy gibi hareket ettikçe dans etmeme gerek yok
Kiralık katil tutmaya ihtiyaç duymam
Onun yerine ayı satın alıp özgürce nefes almayı tercih ederim
Gökyüzü mavi, kravatım yeni
Maserati'm beyaz ve cool, G-Eazy gibi
Diğerleri freestyle'larımın nasıl da benim gibi uçtuğunu
Anlamaya çalışırken
Ben Kapri Styles ve Mya G'yi nasıl sikebilirim diye düşünüyorum
Herkes korkakça davranmakta
Büyük ihtimalle bu küçük adamları yumruk noktasında soyacağım
Hatırlayın eskiden herkes Nickel'ı taklit ederdi
Şimdi herkes Bitcoin peşinde
Bizim hiçbir ortak noktamız yok (Hayır)
Bizim hiçbir ortak noktamız yok (Hayır)
Hepiniz ikili Styrofoam bardaklarının peşindesiniz
Hepiniz uyuşturucu ve yatıştırıcılar peşindesiniz
Ben virgülleri çiftleme peşindeyim
Bana bu boktan işleri sayacak ve bu saçmalığı bitirecek
Sağlam bir kardeş bulun
Polisler bize tuzak kurduğunda, bokun üstüne sifon çekebiliriz
Sikimize takamayız, lanet olsun, sikik kolonik bir durum
Takipçi için sikinizi ve götünüzü satıyorsunuz
Herhalde birkaç dolar ile, toz kokusu üstünüzde
Şu an ise korunmasızsınız, buna güç gezisi deyin, birkaç politiğin ürünü bu
Hepiniz kazançlı bir halde listelerin tepesindeyken
Bir park kenarında bok çukuruna düştünüz
Tecrübe güçtür, ama ona sahipsen ve onu anlayamazsan güçsüzdür
Hepinizin müziği kulağıma sanki size Dr. Seuss ilham vermiş gibi geliyor
Striptizciler kiralanıyor, kaltaklar emekli oluyor
Sizin gelişmeniz için rap yapabiliriz
Ben kral olmak için uygunum, siz ise Prince'ın ortası kesik pantolonu gibisiniz
Siz zenciler --

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Diyorsun ki senin katillerle bağlantın varmış (ayy)
Senin şu takıldığın serserilik yapanlarla (gang)
Ama sen sadece taklitçi bir tetikçisin (gang)
Sanki bir bok yapabilecekmişsin gibi
Cesetlerin varmış gibi davranıyorsun (ayy)
Ve bir saygınlık elde etmişsin, küçük genç, saçmalıyorsun
Senin bir adli sicil kaydın bile yok pil ile bağlantılı olarak
Kaltak sen hiçbir prize takılmadın bile
Rap God lirikal mermiler yağdırmıştı (boom)
Ve siz silahlı abiler, partnerlerin silahlarını kuşansa iyi eder
Bunun kas gücü ile ilgisi yok
Ama silahlarınız vardır kesin, hadi çıkarın
Belinize bağlayın, başka bir deyişle
Eğer çetenle üstüme geleceksen bol cephaneli bir orduyla gelmen gerek
Çünkü bu cümleler aklının alamayacağı derecede
Yani eğer silah çekeceksen kolların olsa iyi olur (skrrt)
Oh, demek sokaklar senden sorulur ha?
Şimdi gelip benle sidik yarıştırıyorsun ha?
Bu küçük yarak sevici bayağı bir gaza gelmiş olmalı
Sert tavırlarını sürdürmek istiyor
Sonra bir düet yapıyor, Nina ile takım olmaya karar veriyor
Ama bir sonraki sefer, eğer bana bir hafif makineli tüfek ile saldıracaksan, Machine Gun
Tech N9ne'ı kullanmana gerek yok
Ve sana konuşuyorum, ama sen zaten ne sikim olduğunu çok iyi biliyorsun, Kelly
Ben öyle sübliminal kullanmam, gizli diss atmam
Ama kızım Hailie hakkında konuşmaya devam edersen
Ve her ihtimale karşı her boku unuttuysan, Ja Rule ilgili olayları hatırlamaya ihtiyacın olursa
Anılar çilek ya da ananas, kayısı reçeli gibi kavanozlanmışsa
Ben de konuşmaya devam edeceğim orospu evlatları
Ben nadiren yanıt veririm, ama bu sefer Shady fazlasıyla zinde
Sanki tetiği çekilmiş bir Glock gibi, yarı Tanrı gibi
Şu benim hakkımda basmakalıp konuşan zararsız sarı kafalı velete susturucu takmama izin verin
Hazır değilsin, aptal, artık pes et Rocksteady Crew gibi
Apaçık ortadaki, bunun üstesinden gelmiyorum
Redenbach gibi olay çıkarabiliriz, Remy Ma gibi sağa sola ateş edebiliriz
Fazlasıyla ağır silahlı, Godzilla, sert kabuklu ve acımasız
Bizarre'ın göbeğinden daha büyük bir kalp ile birlikte
Benim kaybettiğimi konuşabileceğin tek an Fetty Wap hakkında konuştuğun zamandır
Diddy'yi arasan iyi edersin, rahatlamama yardımcı olmak için
Ve Trick Trick'i aramamam için dua etsen iyi edersin
Kaltak, bu bok bizim şehrimizde takılamaz
Serseri velet, OG'lere saygısızlık etmeyeceksin, Prodigy huzur içinde yatsın
Dre'ye ruhumu sattım ve beni şirketine aldığında ona dedim ki
Ben en çok nefret edilen olacağım, yine de başardım
Yani ortada bir ayıp yok, sahip olmakta bir sorun yok
Çünkü hayat bir kaltak, çarpık bacaklı bir orospu
Ama artık o günler bitti
Ben önü açık gezen bornozlu Harvey Weinstein'ım
Benim kod adım gizli tacizci, losyonla role play yaparım
Tüm dünyayı sikeceğim ve üstüne Trojan atı salacağım
Ev yapımı patlayıcılarla kaltakları eğlendireceğim
Üstünde seksen delik açacağım
Beni zorlamayın, ben flowları katlederim, ve
Hasara hakaret ederim, Rolaids'ten Goldman'e
Dre'ye Motrin atarım, Nicole'u boğazlarım
Her ikisi de boğulmak için oradayken ve tüm tabaklarım ıslanırken
Ben iki tarafı da sivri bir kılıcım, yani bir mekana adım attığımda
Kılıcı sokarım ve dönme hareketiyle döndürürüm
Kalemle görünmezim, hastalıklı davranışların son noktasındayım
Sikimi sokarım ve minimal muazzamlıklar sunarım
Bu heceleri sikiyorum, genital bölgemi yalamalarına izin veriyorum
Ben yenilmezim, affedilmezim, zorlu bir kalleşim
Az biraz da tahmin edilemezim, ben harikuladeliği rapliyorum
İşte kaltaklar, orijinalde uğraştığınız kişi bu
Ben kendimi ve Nickel'ı eş sayıyorum, ama sizi değil
Ortak tek noktamız ben bir yarrağım ve siz de yalıyorsunuz
Bunun haricinde bunlardan birinin diğeriyle hiçbir alakası yoktur
Kokarca, böcek, asker
Dil, çalı, omuz, bir ay büyük
Sünger, çete, daha soğuk, hiçbiri, kilim, tabanca kılıfı
Bijon somunu, bardak altlığı, akciğer, güveçte kavurma
Young Thug posteri, fişten çekilmiş tost makinesi

You got it all twisted
I checked out a long time ago
Texting, you missed it
Touch it, had enough that
She got you sprung
So I pulled up, they start a case of charity
After you begging me, begging for company
Never needed you, you only needed me
All that talk just to settle being weak
Had too much tequila, so save that shit for the next one
It goes in one ear, and out the next one
Said you put me out, why you lying?
I left on my own, had you crying
I was tryna keep your bidness silent
Tried to keep the peace instead of being violent
Thought we squashed the bygones and remained friends?
Truth be told, you're the one that's high maintenance
Let's be real, I threw you out
¿El a-El anillo pa' cuándo?
But your time ran out

Mike WiLL the one who made it

[Verse 1]
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I’m turnin’ back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia’s an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin’ you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are
Looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause damn it I'm still the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world

So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)
Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, ""DIE ANTWOORD!""
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo!)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book!
No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers
I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's-snot gonna ever

But I'm the greatest

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips got the sig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Prr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling

You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring

In my own way, this feel like living
Some alternate reality
And I was drowning, but now I'm swimming
Through stressful waters to relief

I'll prolly never even tell myself

I wish it was nice out, but it look like rain

(Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, how do I keep
(Man, I don't know what’s up with these hoes, man)
Gettin' in relationships like this?
(I'm just sayin’)
Maybe it says somethin' about me
(Yeah, yup)
Should I look in the mirror?

[Chorus 1]
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together

[Verse 1]
She thinks I'm bein’ mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She’s about to let the demons out
She don't wanna see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin’ to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how—

[Chorus 2]
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
I guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein’ weird's normal

[Verse 2]
And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over
Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted
Up with someone so unlikable and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene?
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't s'posed to agree, you fucking bitch!
'Specially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo flip me off
Right out the passenger side window (*Beep-beep*)
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5 a.m. in the drive in a stretched white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye, so shut your pie hole

Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal? (Yeah)

282,Stepping Stone,"[Intro]
Take me to the river
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof—wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group
Shoot!

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 2]
It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel
And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in
Been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me, Biz, ""Rockstar"" was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
More than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET
And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 3]
Bacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops, little drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed
All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none
I just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this
To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you men
But I just can't be the guy everybody depends
On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era
I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air
I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road
Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones",Eminem,Eminem,2018,[42],1

Been textin' you since three, I still get no fucking reply
You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
Fuck you goin' in those knee-high boots? Cut it out, bitch
I doubt that you're goin' to house sit
In that outfit, and those skin-tight Levi's
Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
You say don't come over 'cause you got pink eye

284,Good Guy,"[Verse: Eminem]
İşte tekrar kahramanlardan döndük kötü adamlara
Eskiden Romeo'ndum, bir kaç kez de terkettik birbirimizi
Yüzleşmemiz gereken kötü durumlar oluşmuştu
Ama bu birlikte bunları aşabileceğimiz umudunu verdi bana
Kesik bir kulak memesini sana zarf içinde göndersem iyi olabilir
Fakat sen ne kadar zorlardın sınırları benim için?
Aynı Vincent van Gogh'un yaptığı gibi yapmak, sırf bir kaltağı ikna etmek için
Düpedüz yalan söyleyen bir ev hanımı olmak
Kör kütük sarhoş, şimdi benden tam ters istikamette uzaklaşıyor
Dışarı çıktım, neden bu kadar kötü davranıyor
Kız benim boylarımda, ağzıma iki tane vuruyor
Beyler, uğruna öleceğiniz biri
Kalbinize bir hançer saplasa, daha fazla çabalar mısınız?
Başka bir gece yarısı, kapımın önünde yalpaladı
Günışığı girsin içeri ve bizim tüm yaptığımız daha fazla kavga etmek
Ve ben şiddet uygulamıyorum, ama o çekmeceme doğru gidiyor
İçine K-Y yerleştirmek için
St. Ides gibi kokan ve büyük ihtimalle beş erkekle daha sikişen
Sekiz dokuz erkeğe sakso çeken bir kaltak tarafından suçlanıyorum
Baltamı alıp çerçevelerimize doğru gidiyorum
Kaltak evet çerçeveden yok ettiğim sensin, ben kazandım
Yeni bir yüksek skor elde ediyorum, içinde olduğum bu oyunda benle yarış
Arkadaşlarımla buluşacağın zaman bağırsakların hareket ettiğinde
Götünü silmen için sana 2 katlı bir peçete bırakıyorum
Yeminimizi tekrarladığımızda elde ettiğim şey bu mu olacaktı?
Şunu söyleyeceğin günü bekliyorum
""Marshall, ben ne kadar da kaltakmışım, ve işte yeni bir çocuk, sen onun yerine geçeceksin.""
Yumurtalıklarını bağlattın onun için, memelerine silikon yaptırdın onun için
Beni derinden yaralıyor, ama senden sonra yaşadığım bu acı
Yemin ederim ki gri gökyüzünü bitireceğim
Işık hüzmeleri geliyor rüzgar gibi, ödeme zammı alacaksın
Ben iyi adam mıyım yoksa sadece öyleymiş gibi mi davranıyorum?
Ve o erkeğin kıçına tekmeyi basacağına dair olan umudum?
Hayalimin gerçekleşmesi olur, sana ""Siktir git!"" diye bağırabilirim
Zar atarken yaptığın gibi bir hayata son veriyorsun sanırım
Çünkü sen bana bakıyorsun ve o ufak yılanları gözlerinde yuvarlıyorsun

[Chorus/Outro: Jessie Reyez]
Jüriyi avucuna aldığından beri, bana suçlusun diyorlar
Bana suçlusun diyorlar
Jüriyi avucuna aldığından beri, bana suçlusun diyorlar
Gerçek beni bildiğin halde bile
Aldatan olamazsın, inançsızı bile inandırırsın
Ve ben hislerimde değilim, ben yokum
Ama sana iyi bir adam olduğunu söyleyeyim
Çünkü aşk böyle bir şeye benzemiyor
Aldatan olamazsın, inançsızı bile inandırırsın
Ve ben hislerimde değilim, ben yokum
Ama sana iyi bir adam olduğunu söyleyeyim
Onlar ""Sen iyi adamsın."" diyor
Onlar, onlar, onlar, ""Sen iyi adamsın."" diyor",Genius Türkçe Çeviri,Eminem Featuring Jessie Reyez,2018,[67],1

Tryna see if shawty on my dick, wonder what she doin'
You know me, real G, I text ask her, ""How it's goin'""
She responded nothin', lookin' like to me you havin' fun
Look for my mama when I try to look inside my woman
Told my bae, ""I wish I woulda found you back when I was bummin'""
Stayed away from all the bullshit, them niggas said I'm runnin'
Time passed over now you see that I was chasin' money
Posted on Maryland, me and Von, his mama tearin' just once
Know you seen up in the parish, like check it out that's my lil' youngin'
Nigga don't wanna sell me a brick of dope, act like my money funny

Tryna run me up a check, late nights, early mornings
Diamonds 'round my neck, they really wet, I could've copped a foreign
Givenchy shoes, I came a long way from Ralph Lauren
Cut off my ex because my new bitch put that pussy on me
They watchin' every move I make, I guess I'm settin' trends
I had to focus on the check, told myself, ""Fuck a friend""
Committed crimes so many times but I don't give a damn
I are who you say I am
Posted on high street, me and roof 'cause we been really thuggin'
Convicted felon with a dirty pistol, bitch I'm steady clutchin'
No drama sittin' in my cell like check out my lil' cousin
Can't trust these hoes because I know they come a dime a dozen
RIP to Quahfee, know my nigga at them Heaven gates
She ain't never really made love, I'm him just like Kevin Gates

20 of 'em comin', I switched to another spot
Reversible stock carbon, a new convertible drop
I was gambling with shawty, I put some work on the block
I tested her, she held a lil' quarter bird at her spot
I ain't into bustin' down a Rollie, bustin' down on bales
Don't wanna fuck me, I won't argue baby, oh well
The 18 Willard, the lever get 'em movin' mils
Millionaire dollar bond in 30 minutes and I made bail
I graduated, the square's outta town, at the room cookin' at the hotel (yeah, yeah)
Aux is outta reach, I'ma move the race car (Vroom)
Hated on us and they know who they are
Still livin' large as I aim for the stars
I'm a BreadWinner don and I came from the slums
I got a stain on my arm, weather through the storm
If I tell you that I love you then you can't do nothin' wrong
Surrounded by steppers, I got control in this bitch
I'll book you for a show and get you showed in this bitch
Tell that curb boy Trell I love you with all my heart
Now we ride around in Wraiths with a push button start (vroom)

Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other

Get along, on down the road

Get along while we can

Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Verse 2]
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die

Elle lui parlera quand elle sera dans la matrice

[Couplet 1: Juice WRLD]
Merde, pourquoi est-elle si démoniaque ?
C'est Medusa avec un air de Pocahontas
Elle a dû ajouter des substances à mes médocs
Car chaque fois qu'on est ensemble, je suis inconscient
Attends, laisse-moi être honnête
Je sais que je l'ai vue mettre du Percocet dans mon herbe
Fumer jusqu'à ce que mes yeux soient noirs comme lors d'un mauvais présage
Juste un autre enterrement pour elle, putain

Rock stars, c'est notre style, ces mecs-là ne supportent pas (ouais)

T'es basique, tu roules dans une Ferrari toute neuve pendant que moi, je fais la course (ouais)
Je m'adapte, je te laisse rouler mon herbe ; s'il te plaît, n'ajoute rien dedans (ouais)
C'est les fesses de cette salope que tu cours après (ouais)
Étrangère avec moi, c'est une dominatrice (woah)
J'aime cette fille et j'aime son corps
""Je ne veux pas l'argent, je veux juste de la Molly""
Voilà ce qu'elle disait quand elle vivant dans la Valley
P'tit gars, j'suis ton papa, hakuna matata
J'ai fait en sorte que cette fille donne tout ce qu'elle a
Je craignais Dieux dans ma tête, je priais pour mettre ma bite dans sa bouche
J'ai frappé depuis l'arrière, mes jambes ont commencé à se refermer
Jacuzzi sur son boule, j'ai donné à cette fille un stimulant
Je prends des champi qui continuent à modifier mon chakra
J'ai une rose sur ma chaîne en or , pas d'espion ou de flic
J'ai des tatouages sur mon front, comme si j'étais un avatar
C'est pour ça que je roule sur mon Appa

Et elle ne sait pas qu'en moi vivent tous ses démons, non

Je ne sais pas ce qu'elle a pris, je ne sais pas
Toute cette Lean que je bois, maintenant, regarde-moi la servir

‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too

Make my way through the motions, I try to ignore it
But home's looking farther the closer I get
Don't know why I can't see the end
Is it over yet? Hmm
A short leash and a short fuse don't match

So I just hold my breath
Don't know why I can't see the sun when young should be fun

Can't find pieces of my peace of mind

But I can't lie to myself, to anyone

Can't run back to my youth the way I want to
The days my brother was quicker to fool
AM radio, not much to do
Used monsters as an excuse to lie awake
Now the monsters are the ones that I have to face

I wanna make it acapella—wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
And re-develop, Hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind; I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights
They're just too high to reach
And I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire meat pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it
Better not use me as your topic
Anybody who brings me up, duck it
Let me keep it 100
Two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband
Last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah

[Chorus: Labrinth]
Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (Oh, oh)
Whatever you want, you can have from me (Oh, oh)
I want your love, just lead me on
Won't give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey

Ayo, as the world turns, the blunt burns
(Who you gettin' at, Nicki?)
Watch them cunts learn
Fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn
I move keys, but you hoes get one turn
Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn
I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back, now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle, I ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't givin', so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to give men my body
(He gotta be king status to get in ya body?)

Yo, you can't wear a Nicki wig and then be Nicki
That's like a fat nigga thinkin' he can be Biggie
One rough ride, now you DMX and Swizzy
One hot video, you Hype? Nah, you just giddy
You made one dope beat, now you Kanye?
You got a nigga named JAY, now you 'Yoncé?
You got about three stacks, now you André?
You put a part in your fade, yeah, you Nas, bae
You gotta have real skill, gotta work for that
If it's really your passion, would you give the world for that?
Unlike a lot of these hoes, whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat, and tears in perfectin' my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day
I’m Kobe, KD, Kyrie, pick a K

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?

You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her
But never turn your back on her
'Cause they did not create commandments
When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be

Stay out of court when you got the attorney

And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?

Got ya nose


18 but I’m rapping like I been here
Philadel
Who can tell
You know I gotta win here

Tryna get my own
No more asking mom and pop
Dance when I’m feeling good
Woah
Pop and lock


I’m a king right now
Check the prophecy
Thinking y’all can compete
Is comedy

Lafnotfamous
Man I gotta be
Everytime I’m around
I always hear a lot of me

It would be nice if I hit the lottery
But I’m not waiting
I rather work for it
No robbery


I rather go for it
Everyday comin
I’m walking to the end
Y’all can get tired running

No more playing games
No more rapping lames
Y’all all sound the same


But that’s what’s gettin money
Just know y’all can’t taking nothing from me
Karma is a female dog
And the rest is coming

I work everyday to get better
This not a hobby for me
I’m just lucky
It makes cheddar


Everyday I get a little better
I just want world peace
No throwing elbows
Metta

Shoutout nasir
Cause my rhymes are too wavy
Tryna get my pockets fat
Cause I’m slim like shady



Last line let me make this worth ya time
Y’all been putting out trash all this summer
What do you think of mine",Lafnotfamous,J. Cole,2018,[87],1

Fighting over your deeds, sliding over your keys (Ooh)

Somebody give me, uh
Somebody tell me the answers
Me and you isn't the answer (Uh)
Me and you isn't (No)

Remember?
Remember the night in Miami?
First time you put your arms around me
I'm up reminiscin' (Ooh, yeah)
And thinking 'bout you isn't helping
Thinking 'bout you doesn't tell me
What good it would do if I decide to face the truth

[Bridge: H.E.R.]
It could've been right, but I was wrong
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone
You only hit me up when she's not home

What we could've been
What we should've been
If I wasn't, if I wasn't with somebody
If you gotta hide it, what's the point of trying?
I ain't just your friend, no, what's the point of lying?
Tryna sell a story ain't nobody buyin'
Look me in my eyes, don't that feel nice?
Why should it end? Baby, I could've been
I could've been him, more than your friend
Just say where and when, where to make a trip

Breaking up or letting go
Girl's just like Rock-n-Roll

I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee

I cauterize you with the flame quick
Cause I ain’t authorize you to say shit
Them awful rhymes you just pasted
After you copied, your attitude washy
Who the fuck is this rapper dude Bobby?

This ain’t a blunt but you’re facing Ls
I hate to tell you, you ain’t got a chance
You’re like 40, still not a man

Man this fool got no flow
I’m not a fan of the rhythm, I eat this fool

This cannibalism, this man is my victim
He’s lacking precision
Watch him get to vanishing quicker
I chop em up like animal liver
Even with sandals I’ll kick you
Need some bandage and stitches
I’m about to have Campbell’s for dinner

You smoke trees? I bet all along you’ve been boofin’
Beat me with the bat quick? Nah I’ll hit you with the batman

Yeah cause you’re a fucking joker you moronic clown
Tryna call me out just quiet down
Maybe we can find some common ground
We both rap, but you’re seriously awful pal
Dissing me over a can of soup
Nah damn it dude, what advantage do you have?
That recording was weak, weak as fuck, what mic did you use?
Apple headphones? Yet you claim you freestyled in the booth
I’ll introduce my little truth, you better with comply with the rules
Or I’ll display your head over the fire like a moose

You look like a washed out chronic masturbator
Thinking you Blaine? You ain’t magic David
All you are is a half assed complacent

Put this chrome to your dome I’m smoking ya
Bitch dissing young rappers, you’re grown how old are ya?
You’d be better off drinking a cup full of ammonia
Dispatch my diss track on your bitch ass
Can’t withstand the whiplash from my sick raps
It didn’t take me a month to drop, but regardless of this shit
It’s quality over quickness, it’s honestly ridiculous
Like you recorded a wack song and didn’t mix it
Listen, stop with dissin'
Don’t copy my rhythm
I jot with precision
Why the hell you hatin? On my generation?
Cause you live with your mom, stayed in her basement and just never made it
You’re irrelevant nameless, step into danger
A pessimist wasted
This my detrimental creation
Better get him away to
A medical station
What you think I spit slow, I can read cursive fast
And observing facts, this kid’s dyslexic
I murder this fuck in a millisecond
Don’t care where he goes, if it’s hell or heaven

350,One Day,"[Refrão: Ryan Tedder]
E talvez um dia eu seja mais sábio
Porque talvez um dia eu vou estar mais longe daqui
Coloco toda a minha fé no amanhã
Dias escuros me mantêm acordado a noite toda
A única coisa que eu sei, tudo vai ficar —
Bem

[Verso 1: Logic]
Você já se perguntou o que significa conseguir por qualquer meio e, finalmente, obter os seus sonhos
Na ascensão, onde eles correm de um mundo de muitos demônios
Eu tenho feito isso desde adolescente, ganhando esse dinheiro, ganhando o creme
Trabalho duro e sacrifício, mas não sabe muito o que significa
A maioria desses rappers não tem nenhuma classe como ameaças de bomba
E estar descolado é uma doença, é o início
E não importa onde você está
Se você é branco ou negro
Se você é rico ou pobre, nós vamos sempre querer mais
Mas uma coisa eu posso ter certeza, enquanto eu tenho o chão
Eu vou usar esse poder para pintar uma imagem de união
E sim, eu estou representando com essa energia como se fosse dois de mim
Foda-se as luzes e as câmeras, agora é só você e eu

[Ponte 1: Logic e (Ryan Tedder)]
Um dia (um dia)
Eu vou ser mais rico do que eu era antes
Um dia (um dia)
Eu vou ter dinheiro suficiente para comprar uma loja
Um dia (um dia)
Como Sinatra disse que você sabe que eu estou fazendo do meu jeito
Você está na estrada para o sucesso, eu peguei a rodovia

[Refrão: Ryan Tedder]
E talvez um dia eu seja mais sábio
Porque talvez um dia eu vou estar mais longe daqui
Coloco toda a minha fé no amanhã
Dias escuros me mantêm acordado a noite toda
A única coisa que eu sei, tudo vai ficar —
Bem

[Verso 2: Logic]
Sentindo abençoado como se eu estivesse em massa
Sim, eu estou indo te dar um jeito
O jogo esteve quebrado por muito tempo, então eu acho que eu sou o escolhido
Fora da seção 8, finalmente encontrei um pouco de grama mais verde
Tão à frente do meu tempo, eu não nasci no passado
Isso aqui é uma dose dupla com Logic e Ryan Tedder
Oh não, não poderia ficar melhor
E você sabe, você sabe que nós fazemos isso pelas crianças
Eu nunca pensei que veria o dia em que faria um milhão
Alguns anos depois, parece que todos o sentem
Eu não quis me gabar nessa última linha
Mas contar dinheiro sempre foi o meu passatempo favorito
Especialmente com um passado como o meu
Drogas no domicílio
Nunca tive uma mão para segurar
Mesmo quando eu era sem-teto no frio escaldante, mas eu consegui me virar
E se eu posso, você pode, sem dúvida
Eu sei —

[Ponte 2: Logic e (Ryan Tedder)]
Um dia (um dia)
Eu vou fazer como eu nunca fiz isso
Um dia (um dia)
Eu vou ter a coragem de sair e conquistar
Um dia (um dia)
Fazer o que eu amo e apoiar a minha garota (um dia)
Eu vou sacudir o mundo inteiro

[Refrão: Ryan Tedder]
E talvez um dia eu seja mais sábio
Porque talvez um dia eu vou estar mais longe daqui
Coloco toda a minha fé no amanhã

(Um dia)
Todos tentam apagar minha luz
A única coisa que eu sei que vai ficar tudo bem (um dia)
Todos tentam apagar minha luz
A única coisa que eu sei que vai ficar tudo bem (um dia)
Sigo tentando dizer a mim mesmo toda manhã que as coisas serão melhores (um dia)
Sigo tentando dizer a mim mesmo que amanhã o clima será diferente

Eu acordei como Chris Breezy, oh meu Deus, eu sou o cara
Eu sou tão foda e eu danço bem
Tenho tatuagens no meu pescoço
Acabei de fazer uma vídeochamada com o Kanye
Falei pra ele que sou seu maior fã
Tenho todas essas putas nas minhas DMs
Puta merda, eu tenho uma filha
Ohhh, eu posso cantar tão bem
Me pergunto se eu posso usar a palavra com ""n""?
Espera, eu posso mesmo usar a palavra com ""n""?

(Ring ring) Que porra é essa?
Eu acordei e sou o Lil Dicky
Ugh, que porra é essa?
Essa merda é muito fraca
Como o pau dele fica pendurado nas bolas desse jeito?
Descendo a rua e ninguém sabe o meu nome
Sem paparazzis tirando fotos, isso é ótimo
Ninguém me julgando por ser negro ou pelo meu passado controverso
Eu vou assistir um filme e relaxar
Ayy, eu sou um Blood mas posso finalmente usar azul
Por que a mãe dele fica ligando o tempo todo?
Me deixa em paz, vadia
Espera, se eu estou no corpo do Dicky, o Breezy é quem?
Espero que minha filha esteja na escola
Porra, se eu fosse o Chris Brown, onde eu estaria?
O que eu faria?

Meu pau tá em tendência no twitter? Caralho
Agora eu estou no club, tentei achar um jeito de entrar
Olho na área VIP, minha nossa, lá estou eu
Eu sinalizo pra ele me deixar entrar mas ele não deixa
Eu não sei quem é esse
Espera, que porra ele pensa que ele é?
Peguei uma garrafa de vidro e quebrei na cabeça do segurança
Andei até o filho da puta
Espera, pense por um segundo
Se você me machucar só vai machucar a si mesmo

I ain't no activist, I'm the protagonist
I don't co-captain it, I fly solo like one cup in the cabinet
The cab is the cabinet, they trust me at landing it
They call me the advocate, they'll slide like the abacus
Boy meets world, everybody been savages
I just want to really know how much that your shooter averages
I'm not no nice guy, I'm just the good guy
The bad guys should really stay on my good side
I smelled my roses younger than the good die
The Illuminati couldn't see me with they good eye
They think they Heath Ledger scary, they just Jack Nichols
I'm a sign to my city like the Bat-Signal
Young chosen one, golden boy, De La Hoya
It ain't too many me's, rest in peace to Verne Troyer
I was younger than I seemed as a kid
I mean my G17 18 in the head
I mean I'm only 25 but I'm Motown 25
Bet I get a statue in my hometown when I die
And Rahm, you done, I'm expectin' resignation
An open investigation on all of these paid vacations for murderers

I don't get no paper, I gotta sign at the bottom
Still in my bag like the fries at the bottom
And I can't do nothing right, they gon' always be at me
I missed a Crain's interview, they tried leaking my addy
I donate to the schools next, they call me a deadbeat daddy
The Sun-Times gettin' that Rauner business
I got a hit-list so long I don't know how to finish
I bought the Chicagoist just to run you racist bitches out of business
Speaking of racist, fuck your microaggressions
I'll make you fix your words like a typo suggestion
Pat me on the back too hard and Pat'll ask for your job
And in unrelated news, someone'll beat your ass at your job
I'm the real deal
Who taught all these rappers that a big deal's not a big deal?
Inherited the earth, popping wheelies on a big wheel
My enemy lives in his mother's basement
That's why my videos don't got no Baphomet product placement
I'm a real one
The honey is sweet, the apple's bitter
They'll try to convince you you stronger without your woman than when you with her
And tell you they kidding while Twitter trashing your litter
I know the devil's a liar
I know that players is quitters, I heard you hire your hitters
I know the higher the bidder, that mean the less on return
So I just hire a sitter
I'm not no boss nigga, I'm a soldier

Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

You know what is on my mind, all I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (Bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (Wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne (Haan) when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes
When I was with Ms. Creighton, that lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favourites, it feels amazin' (Yeah)

Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This a life bid we can never separate

All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be

Unh, regarde
Je suis un vrai individu rare
Je suis dans le physique et le métaphysique (ouais)
Je sais que vous avez besoin de votre temps seul, c'est essentiel
Mais j'ai besoin de votre temps, est-ce que je suis hypocrite?
Tu sais que je peux relier avec vous plus qu'avec ma famille
Donc je ne vais pas m'asseoir et te laisser couler dans les sables mouvants
Je sais que vous avez des plans de millions de dollars
Et vous essayez de construire une marque, vivre une vie en forte demande
Détourant des grands Bs, votre sac a des petits Gs
Gucci jusqu'aux chaussettes comme Biggie et Little Ceas
Allons aux Maldives et cachons-nous derrière des palmiers
Petit vin rouge, mauvaise herbe et une brise calme
Car bébé, tu vis la vie à l'intérieur d'une bulle
Quand était la dernière fois que vous avez eu quelqu'un qui vous embrasse?
Quand était la dernière fois que vous avez eu quelqu'un qui vous aime?
Quand était la dernière fois que vous avez aimé quelqu'un qui vous aime?

367,Everything's Gonna Be Alright,"[Verse 1]
She rattled the ice in my plastic cup
I said ""yes m'am"", fill her up
Tell me something good that I don't know
'Cause this world's been kicking my behind
Life ain't been a friend of mine
Lately I've been feeling kinda low

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And she looked back over her shoulder
Pointed at the sign hanging up on the wall
It said

[Chorus]
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
And nobody's gotta worry 'bout nothing
Don't go hittin' that panic button
It ain't worth spilling your drink
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright

[Verse 2]
So I nodded my head and said, ""that's for sure""
Dropped a few bucks in the mason jar
Felt those good old neon vibes on me
And whatever monkey that was on my back
He jumped off just like that
Right into the deep blue sea

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I looked back over her shoulder
Thinking 'bout the sign hanging up on the wall
That said

I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose

California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues

I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlamagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me, it ain't dirty words

And now I'd rather know ahead of time
You said ""I love you"" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see you likin' someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?

[Chorus]
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezin' outside
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said ""I love you"" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

[Verse 2]
I kept it decent, I kept you sane
I kept it peaceful, don't lie
I kept it decent, even the secrets
Kept it between you and I

Never had me missin' a beat
That's just a view from a cheap seat
They don't want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap; nowadays, it's free

— What I'm sayin', in today really at our big, big age if you're gettin' with someone right now and you're linking them for couple weeks, they should know 'This is the girl I kinda want to see' so lemme lock off the ting but obviously in the world that we live in today is not like that

Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence

Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh
Dying young, uh, demon youth

What's the 27 Club? We ain't making it past 21
I been going through paranoia, so I always gotta keep a gun
Damn, that's the world we live in now
Yeah, hold on, just hear me out
They tell me I'ma be a legend, I don't want that title now
'Cause all the legends seem to die out, what the fuck is this 'bout?
I'm tryna make it out, I'm tryna change the world
I'm tryna take her out, I'm tryna take your girl
More importantly, I'm tryna change the world
Maybe flex with some diamonds and pearls, yeah

387,Is There More,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is ""Where the rest of my commas?""
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Is there more? Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, ""How Does It Feel?""
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?

Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (High)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willin' and ready for the takin'
Earth-shatterin', groundbreakin'
Headscarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down

I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now, we’re one now

390,March 14,"Next on shuffle is the track March 14 by Drake

A remixed R&b beat comes on as a base for the rap
He starts rapping on what it seems to be father issues
He heard he has a baby with a girl that isn't really his lover, maybe slept with her a couple times
Ended up getting her pregnant, he doesn't want to be a single father though so he gotta show some support for the womans
Gotta arc up with the responsibilities so whatever if the DNA came out positive, get to see 'em again maybe
Thinking about the future when the kid grows up, he hears about how big he's getting, God willing he'll grow up to be a good spirited man. He'll take him to meet his grandfather and actually be present in the kids life, but he's gotta give it a break until he's old enough to hear the track cause he is probably busy

Changing from boy to a man. Ain't no use crying about it, gotta man up. Realize that the boy doesn't have anyone to rely on but the father. So that's the big change. Do it on your own without crying for help, whatever it takes put the roof over the kids head and that's what matters, in the end. That's what makes a man",James Kirk Bogucheski,Drake,2018,[57],1

397,Me Niego,"Es difícil abrir mis ojos y ya no verte
Tu olor en la cama, aún sigue intacto
Te he buscado en mis sueños, deseando tenerte
Y no encuentro tu rostro, por más que trato
Aún quedan tus retratos, en cada rincón de la casa
Y el silencio me habla de ti, es que solo hay tanto espacio
Desde que no estás, daría todo lo que hoy me queda
Por tenerte, por que vuelvas
Es que me niego a perderte, a más nunca verte
Me niego a aceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabó
Es que me niego a perderte, a más nunca verte
Me niego a aceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabó
No puedo asimilar
Que ya tú no estás, sin ti nada es igual
Sé que por el mundo no hay otra similar
Que tú me hiciste que no te puedo olvidar
Tú me quieres a tu manera
Mi mente quisiera, que otra me quisiera
Mi corazón dice que por ti espera
Por que volvieras, daría lo que fuera
Pero es que tú chica, con ese piquete
Sé que me olvidaste y en tus ojos veo que mientes
Ahora puedo decir, sufrir amor lo que se siente
Te sacaré de mi mente y eso será de repente
Pero es que tú, chica, con ese piquete
Sé que me olvidaste y en tus ojos veo que mientes
Ahora puedo decir, sufrir amor lo que se siente

Y es que me niego a perderte, a más nunca verte
Me niego a aceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabó
Es que me niego a perderte, a más nunca verte
Me niego a aceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabó
Me está matando la soledad
Duele saber que ya no estás
Quiero pensar, que todo
Esto es mentira
Y que al llamarte contestarás
Y que al llegar la noche me besarás
Aún podemos intentarlo
No te alejes de mi vida
Yo sigo aquí confundido y solo
Llorando de noche, muriendo de día
Viviendo esta agonía, no puedo entender
Que ya no seas mía, el circulo se cierra
Y el dolor me entierra
Qué difícil es vivir en esta guerra
Me niego, aunque digas que estoy ciego
Desde que te fuiste soy un andariego
A todo compromiso tarde le llego
Distraído de tu foto no me despego
Si tú eres mi vida, por qué me liquidas
Yo no provoqué tu partida
Necesito tu olor, necesito tu calor
Necesito verte encima de mi en ropa interior
Aún quedan tus retratos, en cada rincón de la casa
Y el silencio me habla de ti, es que solo hay tanto espacio
Desde que no estás, daría todo lo que hoy me queda
Por tenerte, por que vuelvas
Es que me niego a perderte, a más nunca verte

Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that'll blow a bitch mind frame
My brain can't fathom what the hate say
He say, she say, how 'bout me say?
Get the Vis-a, headed to the islands A-S-A-P
What's that on my shawty wrist? That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feelin' like ET, flyin' out of the Addy
Fuckin' on shawty, she baddie, casual convo then at it
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lyin'
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine

399,I Lived It,"[Verse 1]
Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Crisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand
Where them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it

[Verse 2]
Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them ol' Duke boys were flattening the hills
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawn mower around
I'd go back there right now

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am

You wouldn't know to love it like I love it

Without no coat I was walkin' and meditatin' in the rain
Reminiscing about bein' in prison, I was locked in them chains
Without no drugs I was workin' and stimulatin' my brain
I ain't gotta act how I was actin', everything done changed
I was missing out on plenty shit, just watchin' time fly past
I was broke, down on my dick, I had to get me a bag
Havin' shootouts broad day and we was runnin' from task
I put my flex down, never sit down, I told that bitch I'll never stand down
Creepin' on your block with a hundred rounds
Go to shoot and try to run
Hop out the whip and we gon' run you down
Shoot him dead up his head, knock off his dreads
Now he can't make a sound
Kill him where he stand, we live by law and we gon' lay it down
Tell me he want smoke, 187, that's that same shit
.357 send you to hell, knock out your brain quick
Sippin' on this drank, RIP Fredo, this that bang shit
Doin' the same thing, time pass, got a bitch with a fat ass
I told her turn around and bust it open
That Soulja Slim, that C Murder, come in the tank just like a No Limit soldier
I'm poppin' X so I'm steady rollin'
Say he a gangster, got his chest out
When I hit him with this Glock I bet I fold him
None of these niggas ain't never play with me
Play with me, I bet you see
Fuck that Twitter beefin', you want beef, I pull up where you sleep
Bitch I'm out the North, 38 Baby, I come from the streets
Two clips on that chopper for to stretch you when we fuckin' meet
Got 'em all boxed in at the location, the police movin' in
People tryna catch me with a pistol just to turn me in
Same shit you did to go to jail, don't do that shit again
Bitch I'm screamin' fuck it, never change, thuggin' to the end
I got a question, tell me what these niggas hatin' for?
Why they steady sayin' they gon' snatch my chain though?
You want to rap, how you gon' think without a brain though?
Take gunpowder out a bullet, put some crack, now this that 'caine flow
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (shoot 'em up yeah, yeah)
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (fill 'em up yeah, yeah)

Send your ass to the devil, in an envelope like a letter

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me

You blamed it all on the alcohol

I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps

Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption

Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then that's what it gotta be

Who gon' pray for me?

Even with a rose gold Concept on me
I remember summer nights in the projects
Bullet rounds interrupting my Chi
When the worst thing that could happen

In Bel-Air, only the nights get cold
I wrapped a yellow jacket 'round Bey
It's not lost on me, music has my kids sound asleep

Everybody want world peace
'Til your niece get shot in the dome-piece
Then you go and buy your own piece
Hopin' it'll help you find your own peace
Bring light to what they don't see
Auntie cryin' on the concrete
Talkin' to dispatcher then the phone beep
On the other line was the homies
Told her that you ain't comin' home, see
When she heard the news it hurt her bone-deep
Caught with the rifle with the long reach
Just another cycle of the lonely
All growin' up in environment
Where doin' crime the requirement
They send us off to prison for retirement
Hopefully Alice Johnson will inspire men

Paid this shit just gon' give up, 'cause Ye just gon' live up
To everything that sucks to you and that's never enough

I like breakfast in bed, but I love breakfast and head
For anybody who said that I was better off dead
Told 'em, ""Don't ever believe nothin' that you ever read""
Got a Bible by my bed, oh yes, I'm very Christian
Constantly repentin', 'cause, yes, I never listen
Don't like bein' questioned and don't like bein' less than
Any a competition in any of my professions
So I gotta guess then, I gotta stay the best man

That you ain't seen in a minute, called on the telephone
And when they see you they say, “Damn you got hella grown
Always thought you'd make it, but damn now you hella known""

How we made enough bread for us to put some relish on

Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

This is a Golden Remix
King

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Calculan que relaciones que fracasan
Mayormente es por desengaño
Falsedad que contamina y hace daño
Tú fuiste perfecto clavel que con mis manos marchité
Mi obra se llama ""Romeo sin Julieta otra vez""
Puedes pensar ""Soy el rey de las mentiras, volvería a fallar""
Aunque lo jure por mi vida
Mis palabras no importan ni valen ni de rodilla na' 'e na'
Dice que ha visto muchas novelas, el actor debe llorar

[Pre-Coro: Romeo Santos]
No, ¿ahora qué hago?
Ozuna y yo somos farsantes, nos ahogamo' en el fracaso
No, no juro en vano
Jamás yo vuelvo a ser infiel con chapiadoras, yo te amo
No, escúchame esa pena que siento
Voy a hacer otro disco con Aventura y te lo dedico enterito

[Coro: Ozuna, Romeo Santos]
Bebé, si todavía me amas como ante'
Ya nada me parece interesante
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé
Si todavía me amas como antes
Ya nada me parece interesante
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé

[Verso 2: Ozuna]
Yo sin ti yo no me vuelvo a enamorar
No sé ni qué pensar
Ya sé por qué todo me sale mal
Mentí diciéndote que era leal
Siendo un amor real, le pido a Dios me pueda perdonar
No quiero que te vaya', vamo' a intentarlo
¿Por qué no salvamos nuestra relación?
Tú sabe', bebé
Perdona, bebé

[Coro: Romeo Santos, Ozuna]
Ey, bebé
Si todavía me amas como antes
Ya nada me parece interesante
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé (ehhh)
Si todavía me amas como ante'
Ya nada me parece interesante (-sante)
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé

[Verso 3: Ozuna]
Tu aroma en la cama (ehh)
De ese que dejas cuando entras y sales
Dónde quedaron los besos y todos los planes (oh-oh-oh)
No sé si vivir o morir (ohh)
Me encuentro en un limbo desde que te fuiste de aquí (oh-oh-oh)
Eres la única persona que yo quiero que se venga encima de mí
Mi libertad no la quiero, tampoco la vida 'e soltero
Yo lo que quiero es que quieras lo mismo que todos queremos
Tener una cuenta de banco con dígito' y muchos cero' (ehhh)
Hacer el amor a diario y de paso gastar el dinero

[Coro: Romeo Santos, Ozuna]
Dime bebé
Si todavía me amas como antes
Ya nada me parece interesante
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé

They say, ""Build your own""—I said, ""How, Sway?""
I said, ""Slavery a choice""—they said, ""How, Ye?""
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day

My wife callin', screamin', say we 'bout to lose it all
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave

Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time somethin' happen they want me sent to mental
We had an incident, but I cover incidentals
You want me workin' on my messagin'
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson
But soundin' like George Jefferson
Then they questionin' my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again
Then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two, but me and you, that's infinity

[Spoken Word: Kanye West]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

[Verse: Kanye West]
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say ""He died so young""
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay
We was all born to die, nigga, DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (Ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay",Kanye West,Kanye West,2018,[28],1

Take the top off, let the sun come in (The lord still shines on you)
Whoa, for all my dogs that stayed down, we up again (Again)
Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard
I had debt on my books, it's been a shaky-ass year
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
I don't take advice from people less successful than me
Hah? Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Had to tell the dogs, ""Turn the snubs off!""
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
(Believe it or not) These two wrongs'll right you
(Believe it or not) I was too grown in high school
(Believe it or not) The true soul of Ice Cube
Too close to snipe you, truth told, I like you
Too bold to type you, too rich to fight you
Calm down, you light skin!

Just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, they say it ain't that hard
But just puttin' one foot in front of the other ain't gettin' me too far
This movin' on ain't comin' along the way they said it would

[Chorus]
I guess whoever said ""the grass is greener"" must've never seen the other side
And ""what don't kill you makes you stronger"" sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that ""time heals everything and everything will be alright""
Whoever said ""it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new”
Must've never met you

[Verse 2]
Must've never heard you say you'd never leave me then watch you walk away
Must've never fell as hard as I did 'cause then they wouldn't say
""Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone""

[Chorus]
I guess whoever said ""the grass is greener"" must've never seen the other side
And ""what don't kill you makes you stronger"" sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that ""time heals everything and everything will be alright""
Whoever said ""it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new""
Must've never met you
Must've never met you

""Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone""

[Chorus]
I guess whoever said ""the grass is greener""

And calculated promises all in your conversation

Банда!Банда!
Они пытаются попасть в банду спереди!
Они запомнят моё имя
Эй, кто-нибудь когда-либо находил время, чтобы спросить Rocky что A$AP значит для него?
Ну если так, то он, возможно, расскажет вам, ""Всегда стремись и процветай""
A$AP, партна!Свободу моему нигге, Cap
Покойся с миром Big Phil, покойся с миром A$AP Yams
Ты понял? (Банда)

[Куплет 1: A$AP Rocky]
Приходи трахаться с Mob, респект Господам и Богам
Я люблю свою суку, потому что она бисексуальна
Мой лёд, как звёзды, я сказал этой суке, ""Прикрой свои глаза
Потому что трахаясь со мной, ты ослепнешь""
Она теряет свой разум, мы целуемся с Frank Ocean и Blonde
Заставил свою суку стать блондинкой
Был рождён в темноте, я убью тебя, ты откроешь мои занавески
На Yams и это слово моей маме
Margiela Madman с делами, которые я всё ещё пытаюсь выиграть
Куча дерьма с давних времён
Чем больше они становятся, тем сильнее падают
Как домино, нигга, Geronimos
Когда моё время идти, adiós, vámonos
Флако не доминиканец, но ест камни с бананами
Имею дело с жизнью и максимумами и минимумами
Я просто занимаюсь сутенёрством, будто предназначен для этого
Я думаю это зовётся живым, дерьмо, я полагаю
Я живу в одиночестве, умри VLONE
Не говорю о трате или покупке одежды
Я о своём бизнесе, но я один
Я всё ещё вижу так, как когда был бедным
Трахаю сук и зарубежных шлюх
Вывожу женщин на скучные шоу
Я молюсь Богу, я не передозируюсь

[Пред-припев: A$AP Rocky & Kid Cudi]

Банда!Банда!Те парни не флексят так же
С меня хватит привыкать к славе, подваливаем на твою установку, оставляем пятна
Банда!Банда!Я сказал ей прийти потрахаться с бандой
Я сказал им не трахаться с бандой, это время трахнуть всю игру!
Хмм

[Куплет 2: Kid Cudi]
Я свободен, как птица, я хотел этого дерьма всю свою жизнь
Но у меня весь этот стресс в разуме
Пока я не осуществил, вещи наладятся, когда всё будет в порядке
Между тем я вкалываю
Я думаю о тех днях, когда я был таким молодым в моём тяжёлом положении
Вечеринка и херня и игра
Был в городе, один, кто окружён светом
Хотел сжечь его дотла
Выбраться из его линий, не было времени, не нуждался в совете
Кроме моей мамы
Катался для своей дочери, она всё, что мне нужно
Она получила своего отца, когда я рос
О да, я сделал это, я в ударе
Подумал буду со своим ниггой, нет
Я только разогрелся, давайте начнём шоу
Я учу этих ниггеров, так что в зоне и меня подставили чтобы взорвать
A$AP и Cud Life навсегда
И я чищу и властвую над этими тупыми шлюхами
Выучил кодекс, подал магию для всех этих
Детей, у которых не было никого самостоятельного
Раздаю слова, у каждого из вас есть своя песня
Держи и держись, не заставлю тебя ошибиться
Поём вместе, поём вместе, хмм

The game's fucked up
Niggas’ beats is bangin', nigga, ya hooks did it
The lyric pennin' equal the Trumps winnin’
The bigger question is how the Russians did it
It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin
At the mercy of a game where the codes is missin'
When the CEO's blinded by the glow it's different
Believe in myself and the Coles and Kendricks
Let the sock puppets play in their roles and gimmicks
Shit, remember Will Smith won the first Grammy?
And they ain't even recognize Hov until ""Annie""
So I don't tap dance for the crackers and sing Mammy
'Cause I'm ’posed to juggle these flows and nose candy (yugh)
Ferrari, my 40th, blew the candles out
Tom Brady’d you niggas, I had to scramble out
They be ridin' these waves, I pulled my sandals out
Jefe Latin my Grammy, I went the Spanish route
Oh, now it’s okay to kill Baby?
Niggas looked at me crazy like I really killed a baby
Salute Ross 'cause the message was pure
He see what I see when you see Wayne on tour
Flash without the fire
Another multi-platinum rapper trapped and can't retire
Niggas get exposed, I see the cracks and I'm the liar?
Shit, I’ve been exposed, I took the crack and built the wire
Now who do you admire?
Your rap songs is all tryin' my patience
Them prices ain't real without inflation
I done flew it, I done grew it, been a conduit
Moynat bags on my bitches, I done blew it
See through it, neck, igloo it
Habla en español, I ""y tu"" it
Let Steven talk streamin' and Shazam numbers
I'll ensure that you gettin' every gram from us
Let's cram numbers, easily
The only rapper sold more dope than me was Eazy-E
How could you ever right these wrongs

Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud
Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up

Cause the way you're shining I think you're thinking
It's been way too long

When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, yeah, let yourself go, come on follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing

You did something for the first time, girl?
Come on, baby

464,Most People Are Good,"[Verse 1]
I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
'Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half
As bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

[Verse 2]
I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

[Bridge]
I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last

467,The Games We Play,"[Intro]
Drug dealer Benzes with gold diggers in 'em
In elevator condos, on everything I love

[Verse 1]
This ain't a wave or phase, 'cause all that shit fades
This lifestyle's forever when you made
They tweet about the length I made 'em wait
What the fuck you expect
When a nigga got a cape and he's great?
Oven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreadin' paste
The love just accentuates the hate
This is for my bodybuildin' clients movin' weight
Just add water, stir it like a shake
Play amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith
Get the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race

[Refrain]
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

[Verse 2]
To all of my young niggas, I am your Ghost and your Rae
This is my Purple Tape, save up for rainy days
And baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches
They try to coexist, end up wishin' you'd die, bitches
Stood on every couch, in the A at the black party
No jewelry on, but you richer than everybody
You laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder
And we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours
We can bet a hundred thousand with my safe hold
My numbers lookin' like a bank code

[Refrain]
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

[Verse 3]
Ain't no stoppin' this champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin', the laws from watchin'
With Ye back choppin', the cars and the women come with options
Caviar facials remove the toxins
This ain't for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters
Who grew up on legends from outer Yonkers
Influenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies
I'm two-point-two incentivised
If you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money
Or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy
This ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya
Who said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers
The only kingpin who ain't sinkin'
Chess moves are made, my third eye ain't blinkin
Stay woke, nigga, or get out
Still pull them whips out, still spread the chips out
Might buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out
The message in this music, all my niggas had to live out

[Refrain]
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes, yah!",Pusha T,Pusha T,2018,[100],1

Diamond teeth when I bless the game, I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say
Unique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, cocaine Wraith

Making Salat, I ain't miss a beat
Praise to Allah, made it out the clink
Alhamdulillah, praise be to God
Big booty freak, givin' a massage
Lookin' in the mirror, lookin' at a star
She get on her knees and look up at a star
Remember being broke, wishin' on a star
Out the mud, no one givin' us a start
White gold, iced out, Audemars
Foreign car, push button, autostart
Rest and relaxation not involved, goin' hard Rolls Royce, R&R
Wonder why these niggas hate me?
Probably 'cause they know they ain't me
I ain't never been a gang member, Illinois labeled me a gang chief
Political spear, Judge Linehan racist, I’m bein' sentenced
Wrongful conviction, broke bread and lied to me
Gave him a quarter ticket, he did not appeal it
Layin' in my cell, lookin' at the ceiling
I'm on a division, me and all the killers
Throwin' shit and piss on all the staff members
Even got the warden, that’s why they had to ship us

Unwillin' to fuck with me, why is you starin'?

Jerk Villa curry chicken and cabbage
Fresh yams, politic'n with family

Makin' music, but I'm really a trapper
Booty club, 'bout to fuck up a sandwich

I'm shining bright just like a light 'cause I came from the dark

I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki, yeah, she like it sloppy
Oh, you got a hottie body, come ride on my johnny
I'ma go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste?
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights, I'm flyin', no, you can't see me
Say you need me, but you deceive me

If the work good I'll be back for the re-up

Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew

The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

I’ve been tryna help the kids because that’s what I am inclined/
To do/
But I’ve got monsters in my head tryna take me to/

I try to tell myself that everything gone be okay/
But all these monsters in my head say that they here to stay/

Try not to listen to um/
But they inflicting pain/
These fricken demons in my head they just won’t go away

I start to think that they might just live inside of me/
But then again all these monsters do is lie to me/

At least I think they do/
Or maybe I just hope.../
Cuz if what they say is true well then I don’t know/

What the future holds/

I’m tryna make it through the pain/
I’m tryna see these brighter days/
But I can’t/
When everything I love always fades away/

Everything I love/
Everything I trust/
Everything I touch/
Always turns to dust/

I’ve got anxiety from everyone who’s lied to me
I used to be more open now I stay alone in privacy
When I was open people really never understood
So now I lie to people’s faces I say that I’m good
You don’t wanna hear it like this?
Well then don’t ask how I am
I think that’s why nobody talks to me cuz they don’t understand
So I just keep my struggles to myself
And focus on the music
But I’ve been feeling stressed out and I think I’m bout to lose it
And my smile don’t make me happy, if you think that you’re mistaken
Because every single day I swear I think my body’s breakin
And I feel like I’ve seen gods face
Still question faith
If I make one more mistake
Then I swear ima break
And I just want to know why I’m losin my mind
And there’s so many fricken things I wanna rewind
And there’s so many times in like that I wanna die
And I really wish that I could say this song was a lie

They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out, right through the teeth

Every day's the same, yeah, I just watch 'em go
As I scrape away through the impossible

Where did the time go? A watch with no face
They hit the ceilin', but my roof likes space
I took my chances so won't you

Yo' girl gon' cheat on you for nothing, so I'm done with these bitches
I think about it every minute, ain't stoppin' my mission

Put twenty thousand on his head, they catch him, I send it
Get on my knee on side the bed like ""Father, forgive me""
Was sellin' weed, fucked up my profit, I ain't make a dolla
The fame gettin' to my niggas, I cut off my partners
Before I call on you, I put my trust up in this choppa
Movin' like he can't get touched real quick, I bet I stop 'em

Do anything in the world for you, I'm livin' red
Showin' love to them niggas, they might bust my head
Mad 'bout a gun, but for a fact bitch I won't do you nothin'
Mad that I'm up but you remember, you ain't give me nothing
I ain't give up on my mission, fuck you mean bitch? I was steady hustlin'
Handin' all you niggas money bitch, and I was steady strugglin'

I told him watch what he was saying, but shit I had to fold him

500,1985 (Intro To The Fall Off),"1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked

502,Ye vs The People,"[Kanye]
Like these is all super pretty things that make you feel everything is safe
I got my polo shirt, I got my horse, it's all good
I got my cross on me

[T.I.]
I agree, but I just think that when you have lives lost
As artists, that gives us an obligation to stand up against all of that kinda shit

[Kanye]
You know, me putting the hat on forces an evolution because
There's, even for me, I know so much more in the past 3 days
Because I'm getting this energy, positive or negative
Agreeing with me, disagreeing with me
It's like, and that like sharpens the diamond, that shit
Our mind, our conscienceness the way we're thinking
Just breaking some shit

[T.I.]
Your intentions, from what you tell me, are pure
But the direction that you took to get there is a bit unorthodox
And kind of... I would say - some people would say thoughtless

[Kanye]
If I had not done what I felt and I just thought
Then it would've just never happened
And when I wear that hat it's like a fight for equality
Like ""oh I can wear this hat too""
I think people get mad at me when I name my idols
And I don't say Michael Jordan, I say Disney

[T.I.]
I just want you to consider all the people who just might be terribly, like, just torn apart and hurt

[Kanye]
I really wanna take that hurt off of them and let them understand that I did not wear that hat to hurt them
Half the shit Trump does, I don't agree with

[T.I.]
What half do you agree with?
Let's get that out

[Kanye]
Just the ability to do what no one said you could do
To do the impossible is the most inspiring thing to me

[Kanye, to someone else in the room]
Did you play that umm, the one that said
""Tell Daddy what you learned in school""
(You wanna play with that, boy?)
I wanna play with that, yeah
(Alright, okay)

[Kanye, on a playback of ""Ye Vs The People""]
""I was in debt and the car that broke
The same shit I've been saying for years they called it ""loc""
Successful man, a man that [?] the [?]
The most successful man the one's who can afford the most mistakes
And play with them""

[Kanye]
You could mix into that cause I basically gave a lotta my side on that

[T.I]
Sure

[Kanye]
You know what I'm saying?
And your shit come in, you say
""Whoa whoa whoa, what you say?
How could that be?
[murmurs]""
You know what I'm saying?
The exact conversation we're having
And what would you say?

[T.I.]
Sure
""Yeah I'm just trying to figure where you're trying to go with this
Some things you don't align with and some shit you just don't go against""
That would kinda [gestures], you know

[T.I., in recording studio]
Let me hear it bro, let me see what we got here

[T.I. listens on a set of headphones]

[T.I., recording]
""... you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down""

[Kanye, recording]
""... know everybody emotional
""Would it be better if I rapped about selling crack?
Because it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, or I'm fuckin' rich?""

Or uhh, I could fuck your bitch

""Here's a suggestion, be selective with your critical views
Of people who done made greater contributions than you""

I'm dreaming violent, I can't tolerate disloyalty
So I'ma see you when I see you, know that day comin'
I pray that on that day you slip and say something
I never fantasize 'bout murder 'cause I'm still sane
But I can't seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
I know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place your value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily ""Why you not with me?""
I had to cut some people off 'cause they was using me
My heart is big, I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and don't hear back for like two months now
You hit my phone, you need a loan, oh I'm a crutch now
I had to learn, I never had shit
You never would split, you was hood rich

And I'm not bragging, I just wanna say something
I make a so—fuck, it's ridiculous
But wait, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hey, if my father was alive today, I would go home and say
""Dad, I wanna tell you how much money I made""
You know what he'd say? ""You's a lying motherfucker

Come in here, get your ass out the house
Coming here with that bullshit,"" hah

Niggas hating on me, I ain't used to that
Know a couple people wanna shoot for that
I say ""No, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that""
Them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that
And if it work for them, well shit, I'm cool with that

Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced
I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again
I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
Some older nigga told me to start votin'
I said ""Democracy is too fuckin' slow""
If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out
On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn

One night
When me and my mom was about to go to bed
All the doors was locked
Then when I had fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, his name was Rod
The one that came to pick me up
He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
And he got shot right in the stomach

[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

[Verse]
Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?
Have I sacrificed for fame?
My occupation's on my brain
Thought that I could change it all if I had change
But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same
I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came
They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing
It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range
Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange
How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing?
I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin'
That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head
Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead
Shootin' up where his granny live, ""blaow, blaow!"", his granny duck
He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up
Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?
He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough
Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways
The results are deadly
Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me
The little girl I met this past summer said, ""Don't forget me""
I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through?
A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you
And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue?
If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through
I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through

[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

[Outro]
It's not that big
Well at least, um
God had saved him 'cause he still alive
So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?
Like why can't the world just be all nice things?
Because God is tryna, um
Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world
He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time
And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world

507,Thunder,"[Verse 1]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, ""You're basic,"" they say, ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

[Verse]
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, ""Mama, go to sleep""
She tell me ""Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed""
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, ""Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'

[Outro]
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be—
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go

Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

I wish that I could say I'm proud

I'm sorry that I let you down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud

I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Verse 3]
We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh until it falls won't bother me

Is it coming?

Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other, man, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (You know?)

Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure

So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again

And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines

Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

Eight years old a couple cane poles sitting down by the creek
Our lines in the water watching those bobbers seeing that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling ""Supper's hot, y'all come and get it!""
We yelled five more minutes
At sixteen it was twelve o three standing at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight, but we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off, interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes

[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Give myself five more minutes

[Verse 2]
At eighteen, turned my helmet in, and walked to the fifty yard line
It's just the coach and me after we lost state ten to nine
And I cried, ""man next time to get in here, I'll have to buy a ticket""
Can't you give me five more minutes

[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops

Give myself five more minutes

At eighty-six my grandpa said there's angels in the room
With all the family gathered 'round we knew that time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed Lord I ain't finished

I wish I had a few more drops

You'd rather something toxic
So, I poison myself again, again

Not between your heart
Can't you see?

[Pre-Chorus]
That all the nights you slept alone, dryin' your eyes ('cause of me, baby)
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life ('cause of me, baby)
If it's love you want again, don't waste your time (don't you waste)
But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight

[Chorus]

I don't wanna hurt you

Enjoy your privileged life
'Cause I'm not gonna hold you through the night
We said our last goodbyes
So, let's just try to end it with a smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna hear that you are suffering
You are suffering no more
'Cause I held you down when you were suffering
You were suffering

[Chorus]
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away

[Bridge]
And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay
They said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say
But I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways
And I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh

[Outro]
I don't wanna hear that no more, no more
No more, no more
I don't wanna hear that no more",The Weeknd,The Weeknd,2018,[52],1

CashMoneyAP
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the sameLife switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Ayy, it's so lonely on the east side
I don't give a fuck, I keep it real, I'm not gon' let it slide
Now she see me up, she let me fuck, want me to cum inside
Broski going dumb, hopped in the car, he said he down to ride
You a little pup, stop playing tough, ain't make no sacrifice
Yeah, smokin' cookie for my appetite
I don't trust nobody, people talking and be telling lies
We just wanna win and shock them all and catch 'em by surprise
I was saucin' down until we up and then we all rise, yeah
But niggas don't stick to the G-code, balling on my haters
I think that I'm stuck in beast mode
Make it through the foul run to the line and make the free throw
I think that I'm D. Rose
Do 'em like I'm Deebo

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I think it's so damn strange what these people be saying
I can never even listen to a word that they say
I'm on the west side, that's the best side
By the cliff smoking blicks, that's the best high
And I got a shawty with the best eyes
Talking shit girl, why you putting up a fight?
I'm in my own world, far from the satellites
They want my information, they get no conversation
'Cause nowadays everybody calling
I need a manager 'cause I can't really fuck with nobody (I can't really fuck with nobody, so)

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

[Chorus: Lil Skies]

Levitated like I'm David Blaine
Livin' a dream like I'm David Aames
Talk all you want, we are not the same
Step in the spot, now they know the name
Sold more albums my first week than Harry Styles and Katy Perry
If that ain't a sign of the times
Then I don't know what is, man this shit is scary
'Cause bitch, I've been blowin' up like C-4
And I'm 3 for 3 like a free throw
Anybody hatin' on the boy, take a step back and then deep-throat
Now my phone blowin' up like ring
Like ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring!
That Kevin Durant, I'm a champion
Check the numbers, I'm a champion
Can't sleep on the boy anymore

573,Everybody Hates Me,"[Intro]
Yeah, let's do it again but, uh, this time, uh, let's go full psycho

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friend
She says she cheated 'cause she's tryna get ahead
The more I read it, yeah, the more I take offense
I'm so defeated, I can't get outside my head
I post a picture of myself 'cause I'm lonely
Everyone knows what I look like
Not even one of them knows me
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
I'm so defeated, I just want this shit to end

[Chorus]
So I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy
I walk into the club like everybody hates me (Everybody hates me)
Like everybody hates me

[Drop]
Like everybody hates me (Everybody, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm a product of the internet
And now, I'm face to face with all the voices in my head
I can't even check the time without facing regret
Why do I still have to mean everything I ever said?
And I'm not tryna be like, ""Poor me,"" I made it
I'm just trying to stay normal now that they know what my name is
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
Yeah, they're the reason that I still am who I am

[Chorus]
So I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy
I walk into the club like everybody hates me (Everybody hates me)
Like everybody hates me

[Drop]
Like everybody, everybody hates me (Everybody, yeah)

[Bridge]
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me

[Drop]
I walk into the club like everybody, yeah
Everybody (Everybody)
I walk into the club like everybody, yeah

Young Money
Ayo, Ferg
Yeah

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his gut, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I'll fuck yo' bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo' ho if yo' bitch keep eyein' me

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Post-Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (Yeah)
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (You already know, Harlem)
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (Queens)
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (Queens for the Kings of the Queens)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, I'ma explain why you prolly never see me
I push a Lamborghini, chocha magic like Houdini
My body shaped like Jeannie, booty dreamy, waist is teeny
Yes, I told him to get TIDAL, so he stream me when he leave me
I go hard in the booth, Biggie vibes, gimme the loot
I'm a classy millionaire, bitches ain't got the couth
C-O-U-T-H 'cause you can't spell it either
If I call him then he comin' home runnin', Derek Jeter
Bitches must be eatin' ass because I swear they're bottom feeders
Ho, you know that you my son, I shoulda scrapped you as a fetus
All these bitches rockin' inches 'cause they followin' the leader
I should switch it up on hoes and rock a Afro like Lupita's
I don't keep up with the Joneses, but I do know Catherine Zeta
I'm with Candice, TT, Thembi, and Viola, mi amiga
Rap bitches, they gotta check in with the Queen
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, everything in between, uh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Ride with Minaj, mmh Mashallah
Check in with me, then do your job
Queen is the name, Rafaello did the chain
This is Monse, Patty Plain Jane
Ride with Minaj, mmh Mashallah
Check in with me, then do your job
Queen is the name, Rafaello did the chain
This is Monse, Patty Plain Jane

[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Eat a Barbie ass or somethin'
Eat a Barbie ass or somethin'
Eat a Barbie ass or somethin'
Eat a Barbie ass or somethin'

575,Sorry Not Sorry,"[Intro]
Payback is a bad bitch
And baby, I'm the baddest
(I'm the baddest, I'm the baddest...)
Go

[Verse 1]
Now, I'm out here lookin' like revenge
Feelin' like a ten, the best I've ever been
And, yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse (wait a minute)
Now, you're out here lookin' like regret, ain't too proud to beg
Second chance, you'll never get
And, yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse (wait a minute)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, payback is a bad bitch
And baby, I'm the baddest
You fuckin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this (ah)
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but nah

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Bein' so bad got me feelin' so good
Showin' you up like I knew that I would
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Feelin' inspired 'cause the tables have turned
Yeah, I'm on fire and I know that it burns

[Verse 2]
Baby, fineness is the way to kill
Tell me how it feel, bet it's such a bitter pill
And yeah I know, you thought you had bigger, better things
Bet right now this stings (wait a minute)
'Cause the grass is greener under me
Bright as Technicolor, I can tell that you can see
And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse (wait a minute)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, payback is a bad bitch

[Verse 1: Logic]
Riding 'round the city with my homies, blowing trees
Wavy like the Seven Seas, living life, let me get it right
Let me give it a minute to get up in it like a beautiful independent woman that's finna make you wait to smash
Come now, let me count this cash
Come now, let me sip this flask
Pockets fat like shawty ass
Jump in the whip, gotta get this gas
Put that shit in drive, I'm live like ammunition
No permission needed, I proceeded to accelerate
Had days with hella hate, but gotta let that anger migrate
All this shit that's on my plate
That food for thought that can't be bought
But only taught, and on the real, know

[Chorus: Logic]
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nigga, like we smoking all weekend
And I roll and smoke when I'm drinkin'
Tell them open that door but don't peek in
We be havin' a OG Kush meetin'
If we smokin' that dope, it's a reason
Eyes so low from the chiefin'
I be getting high when I wake up
And roll me one more 'fore I'm sleeping
Man, I be smoking so good that I be forgetting the past
It don't even come to my house
If it ain't wrapped up in a turkey bag
We roll up the herb and laugh, kick back, blow a zip
Take it on a plane, know I smoke the same when I'm on a trip
Nigga like me always got weed on 'em (got weed on 'em)
Try to tell me that she don't smoke, later on she joinin'
Ain't no point, no I'm back, keep going in
You been rolling with cats, who boring
I be bringing them stacks enormous
Section always in the back important
Bad bitch gorgeous, pack imported

[Verse 3: Logic]
Uh, yeah, I'm finna get up in the feeling
Independent feeling like a boss
Roll a little something, smoke a little something
Kick back and then floss
Chiefin' that Indica in the cut, tell my anxiety to get lost
Fuck a pill, only numb the pain
Man, you know how much that shit cost?
I ain't talking 'bout your pocket
No, I am only talking about the mind
When the cannabis combine with the brain
It be like everything you see, it seem to shine
Smoking that Golden State, everything going great
Got a lot on my plate, not a single complaint
Stack of money in the bank
This that RattPack and that Taylor Gang
They know the face and they know the name
I'm a married man with a bad wife
Never fuck around unless it's Mary Jane
Come play the game, honestly never the same
Just like my flow, got one for every occasion
Living the life so my life is amazing, woo

I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire

Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier

Check the- check the bling that's on my finger 'cause I'm married, ho
There he go, everybody know that boy's pockets is swole
What's good? That sound familiar, never been here befo'
Life good, 'cause I just got quoted two hundred a show
Oh no, oh no, two hundred a show
Overnight, all this money that I've been makin', I gave it right back
To all of the people that made me, you know we like that
Don't know why your bitch wanna date me, but I can't fight that
Guess you ain't done shit for her lately, not on the right track
If I think that shit sound good, I gotta write that
Weed man knockin' on the door, I'll be right back
Pass the shit to 6ix, watch him light that
Hit the studio, record the shit, then mix the shit, then master it
And then we do the show and they recite that
Bitch, I'm right back, told 'em 'bout my life, told 'em 'bout my life
Told 'em I was broke as fuck too many nights
Now I see my name up on so many lights, but everybody prolly think this shit done happen–happen–happen

All they ever do is hate the boy, but now they know the name
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel
All they ever do is hate the boy, but now I run the game
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel
You can hate now all you want, but shit won't ever be the same
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel
You can hate me, but I'm not the reason that your life is lame

Tell me, is it really so hard?
Really so hard, to be a good person?
Tell me, is it really so hard?
Really so hard, to stop acting like a bitch? (Woo!)

Maybe you got issues with your daddy, doe
Maybe you was bullied back in high school
Maybe you are just a tool

In seinem Atem Jack, er ist ein Sexsüchtiger
Und sie möchte nur Rache üben und zurückkommen
Es ist ein Schachspiel, sie ist hinter ihm her wie ein Jetpack
Sie behält die Übersicht über all seine Internetchats
Und ratet, wer gerade dabei ist, zur Nächsten weiterzuziehen
Tatsächlich, gerade auf mein letztes Mädchen gekackt und sie hat, was meiner Ex fehlt
Denn sie liebt Gefahr, Psychopath
Und du fickst mit niemandes Mädchen, selbst ich weiß das
Aber sie hat einen Plan entwickelt, ihm in den Rücken zu stechen
Messer in der Hand, sagt, dass ihre Beziehung an einer Strähne hängt
Also war sie neuerdings im Netz
Sagt, vielleicht wird sie meine Gwen Stacy sein, um ihren Mann zu ärgern
Und ich weiß, sie benutzt mich, um zu versuchen, ihn zu betrügen, mir egal

Wie soll ich jetzt diesem Mädchen sagen, dass wir fertig sind?
Es ist hart, die Worte zu finden, ich bin reserviert, nervös, und Sue
Möchte nicht, dass das wehtut, aber was du verdienst ist die Wahrheit
Nimm es nicht persönlich, ich kann es dir einfach nicht persönlich sagen
Also kehre ich ins Studio zurück, wie Rattenloch-Diner
Muss in einer Kabine nicht reserviert sein
Ich fühle mich nur so, als wäre die Person, zu der ich werde
Unumkehrbar, ich habe auf dich Jagd gemacht, als wäre es Kirche auf der Kirchenbank
Und jetzt, wo ich dich habe, will ich dich nicht
Nutzte den Vorteil in meinem Verfolgungsdurst
Warum mache ich diesen Dreck, den ich mache?
Steige auf meine Tribüne und predige meine Predigt und Rede
Reinigungsmittel und Bleiche verbrennen die Wunde
Denn jetzt, mit ihr im Mutterleib
Können wir sie nicht in diese Welt bringen, hätten daran denken sollen
Schutz zu verwenden, bevor ich in deine verbotene Frucht gebissen habe
Fuck!

[Refrain: Ed Sheeran]
Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines, ich möchte nichts zugeben
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist
Wahrheit und meine Lügen fallen grade wie der Regen
Also lass den Fluss strömen

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
Mein Name ist (ooh), mein Name ist (ooh)
Fluss (ooh), Fluss ströme
Nennt mich (ooh), nennt mich (ooh)
Fluss (ooh), wir werden den Fluss strömen lassen

[Part 3]
Immer die Brautjunger, niemals „die Braut, hey“
Was zum Teufel soll ich sagen? Wenn das Leben eine Schnellstraße wäre
Und Betrug eine Enklave, würde ich über fünf Fahrspuren schlingern
Die Geschwindigkeit ist enorm, als würde ich auf Eis rutschen, vielleicht
Ist das, warum ich dich vielleicht von der Seite angemacht habe
Ich kann meine Lügen nicht beisammen halten
Aber ich brachte dich dazu, mein Baby aufzulösen
Diese Dreiecksbeziehung ließ uns im Ruin zurück, verwirrt
Was kann ich noch sagen? Es hat eine Zeit lang Spaß gemacht
Wette, ich hätte dein Lächeln wirklich geliebt
Wollte nicht wirklich abtreiben, aber scheiß drauf
Was ist eine Lüge mehr, die wir unserem ungeborenen Kind erzählen?

[Refrain: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines (es tut mir leid)
Ich möchte nichts zugeben (ich habe es vermasselt)

I'll let success talk, 'cause a word of advice:
More achievements for yourself and less talk
Cats beef with Logic, yeah, they prayin' I respond
If I ever did, I dead you in this game with no respawn
Peace, love, and positivity, that's all I want with you
But you push the issue 'cause I give you more press than your publicist could ever get you
Hell nah, fuck rap, fuck beef
Anyone that hate me, I wish you success
I wish you look in the mirror and ask yourself why you suppressed
The feelin's of self-hatred that you want project on me
Bet if I never picked up the mic then we might be homies
But you jealous, you look at my life and you feel envy
Constantly comparing yourself to me and feel empty
Most people that don't fuck with me ain't never shook my hand
I'm a good man, yeah, I love myself
I know who I am, yeah, I love myself
They don't understand

Grippin' this grain, I spit to release the pain
Pimpin' ain't a thang, what's good?
Hold up, let me get it right, I been contemplating life
I been grindin' on a fight, I been writin' on a flight
Roll up on 'em like that Backwood
Better act good or get smacked good
I'm just tryna live life, I'm just tryna get right
Anybody got advice?
I know I'm a workaholic but everybody got a vice
I leave 'em diminished

That I am so ahead of my time
That my whole motherfuckin' discography's already finished

Been smoking and drinking a little bit
There's levels to the litness

You'll miss the magic of these good old days

I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days

And all these reckless nights you won't regret

Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days

And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 3: Macklemore & Kesha]
Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

'Til it goes, 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got

Go all in just to lose again

A mí me gusta que me digan poesía
Al oído por la noche cuando hacemos groserías

Que sea un buen amigo, pero más un buen amante
¿Qué importan unos años de más?

De los que te abren la puerta y te mandan flores
A mí me gustan más grandes
Que no me quepa en la boca
Los besos que quiera darme y que me vuelva loca

Jetzt gut, als ich jung wahr, wir verbunden uns
Als wir etwas älter waren, beide sprangen
Ich habe Probleme und Geld auf meinen beiden Schultern
Der Ruf geht mir vor und Gerüchte sind Knietief
Die Wahrheit ist, es ist einfacher es zu ignorieren, glaub mir
Selbst wenn wir Streiten würden, würden wir es nicht lange tuen
Und du verstehst, das Gute und das Schlechte enden in einem Song
Für alle deine wundervollen Eigenschaften und die Art, es mit Leichtigkeit zu tun
Für alle meine Fehler, Paranoia und Unsicherheiten
Ich habe Fehler gemacht und machen Entscheidungen getroffen, welche schwer zu verleugnen sind
Nach dem Sturm, etwas ist geboren am 4. Juli
Ich habe Tage ohne Spaß verbracht, dieses Ziel ist das letzte
Mit 4 Wörtern auf der Spitze meine Zunge, die ich niemals sagen werde

Und ich kann dich nicht loslassen, deine Handabdrücke auf meiner Seele

Du hast mich gezwungen Farbe zu erkenne über alle meine üblichen Tricks
So hier ist eine Wahrheit vom meinen roten Lippen

[Chorus]
King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again
King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion

[Verse]
Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
I embrace them with collision, kings did it
King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king!
I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned
The lens that I'm lookin' through
Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef
What do you stand for?
Are you a activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you a accident? Are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?

[Outro]
Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die
King don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
KING! KING! KING! KING! KING!

617,Rewrite The Stars,"[Verse 1: Phillip Carlyle]
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep saying our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny?

[Chorus 1: Phillip Carlyle]
What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight

[Verse 2: Anne Wheeler]
You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wondering why
Because we're able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

[Chorus 2: Anne Wheeler]
No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours
Tonight

[Post Chorus: Both, Anne Wheeler, Phillip Carlyle]
All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It's not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

[Chorus 3: Phillip Carlyle and Anne Wheeler]
How do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing can keep us apart
Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

Would've thought you wrote down every word
Goodbye spelled out like it had been rehearsed
There ain't no point in trying to change your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems like
You've got it all figured out
You're alright
With the way this is going down

[Chorus]
Don't tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

[Verse 2]
By the way you're talking you would think
You never had any real feelings for me
And if you think I can look across the bar

[Pre-Chorus]
And see you
In someone else's arms
And I need you
Oh who do you think you are?

[Chorus]
Trying to tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

[Bridge]
You always told me
You'd never leave me
You said I was your one and only
So what makes you think I wanna hear you say
We can still be friends
No, I don't wanna be friends
Stop telling me, stop telling me, woah

[Chorus]
That we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth

Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe

I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Verse 1]
Hey, sugar plum, look at where we are
So tonight, if I take it too far, that's okay because you know
(That's okay because you know)
I hear the making up's fun
Been a minute since we've had some time to breathe
So if you see another side of me that's okay because you know
(That's okay because you know)
I hear the making up's fun

[Pre-Chorus]
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Hey, there's the faucet
Someone's knocking like they know
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light
And girl you know

[Chorus]
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Verse 2]
Well, I got your sweet with a twist of lime
And this one's neat, well you know that's mine, here we go
And do it twice 'cause you know we like it
And damn anybody if they disagree
They don't understand you're just like me, they don't know
We do it twice 'cause we know we like it

[Pre-Chorus]
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Hey, there's the faucet
Someone's knocking like they know
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light (light, light)
And girl you know

I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

How do I ever explain what I've got with you?
I try to find the words but they hide and that's the truth
And nobody ever will understand what we do
There's only one me and you
Come here, hold me
'Cause there's only one me and you
Yeah, there's only one me and you, uh
There's only one me and you
You know there's only one me and you

I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

I wrote this to let you know
And I let them feelings show
I'm the man of the woods and you're my pride

621,Diplomatic Immunity,"[Verse]
Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, ""What scent that is, boy?""
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house ""the embassy""
The studio ""the chapel"", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me ""don't worry, I got your money"" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, ""Where does the day go?""
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Inshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira

Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza ya empezamos cómo es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie así que vamos a romper
Con lo mío todos se mueven
La fiesta la llevo en mis genes
Yo soy la reina de los nenes
Mi gente no se detiene, aquí nadie se quiere ir
Si el ritmo está en tu cabeza
Ahora suéltate y mueve los pies
Me encanta cuando el bajo suena
Empezamos a subir de nivel
Toda mi gente se mueve

Mi musica los tiene fuerte bailando y se baila así

644,Greatest Love Story,"[Verse 1]
They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 2]
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

[Chorus 2]
When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 3]
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between

Look, people ask me what the future is
All I know is I'll be doin' this
All I know is things are moving quick
That's convenient for me 'cause that's how I live
Now they see me out here movin' up
You don't like me, that makes two of us
Time change, yeah, I can't adjust
Yo, it’s who you are not who you was, oh my
Yeah, just went to Europe, they said the single is working
I think I'm learning
I am way more than what people might think when they look on the surface
What is my purpose? Yeah
That is a question that I have been asking myself and it hurts
'Cause it's prolly something I should already know but I don’t know it yet, I'm tryna grow as a person, woo!
I'm sick of people tellin' people I'm here 'cause of marketing dollars, oh
You think that everything is gonna blow just 'cause you market it harder? No
I got my hands in everything, now they out here tryna get to me, stop tryna lecture me
You don't compare to my level of thinking, so why do you think you compare to my energy, huh?
Small circle, but the number's growin'
Fame called me, I'm like, ""How you doin'?""
Hung up on him, I ain't ready for it
I'll get back to that when I make album four
Less talkin', I've been workin' more
Better me is what I'm workin' towards
Y'all judgin', but we not in court, no, we not in court, oh Lord!
Last couple years, let's recap
I make a livin' off of writin' out my regrets
I'm doin' me, I don't care where the scene's at
Try to give me feedback, I don't really need that
I used to walk on stage in a V-neck
I used to wear a lil' tie with a black vest
I came a long way, why you lookin' upset?
I'm tryna paint a picture, get the vision, you ain't hear it yet, woo!
Look, hold up, hold up, wait a minute, please
Flow's switchin', I got ADD
Brain scatters when you play the beat
It don't matter what you say to me
I'll be doin' this at 83
I've been doin' this since ABCs
In the major leagues doin' major things, don't play with me, woo!
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Wake up every morning thinkin' I'ma have a bad day
Drive my own car, I don't like the valet
Park then I go into my mind with an AK
Shoot every thought in my head then it rotates
Losin' it all, but I think that I'm okay
Who is involved? I don't know, but I'm insane
Poof! And I'm gone, wanna call me a no name, what!?
I'm prolly not what you thought
I'm prolly not what you thought
I used to judge everybody that wasn't like me 'til I learned it was wrong
Girl told me I should get it together and get out the dark
I'm tryna give her my heart
That's when I sit in my car, writin' for hours until I can barely talk
I mean, where do I start?
Feels like I'm fallin' apart
Act like my image is hard
I always put up my guard
Even when talkin' to God
Sit in my room and I plot
Everything that I'm not
Comes out in the music I jot
I give it all that I got
I give it all that I got!
I'm tryna think out the box, no!
Yeah, I got people standing outside a bus screaming my name
I don't come out and take pictures, they tell me I changed
I don't smile in VIPs, you get mad like, ""You know what I paid?""
Guess I don't know what to say
Guess I don't know what to say
I leave it all on the stage
I leave it all on the stage",NF,NF,2018,[82],1

Cincuenta camiones, cuando yo llego estamos a una flota lejos
Tú no estás en mi trono, ni si quiera a un asiento lejos
Pero gracias a Nicki, todas estas perras nuevas pueden ver el camino
Yo tengo el krippy, pero no estoy hablando de las gangas
Pero tenía a todas estas perras usando flequillos y pelo rosa
Ahora las tengo usando pulgadas
Pero ahora dejaré a estas perras colgando como los linchamientos
Mi juego de palabras los tiene mejorando sus bolígrafos
Pero todavía me meten como jeringas por mi flow
Pero todavía sigo derribando puertas cerradas de las bisagras
Ahora en el asiento delantero de esos Benz del ‘88
Con mi suplidor, yo lo llamo Poncho, pero creo que quiera esa chocha
Pongo esta vagina en su boca, hago que mi gente cojan su coca

Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom

Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and

Never be the same now, now

My equality, how much love how to put it
I have only one angle
You seem to have ears, you feel my words

I will show you something in your ear

If I ask to see the kiss gimme, I know your belief converted
Bucket I have sought for some time, mother, until today
I know your heart I decided to be honest

I would, I wish, I want to know down the fullness of I love art
I am in a hurry, I want to go
First of all, surprise

Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feet, inches
They can't add up to the distance

Yeah, lookin' at the O's I drank (aw, it's lit)
You can't see that on the road, I blank

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Quavo]
Nah, lit ain't lit for me, yeah, yeah
A four in Brisk, that's my cup of tea, yeah
Look behind the blinds, nobody can see, yeah
Collect the platinum hits like they jewelry, yeah
I might charge you fifty thousand for the sauce (sauce and drip)
Ace Ventura, Marino, I play with dolphins (dolphins, splash)
Count up the deads, no coffin (coffins, deads)
Pullin' out that fire, out that arson
A lot of jelly on this PJ, made it say 4K (yah)
You niggas 'round runnin' down my juice, I ran it back, OJ (it's lit)
Rubber bands make 'em twerk, diamonds make 'em twerk (pop it, pop it)
Out in LIV every Sunday like you goin' to church
Fuck wrong with these niggas? (ooh)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, mama built a saint (saint, yeah!)
Yeah, countin' up the O's, I thank (thank, alright!)
Yeah, lookin' at the O's I drank (aw, it's lit!)

677,Walk On Water,"[Refrão: Beyoncé e Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)

[Verso 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter–
Flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

[Refrão: Beyoncé e Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain’t no Jesus
(It’s the curse of the— it’s the curse of the—)
I walk on water (shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verso 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Refrão: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Pós-Refrão: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh, if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verso 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's — a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
Pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Refrão: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Pós-Refrão: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh, if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike

678,Tennessee Rain,"[Verse 1]
You never see it coming, it happens all of a sudden
And when it finally hits you, it's too late
He just sat there in the silence, on his own private island
I wasn't ready for the storm about to break
Yesterday, there was no trace of trouble
Now he's given up more than I can take

[Chorus]
He said hold on tight, it's gonna be a heck of a night
Especially when you hear what I've got to say
And when he said, I don't love you
The first tear broke through
Now it's comin' down
Like a Tennessee rain

[Verse 2]
Nobody showed me, nobody told me
What to do when the story turned out wrong
Or how a heart does its mending, without the perfect ending
The one I always thought would come along
He had his own ideas of where this love was going
He wasn't leaving it up to the hands of fate

[Chorus]
He just said hold on tight, it's gonna be a heck of a night
Especially when you hear what I've got to say
And when he said, I don't love you
The first tear broke through
Now it's comin' down
Like a Tennessee rain

[Chorus]
He said hold on tight, it's gonna be a heck of a night
Especially when you hear what I've got to say
And when he said, I don't love you
The first tear broke through
Now it's comin' down
Like a Tennessee rain

[Outro]
It's comin' down harder than a Tennessee rain",Addison Agen,Addison Agen,2018,[67],1
679,Wish I Didn't Love You,"[Verse 1]
I remember where we used to dance
Out by the well, under the moon
You were begging me for half a chance
Summer was gone, we were in bloom

[Pre-Chorus]
Just two kids with pockets full of pennies
Singing every wish to our own melody

[Chorus]
Oh my love
Tell me is it wrong
Swaying to this song
Holding memories of you
Oh, I'll be fine
If I could forget
Don't you think I would
Wish to god I could
I wish I didn't love you
I wish I didn't love you

[Verse 2]
I never knew the stars could be so bright
Under the blanket, over the moon

[Pre-Chorus]
Something more than words, your heart was telling me
Everything word you whispered was a melody



[Excluded from Music Video]
[Chorus]
Oh my love
Tell me is it wrong
Swaying to this song
Holding memories of you
Oh, I'll be fine
If I could forget
Oh, don't you think I would
Wish to god I could
I wish I didn't love you
I wish I didn't love you

[Bridge]
Oh, I wish I didn't know
Oh, how could it be
And that it could break so easily
I guess I could say it wasn't me
[Chorus]
Oh, but it was
And I know it's wrong
Swaying to this song
Holding memories of you
No, I try
And if I could forget
Oh, don't you think I would
Wish to god I could
I wish I didn't love you
I wish I didn't love you
I wish I didn't love you",Chloe Kohanski,Chloe Kohanski,2018,[69],1
680,I Pray,"[Verse 1]
When I look up from the bottom
I still don't see the light
I feel like my whole world
Is stuck in the darkest night
There's a million different questions
That my mind's running through
And I don't know exactly what to do

[Chorus]
I pray, I get down on my knees and drift away
He covers me with his amazing grace
When I need it, he fills that empty space
And it always seems to take the hurt away
When I pray
[Verse 2]
When I'm searching for the answer
But I can't find the truth
And I'm ready just to give up
Give in and just be through
I lift my eyes towards heaven
And I see it loud and clear
Everything I'm looking for is just right here



[Excluded from Music Video]

[Chorus]
I pray, I get down on my knees and drift away
He covers me with his amazing grace
When I need it, he fills that empty space
And it always seems to take the hurt away
And he's never really ever far away
When I pray[Chorus]
I pray, I get down on my knees and drift away
He covers me with his amazing grace
When I need it, he fills that empty space
And it always seems to take the hurt away
And he's never really ever far away
When I pray

681,Believe,"[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?",Eminem,Eminem,2018,[92],1
