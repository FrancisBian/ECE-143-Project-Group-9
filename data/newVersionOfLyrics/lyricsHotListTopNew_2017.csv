0,Perfect,"[Verse 1]
I love me
My love just jumped and my leader continued
I'm beautiful and beautiful
I'm sure I'm living
Sorry, he's a boy
There is no hope in that
At this point I'm willing to give you
But Thailand kissed me, your heart is mine
We will keep yourself in front of you

[Chorus 1]
Baby, had a great nap in hand
More and more neglected, fear in your favorite music
If you're looking for a product, I'll get you a copy
But you heard, dear, my dinner

[Skit]
Is dinner ready yet?
Uh, no
I'm hungry!
Be patient, wait
Ugh, fine

[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm a woman and I have more power than I have
One day, his fate unites
I have the power, to love and keep my confidentiality
Love, who took the children
They are boys too, but we do not have much love
You probably have a lot of things
We are confident that time is over
Darling, adjust your hand
He is my daughter, I will be your husband
I see the front of my eyes

[Chorus 2]
My son and I play in the dark and in my arms
Without feet and legs and scan more
When I read in court, do well
I do not need this, dear, it's okay tonight

[Skit]
Random people skiing

[Chorus 3]
Child, suddenly in the dark, touching me
With spaghetti flavors, you will miss it, please prefer out favorite favorite
Amazing in my mind
But I know I am an angel
On the other hand
It's not valid (Nope)

Tank God
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Sürtükleri becerip hap alıyorum
Adamım, kendimi rock yıldızı gibi hissediyorum
Kardeşlerimin otu sağlam
Ve Rasta gibi tüttürüyorlar
Benimle uğraş, Uzi'ni kap gel
Ortaya çık ve vurucularımla karşılaş
Dostlarım mahallene uğradığında o silahın gra-ta-ta-ta gibi patlayacağından emin olacaklar

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Tarzımı değiştirdim, siyahlar içerisinde geldim
""Huzur içinde yat Bon Scott"" demeye başladım
Kapıyı kapat, tüttürüyoruz
Benden çakmak istedi beni Morrisson sanıyor (ayy)
Sahnede aptal gibi davran
Büyük ihtimalle şovumdan polis arabası ile ayrılacaksın
Efsaneviydi, Montage'ın tepesinden televizyonu aşağı fırlattı
Masanın üstünde Kokain var, likör karışıyor hiç bir şey umrumuzda değil
Dostum, kız arkadaşın bir sürtük içeri girmeye uğraşıyor
""Ben gruptanım"" diyor (ayy, ayy)
Kafayı yemiş gibi davranmaya başladı pantolonlarımdan tutmaya çalışıyor
Karavanımda yüz tane orospu var ve hiç birinin bir erkeği yok
Hepsi bir arkadaşını getirmiş

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Sürtükleri becerip hap alıyorum
Adamım, kendimi rock yıldızı gibi hissediyorum
Kardeşlerimin otu sağlam

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Hills'de süperstarları beceriyordum
Popstar gibi hissediyorum (21,21,21)
Henny yudumluyorum fena orospular havuzuma atlıyor
Ve sütyenleri yok
Arkadan vur, saçlarından çek
""Yeter artık"" diye bağırıyor (evet, evet, evet)
""Savage, neden 12 tane garajın var ve 6 araban var?"" diye soruyorlar
İlişki aramıyorum, bunu nasıl buldun? (nasıl buldun?)
Karıcığın benim tam yalamalık olduğumu düşünüyor (yalamalık)
Yeşil yüzlükler kasamda, eski paralarım var (eski para)
LA sürtükleri her zaman ""Kokain nerde"" diye sorar (21,21)
Rock yıldızı gibi yaşa, polis arabasını parçala
Pop-Tart'dan daha tatlı, sert olmadığını biliyorsun
En yükseklere çıktım, hatırla sağlam traplerdim
Rock yıldızı gibi yaşa, Rock yıldızı gibi yaşıyorum (ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Sürtükleri becerip hap alıyorum
Adamım, kendimi rock yıldızı gibi hissediyorum

How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong

Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

Feels like we're on the edge right now

Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Might be over now, but I feel it still

We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down

It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh until it falls won't bother me

Is it coming?
Is it coming?

All der andere Scheiß, über den ich rede, sie denken sie wissen es
Ich habe gebetet, damit mich jemand rettet, keiner ist heldenhaft
Und mein  Leben bedeutet nichts
Ich weiß es, ich weiß es, ich weiß, dass ich tief in mir verletzt bin, aber kann es nicht zeigen

Ich hatte nie ein Zuhause

Und wenn du deine Reflektion anstarrst
Endlich zu wissen wer es ist
Ich weiß, dass du Gott danken wirst, dass du es getan hast

Ich weiß wo du warst, wo du bist, wohin du gehst

Je t'ai dit que j'étais en chemin (aime-moi)
Je suis en chemin, je sais que la connexion a des bugs

T'as le mauvais comportement de ta grand-mère
Les courbes et les hanches de ta mère

Je sais que Top m'en voudra
Je devais le faire, je veux ton corps, ta musique
Je t'ai acheté la grosse pour te le prouver
Regarde ce que t'as fait
Je t'ai dit que j'étais en chemin
Je sus à une sortie près, ouais

Si je conduisais pas de grosse bagnole à la cité, est-ce que tu m'aimerais encore ?

My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide

Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other, man, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (You know?)

Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I-
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)
And we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever
You know? We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch

Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his gut, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I'll fuck yo' bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo' ho if yo' bitch keep eyein' me

I go hard in the booth, Biggie vibes, gimme the loot
I'm a classy millionaire, bitches ain't got the couth
C-O-U-T-H 'cause you can't spell it either
If I call him then he comin' home runnin', Derek Jeter
Bitches must be eatin' ass because I swear they're bottom feeders
Ho, you know that you my son, I shoulda scrapped you as a fetus
All these bitches rockin' inches 'cause they followin' the leader
I should switch it up on hoes and rock a Afro like Lupita's
I don't keep up with the Joneses, but I do know Catherine Zeta
I'm with Candice, TT, Thembi, and Viola, mi amiga
Rap bitches, they gotta check in with the Queen
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, everything in between, uh

Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

Als wir etwas älter waren, beide sprangen

Der Ruf geht mir vor und Gerüchte sind Knietief
Die Wahrheit ist, es ist einfacher es zu ignorieren, glaub mir
Selbst wenn wir Streiten würden, würden wir es nicht lange tuen
Und du verstehst, das Gute und das Schlechte enden in einem Song
Für alle deine wundervollen Eigenschaften und die Art, es mit Leichtigkeit zu tun
Für alle meine Fehler, Paranoia und Unsicherheiten
Ich habe Fehler gemacht und machen Entscheidungen getroffen, welche schwer zu verleugnen sind

Just a little too far

You were gonna be my wife

Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed

So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife

So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

No more Macy jewelry, baby, now you drippin' icy (Ayy)
You keep hangin' 'round me, baby, you'll start talkin' like me
Got my own lingo, I can change your whole lil' ego
I be swimmin' in the money, baby, whish torpedo
I ain't like these rapper niggas, they is not my stylo
I'ma call you back, I'm with my niggas shootin' cee-lo
I might change my old ways for you, baby
I can change your whole wave, now you wavey
Now you glamorous​​, I'm out your element
I'm too reckless for you, girl, it's evident

52,Like I Loved You,"[Verse 1]
Would've thought you wrote down every word
Goodbye spelled out like it had been rehearsed
There ain't no point in trying to change your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems like
You've got it all figured out
You're alright
With the way this is going down

[Chorus]
Don't tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

[Verse 2]
By the way you're talking you would think
You never had any real feelings for me
And if you think I can look across the bar

[Pre-Chorus]
And see you
In someone else's arms
And I need you
Oh who do you think you are?

[Chorus]
Trying to tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

[Bridge]
You always told me
You'd never leave me
You said I was your one and only
So what makes you think I wanna hear you say
We can still be friends
No, I don't wanna be friends
Stop telling me, stop telling me, woah

[Chorus]
That we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you",Brett Young,Brett Young,2017,"[54, 62, 62, 61, 62, 67, 63, 67, 78, 84, 91, 95]",12
53,Rubbin Off The Paint,"[Intro]
That's what I thought you said
Now let me offer this as a rebuttal
Ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang

[Verse]
They say, ""Lil Nahmir where you been at?"" I'm just passin' a breeze
I been runnin' up a check, that's why these bitches on me
I been coolin', layin' low, but I'm not takin' a seat
But just know a nigga back and this time I won't leave
I been runnin', runnin', runnin', gotta check me a bag
I got hunnids on my neck and I got Trues on my ass
Niggas said I'm goin' broke, well I just take it and laugh
I be speedin' in that foreign with Five-O on my ass
But I'm that nigga, I won't ever change, rubbin' off the paint
Smokin' dank, got a Uzi in my lap, I let it bang
Free Lil Tay, know he keep a 'K, but he not Tay-K
I up the chop and let it blow him, watch this bitch heat his face, I'm that nigga
And all my young niggas pullin' triggers, we gorillas
We let this bitch off until you feel us, for you niggas
That's always on IG with them yiggies, takin' pictures
Is you really gon' use 'em or you just loafin' for them bitches?
You niggas really hoes and you be acting like these bitches
You niggas say y'all silent but y'all probably in there snitchin'
Most the niggas that's around me throwin C's like they crippin'
But they do it for the twins, free Lil Corey and Lil Christian
But I'm rockin' with my shooters and that's mandatory
One up top like I'm Mozzy, bitch I keep a 40
You say I'm lackin', nigga try me, shoot you and yo' shorty
I'm cookin up in the lab like I'm Rick and Morty
40 poppa, hit a mobsta, turn your brain to pasta
Hit a opp up, dreads swangin' just like I'm a Rasta
Smokin' ganja and I'm zooted, walkin' in my Pradas
Any nigga test my gangsta nigga, I'ma pop 'em
And we ain't throwin' hands with you fuck niggas
It's one up top up in that chamber, better duck nigga
Niggas dissin' on Lil Valley, he get slumped nigga
We shoot his body then we lay him in that trunk nigga
I'm one-hundo, bitch that's on my life, I will never fold
A nigga speakin on Lil Quay, well then that nigga gotta go
I'm really small but I can fight but I'ma still up that pole
For you niggas think I'm pussy, you gon' have to show me, ho
Police always at my fuckin' crib, I don't tell 'em shit
I'm really rapping 'bout this fuckin life, that I fuckin' live
But I be coolin', tryna focus on them fuckin' dividends
But if it's money near yo' head, well I'ma fuckin get it, man

54,Let Me Go,"[Verse 1: Hailee Steinfeld]
You made plans and I, I made problems
We were sleeping back to back
We know this thing wasn't built to last
Good on paper, picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black

[Pre-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me, but you always do

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I've been hopin'
Somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of
All of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hopin'
Someone will love you, let me go

[Post-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Someone will love you, let me go
I've been hoping someone will love you, let me go

[Verse 2: Florida Georgia Line]
It's been some time, but this time ain't even
I can leave it in the past
But you're holding on to what you never had
Good on paper, picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black

[Pre-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me but you always do

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I've been hopin'
Somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of
All of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hopin'
Someone will love you, let me go

[Post-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Someone will love you, let me go
I've been hoping someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go

[Outro: Hailee Steinfeld]

55,What About Us,"[Intro]
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da

[Verse 1]
We are searchlights, we can see in the dark
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

[Verse 2]
We are problems that want to be solved
We are children that need to be loved
We were willin', we came when you called
But man, you fooled us, enough is enough, oh

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?
What about us?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

[Bridge]
Sticks and stones, they may break these bones
But then I'll be ready, are you ready?
It's the start of us, waking up come on
Are you ready? I'll be ready
I don't want control, I want to let go
Are you ready? I'll be ready
'Cause now it's time to let them know
We are ready, what about us?

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
So what about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?
What about us?

57,Lights Down Low,"[Verse 1: MAX]
Heaven only knows where you've been
But I don't really need to know
I know where you're gonna go
On my heart, where you're resting your head
And you just look so beautiful
It's like you were an angel

[Pre Chorus: MAX]
Can I stop the flow of time?
Can I swim in your divine?
Cause I don't think I'd ever leave this place

[Chorus: MAX]
Oh, turn the lights turn the lights down low
Yeah, now I'm feeling you breathing slow
'Cause, baby, we're just reckless kids
Trying to find an island in the flood
Oh, turn the lights, turn the lights down low, oh

[Verse 2: gnash]
Moonlight, mood lights, moves like J-Lo
Tell me what you want from me, I'll do it if you say so
'Cause you're the only one for me, I'm never gonna say no
I found me an angel, I can see it in your halo
Have you ever dreamt what we could do?
Have you ever sent an ""I love you""?
I've never felt the feelings that I feel for you
So maybe we could make a we of me and you
I'mma treat you right tonight, let's make it last forever
I promise you that no one else will ever treat you better
And if you don't believe me, please see I don't need no effort
All you gotta do is flip that switch before we bed-up

[Chorus: MAX]
Oh, turn the lights turn the lights down low
Yeah, now I'm feeling you breathing slow, oh
'Cause, baby, we're just reckless kids
Trying to find an island in the flood
Oh, turn the lights, turn the lights down low

[Post-Chorus: MAX]
Oh, turn the lights down low

[Bridge: MAX]
And I will give you everything baby
But can you feel this energy? Take it
And you can have the best of me, baby
And I will give you anything
Can you feel this energy? Take it
And you can have the best of me, baby

[Chorus: MAX]
Oh, turn the lights turn the lights down low
Yeah, now I'm feeling you breathing slow, oh
Oh, turn the lights turn the lights down low
Yeah, now I'm feeling you breathing slow, oh

Girl, it's high time I tell ya
No more messin' around

You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah

[Verse 2]
You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass
Watch a sunset from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still lovin' on you when the rooster crows
Watchin' way more than the garden grow

And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding

I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm in Uranus right now, I think I seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing witcha, dawg, I'm going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith, feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm gon' show him first
Say we just distinguished  beings, baby, me and you diverse

'Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars
'Bout to leave these peons behind like the Jackson 4
Tried to moonwalk on the moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche, err!
'Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back and forth, yeah
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth, yeah
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart, yeah
Got the codeine on my breath, it smell like caviar, yeah
Codeine dreams and they come true too
That's my spaceship, brp-brp!

'Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars to go to sleep
I'm in my Orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto 'cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm a metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring, I need a Zorcon
You takin' morphine, homie, you a moron

62,Good Old Days,"[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 3: Macklemore & Kesha]
Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

[Bridge: Kesha]
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change

63,Light It Up,"[Verse 1]
I open my eyes, reach for the phone
Not a word from you baby
It don’t leave my sight since we had that fight
Can’t remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it

[Chorus]
I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up

[Verse 2]
Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick ‘I miss you’ pictures
I’m on your clock, you’re in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers

[Chorus]
I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, then light it up

[Chorus]
I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night, I check it
I feel the buzz in my bed
And I don’t get no rest
I always got it on me

Then light it up

64,Yours,"[Verse 1]
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me

[Chorus 1]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Verse 2]
I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

[Chorus 2]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

66,When It Rains It Pours,"[Verse 1]
Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

[Chorus 2]
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Bridge]
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong

[Intro]
Hands up, officer don’t shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it’s no use
We ain’t ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

[Verse 1]
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...

Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

[Verse 2]
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where’d you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...

[Verse 3]
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up’s the only time attention’s paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can’t escape the sirens
Don’t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate’s the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we’re trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil’s face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we’re guilty ‘cause we’re black
""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”
Single mother strugglin’ through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the ""Land of the Free"" that made people slaves to build",Eminem,Eminem,2017,"[86, 96, 95]",3

Al oído por la noche cuando hacemos groserías

Me gusta un caballero, que sea interesante
Que sea un buen amigo, pero más un buen amante

Yo te prometo un millón de aventuras

Yeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
I'm asking you baby 'cause i’m tired of asking myself

[Chorus]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand

I know you're somewhere, somewhere

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Shiloh Dynasty]
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (yah!)
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front, you're a stone cold diva (yaah!)

Dame un poco de espacio, puta, mantente lejos a cien pies
Cincuenta camiones, cuando yo llego estamos a una flota lejos
Tú no estás en mi trono, ni si quiera a un asiento lejos
Pero gracias a Nicki, todas estas perras nuevas pueden ver el camino
Yo tengo el krippy, pero no estoy hablando de las gangas
Pero tenía a todas estas perras usando flequillos y pelo rosa
Ahora las tengo usando pulgadas
Pero ahora dejaré a estas perras colgando como los linchamientos
Mi juego de palabras los tiene mejorando sus bolígrafos
Pero todavía me meten como jeringas por mi flow
Pero todavía sigo derribando puertas cerradas de las bisagras
Ahora en el asiento delantero de esos Benz del ‘88
Con mi suplidor, yo lo llamo Poncho, pero creo que quiera esa chocha
Pongo esta vagina en su boca, hago que mi gente cojan su coca
Ahora tengo dinero como que soy Sosa, en un Lamborghini rosa

Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong

But I know how you are 'cause I know how I am
And I'd give anything to go back and try again

Maybe then you won't end up like me

[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go

104,Bella y Sensual,"[Letra de ""Bella y Sensual"" ft. Nicky Jam & Daddy Yankee]

[Intro]
Hola mi amor, vengo acompañado
DY
Nicky, Nicky, Nicky Jam
Let me holla at you for a second

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Uno de nosotros es de barrio fino
Un tipo muy real (The Big Boss)
Nos jugó una apuesta, que ni te miremos
Que te va a robar (Tamo' ready)
El otro es medio loco, con veinte tatuajes
Y ese swing de calle (Dimelo papi)
Y en su Lamborghini, con labia salvaje
Quiere impresionarte
El tercero es un poeta, trae serenatas
Brilla como el sol (Sólo escucha)
El chico de las poesías
Atentamente, tu servidor

[Coro: Romeo Santos, Daddy Yankee]
Bella y sensual, sobrenatural
Uno de nosotros te tiene que conquistar
Bella y sensual, sobrenatural
Uno de nosotros te tiene que conquistar

[Verso 2: Nicky Jam]
Quiero ser dueño de tu cama, ah
Tratarte como una dama, ah
Los tres tenemos la fama, ah
Pero a mí nadie me gana, escúchame
Romeo te habla bonito y Yankee tiene a Yamilette
Yo te hago travesuras, mami hasta el amanecer
Tengo lo que hace falta para hacerte enloquecer
Por eso te pregunto si quieres ser mi mujer
¿Con quién te vas? Tengo la curiosidad
Dime si soy yo, dame la oportunidad
Yo seré un loquito pero puedo amarte
Dime mamacita, porque quiero llevarte

[Coro: Romeo Santos, Nicky Jam]
Bella y sensual, sobrenatural
Uno de nosotros te tiene que conquistar (Zumba Nicky, Come on!)
Bella y sensual, sobrenatural
Uno de nosotros te tiene que conquistar (You know who's this baby)

[Verso 3: Daddy Yankee]
(Da-ddy!)
Si tú dejas que te invite, te doy lo que necesite
Tenemos algo en común y es que conmigo nadie compite
Me gusta que tienes pique, no te me desubiques
Si quieres una película, mami, yo tengo los tickets
Si estás enfermita te doy mi Robitussin
Conviértete en mi rusa, ponteme media Putin
Nicky vuela como un fénix y Romeo, el bachata king
Pero sigo siendo el mejor libra por libra en el ring
Baby, yo sé que está difícil la decisión
Reconoce que aquí no hay liga, yo soy tu opción
Yo sé que seras mía-ía
Cuando tiro no falla mi puntería-ía
Soy el mejor de esta trilogía
Pero quien tú escojas, te ganas la lotería

[Coro: Romeo Santos, Nicky Jam / Daddy Yankee]
Bella y sensual, sobrenatural
Uno de nosotros te tiene que conquistar
Bella y sensual, sobrenatural
Uno de nosotros te tiene que conquistar

¿Sientes lo mismo también?

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)

[Verso 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter–
Flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

[Refrão: Beyoncé e Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain’t no Jesus
(It’s the curse of the— it’s the curse of the—)
I walk on water (shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verso 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Refrão: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Pós-Refrão: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh, if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verso 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's — a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
Pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Refrão: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Pós-Refrão: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh, if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike

Talking shit on Twitter too but you still hit my phone last night
It was 4:52 and I got the text to prove
And all the recordings too, don't make me tell them the truth
And I just dropped some new merch, and it's selling like a god, church

Want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?

Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (dark room, dark room)

But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)

At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad

Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats
Alone

[Strophe 1: Rihanna]
Ich weiß nicht, ob du es aushalten könntest
Ich weiß, du willst mich nackig, nackig, nackt sehen
Ich will dein Baby, Baby, Baby sein
Kreisend und es ist nass, als käme es aus Maytag
Weißes Mädchen betrunken von dem brauenen Drink
Wenn ich so werde, kann ich nicht um dich sein
Ich bin zu gut drauf, um eine Stufe herunterzuschalten
Weil ich könnte ein paar Sachen nennen, die ich machen werde

[Refrain: Rihanna]
Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wilde Gedanken
Wild, wild, wild
Wenn ich bei dir bin, sind alles, was ich bekomme, wilde Gedanken

Lass uns loslegen!

[Strophe 2: Rihanna]
Ich hoffe du weißt ich bin zum Mitnehmen
Du weißt, dass dieser Keks zum Backen ist (ugh)
Kätzchen, Kätzchen, Baby, gib dem Ding ein bisschen Ruhe
Weil du bist damit fertig, es zu schlagen wie die '68 Jets
Diamanten sind Nichts, wenn ich mit dir rocke
Diamanten sind Nichts, wenn ich mit dir scheine
Lass es einfach schwarz und weiß, als wäre ich deine Schwester
Ich bin zu hip, um mit dir hier draußen in der Stadt mit dir herumzulaufen

Du sorgst dafür, dass ich darin ertrinke, touche, Baby
Ich trage das Wasser, Bobby Boucher, Baby
Du weißt ich schlachte, als wäre ich Jason
Spreng es, warum hast du es auf Sicherheit?

Ich sollte wahrscheinlich nicht um dir sein
Weil du wirst wild, wild, wild

Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Verse 2]
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile mmm
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

137,Pray,"[Verse 1: Logic]
They never knew my struggle
Rose above the rubble
Rather live inside they bubble
Than go through the trouble
Of having they double-double vision corrected
They just neglect it and—
I've been thinkin' lately
Will the Devil take me?
Or will God protect me?
I know I ain't perfect, but you should respect me
They don't want me happy
They don't want to let me live

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 3: Logic]
I am me
I'm a man, I'm a sinner
But understand, aren't we all?
So when it comes to passin' judgements
I don't think that you're the one to make the call
Heaven want to cast me out for being me
I know there's others like me that'll break the fall
I know you hater motherfuckers just can't relate at all
If I'm the first one to the line, that's fine, I'll take it all
Well, Logic, he gon' let 'em know
I ain't perfect, but I'm worth it
I'm alive, I deserve it
I been praying, I ain't playin'
I don't think you hear the words that I'm sayin'
I don't think you know the weight on my shoulders
That gets heavier as I get older
Callin' anybody, callin' anybody
""Can you hear me?""
I pray that you hear me
I pray that you hear me

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

[Verso 2: Ozuna & Wisin]
Mi mente descontrola
Y si la llamo, ella me dice que la busque, que está sola
Que no hay tiempo, pero haciéndolo no se demora (Yeah)
Y si le fallo, que tranquilo, porque no se enamora
Tranquila, la vida conmigo te la vacilas
Que no he visto otra baby de tu liga
Esos besitos que me dan ganas
De amanecer contigo todas las mañanas
(A las 2 de madrugada estoy en tu casa)

[Pre-coro: Wisin & Ozuna]
Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé (Ajá)
Te quiero comer (Es solo eso), te va a encantar
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar

Ja czekam na stacji
Jest wszystko spoko bo naszły dni wakacji
Czas zrzucić krawat i mieć luz jak Gandhi
Jednego możesz być pewien nigdy nie pożegnam ganji
Ziomek tu podjeżdża zaraz swoim cierpem
Biorę w plecak dużo grassu żeby wrażeń było więcej
Każdy jest już porobiony i podnosi w górę ręce
Nagle zobaczyłem ją
Blond włosy i oczy niebieskie
Jak ją miałem w objęciach to nie chciałem nic więcej
Kiedy tańczyliśmy razem szybciej biło mi serce
Ta plaża to więcej niż miejsce
To wspomnienia i ludzie tak ważni
Powiedz mi Skarbie czy znam Cie jak nikt czy znam Cie jak każdy?

(Verse2:Kre)
Twoje oczy idealnie pokazują morze
Może pokażesz mi też swoje fobie
Nie wiem czy jesteś prawdziwa lub nie popadam w jakieś pieprzone paranoje
Nie liczy się teraz już nic oprócz Ciebie
Na koniec świata tylko my we dwoje
Każdy pod wrażeniem kiedy mamy splecione dłonie
I idziemy prosto ku słońcu
Ja chce tylko ją i nikogo innego
Choć wiem że wkurza się gdy widzę moje alter ego
I w dupie mam już ten swój kwit
Uwielbiam z nią być kiedy jesteśmy vis-à-vis
I chciałbym z Nią tu być nie liczyć na farta
Choć jej piękny obraz zasłoniły kłamstwa
I taki właśnie jest sezon letni i bawcie się dużo bez żadnych obietnic

Ich brauche eine mentale Rechnung, um diesen Moment überhaupt zu kennen

Stört es dich, wenn ich einen Kuss klaue? (Chop, chop)

Gottverdammt, ich weiß, dass du es liebst einen großen Auftritt hinzulegen
Magst du es bezahlt zu werden oder bezahlte Aufmerksamkeit zu bekommen?
Du hast die falschen Typen mit den richtigen Absichten vertan
Im gleichen Bett, doch es fühlt sich immer noch fern an
Sie sucht nach ein bisschen mehr Beständigkeit
Aber wenn du aufhörst zu suchen, wirst du finden, was sein soll
Und ehrlich gesagt, ich bin viel zu fertig mit Schlampen
Ich schoss meine Exen für deine x und o in die Wüste
Ich hab das Gefühl, dass meine alten Affären mich einfach vorbereitet haben
Wenn ich sage, dass ich dich will, sag es zurück, Parakeet
Flieg in der ersten Klasse durch die Luft, Airbnb
Ich bin der Beste, den du hattest, du würdest mich nur mit mir vergleichen
Ich „at” das an dich, wenn ich dich in meinem Handy speicher
Und lade es hoch, es wird die maximalen Aufrufzahlen bekommen
Ich kam duch das Loch mit den Lippenstiften und Handys rein
Trage dein Lieblingsperfüm, nur um dich alleine zu bekommen

Hab keine Angst, Gefühle zu entwickeln
Hab keine Angst, diese Gefühle zu entwickeln

You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all

Dear Hate
You were smiling from that Selma bridge
In Dallas, when that bullet hit and Jackie cried
You pulled those towers from the sky
But even on our darkest nights
The world keeps spinning 'round

You were there in the garden, like a snake in the grass
I see you in the morning staring through the looking glass
You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all

Dear Love
Just when I think you've given up

I hear you every morning through the chaos and the noise
You still whisper down through history and echo through these halls
And tell me love's gonna conquer all

If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just might make 100K, yeah
If they put a price on me, I'll double what they pay, yeah
They say they don't like me, give a fuck 'bout what they say, yeah
I could take your bitch and make you think about what you say, yeah
I'm gon' put her in a leg lock like MMA, yeah
I'm gon' let her give me head twice if she don't say shit
If she ever turn sherm on me then she basic
Couple bitches had to swerve on 'em, I updated
You pulled up with her, she ain't leave with who she came with
She deserve better, you's a bird, you's a wasteman
Fuck a umbrella, change weather in my spaceship
Diamonds dancing, I'm two-stepping with my bracelet
So, get the fuck up out my face
I'm just on my way to get this money and I'm late, okay
In the strip club throwing twenties like ""I'll be okay""
100k a day, trap booming like an 808

If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 2]
Hold up, talking shit don't ever get to me
When they see me now, they'd better have that same energy
In abandoned houses, in and out, it wasn't shit to me
When you see me now, don't try to act like you remember me
Then look at me now, bitch I'm drowning
And my hoodie Saint Laurent, it's a thousand
And we come straight out the Bronx so we wildin'
Shoutout BK, free Bobby and free Rowdy
Free my nigga V12, holla if you see 12
Febreze, believe me, it'll cover the weed smell
I probably got 3 mil', sitting in my email
So much on me, they second guessing what we sell
So much money on me, fuck it if it's dirty money
'Cause I earned it, you get murked if you come searchin' for me
When the police pulled me over, I had 30 on me
What the fuck I look like with less than 30 on me, nigga?

Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?

Não precisa se preocupar sobre as vírgulas porque meu bolo está grande

Uh, ela maquia seu rosto com aquele Chanel novo
Ela gosta do valor, ela vê as joias, elas fazem sua vagina derreter
Quando eu conheci ela no clube perguntei quem ela “sentia”
Então ela foi e colocou aquela bunda em um cinto da Gucci
Nós não temos rótulo
Ela diz que quer garrafas, ela não tem uma mesa
Ela não tem uma armação de cama, ela não tem mesas
Nós só ficamos assistindo Netflix, ela não tem TV a cabo, mas tudo bem
Plugue, plugue, plugue, eu sou o plugue para ela
Ela quer um nego que puxe seu cabelo e segure a porta para ela

Procurando o cara certo? Bem, vadia, você está olhando pro cara certo
Eu sou o melhor até agora, e ainda assim meu melhor está por vir
Porque eu venho procurando por alguém
Não só qualquer fuckin' body
Não me faça pegar um corpo
Isso é pra qualquer um e todo mundo
Ah, meu Deus! Ela me manda mensagem o dia todo, mas não recebe resposta
Vadia, você estraga minha brisa, isso é como transformar ouro em bronze
Reviro meus olhos
E quando ela usa molly ela é um zumbi
Ela acha que somos Bonnie e Clyde
Mas está mais para Whitney e Bobby
Deus, me perdoe
Tunechi e luxo, eu sou uma lenda

Brauche dich nur im blauen Bikini

Braucht keine Meinungen
Von 'nem Schaltier oder Schaf

Und ich eine Killer-Queen auf dem Feld
Und du wirst den Ring küssen

Also sei ruhig, Kleine, ich werde hier bleiben
Länger als eine Minute, gewöhn' dich daran
Lustig, wie mein Name dauernd deinen Mund verlässt
Denn ich gewinne weiterhin

Und Karma ist keine Lügnerin

Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow

Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy

Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out

See, I got history of misery inside my DNA
My flow is blistery. No mystery inside my DNA
These niggas killing me, no need to flee inside my DNA

I came from royalty, and they just mad cause they wish that they did
Working hard you see, I couldn't stop I have to feed my kid
On a chopping spree. Keep playin' with me then I'll order ya hit
Gone in 1, 2, 3, then pay my man a quid for what he did

I'm a lover though, it don't get tough unless YOU getting tough
I just want the dough. She talking hard but I might call her bluff
Audi riding slow. Don't fuck with twelve. Stay from me with the cuffs
Nefertiti glow. My people royal racism enough

I got history of misery inside my DNA
My country tis' of thee. No liberty inside my DNA
Years of trickery. Black history inside my DNA
Said I'm too dark to be a star, but naw, it's in my DNA

I was only five when I saw my mother grindin', mastermindin'
Never ever saw her able to unwind and I'm reminded
Every day about the struggle. Wanna pay for her retirement
You inquiring about me baby, I'm busy steady shining blinding

Oohh

Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain

Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em
If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the 9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand

Nigga with attitude but I ain't from Compton

I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty
Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber
She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father

217,Castle On The Hill,"[Verse 1]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers

You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

Helluva made this beat, baby

These niggas prayed on my downfall (They what?)
These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

[Verse]
Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Moo, 'member when you had them green things mailed
With vacuum seals tryin' not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money?
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you every day before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan though, ayy, Theo ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle
Ayy, JR nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened?
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill ya
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gon' drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, ""Get ahead of them niggas!""
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fuckin' shoulders
(Boom-Boom-Boom!)
You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoein' niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was comin' home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on
Get 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch, I came home to my lil' brother gone
Niggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds tryin' to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch I'm 2-0
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on

Welcome
Finally

[Verse 1: China, Dove Cameron]
Huh, let's get this party started
I swear I'm cold-hearted
There's no negotiation
I'm not here for debatin'
You need some motivation?
Just look at Ben's face
Then ask yourself how long you think I'll remain patient
I'll throw him overboard and let him swim with killer sharks
You either hand over the wand or he'll be ripped apart
Now, let's all just be smart
Although for you that must be hard
You'll get your wand
No one has to come to any harm
Don't try to intimidateYour bark is much worse than your bite
Who's the baddest of them all?
I guess we're finding out tonight

[Chorus: China & Thomas & Dylan, Dove & Sofia & Cameron & Booboo]
Let's go, bring it on
Better give us what we want
It's the wand for the crown
If you don't, it's going down
Let's go, make your move
Peace or war, it's up to you
Give him up and do it now
If you don't, it's going down
We want the wand
Or else the king is gone
Your time is running out
You should really watch your mouth
Let's go, pound for pound
We're prepared to stand our ground
Put your swords up, put 'em up

[Verse 2: Dove Cameron, China Anne McClain, Thomas Doherty]
Ok, look, this is not a conversation
It's a do-or-die situation
If you don't give me back the king
I'll have no hesitation
I'll serve you right here
And I don't need a reservation
That way your whole pirate crew can have a demonstration
Release him now, and we can go our separate ways
Unless you wanna deal with me and the VK's
So that's your big speech, huh?
An empty ultimatum?
All it takes is one swing and I'll humiliate him
Matter of fact, make one wrong move and I'll debilitate him
And if he even starts to slip, I'll eliminate him
All it takes is one wrong look and I'll---
Harry!  We get it.  Chill

If you don't, it's going down

We don't have to light the fuse

You're gonna give me a chance?

Ya yo me cansé, no quiero ser tu amante
Te digo de mi parte, que no aguanto más
Ya no aguanto ver el otro como dice que es el dueño tuyo
Me mata el orgullo, él ni te sabe hablar

[Pre-Coro]
Esta la hice pa' él
Cuando la escuche quiero estar ahí para ver
Cuando se entere y sepa que soy dueño de usted
Tal vez suene un poco mal, lo sé y no me luce
Todo es por usted

[Coro]
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que con él te sientes fría

Mami, yo me siento tuyo

Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más

[Verso 1]
Sólo una cosa te preguntaré
Si tienes frío, ¿quién te da calor?
Yo soy el dueño de tus fantasías
Nadie lo hace como yo

Si te viste bonita, él no te dice na'
Y a mí tú me gustas hasta sin maquillar
Tú siempre a mí me dices que él te trata mal
Y eso lo tienes que acabar

Dime qué tú vas a hacer
Mami, tengo la inquietud
Si quieres sufrir con él
Eso lo decides tú

Que seas feliz con él
Yo no te contestaré
Sé que me vas a llamar
Cuando me extrañe tu piel (tu piel)

It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme

In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter",Linkin Park,Linkin Park,2017,[37],1
253,Closer,"[Todd playing ""Closer"" on the piano]

It's hard for me, given the upheaval of the world right now, to talk about silly things like pop music. But that's where we are, that's my job, and that's what I'm gonna do. But first, let me take a selfie.

[A clip of ""#SELFIE"" by The Chainsmokers plays]

Yes, The Chainsmokers. Or as they will always be known to me: The #SELFIE Guys. I am more shocked about their comeback than I was for Mike Posner's, and Posner was gone for three times as long. #SELFIE was just from 2014. And what makes it so shocking is that #SELFIE is the definiton of a novelty hit. It was exactly the kind of song that I should be able to dismiss as a blip from two idiots I would never see again. Of course, I've been wrong about the career prospects of a lot of people, like, say, LMFAO, but they had their second song in the same year. If The Chainsmokers couldn't immediately follow up on their big hit, how on Earth could they return two years later?

[A clip of ""Roses"" by The Chainsmokers plays]

I'm annoyed by a lot of things about their comeback, but most of all, I'm annoyed that I have to start taking them seriously as artists. The #SELFIE Guys are, in a quantifiable sense, the biggest act of the year. The Chainsmokers. If I could go back to 2014 and tell my past self that 2016 was the year of The Chainsmokers, past me would probably say, ""Wow, 2016 must be the worst in history!"" And I'd tell him, ""Calm down! Things aren't that bad, hahaha, hahaha, also start investing in Xanax. And I mean now, not later.""

The big question is: ""How do you turn #SELFIE into a sustainable career?"" Good question! Well, apparently by switching from making terrible novelty EDM to terrible generic EDM... that's one possible way.

[A clip of ""Don't Let Me Down"" by The Chainsmokers plays]

This was  one of the biggest hits of the year, and it is a disaster. Its an incoherent mish-mash of the worst sounds in pop music, and it of course was everywhere. The Black Eyed Peas may have been banished, but will.i.am's influence remains. But even that was dwarfed by today's song, which is A.) their attempt at a love song and B.) one where they actually sing. That's right, The #SELFIE Douches are now singing.

[A clip of The Chainsmokers performing ""Closer"" live plays]

Oh... boy...
Calvin Harris, I apologize.

[A clip of ""Summer"" by Calvin Harris plays]

Your voice is lovely, like the song of a beautiful wood thrush wafting on a summer breeze.

And because nothing in this world makes sense anymore, this song is huge. It is the best charting hit of the year.
And, not speaking for myself, just taking the temperature of the room here, seems like the backlash is kicking in, but hard!
And goddamn, I'm not surprised. 'Cause, Jesus Christ, who on Earth thought this was a good idea? I daresay there's not a more disliked song in the world right now!

Am I really gonna be the guy to stand up for this? Fine, screw it. I like the song. Quite a bit, if I'm being honest, but hear me out; I totally get why this song is controversial. There are a lot of problems with it. A lot! I mean, first off, Jesus Christ, it's a duet... with Halsey!

[A clip of ""New Americana"" by Halsey plays]

And, speaking of artists who made a terrible first impression! I was introduced to Halsey last year with her first mainstream success, ""New Americana,"" an anthem for the new millennial generation.
Yeah, listen to that. Feel the creeping dread of the sweeping tide of change!

[Halsey]
We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana

We smoke weed, legally! Watch us, obeying the law!

[Halsey]
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana

That's not even your generation's music! If anything, those are two artists whose influences are being felt less and less! That has nothing to do with your generation, you're just trying to make the rest of us feel old! Yeah, every impression I got was that Halsey was like if Kesha was trying to be Lorde, which is not a combo that works.

[A clip of ""Colors"" by Halsey plays]

But I gathered that was a fluke, and she's actually much more an anonymous singer than that, like she's not trying to make a statement, she's just another boring singer.
So yeah, I don't like her, she was another demerit against ""Closer"". But I do like it anyway. Mostly, I like that it's such a songwriterly song. I don't know the last time we had a hit song packed with this much lyrical detail and intense emotion. It sketches a very full portrait of a very complex relationship between two people. And that level of detail is really remarkable in a day and age where you can have a hit song that just says ""Pineapple, pen, apple.""

[A clip of ""Pen Pineapple Apple Pen"" by PIKOTARO plays]

Or ""You ugly, you ugly.""

[A clip of ""JuJu On That Beat (TZ Anthem)"" by Zay Hilfigerrr plays]

And in it, the two of them are playing specific roles in the song. They're two long broken up exes reconnecting despite the years of tension between them.
Todd: I, I should really just play the chorus here, because it is just fantastic!
Andrew and Halsey: So baby pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford [Todd cringes a little on that line.]
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder [Todd cringes harder.]
We ain't ever getting older
Todd: Okay, not that fantastic. Go back.
Andrew and Halsey: Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder [Record scratching noise]

Sorry. I do keep an actual record player down here [Reaches down to grab it] for uh, for when I need that sound. But um, anyway, yeah. I think it's important to say that lyrical detail is great. It adds a lot. But, not all details help paint the picture you're trying to create. For example...

[A clip of ""Hey, Soul Sister"" by Train plays]

...I didn't need to know about Pat Monahan's manscaping habits.
Pat: My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest

Not important to the story.

Back to ""Closer""
Andrew and Halsey: Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Todd (VO): Now, for example, the shoulder tattoo, that's an important detail, it adds to the scene.
Andrew and Halsey: Backseat of your Rover

The Land Rover. Well, you know, it's part of the setting.

Andrew and Halsey: That I know you can't afford

Can she pay for it?  ...Um?  I, I guess it adds a level of familiarity with each other? ...But the mattress! Oh boy.

Andrew and Halsey: Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

Do I need to know that there's a mattress? Yeah, that's uh, it's pretty important. But I don't need to know where she got the mattress, I don't need to know who she got the mattress from, and I certainly don't need to know where the person she got the mattress from is from! And it happens right before the most important line!

Andrew and Halsey: We ain't ever gettin' older
We ain't ever gettin' older

That's what we were building up to! Except right before we hit peak momentum... mattress?! Boulder?! What?!

Video of a bicycle race

We're right at what should be the chorus's triumphant climax, and then...

The song plays over a cyclist riding a bike...

Andrew and Halsey: From your roommate back in Boulder
...and he falls off.
Andrew and Halsey: From your roommate back in Boulder


This is the clumsiest, most useless, most jarringly unnecessary detail I've ever seen a writer use! And I've read [Cover of The Da Vinci Code by...] Dan Brown! And the fact that they're both singing the chorus together?

Andrew and Halsey: Baby pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover

That also raises some questions. Can they both not afford a Land Rover? Do they both have shoulder tattoos, are they both mattress thieves?  But, the fact that it's a duet makes some interesting things happen. Most especially, I like the fact that despite how they're sharing this moment together... these two people are having wildly different experiences!

Andrew: Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much, and that's an issue
But I'm okay

I mean, the first thing the guy sings is basically...""Go away, I hate you!"" [sticks out his tongue]

Andrew: Tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

Meanwhile, let's see how she feels about this rekindling of that old flame.

Halsey: You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you
I was insane

Why did you leave him? Hmm... Well, he hates all your friends!

Andrew: But I hope I never see them...

I'm not saying it's his fault or your fault, I'm just saying it's a huge red flag as far as compatibility goes. And of course, there's this.

Andrew: I drink too much, and that's an issue

Just a guess. But then again, by his own words, it's okay.

Andrew: But I'm okay

So, I mean, don't worry about that obviously.I mean, focus on what's bringing the two of you together again.

Halsey: You look as good as the day I met you

Ah, yes! The one thing that proves a relationship can work forever: looks! It's like they say, ""Beauty is bone deep."" I, I don't know how to break it to ya... but I wouldn't count on him calling you the day after.

Andrew: Four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar

I mean, you haven't spoken in four years, which is not a good sign on its own. Plus, I get the feeling you might've forgotten some bad memories. I mean, Christ, you've re-met at a bar! The two of you only got back together because he's drunk! He drinks too much! It's an issue!

Halsey: I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car, and

This girl has completely missed that this guy's carrying more baggage than  a Samsonite store. Christ, the couple in  ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" were more on the same page!

Kimbra: Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over

I think these two crazy kids are gonna work it out! [laughs] Ah, young love.

Andrew: I know it breaks your heart

And even when they sing ""It breaks your heart,"" one's being completely sincere and the other's completely sarcastic. I mean, I guess it's kind of a dick move that the Chainsmokers wrote the girl as like being, [sarcastic tone] ""Wow, you're so hot,"" and... he never has to meet her halfway, he's just like ""You're a bitch,"" and she's just like, [sarcastic] ""God, sorry I'm crazy!""

Halsey: I was insane

But, it, it still feels real, you know? The, the willful delusion of it all. See, it is a good song.

Halsey: Stay, and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

[Todd exhales] O-okay, I got questions again.
Halsey: In Tucson, okay
First off, Boulder? Tucson? What the hell was the two of you's relationship?! Were you traveling around the country like Bonnie and Clyde on a crazy mattress-stealing spree Secondly, ""that Blink-182 song""?
Halsey: Play that Blink-182 song

Which one, the one with the dick jokes?

[A clip of ""What's My Age Again?"" by Blink-182 plays]

Mark Hoppus: The state looks down on sodomy

I know, I know, I'm sorry, [Clips of ""Stay Together for the Kids""...] I know they became a real grown-up band eventually. [...and ""All the Small Things""] But to me, they'll always be the [Album cover of Enema of the State] ""Haha, that porn star's gonna stick a finger up your butt"" band. Which, which song are they even talking about? [Looks on his phone] Let's see here. [Headline reading ""How Blink-182's 'I Miss You' Inspired The Chainsmokers and Halsey's 'Closer'""] Oh yeah, ""I Miss You."" Yeah that's a good song. I like that song.

Tom deLonge: Don't waste your time on me
You're already the voice inside my head

Not sure it's all that romantic though. Not sure ""Don't waste your time on me"" is the lyric you really wanna hear when reconnecting. But yeah it does have some of the same  wistful vibe that this song has, you know, I'll give it that. Of course, if anything... the Blink-182 song she's talking about is still ""What's My Age Again?"" because that song is indeed about never getting older.

Mark: I never wanna act my age


And be honest, the situation will probably end up for these two looking like the same way it did for Blink. Embarrassing and regrettable in hindsight. This hookup is a mistake, you guys.  But I do have one other question: [Screenshot from Wikipedia page] Why is this being labelled a millennial anthem? 'Cause I've seen that a lot. I've been thinking about it, and... I think it's that a lot of the unnecessary jarring details are about... one major thing.
Andrew: Moved to the city in a broke down car and


Can't buy a mattress, Daddy bought us a car, this is the new Americana. We're all broke. And we're gonna be a lot broker pretty soon, probably! [starts nervously laughing again, but quickly composes himself] Oh no, no, no politics, no politics, no politics. [sighs]


Andrew and Halsey: We ain't ever gettin' older


Yeah, regardless of all its deep, serious flaws, I like it. I mean she's singing way too hard, and he can't sing at all, but... it works together, you know? Like Sonny & Cher, who are also both terrible singers; don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Andrew and Halsey: We ain't ever gettin' older

Look, I'm not saying it's a perfect song, I'm not sure it's even a good song. But if there's anything that sums up the mess of anger, optimism, confusion, and the desire to turn back time that I'm feeling right now, it's this one. Chainsmokers, ""Closer,""... thumbs up.

As I walk through the valley with my ladder in flex
I'm the realest nigga in it, I just happen to rap
When they all thought we was finished, they was laughing at that
So I went and bought me a Dawn and flipped that hat to the back
Fuck 'em
New jewelry, new whips on the way now
Brr, brr, that's yo bitch on the way now
Mama told me if you fall, never stay down
Stand up nigga, I can never lay down
Wins and the losses, it come with being bosses
Shoot a pussy nigga in his head if he cross us
Take that shit to trial if the feds making offers
Five hundred thou', lawyer said we lookin' awesome
Swap that Patek for them cuffs, take them off us
Lil' bitch, call me Lil' Fish
Niggas tryna turn my lights out, it's still lit
Streets calling and they said they want some real shit
Young bull looking like he hit a real lick
I got too many foreigns, man this shit getting borin'
Half a milli' last week, you would've thought I was touring
Niggas tried to count me out, I guess they thought I was normal
They ain't know I was different, I'm like ""Lord be my witness""
'Cause we was fucking up them dishes in my grandmama kitchen
Get a pigeon, do division, break it down on my niggas
Fuck they opinions why would I listen, they ain't see the vision
When I had a foreign I ain't see them bitches
So I'ma ball on 'em
Magic City, let it fall on 'em
And all my niggas stayed down with me
Know I be there if they call on me
Yeah!
My nigga bail half a milli, he made it home in a week
Even my momma know how I'm rocking, I go on them streets
Glock .40, keep it on me, we rolling 32 deep
Bulletproof everything, just let me know if it's beef
We bring the war, I just wanna shine like my Rollie
Put in all this time that they owe me
Made it to a nine and we litty
Dropping 60s too like we Kobe, oh
Pushing the foreigns, drive through the trenches (Trenches)
Top of the food chain, head of commission ('Mission)
We wackin' niggas without permission ('Mission)
Never was personal, it was business (Brrrrr!)
Brrr, settle down, let it settle down
Couldn't tell me shit when I was broke
Fuck they gon' tell me now?

Started sellin' white, we won't sell it no more

Niggas takin' shots, can't stop me, they ain't real enough
Cut her off, act like she's dead and it's killin' her
New Dawn, Hermes seat, I let the ceiling up
Just to kill 'em softly, ooh, get 'em off me
Try to crucify me like I'm Jesus the way she cross me
I'm too bossy and too thorough
To move like a weirdo, on point like an arrow
We started off with zero, now I'm seein' M's
Diamonds like water and they jumpin' out the gym
Shootin' like Harden if your head was the rim
'Cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up and a trim, damn
Back when I was broke, they was cool with it
Now every move I make I'm in the news with it
Even if I ain't do it they be like ""You did it!""
My teacher always used to tell me ""You gon' lose nigga!""
That's why I never went to school nigga
And why I'm rappin' like I got somethin' to prove nigga

So I'ma give it to 'em every time I'm on the scene
Pull up Ghost Ghost, Wraith Wraith when you see me
Some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me
I know it, I go through it, don't show it
I told niggas who wrote it, ain't takin' back what I quoted
Started off with a quarter, flipped that to a half
Turned that to an ounce, got some shit in the stash
Nigga say that he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass
Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass
And one thing 'bout Meek Milly, I'ma get to a bag
Had to starve all day just to get to it fast

[Intro]
Hey
Who are you?

[Verso 1]
Mi memoria ha conservado lo que se ha llevado el viento
Y yo estoy estancado en esos tiempos
Cuando tú me amabas y con gran fulgor sentía tus besos
Dime, quítame esta duda

¿Quién es esta extraña que se ha apoderado de tu ser?
¿Dónde está la amante loca que me erizaba la piel?
Porque ya tú no me tocas como lo hacía esa mujer
Algo no anda bien

Escucha las palabras... de Romeo

[Verso 2]
Esta noche me hago el interrogante
Y le pongo fin a la impostora, usurpadora
Exijo contigo una entrevista
Sospecho plagio a mi señora, mala imitadora

Dime, tengo unas preguntas
¿Dónde fue bajo la lluvia que te di ese primer beso?
Dime también, relátame el momento
Número de alojamiento donde yo te hice mujer

Confírmame
¿Qué me enciende en el sexo?
¿Qué me encanta de tu cuerpo?
Nuestra primera aventura

Quiero detalles
¿Será el cuello o el ombliguito tu punto favorito?
Porque yo sí sé cual es

Si en verdad eres la original, demuéstramelo ahora

Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga, still nigga
I like that second one
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga, still nigga

[Interlude]
O.J. like, ""I'm not black, I'm O.J."" …okay

[Verse 1]
House nigga, don't fuck with me
I'm a field nigga, with shined cutlery
Gold-plated quarters, where the butlers be
I'ma play the corners where the hustlers be
I told him, ""Please don't die over the neighborhood
That your mama rentin'
Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood
That's how you rinse it""
I bought every V12 engine
Wish I could take it back to the beginnin'
I coulda bought a place in DUMBO before it was DUMBO
For like 2 million
That same building today is worth 25 million
Guess how I'm feelin'? Dumbo

[Chorus]
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga

Still nigga, still nigga
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga

[Interlude]
You wanna know what's more important than throwin' away money at a strip club? Credit
You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it

[Verse 2]
Financial freedom my only hope
Fuck livin' rich and dyin' broke
I bought some artwork for one million
Two years later, that shit worth two million
Few years later, that shit worth eight million
I can't wait to give this shit to my children
Y'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine
But I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99
I turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8
I turned my life into a nice first week release date
Y'all out here still takin' advances, huh?
Me and my niggas takin' real chances, uh
Y'all on the 'Gram holdin' money to your ear
There's a disconnect, we don't call that money over here, yeah

260,We Ball,"[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah!
R.I.P. Dex Osama, Lil Snupe
All the fallen soldiers
Scooter, Truce

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
When they killed my nigga Snupe, I seen my young nigga
In the casket he ain't even have no blood in him
Prolly the reason why I keep taking these drugs quicker
Ain't got no patience for these motherfuckin' fuck niggas
I watch everybody change, they thought I lost it
But now they all bustin' U-ies its gon' cost 'em
I seen Chino shut the casket on the coffin (Truce)
Killed his only big brother and we lost him
So I'ma hold it down 'til we all win
We've been at the Clearport ballin'
I just want to see my niggas flossin'
Hundred bands everytime I walk in
If you keep it trill you'll get a blessing for it
Deep down in the trenches with that Wesson on me
My mama, she can't sleep, I come here early mornings (mama)
But mama I got thirty in this dirty .40
Any weapon formed against me shall not prosper
Used to pray them Ramen noodles turned to lobster
Gotta watch my own homies on the roster
Cause this the type of money'll get your lined up

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
And I can't trust nobody
They hit your homie and they knocked the soul out him
They said that they would ride or die but ain't nobody roll 'bout it
Three felonies, ain't graduate, no I am not your role model
I hope the Lord got us

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
When they killed my nigga, I seen the footage on the tape
Man I must've threw up everything I ever ate
Man I know he got some dice at the Heaven gates
Kicking shit with all these bitches like he's Kevin Gates
Relax your mind and kick your feet way up
Selling dog food tryna feed my pups
Young rich nigga and I'm built Ford Tough
And I'm going through stuff
I don't feel no love
I shake your body and you still wake up
Taking Perkys, man I fill my cup
The feds watching and they still might come, I'm gone
I wan' see my brother with the Patek, not the static
Gucci wrap your toe up, got retarded with my daddy
All they seen was red bottoms bleeding by the casket
Perkys got me focused, I done noticed all the damages
I don't see no purpose, in the county eating sandwiches
Lost so many niggas, I went crazy, I couldn't balance it
You can't question God, yeah, yeah, and then there's challenges
Sipping on this Actavis, I swear, I gotta manage it
SRT the challengers
Make that work do acrobatic flip, accurate
And I'm leaning like a project banister
I'm a boss, I ain't never need a manager
Got rich, with thugs scandalous, ayy

[Outro: Young Thug]
Fuck it, we ball, yeah
All the soldiers we lost, yeah
Fuck it, we ball-ooh-all
For all the soldiers we lost
Shawty on percocets in the bag
(All the soldiers we lost)
Got a Rollie and a Pateky in my bag
(All the soldiers we lost)
She just got a nose job and it wasn't that bad
(Fuck it, we ball)
I was juggin' round the city, I came back, ayy
Fuck it, we ball
Yeah, fuck it, we ball

262,Heavy Heart,"[Chorus]
I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)
Always kept it real from the very start (very start)
Niggas ain't thorough like I always thought
Damn, the game left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas said they with you when they really not (really not)
Niggas plot on everything you got (everything you got)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)

[Verse 1]
Uh, I kept it triller from the very start
Seen so many people crossed me, don't know where to start
Uh, that bitch left me with a heavy heart
Yeah, still on them papers, they won't let me off
Never thought we'd make it out the ghetto, now look where we are
Fucking famous bitches and that pussy taste like caviar
I done gave these niggas everything and that was from the heart
Rollie, chain, every car, all it did was left me scarred
Heard my dog talk behind my back and I'm like let him talk
I won't say his name but he gone feel this shit in every bar
Feel this shit in all my verses
Was it really worth it
Cut the grass and all the snakes gone surface
Nobody's perfect
Showed them cash, he kinda made me nervous
Maybe I'm trippin'
Hoping this paranoia from all this shit that we been in
Watched you pour gasoline, and burned out all of your bridges
Nigga, you sunk the friendship, something you got to live with
Fuck it!

[Chorus]
I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)
Always kept it real from the very start (very start)

[Verse 2]
Tears falling like the water when the levies drop
Boyz in the Hood, these niggas Tre' they screaming let me out
No they ain't riding, it was drama, I'm like yeah we out
Trying to please these niggas, shit gone prolly wear me out
Drive me crazy, I been by myself lately
40 on my belt lately, I ain't need no help lately
Nigga cross me, I cut him off and I felt crazy
'Cause I got a purple heart
Shit I'd rather work and walk 'fore I ride luxury with niggas that don't fuck with me
I'm startin' to hate this fame shit look what it done to me
Seen half these niggas turn they back when rappers tried to come for me
Don't want them in my company just want to be a company
Hunnit mill'
Dream chasers, chasing dreams
Hate is fake, and love is real
Niggas said I wouldn't win told them yes the fuck I will
Hit the studio with all my feeling and I let 'em spill
Forever thorough, be a sucka nigga, no I never will (No!)

[Chorus]
I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)
Always kept it real from the very start (very start)

[Verse 3]
Uh, my heart heavy, my soul cleaner
When shorty got a big head, I was like hol' Gina
I made a mil, I got a deal, I lift the whole team up
I had the whole squad lit, I had the city poppin'
I told my dog don't listen to them, get caught up in that gossip
They wanna see you in the hood back when you ain't got shit
Remember nights was on the 'gram, toasting with the pilot
Then everything went sour, this little thing of ours

[Chorus]
I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)
Always kept it real from the very start (very start)
Niggas ain't thorough like I always thought
Damn, the game left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)

[Intro: Kyle + Lil Yachty]
Dostum, sikeyim
Sorun ne Kyle?
Dostum, bu çocuklar, boş boş konuşup sinirimi bozuyorlar
Aga, sikeyim o çocukları, hayatına bak aga, etrafına bak
Dostum.. Haklısın
Hmm, şuradaki sağlam orospuları görüyor musun?
Vay, evet
Şu ağaçları görüyor musun? Peki ya şu suyu?
Sanırım sorun falan yok
Hadi ama kardeşim, şükretmen gereken çok şey var
Aga.. Düşündüm de.. Haklısın
Çok haklısın ki çok haklıyım. Çok haksız olduğum bir gün bile hatırlamıyorum
Sağol Lil Boat, dostum
Kanka, bu yüzden buradayım


[Verse 1: Kyle]
Son zamanlarda kafayı bulmuyordum...
Pekala, belki biraz bebeğim, yalan söylemek istemiyorum
Bana mesaj attığında, kızım, her zaman cevap vermiyorum biliyorum
Sen bir melek değilsin, uçamıyorsun bile
Fark ediyorum ki, bir şeyler bildiğini sanıyorsun
Tüm bu hayaletler bana doğru geliyor, kimin fırlattığını merak ediyorum
Vizyonu göremiyorlar, dostum dikkatlari dağılmış olmalı
Bu gerçekten güzel bir albüm ahbap, kim yazdı merak ediyorum, oh lanet olsun
Tamam, o zencilerin gitmesini diliyorum
Cirque Du Soleil gibi her zaman etrafta palyaçolar var
Bu bir albüm değil, hatta bunlar sadece gelişi güzeller
Bu şey çok soğuk, piyasaya sürüldüğünde kar günü olacak
Ayy, o iyi ve bunu biliyor, söylemiyor, sadece gösteriyor
Ben tıpkı DeRozan gibiyim, shoot atarsam girer
Cali'de güneşleniyorum, onlar o kadar ıslanıyor ki kızağa ihtiyaçları var
Oprah ile selfie'im var, sadece paylaşasım yok
Mutlu mekanımda takılıyorum, 2006' dan beri somurtmuyorum
2001' den beri ağlamıyorum, benim mekanım Six Flags gibi ve senin evin
Hiç eğlenceli değil
Benimkine geri de gelebilirsin, arkadaşın tatlı değil
Fakat sorun değil
Yüksek notada bitireceğiz

[Chorus: Kyle]
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver

[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh ben...

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
21 yaşında olduğunu söylüyor, kimlik görmem gerek
Bütün orospularım çift çift geliyor aşağıdaki taşaklarım gibi
Bir Hatchback'te şehri turladığım günleri hatırlıyorum
Genç goblinlerimle bir sorun arıyoruz
Modelimi evine boynundaki ağrılarla gönderiyorum
O kadar çok para kazandım ki durdurulamıyor
Kardeşlerim soyadım gibi yanımdadır
Herkese evcilleşmeyeceğimi söylediğim zamanlar aklımda
Woah, altı ay sonra ters döndüm ve şimdi oyundayım
Sahte zincir kolyelerden bambaşka seviyelerde elmaslar
""Beni buradan alabilir misiniz?"" sveiyesinden buraya geldim
Beni siklemeyen bir sürü insanı hatırlıyorum
Üniversiteye gittiler, şimdi hepsi tarih oldu
Dişimdeki altını elmasa dönüştürdüm
Arabamızda sert takılıyoruz, gizemli şeyler peşindeyiz (Raggy!)
Beni siklememeye devam et

Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome,"" you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
“Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!”
I said: “Don't embarrass me,” instead of “Be mine”
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns 'cause I wasn't present
Your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize

[Chorus: Kim Burrell]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over, what if you over my shit?

[Chorus: Kim Burrell]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay

Shawn was on that gospel shit
I was on the total fuckin' opposite
Shit, stuff a million dollars in the sock drawer
That's a war chest in case you need your chest knocked off
Y'all be talkin' crazy under them IG pictures
So when you get to hell you tell 'em Blanco sent ya
I can't take no threats, I got a set of twins (ah!)
Those were just some words you'll never hear again (uh huh!)
For the final time you don't believe these fools
I've never seen a worker rock so many jewels (never!)
I've never seen the runner with so many cars (never!)
Y'all couldn't stop me, you're not as tough as you say you are
My advice is just don't be too nice to niggas
Just set the price so niggas'll live your life, my nigga
Once upon a time in the projects
Shawn was in flight mode, I bought a Pyrex
I was in fight mode and now it's ""fuck me, mijo""
I was movin' them kilos, help you move your peoples
Sometimes you need your ego, gotta remind these fools
Who they effin' with, and we got FN's too
Before we had A&R's, we had AR's too
We the only ones really movin' like y'all say y'all do
We still movin' like y'all niggas say y'all did
Emory passed you niggas and he did a bid
Ty Ty jumped over niggas and he's like 5'6""

Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time

Over there talkin' to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind

And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

You got high on the life, that shit drugged you
You walkin' around like you invincible
You dropped outta school, you lost your principles

You gave him 20 million without blinkin'
He gave you 20 minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?
""Fuck wrong with everybody?"" is what you sayin'
But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records
Your excuse was ""He was talkin' too reckless!""
Let go your ego over your right shoulder
Your left is sayin', ""Finish your breakfast!""
You egged Solange on
Knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong
You almost went Eric Benét
Let the baddest girl in the world get away

Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate

Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile

[Outro: Gloria Carter]
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies
May pretend that we kin but the vibes don't fly
Bruh, I survived readin' guys like you
I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths
I seen eyes wide as they're about to shoot
You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your roots
I wave to these haters, don't give me dap
You know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh
Y'all body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I?
My crash course was much tougher
'Round friends who kill they friends
Then hug their friends' mothers
And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares
Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & JAY-Z]
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes, open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real

So it seems, so you seem (Uh-huh, yeah)
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare (Yeah)

I sat down with Prince, eye to eye
He told me his wishes before he died

They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide, they eyes high
My eyes wide shut to all the lies
These industry niggas, they always been fishy
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh
This guy had ""Slave"" on his face
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
Don't ""big bro"" me, don't ""Big Homie""
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times

Mike was losin' to Isiah, but he soon would get his sixth one
Gave birth to my verbal imagination
Assume a virtue if you have not
Or better yet here's a verse from Hamlet
""Lord, we know who we are
Yet we know not what we may be""
So maybe I'm the one or maybe I'm crazy
I'm from Marcy Houses, where the boys die by the thousand
Back when Pam was on Martin
Yeah, that's where it all started
When Denzel was blottin' carpet, I'll pack a… nine millimeter
When Slick Rick made ""Mona Lisa""
When Lisa Bonet was Beyoncé of her day, I had divas, y'all

Came through the bushes smellin' like roses

Fat laces in your shoe, I'm talkin' bustin' off the roof, uh
Hold a Uzi vertical, let the thing smoke

I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him

Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the Number (N)ine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman

She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide

Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 1]
She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 2]
Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days

Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help
The way I still want you

What if I told you about my little nothing town?
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now

[Verse 2]
What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith?
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there's no fixing me
'Cause everybody's already tried

[Pre-Chorus]
Would you stay? Would you leave?
I could wait, it'll all come out eventually

[Chorus]
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Would you look the other way, could you love me anyway?

[Verse 3]
What if I told you I don't plan on staying here?
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family's gonna want you to stay
You know what? I don't blame them

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll say what I don't want to
And I'll just pray you want what I do

[Chorus]
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way, could you love me anyway?
Oh, could you love me anyway?

[Bridge]
So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
There's some things you probably don't wanna hear
But you have to

[Outro]
If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me?
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl, if that's what this is
I don't wanna let it slip away, oh, no, no, no
Could you love me anyway, please?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway, ooh?
Could you love me anyway?",Darius Rucker,Darius Rucker,2017,"[83, 76, 63, 54, 53, 55, 56, 60, 62, 94, 99]",11

302,Scars To Your Beautiful,"[Verse 1]
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing

Yea, a nigga that's always in the field

I get ya hair done so much they start to think you a beautician
These lil' niggas tryna come up, only reason they diss me
Ya last man bought you Bebe but I'll buy you Givenchy
Biggest thing he ever did for you was take you to Chili's
Keep a bank in my pocket, call me Plies Fargo
Sex game undefeated, think I'm 100-0
I don't go nowhere for free, if you got a check I'll go
Ya last man he was petty, tell him I said so
I be hustlin' so hard I lose track of the days
That lil pussy was so sorry, I call it minimum wage
'Fore you leave this earth baby you better getchu a hitta
Talkin' one that got a bag and drop that rod like a killa
Yea, I just wanna know...

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

[Chorus]
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

It's like we keep coming back for more

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”

I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything

To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town on our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

But still I keep it professional

Empecemos por un par
Solamente te lo digo
Por si quieres practicar

Even though I look forward to seeing you again like, uh
When am I seeing you again?
Ayy, when are we speaking again?
Yeah, you look good with that ink on your skin
Hood, but you far from the streets you was in, oh yeah
No, he don't like it, call me up, he don't like it
This was the perfect timing
Love you, I'm certain I can, yeah
Talk about you like a queen makin' him madder
As if he never even mattered
And you a bad bitch, you keep getting badder
This ain't the side nigga anthem
I've been straight forward, he's going backwards

[Interlude]
Relax, yo, just chill
I love you, I’m with you
I ain’t with this nigga
You don’t think I…
He’s my best friend, he’s my brother
That’s my brother!
He ain’t your brother
That your blood?
You got the same momma and daddy?
Aight babe
You fuckin that nigga, that’s what it is
I’m fucking my brother? That’s my brother…
No, no, if y'all ain’t got the same momma and daddy, y'all can fuck
You fuckin’ him

[Verse 2]
You was on the verge of losing her
You was acting like you ain't want shit to do with her
I cut out the bullshit and kept it true with her
That's why the sexual tension is high when I'm in rooms with her
She really the shit, I don't be juicing her
I'm the shit too, that's why I'm so in tune with her
I feel like I'm sewn on ya
I feel like you grew on me
Have I grown on you?
Done fronting like I don't want you
Keep treating me like I don't know you
Back and forth between me and all your niggas
You're busy tonight, that figures
Tonight you're staying in his city
And still I answer your call when he doesn't answer at all
But I want that too, that's all
I need the same in return, that's all

[Outro]
That's all
That's all I want, all I want, all I want
That's all I want, all I want, yeah

C'est quelque chose, eh

[Couplet 1 - Halsey]
Elle ne m'embrasse plus sur la bouche
Parce que c'est plus intime qu'elle pense que je déserve
Elle ne me regarde plus dans les yeux
Elle est trop effrayée par ce qu'elle verra, quelqu'un me tient

[Pre-Refrain - Halsey]
Quand je me réveille toute seule et je pense à ta peau
Je me souviens, je me souviens de ce que tu m'as dit

[Refrain - Halsey, avec Lauren Jauregui]
Dit que nous ne sommes pas amoureuses
Nous sommes seulement des étrangères
Qui voulons la même chose
Avec la même faim
D'être touchée à ressentir n'importe quoi
Nous ne sommes pas amoureuses
Nous sommes seulement des étrangeres
Qui voulons la même chose
Avec la même faim
D'être touchée à ressentir n'importe quoi

[Couplet 2 - Lauren Jauregui]
Elle ne m'appelle plus au téléphone
Elle me n'écoute jamais, elle dit que c'est innocent
Elle ne me laisse plus avoir le contrôle
J'ai dû traverser une ligne, j'ai dû perdre la tête

[Pre-Refrain - Halsey]
Quand je me réveille tout seul et je pense à ta peau
Je me souviens, je me souviens de ce que tu m'as dit

Qui voulons la même chose
Être touché, être aimé, à ressentir n'importe quoi
Nous ne sommes pas amoureux
Nous sommes seulement des étrangers
Qui voulons la même chose
Être touché, être aimé, à ressentir n'importe quoi

[Pont - Halsey, Lauren Jauregui, ensemble]
Je manque les matins avec toi couché dans mon lit
Je manque les souvenirs qui reviennent dans la tête
Je manque la pensée d'un «toi et moi toujours»
Mais tout ce que tu manques, c'est mon corps, oh

[Refrain - Halsey, Lauren Jauregui, ensemble]
Dit que nous ne sommes pas amoureux
(Non, nous ne sommes pas amoureux)
Nous sommes seulement des étrangers

You never let me get away
From all the memories that we made
I got rid of the triggers, burned the pictures

I'm reminded of you...

I won't ever get used to watching me lose you
Over and over again

On the floor in the living room
And I almost believed that
I'm really here with you

CAMERA holds on this PACKED disco on Van Nuys Blvd.

TITLE CARD: ""San Fernando Valley, 1977""

A CADILLAC SEVILLE pulls up to the valet area and CAMERA (STEADICAM) moves across the street, towards the car, landing close;

From the Seville steps, JACK HORNER (50s) and AMBER WAVES (early 30s).
CAMERA follows them (this is one continous shot) as they pass the crowd,
greet a DOORMAN and enter --

INSIDE THE NIGHTCLUB. Twice as packed inside as outside. Music is full blast. Amber and Jack are greeted by;

MAURICE t.t. RODRIGUEZ (30s). Owner of the nightclub. Puerto Rican. Wearing a suit and fifteen gold chains.

MAURICE

AMBER

Hi, Maurice.

MAURICE

Pissed off you ain't been around --

JACK

MAURICE

Don't stay away this long from my

club ever again, Jackie-Jack-Jack.

JACK

I promise.

Maurice takes Amber's hand and gives it a kiss.

MAURICE

You are the foxiest bitch in ten countries.

AMBER

You're such a charmer.

MAURICE

(to Jack)

I got you all set up at your booth.

I wanna send over some clams on the half shell.

JACK

Beautiful.

MAURICE

Just remember, Jack: I'm available

and ready. Cast me and find out --

JACK

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Amber and Jack head off towards the booth. CAMERA stays with Maurice,
follows him to the bar area, where he shouts some orders to a WAITER.

MAURICE

Clams on the half shell to Jack

and Amber -- over there -- go!

The WAITER takes off to the kitchen, Maurice walks onto the dance floor and
greets three people;

REED ROTHCHILD, 20s, tall and skinny, BECKY BARNETT, 20s, black girl in
silk, BUCK SWOPE, 20s, black guy in cowboy gear.

MAURICE

Hello there, kiddies.

REED/BUCK/BECKY

Hi, hey, hi, Maurice.

MAURICE

Having a good time?

BECKY

Excellent.

MAURICE

Great, great, great.

Maurice moves away to greet some more people. CAMERA stays with Reed, Becky
and Buck, does a 360 around them. Reed and Becky Disco Dance. Buck does
some Cowboy-Type Moves.

Moments later, the WAITER carrying clams on the half shell passes and
CAMERA picks up with him, follows him to Jack's booth, where he presents
them;

WAITER

Compliments of Maurice.

JACK

Thank you.

AMBER

Can I get a Marguerita, please?

JACK

Seven-Up, here --

The WAITER exits, CAMERA PANS with him for a moment, leading to a young
girl wearing rollerskates, ROLLERGIRL (aged 18). She always, always wears
rollerskates. CAMERA PANS with her back to Jack's booth.

ROLLERGIRL

Hi.

JACK

Hello, honey.

AMBER

(to Rollergirl)

Did you call that girl today?

ROLLERGIRL

I forgot.

AMBER

If you don't do it tomorrow, then it's

the weekend and you'll never be able to

get in to see her --

ROLLERGIRL

OK.

Rollergirl scratches her crotch as she speaks. Amber notices;

AMBER

What's the matter down there?

ROLLERGIRL

I gotta go pee.

AMBER

Well go, then.

CAMERA stays with Rollergirl, following her across the dance floor. She
passes Buck, Becky and Reed, says hello, dances a moment, then continues on
-- into the clearing off the dance floor, heading for the bathroom. She
passes something, CAMERA moves away towards this something:

A bus boy cleaning a table, EDDIE ADAMS, aged 17. CAMERA moves into a CU --
blending to SLOW MOTION (40fps) for a moment.

(Note: In the text Eddie Adams will be referred to as Dirk Diggler.)

ANGLE, JACK'S TABLE.

Jack turns his head, looks across the dance floor and sees this kid
cleaning the table.

ANGLE, DIRK DIGGLER.

He looks up, catches Jack looking back at him, then turns away, disappears
into a back room.

CAMERA DOLLIES in on Jack, who at that moment, is approached by a figure
entering FRAME. Short, buffed out LITTLE BILL (late 40s). This is Jack's
Assistant Director.

LITTLE BILL

Jack's attention is with the backroom that Dirk entered. He stands and
heads away.

JACK

Absolutely. But I wanna keep it small.

I wanna keep a small crew on this one --

See this system here. This is Hi-Fi.

""High Fidelity."" What that means is

that it's the highest quality fidelity.

CUSTOMER

It's the price --

BUCK

I have this unit at home.

CUSTOMER

. . . really . . . ?

BUCK

Yes. But -- I've got it modified

with the TK421, which is a bass unit

that basically kicks in another two,

maybe three quads when you really

crank -- lemme put another eight track

in so you can get a better idea what

I'm talkin about --

Buck ejects the Eight Track that was playing and puts in his own of a
country western song.

BUCK

Hear that bass? It kicks and turns

and curls up in your belly, makes you

wanna freaky-deaky, right? If you get

this unit as it is -- it won't sound

like this without the modification --

and we do that for a small price.

The Customer listens another moment, then;

CUSTOMER

Thank you for your time.

BUCK

No problem.

The Customer exits and Jerry approaches Buck.

JERRY

. . . the fuck was that?

BUCK

Wha?

JERRY

Have I told you? Huh? Have I?

BUCK

What? I don't --

JERRY

Alright: A.) You play that country

western-crap and no one's gonna buy

a stereo. You throw on some KC and

the Sunshine Band, a guy looks a particular

way -- and you've seen the profile sheet --

you throw on some Led Zeppelin. No.

Instead, you play this twingy-twangy,

yappy-dappy music. What kinda brother

are you anyway, listening to that shit?

BUCK

Hey, Jerry, look --

JERRY

No, you look. I gave you a job here

because I thought your film work

might bring some nice pussy in the

place -- and it has -- but I can't

have anymore fuck ups -- you dig?

BUCK

Yeah.

JERRY

Alright. Go unload the new 484's

from the back room.

Buck goes to the back room.

I have to get back to work.

SHERYL LYNN

Give it to me, Eddie.

Don't make me pounce you, Sheryl Lynn.

SHERYL LYNN

Ohhhh-baby, baby, baby.

DIRK

I'll do it --

SHERYL LYNN

Promise?

DIRK

That's it.

Dirk jumps up and starts bouncing up and down on the bed, naked and
flapping. She stares at his crotch, shakes her head;

DICK (OC)

What?

SHERYL LYNN

You're so beautiful.

DICK (OC)

Yeah . . .

SHERYL LYNN

Do you know how good you are at

doing this, Eddie? Having sex . . . fucking me . . .

making love to me?

Dirk looks down. BEAT.

DIRK

Everyone has one thing, y'think? I mean:

Everyone is given one special thing . . . . right?

SHERYL LYNN

That's right.

DIRK

Everyone is blessed with One Special Thing.

Dirk kneels down to her;

DIRK

I want you to know: I plan on being a star.

A big, bright shining star. That's what

I want and it's what I'm gonna get.

SHERYL LYNN

A CLOSET SPACE

She goes down on him, unzips his pants and pulls out his cock. She
hesitates. DOLLY IN CLOSE ON HER FACE. She smiles up at Dirk.

Hey. Eddie.

DIRK

Hello. Jack?

JACK

Yeah. You wanna ride?

JACK

This thing here, I mean, you understand

one thing and that's this: It costs.

I mean, this stuff costs good ol' American

Green. You got film, you got lights,

you got sound, lab fees, developing, synching,

editing -- next thing you know you're

spending thirty/forty thousand a picture.

DIRK

That's a lot of money.

JACK

Hell yes it's a lot of money, but lemme

tell you something else: You make a good

film and there's practically no end to the

amount of money you can make, Eddie.

AMBER

Have you seen Jack's house?

CAMERA HOLDS ON AMBER. She watches Dirk.

DIRK (OC)

No.

JACK (OC)

He'll see it.

ROLLERGIRL (OC)

He'll see it.

JACK (OC)

Eddie: You got ten, fifteen people around

and that's just to make sure the lighting is

right . . . shit, this is not an operation for

the weak, and lemme tell you something else:

When all is said and done, you gotta have the

juice, you understand? I mean . . . you can work

on your arms, your legs, workout morning, day,

noon, night, the whole deal, but when it comes

right down to it . . . what we need is Mr. Torpedo

Area, y'understand? Mr. Fun Zone? Okay, let's

say you got that: right? And You Do Got, Yeah?

He looks to Rollergirl. She smiles. CAMERA OFF AMBER NOW.

JACK

I can go out -- tonight -- the reputation

I got: I can find myself 15/20 guys,

cocks the size of Willie Mays Baseball Bat:

Do I want that? No. Do I need that? No.

I need actors.

AMBER

Uhhh-ohhh . . . here we go --

JACK

-- Alright, yeah, I need the big dick,

and the big tits -- that GETS them in

the theater. What keeps them in their

seats even after they've come? Huh?

The beauty and the acting.

If you're able to give it up and show the world:

No, not just your cock. Fuck that.

What I'm talking about is showing your

insides, from your heart . . . you understand?

Hey, Sure: GET THEM IN THE THEATER.

That's one thing. I don't want 'em showing up,

sitting down, jacking off and splitting on

the story. I don't want to make that film.

I wanna make the thing that keeps 'em around

even after they've come . . . what happens when you

come? You're done, you wanna split.

My idea, my goal: Suck 'em in with the

story . . . they'll squirt their load and sit in it . . .

Just To See How The Story Ends.

Sometimes we make these films, we wanna

make people laugh a little, then get into

it and fuck heavy: That's good and that's fine.

But I got a dream of making a film that's

true . . . true and right and dramatic.

DIRK

. . . Right . . . right . . . I understand.

AMBER

Don't listen too hard to all this,

honey . . . it's just nice in theory.

JACK

It's a dream to be able to find

a cock and an actor.

ROLLERGIRL

ROLLERGIRL

Here We Go! Are We Gonna Fuck?

JACK

Yes you are.

ROLLERGIRL

Oh, wait, wait, wait, then.

She rolls over to the Hi-Fi system and picks a record. She sets the needle
on the turntable and rolls over to the couch -- in one swift motion ripping
her clothes off.

ROLLERGIRL

You ready?

DIRK

Are you?

ROLLERGIRL

Ohhh-yeah.

They kiss. They lean back on the couch. Dirk stops a moment.

DIRK

Are you gonna take your skates off?

ROLLERGIRL

I don't take my skates off.

DIRK

Okay.

She hasn't had a hit in a year. She's

desperate. Her landlord is threatening to kick her

out, so she's desperate for a big dick hit, right?

COLONEL

Yes. Good dilemma.

JACK

Yes. So she calls up all the agencies

in town and says: ""Send over your best

actors, I'm casting a porno picture.""

Well, the story goes and develops with

Amber auditioning various men and

women . . . the whole thing wraps up with

the Landlord, I'd like to get Jeremy if

he's still in town to play the part --

he comes in -- the landlord says:

You better pay rent or you're through.

Well, Amber does one helluva suck job,

ass fuck, come in the face, sort of thing

Right.

KURT LONGJOHN

I wondered if we'd be able to look into

getting some more lights, too, y'know --

LITTLE BILL

Jack wants a minimal-thing --

KURT LONGJOHN

Right, well, very often, minimal means

a lot more photographically than I think,

well . . . then I think most people understand . . .

LITTLE BILL

I understand.

KURT LONGJOHN

No, no. Hey. I know you understand,

I was talking about some other people.

LITTLE BILL

Well, I think what Jack is talking

about is minimal, not really ""natural,""

but minimal . . .

KURT LONGJOHN

OK . . . fine . . . I was just saying . . .

LITTLE BILL

I understand --

KURT LONGJOHN

-- cause I'm just trying to give each

picture it's own look --

LITTLE BILL

Can we talk about this later?

KURT LONGJOHN

Oh, yeah . . . you have to go somewhere . . . or . . . ?

LITTLE BILL

Well, no, yeah . . . I mean . . .

shoot tomorrow, we could send Rocky down

and he could pick it up --

LITTLE BILL

Kurt.

KURT LONGJOHN

No. Hey. Gotcha. You've gotta go somewhere

so -- hey -- what the fuck? It's only the

photography of the movie we're talkin' about --

We could make it more of a James Bond

character. This guy that's world traveled.

JACK

I like that.

DIRK

Reed could play my partner.

JACK

I like this a lot.

DIRK

We could make it really good, Jack.

Honestly. If you direct it . . . we could

make a whole series, with a whole story.

This is exactly what we've always talked about.

JACK

I know it. I know it.

REED

We should do this.

JACK

Alright. When we get back. We'll set up

the typewriter and we'll see what we can

come up with. I'll talk to the Colonel when

we get to Vegas. But Dirk, you gotta work

on him too, okay?

DIRK

Right, right.

JACK

-- if we don't put every element into this,

it's just not gonna work --

DIRK

Exactly.

JACK

Now: What's this guy's name?

This character? Do you know?

DIRK

The Audience Applauds wildly. Dirk, dressed in a jean outfit, makes his way
to the stage and accepts the award from Jessie. He turns to the crowd.

DIRK

Wow. I dunno what to say . . . I guess. Wow.

I guess the only thing I can say, is that

I promise to keep rocking and rolling and

to keep making better films. It seems we make

these movies . . . and sometimes . . . they're considered

filthy or something by some people . . . but I don't

think that's true. These films we make can be

better . . . they can help . . . they really can, I mean it.

We can always do better -- and I'll keep trying

if you keep trying so let's keep ROCKING AND ROLLING.

AUDIENCE APPLAUDS. Jessie St. Vincent comes over and plants a deep, wet

like an outsider.

JESSIE

I know my tits aren't as big and I know

my pussy isn't as tight as all the other

girls in this industry but I still feel

like I've got something that works --

I can paint, too.

DIRK

Yes. Yes. Yes.

JESSIE

I dunno. I was just never really secure.

When I was a kid, I was never really secure

with myself that much -- I guess that's why

I try and act like I'm all care-free and everything.

DIRK

I know what you mean, sometimes I'm like,

""What am I doing?"" ""What the hell is wrong

with me?"" Y'know?

JESSIE

I know, I know.

DIRK

But then . . . I think . . .

JESSIE

-- it's just fun. It's great.

I couldn't be happier than where

I am today, right now, at this moment.

CUT TO:

91 INT. JACK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Jack, Floyd Gondolli and the Colonel sitting.

FLOYD

. . . so let's talk about the future.

So let's talk about what video means

to this industry -- and let's talk

about how all of us -- not one of us --

but all of us will profit. I've been doing

theater work in San Francisco and San Diego

for as long as you've been doing stag

and hardcore, Jack.

JACK

I know you're history, Floyd.

COLONEL

No one's doubting your history

or your credentials, Floyd.

FLOYD

Then why the resistance? I mean:

This industry is going to be turned

upside down soon enough --

JACK

Then why help it?

FLOYD

Why not be prepared? The money comes

from the Colonel, the talent comes from

you, Jack. I've got a connection to the

equipment and the mail order distribution,

not to mention those kids I got out there

who are hot-fuck-action to the max.

This is the future. Video tape tells the truth.

JACK

I have a stable of actors and actresses.

They're professionals. They're not

a bunch of fucking amateurs. They're

proven box office and they get people

in theaters (where films should be seen)

and they know how to fuck well --

FLOYD

That's right, Jack and by that

same token, you're the one with the

power here. The video revolution

is upon us -- and our role is critical.

We have an obligation to use our resources

and talent to help make it fly --

JACK

You come in here, at my party, tell me about

this and that -- tell me about the future,

tell me about -- video and amateurs and

all that -- well lemme tell you something now:

I will not shoot films on video and no

I will not loan out my actors who are

under contract to me. Period.

FLOYD

Wait a minute, Jack. I'm not a complicated man.

I like cinema. In particular, I like to

see fucking on film. I don't want to win

an Oscar and I don't want to re-invent the

wheel -- I enjoy simple pleasures like butter

in my ass and lollipops in my mouth.

That's me -- call me crazy, call me a pervert,

but this is something I enjoy. One other

small thing I want to do in this life is make

a dollar and a cent in this business -- I'm not

trying to hurt you. I'm trying to help you stay

one step ahead of the game --

JACK

We're repeating ourselves now, Floyd.

COLONEL

Jack, I think this is about cost and future --

JACK

The future is as bright as we make it --

it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars

that can be saved shooting on video tape --

if it looks like shit and sounds like shit,

it probably is shit --

FLOYD

I think you're one gin past this conversation --

JACK

No . . . no. I'm crystal clear here.

COLONEL

Jack, please understand that this is

not an argument . . . this is a fact of --

JACK

. . . What . . . ?

COLONEL

This is not an argument, but a --

JACK

What are you saying?

COLONEL

What do you mean, Jack, c'mon --

JACK

Are you telling me that you're

working with this shit?

COLONEL

I think that there is a serious case

to be made for the price and the gamble

on the whole idea of a home video market --

Jack: Two, three years from now, everyone's

gonna be able to walk into their local

supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette --

JACK

True film fans won't watch that shit.

It doesn't look good and more importantly

it doesn't make sex look sexy.

COLONEL

It doesn't have to look good, Jack.

Film is just too damn expensive.

The theaters are already planning

converting to video projectors.

JACK

I haven't heard that.

FLOYD

It's true.

JACK

We've got ten minutes until the New

Year and I don't want it to start like this

so I'm leaving now. We will or we won't

continue this conversation some other time.

Jack leaves. Floyd looks to the Colonel. HOLD.

Dirk and Amber enter. She sits him on the bed.

AMBER

I wanted you . . . to just . . . to come

tell you how much I love you.

It's gonna be a new year and we're

gonna start things and do things

and I want you to know how much I

really care for you, honey. I care

for you so much . . . you're my little baby . . .

DIRK

Thank you, Amber.

AMBER

You're the best thing in the world

that's happened to me since my son

went off . . . and I just . . . I love you, honey.

Amber continues to talk as she sets up more lines of coke.

AMBER

DIRK

I can't . . . it's like . . . next thing

we know . . . it's gonna be 1990, then

AMBER

Goodbye to 1979 . . . hello to 1980 . . .

Make sure you snort it back quick and hard . . .

DIRK

AMBER

Really fast, like this . . .

She demonstrates. Dirk hesitates a moment, then leans down and does a line
of coke.

DIRK

It burns.

AMBER

It's good, though, right?

DIRK

It's in my throat . . . uch . . .

AMBER

It's the drip . . . the drip's the best part.

BUCK

That's what Buck's Super Stereo World

know what they're getting into technically

and I have the specific technical hi-fi

background to answer any technical question

that someone might have -- I've been into

sound equipment for long enough to know what

a guy wants when he walks right in the door --

I can't let you take the tapes until

the bill is paid in full.

DIRK

That makes a lot of sense.

REED

Wait, wait, wait. How can he pay

the price of the demo if he can't

take the demo tapes to a record company?

MANAGER

That's not my problem. My job is to

collect payment before we hand over the tapes.

REED

You can't get a record contract if

the record company can't hear what you've got.

DIRK

OK: Wait a minute -- have you heard my tape?

Huh? Have you heard it? I'm guaranteed

to get a record deal because my stuff is so good.

Once that happens, I'll pay you --

MANAGER

It's not gonna happen. This is a Catch-22,

I understand. You're saying this thing

and I get it but I just won't let it happen.

JUDGE

Hello. You must be Maggie?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

I'm Kathleen O'Malley. The judge.

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

You have a lawyer with you?

AMBER

No. I don't. I do not.

They sit in silence. The Judge looks over a couple of files. Moments later,
Amber's ex-husband, THOMAS (late 30s) steps in with his LAWYER. They all
take seats.

LAWYER

Hello, Judge.

Introductions happen, etc. BEAT. The Judge looks over some files;

JUDGE

You've been divorced for six years.

AMBER

Yes. Since 1977.

JUDGE

(to lawyer)

And the agreement on the money settlement

was taken care of?

LAWYER

Yes.

JUDGE

So. What we're talking about then

is coming to an agreement on custody of Andrew?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

What was decided during the divorce?

LAWYER

Initially, Andrew went with his father,

and visitation was given to his mother on --

(looks at a paper)

from Saturday Noon to Sunday at seven.

With his mother entitled to bring Andrew

to her home or any reasonable place.

JUDGE

(to Amber)

Was that the understanding?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

And why wasn't that visiting privilege honored?

THOMAS

Well, it was for a time --

AMBER

I only saw him twice.

THOMAS

It said, ""reasonable place,"" and I didn't

think a house of drugs and prostitution

and pornography was that.

JUDGE

I'm sorry, what is it that you --

THOMAS

My ex-wife is involved in the pornography

business -- I didn't think that environment

was a safe place for my son.

AMBER

This is not right. My son was never

exposed to pornographic material or

drugs or any of these things, my husband

just assumed --

THOMAS

I saw it with my own eye.

PAUSE. Amber has no response. The Judge looks down at the file.

JUDGE

Did you register this as a complaint?

LAWYER

My client didn't officially register,

but I think the circumstance called

for something immediate -- for the

safety of the child.

JUDGE

How old is the boy now?

THOMAS

He's twelve.

AMBER

He'll be thirteen next month.

JUDGE

Where do you live now?

THOMAS

We live in Long Beach. I have a job

there and my new wife is home with him.

(pause)

You see, the problem is, Judge, is that

my ex-wife is a sick . . . she is a very sick

person and she needs help. She deals in

drugs and sex for a living --

AMBER

I don't do drugs.

LAWYER

Your honor, she has been in and out

of trouble with the law on quite a few

occasions regarding this sort of thing.

AMBER

No. No. Not anymore

TODD

Alright. I think this could be the thing.

Something to help us score a little extra cash.

I think if we decide to do this, we gotta

be one hundred percent.

REED

I agree.

TODD

This guy's name is Rahad Jackson.

He's got more money than God and twice

as much coke, crack and smack. He'll buy

just about anything anybody wants to sell him.

He just likes people hanging out at his house

and partying.

DIRK

How do you know him?

TODD

He used to come into Party Boys

once in a while. Mutrix introduced me --

DIRK

And how would we do it, exactly?

I mean, how would it all go down?

TODD

It's like this: I call him up,

tell him I got half a key of quality stuff.

REED

Do you have his phone number?

TODD

Yeah. So we call him up, give him the price.

DIRK

How much?

TODD

Half a key for like . . . five thousand bucks.

Split it three ways --

DIRK

That's enough to get my Vette fixed.

TODD

That's right. So we set up the deal,

dump half a kilo of baking soda in a

bag and walk over to his house -- BOOM.

Right there -- this could be a nifty bit

o' hustle-bustle.

REED

Do you have his address?

TODD

Fuckin', Reed, yeah I have his address, c'mon.

DIRK

What if he tests it out?

TODD

He won't.

DIRK

How do you know?

TODD

I know he won't. I'm positive. Believe me.

REED

It's a pretty good idea.

DIRK

I think we should go for it.

Scotty J. comes over to the table.

SCOTTY J.

You guys should be careful with this.

DIRK

Scotty?

SCOTTY J.

What?

DIRK

Just . . . y'know . . . mind yer own business.

Todd takes out a .45 AUTOMATIC PISTOL and loads a cartridge.

DIRK

What the fuck is that?

TODD

It's a big gun.

DIRK

I know, but why?

TODD

Just in case, just in case. Let's go.

They pile out of the damaged Corvette and walk up. CAMERA (STEADICAM)
follows them.

REED

I'm nervous.

TODD

It'll be okay.

REED

Let's get in and out, in and out.

TODD

Not too quick -- that looks suspicious.

Lemme do the talking --

They arrive and ring the doorbell.

CUT TO:

173 INT. RAHAD JACKSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - THAT MOMENT

A really big fat black BODYGUARD comes to the door and opens up:

BODYGUARD

Hello. Come on in.

The bodyguard leads them down a hall and into a tacky and spacious, sunken
LIVING ROOM.

They're greeted by a man in a silk robe, slightly open to show some bikini
briefs and a thin sheen of sweat covering his body: RAHAD JACKSON (late
40s).

Off in a corner of the room, a YOUNG ASIAN KID is casually throwing some
FIRECRACKERS around.

Rahad is DANCING around by himself to NIGHT RANGER, ""SISTER CHRISTIAN."" He
spots the men;

RAHAD

Hello, friends. Which one is Todd?

TODD

That's me. We met before at the club --

RAHAD

Oh, yeah. Come on in here.

TODD

These are my friends Dirk and Reed.

RAHAD

Great to meet you. You guys want something

to drink -- or a pill -- or some coke --

or some dope?

DIRK/REED/TODD

No thank you, thanks, no.

RAHAD

So what do we have, we have, something, yeah?

TODD

Here it is . . . half a key . . . it's really good,

if you wanna test it out --

RAHAD

Oh, wait a minute, I love this part:

(sings along)

""SISTER CHRISTIAN, THERE'S SO MUCH

IN LIFE, DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP BEFORE

YOUR TIME IS DUE . . . IT'S TRUE!""

(to Dirk)

This song is so amazing.

Anyway: What's the price?

TODD

We were thinking five thousand.

RAHAD

That's good. No problem, cool, cool.

The Bodyguard brings over a PAPER BAG FULL OF CASH and hands the bag to
Todd in exchange for the PAPER BAG FULL OF BAKING SODA.

Reed watches the Bodyguard take the bag and notices something. REED'S POV:
a SHOULDER HOLSTER holds a .45 Automatic Pistol.

Rahad does an air guitar solo to the Night Ranger song . . . he walks
across the room, picks up a COKE PIPE and looks to the guys;

RAHAD

You wanna play baseball?

DIRK/REED/TODD

No thank you.

Rahad strokes the pipe while dancing. Dirk looks across to an open bedroom
door.

DIRK'S POV: Through the crack in the door, we can see a bloody, battered
YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in a silk robe . . .she's followed by another YOUNG WHITE
GIRL in nothing.

RAHAD (OC)

Check this out --

He takes out a nickel plated REVOLVER and loads a single bullet, spins the
chamber and puts it to his head and sings;

RAHAD

SISTER CHRISTIAN -- OH THE TIME HAS

COME . . . AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE

THE ONLY ONE TO SAY . . . OK . . .

He pulls the trigger . . . Click . . . he smiles and casually speaks;

RAHAD

I put a mix tape together of all

my favorite songs . . . This is song number

three . . . I love putting mix tapes together,

you know . . . if you buy an album or tape or

something, those guys put the songs in their

order and they try and say how you should listen

to the songs, but I don't like that.

I don't like to be told what to listen

to, when to listen to or anything . . .

The Night Ranger song FADES OUT . . . BEAT . . . Rahad smiles at the Asian
Kid who's casually throwing some firecrackers around.

RAHAD

(to Dirk/Reed/Todd)

He's Chinese . . . he loves to set

off firecrackers . . .

REO SPEEDWAGON, ""CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING,"" begins to play.

RAHAD

I CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING ANY LONGER

AND YET I'm STILL AFRAID TO LET IT FLOW.

WHAT STARTED OUT AS FRIENDSHIP HAS GROWN

STRONGER -- I ONLY WISH I HAD THE STRENGTH

TO LET IT SHOW --

DIRK

Well . . . I think maybe . . . we better get going --

RAHAD

No, stay. Hang out. We'll party.

DIRK

No, we really gotta split.

We have to be somewhere and we --

Dirk and Rahad continue to haggle about leaving/not leaving. CAMERA BEGINS
A SLOW DOLLY INTO A CU ON TODD.

TODD

We're Not Leaving Yet.

Dirk and Reed look at Todd. He stands up.

TODD

We're here now and we want something else.

Hey -- Hey. We Want Something Else From You.

RAHAD

What?

DIRK

Todd -- what the hell are you doing?

TODD

In the master bedroom, under the bed,

in a floor safe . . . You understand?

The Bodyguard turns his head. Dirk and Reed are confused;

DIRK

Todd . . . what the fuck, man, c'mon --

TODD

Shut up, Dirk. I told you I got a plan.

I got a good plan.

RAHAD

Are you kiddin' me kittie?

TODD

No I'm not. I'm not kidding. We want

what's in the safe. We want what's in

the safe in the floor under the bed in

the master bedroom.

DIRK

Todd -- don't be crazy.

(to Rahad)

Sir -- we don't know anything about this.

This is not the thing that we wanted.

TODD

SHUT THE FUCK UP, DIRK.

The BODYGUARD reaches into his coat . . .

. . . Todd pulls his REVOLVER quickly and AIMS at the Bodyguard.

TODD

Don't reach for your gun.

. . . Rahad reacts by AIMING HIS GUN AT TODD . . .

RAHAD

You don't wanna do this, friendly.

TODD

You've only got one bullet.

Rahad PULLS THE TRIGGER . . . a bullet FIRES from the gun and strikes Todd
in the SHOULDER . . . the gun in his hand falls to the floor and he
stumbles back . . .

. . . The Bodyguard takes this moment to GRAB HIS OWN GUN from the holster
and FIRE off shots at Dirk and Reed . . .

. . . Bullets graze past them and they DUCK FOR COVER . . .

. . . The GIRLS in the bedroom SCREAM and SHOUT at the gunfire . . .

. . . A STRAY BULLET HITS the ASIAN KID in the heart, but he doesn't fall .

. . . TODD reaches hold of his gun, crouches for cover and FIRES a bullet
STRAIGHT INTO the Bodyguard . . . who falls back DEAD . . . Todd looks
right and sees:

RAHAD scuttles into the bedroom with the women . . . Todd looks over his
shoulder to Dirk and Reed;

DIRK

WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, TODD?

TODD

He went in the bedroom.

DIRK

ARE YOU CRAZY? WHEN DID YOU GO CRAZY?

TODD

He's got cash and coke in the safe

under the bed -- if we leave here

without it we're fools.

REED

Let's just split, let's just split

right now, Todd. Don't be stupid.

This wasn't part of the deal.

TODD

I'm goin' in that bedroom and get what's

in that safe. Are you coming?

DIRK

Fuck no. Todd. Don't. Don't do it.

Todd gets up and heads for the bedroom with his revolver at the ready . . .
he inches closer to the door and twists the door knob, then KICKS THE DOOR
OPEN;

. . . Rahad is standing right there, holding a SAWED OFF SHOTGUN. He pulls
the trigger . . . Todd blinks . . .

. . . Rahad's SHOTGUN BLAST blows Todd BACK and UP in the air about fifteen
feet . . . he FALLS to the ground with a HOLE in his STOMACH about the size
of a basketball . . . Rahad calls out to Dirk and Reed;

RAHAD

C'mon out, little puppies. You want to

come and see, come and see, to get what

is coming down. Coming down.

Rahad peers out from his bedroom, sees a sliver of Dirk behind the wall.
Rahad FIRES HIS SHOTGUN . . . which cuts right past Dirk's head and SHREDS
the wall near him . . .

CUT TO:

196 INT. JACK'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY - THAT MOMENT

Dirk is sitting in a jean costume, script in front of him for the new film,
working on the lines. He's cleaned up a bit, hair slicked back. He looks in
the mirror;

DIRK

I've been around this block twice

looking for something . . . a clue.

I've been looking for clues and something

led me back here . . . yeah . . . so here I am.

(beat)

Coulda been me who was at

Ringo's place when the shit went down . . .

(beat)

Hey . . . I know how it is . . . cause I been

there . . . we've all done bad things . . . .

We all have those guilty feelings in

our hearts . . . you wanna take your

brain out of your head and wash it and

scrub it and make it clean . . . well no.

(beat)

But I'm gonna help you settle this . . .

(beat)

First we're gonna check for holes,

see what we can find . . . then we're

gonna get nice and wet . . . so you're

gonna spread your legs . . .

(beat)

That's good . . . so you know me, you

know my reputation . . . thirteen

inches is a tough load, I don't

treat you gently . . . That's right:

I'm Brock Landers.

(beat)

So I'm gonna be nice and I'm gonna

ask you one more time . . .

(beat)

Where the fuck is Ringo?

Dirk stands up, unzips his pants and lets his cock hang out. He looks at
the REFLECTION of it in the mirror;

DIRK

I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star.

I'm a star. I'm a star, I'm a big

bright shining star.

He puts his cock back in his pants, does a final karate kick and walks out
of the room, closing the door behind him.

331,Boy,"[Verse 1]
Boy, you're gonna know it all
You'll think you're ten feet tall
And run like you're bulletproof
And total a car or two
Boy, you're gonna hate this town
Wish you could burn it down
That fire in your eyes is 20 counties wide
But boy, you're gonna love 17
And boy, you'll do some stupid things

[Chorus]
You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you well, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be a boy

[Verse 2]
You're gonna be so stubborn
You get that from your mother
I already see it now, you weren't built for backing down
And boy, there'll be a small town night
And you'll fall for her sky-blue eyes
And when she's in your hands
You'll think you're a man and not a boy
She'll make you lose your mind, boy
She'll be every reason why

[Chorus]
You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be...my boy

[Bridge]
It's 3am and I'd do anything to get you back to sleep
And that face will be the same one in the rearview
The day I watch you leave

[Outro]
But boy, you're gonna come back home
You're gonna settle down
But you won't feel the way I'm feelin' now
Til you have a boy
He's gonna know it all
He'll think he's ten feet tall
And run like he's bulletproof
And total a car or two",Lee Brice,Lee Brice,2017,[94],1

We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

[Verse 2]
It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

333,Any Ol' Barstool,"[Verse 1]
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

[Verse 2]
I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone

Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby

Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone

I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur

This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane

With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

341,Whatever It Takes,"[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom

'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

He praying to make it home
But you ain't answer your phone
Cause it's word on the street, them people didn't put him on
He got your name to 'em like several times
Trying to put you in a cell 'til you 75
Should've knew it when that nigga said ""I'm telling my mom""
Them people grabbed you and you wasn't surprised

Fuck you like the pornstar, just don't lose your cool nigga

We was putting work in 'til we had to keep that tool with us
Took that shit to school with us (yeah, let me tell 'em)
Pulled up in my hood and I jump out the Wraith
Bust down, Patek, diamonds jump out the face
Fear of god on me, I got nothing but faith
Like where the love, I'm feeling nothing but hate
I'm from a hood where before you make it to the morgue niggas will come to your place
Day 1's all in your crib trying to touch in your safe

Seen your son and give him fuck if he ain't

Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch, I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us

Well I'll be God damned, go figure

It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man, what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that

And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

Hier j'ai reçu un appel de mon pote à 101
Il a dit qu'ils ont tué son seul fils à cause de fonds insuffisants
Il pleurait, il tremblait, près à se battre et bourré
Parlant à gorge déployée, philosophant sur ce que le Seigneur a fait
Il a dit : ""K-Dot, peux-tu prier pour moi ?
C'a été une journée de merde pour moi
Je sais que tu as été oint, montre moi comment surmonter ça.""
Il cherchait quelque chose à quoi se raccrocher
Espérant que je pouvait le lui donner
Pour le spirituel, mon esprit fait bien mieux, mais je lui ai dit
""Je ne peux pas te servir la réponse, voilà ce que je pense :
Si quelqu'un tue mon fils, ça veut dit que quelqu'un va se faire tuer.""
Dis moi ce que tu fais pour l'amour, la loyauté, et la passion de
Tous ces souvenirs engrangés, ces moments qu'on ne pourra jamais atteindre

Il n'y a pas de Black Power quand ton bébé se fait tuer par un lâche

Oiseau du ghetto dans la street, les ambulanciers au bout du fil
Laisse quelqu'un toucher à ma maman
Toucher à ma sœur, toucher à ma femme
Toucher à mon père, toucher à ma nièce
Toucher à mon neveu, toucher à mon frère

When you were waddling yay high? This guy
When the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below?
You're looking at him, yo!

To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also, I harnessed the breeze, you're welcome
To fill your sails and shake your trees

Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly, I can go on and on
I can explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway
And the tapestry here in my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been, I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tippity tapping
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey

[Chorus]
Well anyway, let me say ""you're welcome""
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go
Hey, it's your day to say ""you're welcome""

I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome

Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters

I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Maybe I wasn’t there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

I need some water, somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's, I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much? Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that, girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch, let me put the head in

Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction
Lately, I'm not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours

Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know where I cannot go
Where I long to be

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me

If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

I know everybody on this island seems so happy, on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role, on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

More accurate at bagging dimes, now we bagging rhymes
Bodybags, price tags on your forehead
Nine times out of ten, young niggas are nine or ten
When the line becomes thin: be a killer or fireman
Fill up the lavish pen if I needed to right my wrongs
I can't deny sin, condolences through these palms
I remember when your cousin was coming home
My bitch, why we plotted to kill him 'cause we ain't know him
Unfamiliar faces make niggas nervous
Convicted court cases might hit the surface
Restricted territories might come through lurkin'
We ain't want none of that urgent call
Well, I'ma act Turk and fall on my identity, percocets
For all the headaches, I'm 'bout to bring confetti
Tumble out this barrel soon as it ring, you ready?
That was the word 'for we moved on 'em
Treat him like Joe the Plumber
I wonder if someone come and can see this tool on him
Immature and retarded is what you call me
Your cousin wa'n't coming home from the pen but from the army
If I can right my wrongs and pen this verse I read
Even though a bullet hit him in the leg, still walk on by

I ain’t here to pick and choose
I ain't here to sing the blues
I’m just here to spread the clues
I’m just here to spread the news
Everybody know I do
Listen
I ain’t ashamed to be white
I ain’t ashamed to be Black
I ain’t ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact
I know you fucking with that
And I’m not scared of the people who tell me I should be
Do what you love and don’t ever wonder what it could be
Everybody from my hood, everybody know I’m good
Sometimes I’m misunderstood
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading
I'm right out my mind
Tell 'em!
Momma don't love me
Daddy don't love me
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly
You could be anything you wanna be
'Cept the person you don’t wanna be
Let him hate let em love
Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I don’t have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I’m attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man I’ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I’m black and proud
I’m just as white as that Mona Lisa
I’m just as black as my cousin Keisha
I’m biracial so bye Felicia
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher
Maybe Jesus was black
Maybe Jesus had dreads
Spiderman should be black
I vote for Glover instead

I vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
I vote for so much more

[Verse 3]
Yacht cruisin' in the deep
I'm twisted up, I got geeked
Misbehaving with your freak
Can't tell she got teeth
I was in her mouth like veneers
Stop comparing my career
Designer flooded through the crib
Bentley furniture for real
Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga out the six
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin' 10 for the strong
Keep on goin' in on this song
Keep an F&N at your home
Lesson learned and we moving on

381,Blem,"[Intro]
Unruly, unruly, maddas
Who keeps bringing more? I’ve had too many
This Virginia done me off already
I’m blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I’m blem for real, I might just say how I feel

[Chorus]
Don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

[Verse 1]
'Cause I know what I like
I know how I wanna live my life
I don’t need no advice
You’re not here and we both know why
So, move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
I’m buildin' up a house where they raised me
You move with me, I’ll go crazy

[Chorus]
Don’t switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he’s a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I’m blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I’m blem for real, I might just say how I feel

[Verse 2]
I know we can’t keep it together forever
'Cause you’re crazy sometimes
And I only see you sometimes
Move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
I’m buildin' up a house where they raised me
You move with me, I'll go—, look just

[Chorus]
Don’t switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he’s a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I’m blem for real, I might just say how I feel

382,Think A Little Less,"[Verse 1]
Midnight's creepin' in, we know better
Than leaving here together
And in case you were wondering
You've never looked hotter
So why even bother
Looking at the reasons not to
Maybe we ought to

[Chorus]
Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
And kiss a little more
Think a little less

[Verse 2]
When your friends start asking you
Look 'em in the eyes
Tell a white lie
How I dropped you off at home
And I walked you to the door
Nothing more
Tomorrow you can say we're just friends
But baby ‘til then
Kiss a little more

[Chorus]
Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more
Think a little less

[Verse 3]
I'll go warm up the truck if you wanna hop in
Give you a minute or two
To say goodbye to your friends
Ain't gotta go home
But we gotta get gone
Cause we've already waited way too long to...

[Bridge]
Kiss a little more
Think a little less
And do the only thing we've been thinking ‘bout doing
Since the moment, girl, we met

[Chorus]
Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more
Think a little less

383,Teenage Fever,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind so

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6AM
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me

384,Bar At The End Of The World,"[Verse 1]
There's a trail of smoke coming out of a bottle
If you look real close, you can see it right there
A little tin roof bar down a path you have to follow
From a treasure map with the edges burnt
From a few too many beers

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll pull the ropes off the boat
We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock

[Chorus]
We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world

[Verse 2]
In that old seashell, you can hear the ocean
You can hear the waves crash
And whisper in your ear
Little glow in the night, it's the last place open
And the house drink is a beautiful thing
Called ""Make Me Disappear""

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll throw the ropes off the boat
We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock

[Chorus]
We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world

[Bridge]
There ain't no empty glasses
They're playing Drift Away
That's where the magic happens
Back up in that little bay

[Chorus]
We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world

385,Million Reasons,"[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Bridge]
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Chorus]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one

386,Water Under The Bridge,"[Verse 1]
If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey, if I’m not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Verse 2]
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently

388,Speak To A Girl,"[Verse 1: Faith Hill]
She don't give a damn 'bout your Benjamin Franklins
She wants Aretha
She don't really care how you're spending your money
It's all how you treat her
She just want a friend to be there
When she opens her eyes in the morning
She wants you to say what you mean and mean everything that you're saying

[Chorus: Faith Hill]
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with the lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
She don't give a damn 'bout your pride or the lies that you're hiding behind
She just want to feel that you're real
That she's near to the man that's inside
She don't need to hear she's a queen on a throne
That she's more than amazing
She just wants you to say what you mean and to mean everything that you're saying

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with a lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl

[Bridge: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
That's how you speak to, speak to her
That's how you speak to, speak to her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with a lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world

[Chorus 2: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl

389,Tin Man,"[Verse 1]
Hey there Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'
For something bound to fall apart
Everytime you're feeling empty
Better thank your lucky stars
If you ever felt one breaking
You'd never want a heart

Oo-oo
Oo-oo
Oo

[Verse 2]
Hey there Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
I've been on the road that you're on
It didn't get me very far
You ain't missing nothing
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me darling
You don't want a heart

Oo-oo
Oo-oo
Oo

[Verse 3]
Hey there Mr. Tin Man
I'm glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now
By the way there Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor
And you can have my heart

Oo-oo
Oo-oo
Oo",Miranda Lambert,Miranda Lambert,2017,[75],1

Don't tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel 'round the atlas in this spaceship
Candy-coated, my day shift's
Been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up, lampin' in Jamaica
The clouds turnin', my thoughts turnin’
Burnin’ castor oil, yo I been determined to make an earnin'
This seed in this soil is classified
I’m satisfied when I strategize my kid's future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
The more blood pours, but—

[Chorus]
Don’t tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you

[Verse 2]
My fans can't wait for me to son ya punk-ass
And crush ya whole lil' shit
I'll Big Pun ya punk-ass, you a scared lil' bitch
Tiptoein' around my name, nigga, you lame
And when I get at you, homie
Don't you just tell me you was just playin'
Oh, I was just playin', K-Dot
C'mon, you know a nigga rock with you, bro
Shut the fuck up, you sound like the last nigga I know
Might end up like the last nigga I know
Oh, you don't wanna clash? Nigga, I know
I put my foot on the gas, head on the floor
Hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, I'm on a roll
Yellin', ""One, two, three, four, five
I am the greatest rapper alive""
So damn great, motherfucker, I've died
What you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
House on the hill, house on the beach, nigga (facts)
A condo in Compton, I'm still in reach, nigga (facts)
I'm fresh out the water, I'm 'bout to breach, nigga
The five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep, nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah, mo' cars, mo' lears
Mo' bars, no peers, no scars, no fear—fuck y'all, sincere
I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers
You know what the risk is
Earthed in ditches, your body revertin' to stiffness
The whole world gone mad
Bodies is addin' up, market's about to crash
Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump
Know how we feel, punk—tell him that God comin'
And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'
Electorial votes look like memorial votes
But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
It's blasphemy, how many gon' blast for me?
I prophesized on my last song, you laughed at me
But when the shit get brackin', don't you ask for me
How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?
G Malone, big bro, kudos to him
I was two O's from a M, tryna be big as Em
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Salmon and capers, fame and lawsuits
You lookin' at me in Chucks, I'm lookin' at y'all suits
Me and Top Dawg playin' rock-paper-scissors in court
A real hustler lose money just to go get some more
I said it's like that, dropped one classic, came right back
'Nother classic, right back
My next album, the whole industry on a ice pack
With TOC, you see the flames
In my E-Y-E's—it's not a game
And the whole world is goin' mad, daddy, it's sad, daddy
My only advice? Go and get you a bag, daddy
Lee Baca on trial tryna portray a boxer
Beatin' up on my niggas while the CO's watch him
Tables turned, lesson learned, my best look
You jumped sides on me, now you 'bout to meet Westbrook
Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you
Just know, the next game played I might slap the shit out you
Technical foul, I'm flagrant, I'm foul
They throwin' me out, you throw in the towel
Look at the crowd, they— (Naw, I don't like that)
Look at my smile, I'm smirkin'
Calm but urgent (That ain't the style, fuck!)
So many verses, you live in denial (Fuck!)
So many verses, I never run out (What?)
You makin' him nervous, the music is loud
Ho, JAY-Z Hall of Fame, sit yo punk-ass down!
(Sit yo punk-ass down)
So that means you ain't bigger than rapping (What else?)
So that means no more playin' the back scenes (What else?)
My spot is solidified if you ask me (What else?)
My name is identified as ""That King""
I'll let y'all worry about a list, I'm on some other shit
A difference between accomplishments and astonishments
You know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever
Y'all got 'til April the 7th to get y'all shit together

Wrote this shit, January 21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city
Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person
First thing they say is, ""I know you need a break.""
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah

Few shows, that's a mil run
When she bust it down
I said, ""Thanks for givin' to me,"" like a pilgrim
Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers: that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like the Carter, mean it jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah I love my fans but I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God
Point guard and the two guard

Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary

You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.

Still missing you

Feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier
Than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know
How to talk to you
I don't know to be there
When you need me
It feels like the only time you'll see me
Is when you turn your head
To the side and look at me differently
Ohh...
Yeah, and last night
I think I lost my patience
Last night I got as high as your expectations
Last night, oh  came to realization
And I hope you could take it
I hope you could take it all

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it(2x)

Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap

You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next

Died and came back as Fela Kuti
Don't phone me, send a text to Julie

South by, ride out, no Suzuki
Got the Austin Powers, a man's extra groovy (greaze!)

Crackhead swag with the razor blade

Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
Greaze, so don't forget to remember me (yeah)
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see (get me)
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy
And now I'm back on tour, so what you tellin' me?
(Greaze!) Taliban, Halloween (icy)
Pull up in the whip with the gasoline (greaze!)
Yeah, that's that boy from the magazine (jheeze!)

Look at you now, stuck in the background
Silence right now sounds so loud
Tried to let you go, you come back 'round

Plus I got that ass like Selena

Used to lay up in them sheets, they were snow white
Now you spendin' cold nights
You've been in the wrong so long
You don't even know right
Call my line, call my line, I'm like, ""Please, boy""
You just need to leave, boy
I ain't got time for you
Just once, do somethin' for me, boy

417,Better Man,"[Verse 1]
I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Verse 2]
I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it’s always on your terms
I’m hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I’ll always be around
You push my love away like it’s some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I’d run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

[Bridge]
I hold onto this pride because these days it’s all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can’t say that
You can’t say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would’ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would’ve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye

I did it for everybody out here on their own
I did it for the ones who walk a mile in them cages
And never tell me no
Come get me when I fall, and tell me when I'm wrong
But you should know I bought 'em
I changed it, I changed it
They say that shit the same, it ain't the same, though
I changed it, I changed it

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Oh my god, I changed it
Oh my god, they on the same shit
Oh my god, I changed it
Oh my god, they still on the same shit

I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
The big 3 on the court, bitch at them bleachers
I don't wanna have to break bad like it screeches
A bitch out in Atlanta eating them peaches
A bitch got more bars than where Big Meech is
No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no Lisa here
She gon' dread dissin' Nicki like Lisa hair
I buy, lil nigga, ain't no leaser here
The bitch gambled her career, now it's gon' be severe
I just be watchin' bitches pitfalls
Stopped doin' pills, but bitch dem withdrawals
I am in my mansion rockin' pink drawers
I leveled up, bitch, I switched flows
MJ to the teens, I am Billie Jean and the bitch is my son
I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number, tell them bitches I won
This hoe gettin' slick, so I put on gym shoes and extended my run
MJ, game 6, (you my) Jackson, Tyson

No more CMB shit, I changed it
Young Money shit, Mula Gang shit
Different hoes doing the same shit
Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went
Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean
Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen
Yeah, Carter time, I put bling on for the time
She changed her ringtone to one of mine, I changed 23s to 45s
Lil Tune like autotune, I get in her throat and she harmonize
She get the D and ooh la la la, and when she leave, I kumbaya
I whip it up with the left hand, I don't fuck with the yes man
I get younger by the second, I don't rust like Def Jam
It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team
Have sex on my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em ""Let's beef""
Changing girls, change is fine
She don't like girls, change her mind
Change the world, change my line
Never ever change my slimes
Changing looks, changing lies, changing skies, changing lanes
Me, Minaj, and Champagne changed the game
And y'all chump change
I'm just sayin'

Quiet dawg, my phone changed up
I'm icin' out my Barbie chains up

[Verse 1]
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking her cheek

[Chorus]
They say, ""You're a little much for me, you're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting running through the night
But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

[Intro]
Rudeboyz

[Verso 1: Maluma]
Cuando estás bien te alejas de mí
Te sientes sola y siempre estoy ahí
Es una guerra de toma y dame
Pues dame de eso que tienes ahí
Oye, baby, no seas mala
No me dejes con las ganas
Se escucha en la calle
Que ya no me quieres
Ven y dímelo en la cara

[Pre-Coro: Shakira & Maluma]
Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti
Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe
Un día digo que no y otro que sí
Yo soy masoquista
Con mi cuerpo un egoísta

[Coro: Shakira, Maluma & Ambos]
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Siempre es a tu manera
Yo te quiero aunque no quiera
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Vas libre como el aire
No soy de ti ni de nadie

[Verso 2: Shakira & Maluma]
Como tú me tientas, cuando tú te mueves
Esos movimientos sexys, siempre me entretienen
Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas
No sé por qué me tienes en lista de espera
Te dicen por ahí que voy haciendo y deshaciendo
Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ahí sufriendo
Que en esta relación soy yo la que manda
No pares bola' a toda esa mala propaganda

[Puente: Shakira & Maluma]
Pa', pa' que te digo na', te comen el oído
No vaya a enderezar lo que no se ha torcido
Y como un loco sigo tras de ti, muriendo por ti
Dime qué hay pa' mí, bebé (¿Qué?)

[Pre-Coro: Shakira & Maluma]
Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti

430,New Man,"[Intro]
Nah nah nah nah nah

[Verse 1]
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Verse 2]
Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Bridge]
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

431,Supermarket Flowers,"[Verse 1]
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

[Verse 2]
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

[Outro/Chorus]
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know

432,What Do I Know?,"[Verse 1]
Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, ""Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels""

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love, and understanding positivity

[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

[Verse 2]
The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity

[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows

You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

[Verse 2]
In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

How would you feel

I'll be taking my time

Falling deeper in love with you

434,Eraser,"[Verse 1]
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Verse 2]
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?

Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it

This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead

And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my

I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die

Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade, I got caught with a pistol
Sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade, started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade, I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward, nigga, 2016
And I'm screamin' fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listened to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough

'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'

So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
""Savage, I was just playin'""

That shit childish to me
Two hundred thousand to see me

Look like boulders to me

You think he colder than me?
You more bipolar than me

I'm the type of nigga, spend a million on a wedding cake

Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It’s funny how things never change in this old town

The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you

I put a middle finger up, because, fuck you
This money got me geekin' up, nigga, fuck you
Red bottoms with the fur like Frank Luc
I bought some VVS and she caught the chain flu
I fucked this R&B bitch, I should thank you
Yah, I was sippin' my codeine from the beginnin'
She jocked my whole team, she seen who's winnin'
We light Liv up on a Sunday, come see us livin'
This for my dogs on the one way in penitentiaries
Send a direct hit, you gotta pay attention
I just lit my wrist up, I need some more attention
She didn't wanna play fair, I put her on suspension
I put a ki on Greyhound now I'm in a new dimension
Offered her 25, keep tryin' to take some of my percentage
I was petrified, you know my right wrist authentic
I get glorified, that Richard Mille cost 250
I'm a big dog, it ain't no sense in holdin' back
On my Usain Bolt shit, I ran up in yo' set
Fuckin' with them strippers all in G5
And as soon as the club closed we board the G5
I got scammers and junkies lined up on each side
I got five percent tint on each side
I tried to make it outta school on the East Side
I'm on my Nicky Barnes shit, so it's fuck school
I'm blowin' money real fast like Big Meech crew
I like my hundreds stacked up, I like ‘em neat too
They come in stuck together when they in the wrap still
I fucked a rapper bitch, I was on a drug deal
I fucked a rapper bitch, I was on a drug deal

Got the money comin' in, it ain't no issues
I just fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
Got the MAC-11 cocked, it got the kick too

I just fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
She sucked my dick, she came home, I bet she kissed you
I fucked this R&B bitch, I should thank you

Them bricks coming in like the John Doe crew
They put a number on your head, they tryna stank you
I'm ‘bout to take ‘em out the game, nigga fuck you
They got me goin' insane, now it's fuck you
I let my brother fuck your bitch, he got the dog food
I damn near get half a ticket for a walk through
I fuck dem Super Bowl bitches down in Houston
I got this Westside freakin' like boostin'
I built my empire up like Lucious
Ayy gimme pounds, gimme bricks, I'm a nuisance
I make the blogs with ya bitch 'cause I'm ruthless
I make the blogs with ya bitch 'cause I'm ruthless
Yah, I get cash money like I'm Mack Maine
I just put a rapper bitch on game
I be smokin' rapper weed with my gang

İş bitirmek üzereyim, bu çocuk her gece ayakta
Zar attığımda 7 sayısını görmek üzereyim
Şanımı sular altında bırakmak üzereyim
Risk almak üzereyim, belki hayatını sikebilir
Onlara diyorum ki fotoğrafçılar gibi nişan al (odakla) ve ateş et (fotoğraf çek)
Kameraların önünde (brr)
Lanet olsun, Sean, nerede senin o eski alçak gönüllülüğün?
Ben diyorum ki ""Zenciler flow'umu arakladı ama hala ayaktayım.""
Midas dokunuşu yaptığımı düşünüyordum ki ve sonrasında platinum kazandım
Tüm karşılaştırmalarınızın anasını sikeyim
Ben Tanrı'yla terapistimmiş gibi konuşuyorum
Ben Afro-Amerikan bir Amerikalıyım
Bir şeyin üstüne konduğum yok ama 30'uma gelmeden milyoner oldum
Yani O bir şeyler duyuyor olmalı
Don, don, don, ben bunu insanlarım için yapıyorum
Detroit'ten çıkma bu adam kurşunla kontamine edilmiş Flint'e yardım etti
Diğerleri yardıma ihtiyacı olan bölgelerde
Güle oynaya hit alırlar
Ama bir de gelip eller havaya derler
Sahip olduğum tek anlaşma Sam'in Kulübü'nden
Ve şimdi damarlarımdaki kan mavi, yani nereden geldim biliyorsun
Tekrar gidemeyeceğimin söylendiği bir dünyada doğmuşum
Benim kulvarımda, Usain Bolt'la aynı gemide olduğumu düşünüyorum
Her anlamda onlardan öndeyim, yani hedefimde kafalar var
Büyükannem öldüğümde, bir meleğim olduğunu fark ettim
Bana her şeyin bakış açısına göre değişen bir nimet olduğunu gösterdi
Bak, ben anormalim, asla iyiliğe veya özre ihtiyacım yok
Bu benim yeni hayat boyu politikam
Ahşaptan yapılmış direksiyona sahip arabam sanki bir korsan gemisi gibi
Daha kaç tane sağlam verse yazmam gerekiyor siz kaltakların beni tanıması için
Yaptığımız bu şarkılar, adamım
Daha büyük bir güce bağlıyor bizi
Nasıl biliyorum? Çünkü ben yazmak için yazmam, ben düşünürüm, adamım
Bak, benim tüm yaptığım gariplikleri alt etmek
Çünkü hayat bazen seni ne yapacağını bilemediğin bir duruma sokar
İntikam almak karşılık vermek istersin, ama ben yapamayacağımı sandığın şeyi yaparım
Hipnotize olmuşcasına asla durmuyoruz
İzle, bak, ve oluşturduğumuz yükselmekte olan görseli gör
Tüm zamanların en iyisi (G.O.A.T.) ol
Yaşıyorken, öldüğümüz zaman, hepimiz birer Tanrı olacağız

Eğer kız leziz bir şeyse, tadını çıkarmam
Tat alma duyularım yok, kaltak, daha sonra yapalım
Ne diye bana bakıyorsun amına kodumun hater'ı?
Göt tecavüzcüsü gibi gözlerine sokuyorum
Kopya çeken bir sınıf arkadaşı gibi stilimi kopyalamaya çalışırsan
Sınavı geçmeden önce göreceğin son yüz benim olur
Senin o sikik götünü matematik sınavı okuyormuş gibi puanlarım (doğrarım)
Zamanımın çok ötesindeyim, benim yaşım geriye doğru gidiyor
Ben temelde 30'um, inanılmaz gürbüzüm
Budala ve sözü uzatan bir beyne sahibim, ineğim
Apaçık terbiyesizim
Delicesine sapığım, tecavüzcü ve ürperticiyim
Beni Jamie Lee Curtis'i öldürmekle suçluyorlar
Diyorlar ki onun suratını fırına koymuşum, sobayla, birkaç eşyayla
Yumurta çırpıcıyla ve termosla ona zarar vermişim
Bu biraz huzur bozucu olabilir ama, söylediklerim sizi fazlasıyla rahatsız etmeye değer
Ama ben Fergie'nin üzerine işiyorum, bana Shady 81 deyin
Şüphesiz ki ben rap'in Aaron Hernandez'i olmak üzereyim
Geri döndüğümü duyunca gezegen panik yaptı, olağanüstü hal ilan edildi
Brady dönüyor, aslında, bence ben Patriots forması giyen (Brady) gibi Pat'in back'i olmayı hak ediyorum
Açıklanamaz derecede rape açım, homurduyorum
Aynı sikik bir Terrier gibi
Aşağılığım, dibine kadar aptalım, gülüncüm
Dilimden çıkanlar çok pis, ağzım bir bok çukuru
Füze gibiyim, bir fırtına bulutu
45 kglık bir pistol'ün tetiğini çektiğinde çıkan sesim
Ve sen de yolunu bulacaksın aynı Digital Underground gibi
Bir Ku Klux Klan posteri ve lamba direğiyle
Kapı koluyla, panjurla, lanet bir cıvata kesiciyle
Sandalla, konserve açacağıyla, mum kağuçuğuyla
Piyanoyla, bir fanilayla, vantuzla, el sabunuyla, tereyağıyla
Bir bançoyla ve bir lağım kapağıyla Ann Coulter'ı sikeyim
Ağzını sikimle dolduracağım, burnunu da kapatıp onu nefessiz bırakacağım
Land Rover'la, bir müzik grubuyla, bir Lamborghini'yle
Veya bir Hummer ile ya da Road Runner ile üstünden geçip onu çiğneyeceğim
Bir ham donut'çıya git ya da başıma Rambo kesil, bu kızın bir örneğini yapmalıyım
Bu Sandra Bland ve Philando içindi kaltak
Kuzuları kesen Hannibal burada, şüphe yok ki çok inatçıyım
Ben antiyim, hiçbir hükümet bu komandoya karşı gelemez
Senin adamın bunu istemiyor, Trump tam bir kaltak
Onun tüm ihtişamını, markasını yerin dibine sokacağım (evet)
Dre'ye söyleyin onu Los Angeles'ta alacağım, beyaz bir Bronco'yla geleceğim Elway gibi
Hızlanıyorum, bir kaltağı ezmek üzereyim, Del Rey mi çalıyor?
Kadınlar halen benden nasibini alacak, bahse girerim ki onlar kanlı bir şekilde uzanacaklar
Ve bağıracaklar ""Bekle!"" diye, yalvaracaklar, ama çığlık atmak anlamsız
Michel'le'yi helyuma boğmuşum gibiler
Donuk suratlarını birkaç kamçı iziyle bırakıyorum
Bir hücre arkadaşıymış gibi muamele ediyorum onlara
Beni cehennemin kapısına tırmanırken gör
Kaltak, benim sen problemlerin gibiyim: ""Kendi uydurduğun.""
Yani demek istiyorum ki bir başkasının yardımına ihtiyacım yok
Çünkü ben—

Estoy planeando un secuestro

Y si alguien te pregunta por tu héroe favorito
Dile que soy yo

Veo un planeta en mis sueños
Ahí nos vamos a amar

Yeah life ain’t fair but it’s still good though
It’s a blessing just to be here

I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face

I woke up in the morning on a cold slab
How the hell I’m in a damn cell
I’m in jail taking cold baths
I went down the wrong path
Lil boy don’t go that way
You prolly won’t last
Before I had the fame I had the name
I earned my stripes like Adidas
Sliding base like I’m Derek Jeter
Growing up with no father, it’ll make you evil
How he gon’ learn to be a man when you ain’t never teach him?
Youngin’ can’t even read but he totin’ the Desert Eagle
Look how she left, I bet she told you she won’t never leave you

I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K

[Verse 2]
I probably thank God ‘cause without him who is me?
He unlocked my cell when they threw away the key
Jailbird, I was caged in, he came and set me free
I was just on the news, now I’m on MTV
Hurting ‘cause your people ate and you ain’t get a piece
Now you’re taking from your people plate ‘cause you just tryna eat
Grinding for a mil and I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout a combo
My mama need a crib, I been thinking ‘bout a condo
You nothing when you down, it’s crazy how people treat you
Come around now, you can’t even hit the reefer
I pray for all my youngins who done took the same route
Brother from the same struggle, cut from the same cloth

I think it's funny how it go down
I don't even know no more, official shit

I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

[Verse 1]
I'm the livin' proof
That you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece
People passin' faster than I'm passin' weed

And be the man you have to be
Holdin' ship down, don't crash at sea""
Brrrt! Paper on my phone line
It's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me
But I don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically
'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually
So I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
And as for me, I'ma text the room number right now
So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me
Don't ask for me, don't ask for me
Don't ask for me
Lot of shit been goin' on, things goin' wrong
So don't ask for me

Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

[Verse 2]
She been mad, I've been on the go, on the road
On a roll more than a roller coaster
They can't throw me off track or slow
If I did, I got a long list of hoes on hoes
That quote on quote, say I told you so
Heaven on earth, every night is paradise
I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that
I kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s
Still smokin' at 5:20 like it's 4:20
On a quest for more money, more hungry
Just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'
Yeah I got the force but never force nothin'
Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'
In my city I'm Warren Buffett
I mean business, the shirt is tucked in
The gun's tungsten, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with
Who the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with
My stock's risin', I'm goin' public, if I write it, it's gon' publish
You're fuckin' with the best, no discussion

I stay 100 like my dash, yeah
Have you cummin' faster than The Flash, yeah
Is it all mine, all mine? You know me, I had to ask
Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass, glass
Honestly, I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me
This don't replace what I did to you
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through
Look, I'm not tryna play the blame game
Point the fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both want the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we don't work it out, shame shame
I can't touch these hoes I can't trust, I don't wanna have a fake us

Uh-huh, is it time?

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Look, I spent my whole life tryna improvise
I'm not saying that shit for you to sympathize
Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel
I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders
Going up, with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this, I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with

[Refrain: Big Sean]
You know, take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

[Chorus: Jeremih & Big Sean]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light
Hell nah, the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Got the whole city on fire
Boy, this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired
This the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire
This the flow that got my whole family finna retire
Flows on flows, I might drown in this bitch
Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch
My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town
Where if they know you're brown, they might hold you down and even hose you down, man
Since I'm his son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon

[Refrain: Big Sean]
So when they take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, and hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away

I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

Meanwhile, I'm just trying be a mogul
Hunid million views now i'm global
You think he fateful but little do you know hoe
I got yo n*gga on his knees, as if he finta make a proposal
My legs got his head in a choke hold
henswa I call yo n*gga low blow

Y'all b*tches talk sh*t, but y'all finta get flushed
Y'all chicken headed b*tches, all finta get plucked
Y'all B*tches talk tough but y'all b*tches really scary
Y'all just a bunch of words like a f*cking dictionary

But I got, goons with hallow b*tches
Gotta swallow bitches
No Twitta or Insta, but they follow b*tches
Creep up in her house, and snatch her tongue up out her mouth
Then take everything she got, including the coins between her couch
And then they out
Yea my n*ggas be in and out no fast food
They don't play no games, they hate Taboos
I roll with hood b*tches
Fat asses and perky titties
Yea we all fancy, we a bunch of Iggies

Walked by and had her n*ggas like Ooouuu
Little do they know I'm dude
My nose ring, bangles, and bamboos
all gold and my weave is too

[And this is uhh four bundles and a frontal to be exact
Which is pretty light for me, because i usually do six and up
But, you know]

Let's take a moment to be honest
To these hoes I'm like hooked on phonics
I show these girls, how it's really done
I'm the instructor to bad b*itch 101

I showed yo b*tch how to be a bad b*tch
Wasn't for me n*igga, yo b*tch would be average
I'm just a young bad b*tch that be up on his fashion
Stay dressed to kill I'm f*cking assassin

Check my resume i gotta few f*cks
And I don't care about a cross
My pockets on respucia

Named Kandie with a K
Hoes can't name a time i didn't slay
But I got something I gotta say
So let me get that up out the way

I wonder how, Hip-Hop is so homophobic
I wondered if y'all homophobic rappers noticed
Y'all be bragging about all these brands
Which are made by gay men
Tom Ford and Christian Loub
Versace and YSL too
Ha, and Gucci too
Just to name a few

[Everytime I come on they be like turn this faggot sh*t off            I can't motherf*cking relate
Well if that's the case n*gga come up out that Balenciaga
And take off that hermes belt
But you can't relate to that neither, right

My nails cost like 4 hunid
holographic paint with the bows on it
A million christie crystals
My middle fingers look like discos

I'm too ahead of these hoes I can't keep up
Cause every time they speed up
them b*tches hit a speed bump
They always in the back of me, them b*tches never passing me
And I always look down on them
I guess it's just the giraffe of me

I'm here to prove even a fag can be worthy
So these rappers finta get ate like Kobe's old jersey
N*gga love to chit-chat, but I don't partake in that
A N*gga talk about me, and I'm snap like the app

But moral of the story is Ooouuu
Tell them motherf*ckers make room
A fag N*gga comin' through
Finta f*ck up the game like Ooouuu

509,I Hate U I Love U,"[Verse 1: Olivia O'Brien]
Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien  with gnash]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Bridge: Olivia O'Brien with gnash]
All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you

And I'll never be her",​gnash,gnash Featuring Olivia O'Brien,2017,"[41, 33, 31, 31]",4

Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
'Cause you miss it too much

May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox

Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto

Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall

Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes

512,Drinkin' Too Much,"[Intro]
Pour a drink and take a sip of it
Feelin' like a hypocrite
Couple more and I won't give a shit
I never used to talk, I never used to talk like this

[Verse 1]
I’m sorry I named the album ‘Montevallo’
And I’m sorry people know your name now
And strangers hit you up on social media
I’m sorry you can’t listen to the radio
And drive out to the place we used to get peaches down in Pelham

I know you want your privacy
And you’ve got nothing to say to me
But I wish you'd let me pay off your student loans
With these songs you gave to me

'Member the first time you stayed with me?
Overpacked, and drove up, and went to the CMAs with me
Two years later, it felt like you were a million miles away from me
And I was the one on stage, drunk, barely holdin' on, on ABC
Hope your dad still prays for me

[Chorus]
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around

[Verse 2]
A year ago, I was in a hotel room in Phoenix
Wonderin' if it's ever okay to lie
'Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die
But I told you everything, and you told me to have a good life
But you still couldn't believe it was really goodbye
Every night, you'd fill the bathtub up
Lie there for hours, put your face under water and cry
I never wanted to be a heartbreaker
Turn your sisters and their friends into matchmakers
I know you think my dreams came true
Since you been gone, singin' these songs are just something to do
The only dream I ever had was you
I hope you know I'm still in love, it's the kind you can't fall out of

[Chorus]
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around

[Verse 3]
I know this might seem like a contradiction
And the last thing you need is more unwanted attention
But you changed your number, and moved
And this is the only way I could reach you
So wherever you are, turn it up and listen

[Outro]
Hannah Lee, I'm on my way to you
Nobody can love you like I do

Know there ain't no way we're through",Sam Hunt,Sam Hunt,2017,[89],1

Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' ""dollar and a dream"" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt

Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team

'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told

Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, ""Make it quick if the Lord take me""
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, ""sell dope, rap or go to NBA""

Think me and Future fucked on the same twins
Damn, yeah, wait

517,How I'll Always Be,"[Verse 1]
I'm a little more beer bottle beer joint than a fancy bar
I'm a little more sitting up high on the road than a little car
I'm a little more bust ya back than take it for free
And that’s how I'll always be
I'm a little more lose my temper than to sit on back
I'm a little more ol' Hank Williams than that trendy crap
I love a flat wood ol' front porch made of an old oak tree
And that's how I'll always be

[Chorus]
I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

[Verse 2]
I got friends that say I live a little like Cool Hand Luke
Fast cars and motorcycles, raisin' hell in cowboy boots
But, hey, on Sunday morning, I'll take the back row seat
That's how I'll always be

[Chorus]
I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

[Bridge]
I'm a fan of chert rock bouncing off a Chevy fender
That feeling that you get that first time she lets ya kiss her
Rusty roofs that rattle when the rain is fallin' down
Handshake deals, fresh-cut hay fields, and hometowns

[Chorus]
I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be",Tim McGraw,Tim McGraw,2017,"[70, 70, 78]",3
518,Hallelujah,"[Verse 1: Scott]
I’ve heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 2: Avi]
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 3: Kirstin]
Well baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a vict'ry march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 4: Mitch]
Well, maybe there’s a God above
But all I’ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it’s not a cry that you hear at night
It’s not somebody who's seen the light
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Hook: Quavo & YFN Lucci]
I got money way before the deal
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
I might fuck your ho and pay her bills
Yeah we was taught to get it how we live, yeah
I got your ho on a leash
Got a plug, he Vietnamese
We the niggas they wanna be
Cause we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets

Wrap ‘em, put ‘em on a boat (wrap 'em), boy you better not choke (boy)
And there ain't no runnin' off (na, na)
We got the key to the streets (streets), everybody notice me (me)
Used to dream about 50 thousand in my jeans
Now 50 thousand cheap to me
Remember the days watching the Hot Boys and Master P
Now I’m down in Miami, one phone call, I pull up on Weezy (brr)
All of my niggas with me, you feel me
Straps on everybody in the building
All of niggas came from dealing
Or either they kicking in doors and stealing
I feel like I’m not having no feelings
Before the fame, seen quarter million
Came from robbing pizza man at the top of apartment buildings

Real trapper never seen a drought, we gon’ ship ‘em out
Any problem, we gon’ air ‘em out, what they talking ‘bout?
We don't count we weigh it now, no we ain’t servin’ no ounce
We sip purple, we ain’t never out, we ain’t never out
Hit up Quavo, we gon’ need another bando
I’ma flood that bitch with more keys than a piano
All these bitches say they love me, I’m so handsome
Yeah they know ‘bout Lucci go and ask 'em, they gon tell ya

I got the key to the streets my nigga
Just like Dr. Dre, he got the beats
I come straight up out of 1500
That’s the block, my niggas over East
Double cup but no ice tea (lean)
Pour me a four before I go to sleep
Fuck around and landed in the hospital
Geekin’ off the Henn and the lean, whoa
Takeoff! (Sup Skoob?)
Man, go head, take off (Bet!)
24/7, no day off (naw), balling like we in the playoffs (ball)
20 bitches at the playhouse
You quick to freeze up when that K out (graow)
If that bitch ain’t tryna fuck, I kick her out the house
Like Martin, lil bitty bitch stay out (bitch)
They like to whoop me ’til them Ks out
Get to looking for some ways out
You niggas ain’t workin’, you're laid off
Choppa decapitate him, blow his face off (graow)
Won’t get it ‘til these niggas laid out
Assassinating, knock him off like I’m Adolf (baow)

522,Careless Whisper,"[Intro]
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all that you'll find
Should have known better, yeah

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

[Verse 2]
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all that you'll find

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

[Post-Chorus]
Never without your love

[Bridge]
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

[Chorus]
And I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

523,Faith,"[Instrumental Intro]

Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like you
But I gotta' think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play because I played them too

Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door

'Cause I gotta' have faith
I gotta' have faith
Because I gotta' have faith, faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith

Baby I know you're askin' me to stay
Say ""Please, please, please don't go away""
You say I'm givin' you the blues
Maybe you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for somethin' more

Yes I gotta' have faith
Ooh, I gotta' have faith
Because I gotta' have faith, faith, faith
I gotta' have faith, faith, faith

I'll just have to wait
Because I've got to have faith
I gotta' have faith
I've got to, got to, got to have faith

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh, oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for somethin' more

I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2]
What about all the times
You would pick me up and we'd just drive
Around until we found a place to stay and waste the day away
We'd do nothing but it was okay with me
You say it's not good to spend all my time
Thinking about you so late at night
But I can't stop once I start it's like an avalanche
Thoughts coming and I just wanna hold your hand
Hold your breath, I'm going under
Not coming up 'til this night is over
'Til this night is over

[Chorus]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Bridge]
All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you were slowly killing me

[Chorus]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her",Olivia O’Brien,Olivia O'Brien,2017,[99],1
528,Jingle Bell Rock,"[Verse 1]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now, the jingle hop has begun

[Verse 2]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

[Bridge]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

[Verse 2]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell

I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night (just for the night)

[Verse]
I know you want this for life
Fuck you so good you be calling out the Christ (oh my God)
Bottles of the Tech got it laid on ice
We spent four seasons at the Four Seasons twice
You be calling all your homegirls like ""I'm his wife""
Hell nah, you trippin', reevaluate your life
I can't love no bitch, every single hoe is trife
I sip dirty Sprite just to get me through the night
But I need you there (I need you there)
Promise that I need you there
Ain't no other bitch gon' fuck me like you do, I swear
Put that on my gang I swear
I just can't put you on front street like you want I know
But baby you is not no hoe
And I put it on my gang I'm not no average joe (average joe)
It's Yachty from the block you know

[Hook]
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice

533,Change,"[Intro: J. Cole]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge: J. Cole]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—",J. Cole,J. Cole,2017,[83],1

How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now

[Verse]
Trials and tribulations I'm facing
In this age of information, I hate this shit
Cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that he faces

My dad, he died—he got shot 'cause his friend set him up. And I didn't go to his funeral—and sometimes when I'm in my room, I get mad at my momma when she mean to me. And she—
And she say, ""clean up""—I say—

[Bridge]
Nigga play me, never, give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never, show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never

537,Six Feet Under,"[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fanbase
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money she play no games

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, 'til she

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop it for a check now
Six feet under, six, six feet under
Six feet under, six, six feet under
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Counting all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no back bone
Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'

She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, 'til she

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]

Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop it for a check now

Six feet under, six, six feet under (That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around

[Post-Chorus: Future]
Gonna turn that ass around
Oh murder, oh murder
Gonna turn that ass around
Oh murder, oh murder

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Real love's hard to find
So she don't waste her time

You ain't gon' catch her crying
She ain't gon' lose her mind

'Til she..

538,Sidewalks,"[Intro: The Weeknd]
Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

[Post-Chorus: Daniel Wilson]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]

I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke, and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, and more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yah)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

[Post-Chorus: Daniel Wilson]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on",The Weeknd,The Weeknd Featuring Kendrick Lamar,2017,[97],1
539,Foldin Clothes,"[Intro]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 1]
I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I, I see a lot on your plate
Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you

[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 2]
Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you
Except right here with you
Folding clothes
Watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk
(""You soft!"")

[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Bridge]
If I can make life easier
The way you do mine
Save you some time
Alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax
Let you recline babe
Then I should do it
'Cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
That say ""I love you""
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things

[Verse 3]
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
""Damn, what's gotten into you?""
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peeking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright",J. Cole,J. Cole,2017,[98],1
