0,All I Want For Christmas Is You,"[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)

Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

You, baby

I won't even wish for snow (And I)

To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)

Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)

1,Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree,"[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go

7,Someone You Loved,"[Verse 1]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

So why you bragging on me?
Your ways was cruel, I was fooled
I was too blind for to see
My I.D. cover the news
Seems only trouble I keep
You was the one I would choose
Choose for to be there for me
Can't tell me not to do this because I do what I want

Straight from the block selling raw
She said, she never will leave
Soon as she left it was hard
I wanted her here with me
She left me out with my boys
But I say, ""That’s okay""
Protect my heart with that rod
I’m running far out your reach
I mean as far as the stars
Might have to cancel my cards
Don't come out after dark

Tell me how I'm trash and you could easily replace me
Tell me that I'm strung out, wasted on the daily
Prolly 'cause there's no one around me numbin' all my pain
Prolly 'cause there's no umbrella to shield me from all the rain
Probably because you're the one playin' the mind games
You hate me because I don't let you play no mind games
They give me migraines and damage my brain
Date me, break me, easily replace me
Hopefully, you see it clear, hopefully it's HD
Bet you wonder why the last few months I've been spacey
In your head, I sing...

[Harmonizowanie]

[Refren: Ozzy Osbourne]
Czuję, jak kruszysz się w mych rękach, aż do twego serca z kamienia
Wykrwawiłaś mnie do sucha, tak jak łzy, których nie ukazujesz
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść

[Zwrotka 1: Post Malone]
Nigdy niczego nie potrzebowałem od Ciebie
I wszystko, o co zapytałem było dla prawdy (Wszystko, o co zapytałem było)
Pokazałaś swój język, był w parze rozwidlony
Twój jad był śmiertelny, prawie tobie uwierzyłem (Prawie tobie uwierzyłem)
Tak, żerowałaś na każdym moim błędzie
Czekałaś na mnie, powstrzymywałaś mnie od wierzenia, że utonę
Marnowałem siebie, jak plagę
Próbuję szukać swojej drogi do wyjścia, szukać swojej drogi do wyjścia (Szukać swojej drogi do wyjścia)

[Pre-Refren 1: Post Malone]
I nareszcie przyszedł ten dzień
Zacząłem oddawać swoje serce
Na litość boską, kości mi się złamią
Ale nigdy nie nabędziesz mojej duszy, nie-e

[Refren: Post Malone]
Czuję, jak kruszysz się w mych rękach, aż do twego serca z kamienia
Wykrwawiłaś mnie do sucha, tak jak łzy, których nie ukazujesz
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść

[Zwrotka 2: Travis Scott]
Wziąłem kamienie, którymi rzucałaś, zrobiłem łańcuchy dla ekipy (Lód)
Wziąłem ze sobą dziesięć dziwek, ta fura była stworzona dla dwóch (Tak, panie)
Przebiegały przez nią, nic nie pozostało do zrobienia
Potrzebuję więcej powodów, aby żyć tego wieczoru (Prosto w górę!)
Ja piłem na zawsze i brałem cokolwiek
Wierzyłem o myśleniu, że ty kiedyś wrócisz
Pójdźmy naszymi własnymi drogami, którąkolwiek
Mówisz, że jak, to jakkolwiek długo
Bo wiesz, że ja nigdy nie będę sam (Tak)

[Pre-Refren 2: Travis Scott]
Miłość (Miłość, tak)
Laska będzie się ruszać (Laska będzie, laska będzie się ruszać)
Potrzebuję tego na widoku (Potrzebuję tego na, potrzebuję tego na widoku)
Zepsuj to wszystko (Zepsuj to, zepsuj to wszystko)
Daj jej tą lufkę (Daj jej tą, daj jej tą lufkę)
Cały mój gang (Cały mój, cały mój gang)
Laska stała się zła (Laska stała się, laska stała się zła)

I've never been one to ask for help
If I need a mountain moved, I move it myself
I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday
Quote you the scripture kind
I'm far from a preacher
But I'm a believer

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

[Verse 2]
For someone to love me like you do
Graceful eyes to see me through
A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me
A touch that kills me too
And baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

[Chorus 2]
Every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every tail light fade in the goodbye rain
Girl, even today, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom

I'm probably beefing with Peta
I gotta pay her to leave her
It's probably cheaper to keep her

[Post-Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I keep like twenty racks inside the Lamb' truck, a nigga slidin' dawg
I just put twenty racks on his head, a young nigga slidin', dawg

Up the block and knock his braces out, we caught 'em slipping
We was working out that vacant house, God, forgive me (Forgive me)

I'm never trippin' 'bout none of these bitches 'cause I know it's all a game (Game)
I paid the cost for fame, I even seen my dawg show fangs
Just for the love of the money and chains

'Member we said that we never would switch

Way that I'm built, never could snitch

Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Uh)
Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí (Maldición)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Uh)
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

[Verso 1: Post Malone]
Decían que no llegaría tan lejos, ah, ah
¿Piensan que no vemos quiénes son, son, son?
Riendo al banco como ja, ja, ja
Supongo que solo estoy hablando mucho, bla, bla, bla  (Cállate la puta boca)
Entonces, ¿a dónde fueron? (Uh)
Cuando estaba en bancarrota no podía ni comprar cigarrillos
Ahora tu mamá necesita boletos para mi concierto en el estadio (Concierto en el estado)
A ella le encanta cuando me escucha en la radio, oh
Sé que es difícil tragarse su orgullo
Me disculpo porque no puedes superarme (Superarme)
Ahora estás fuera de mi vida, estoy tan aliviado, yo

[Estribillo: Post Malone]
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Maldición)
Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí (Uh)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Maldición)
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

[Pos-Estribillo: Post Malone]
A veces, siempre, me decepcionan (Me decepcionan)

Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

[Verso 2: DaBaby]
Cerca de mis enemigos (Vamos)
Necesito mejor energía (¿Eh?)
Cuando te dije que te jodieras, pensaste que estaba jugando, ¿eh?
(Sí, sí) Pero lo decía literal
Ella quiere quedar, le dije a la mierda eso (No)
Ella me mira como si estuviera sorprendida
Empaquetan el correo y estoy solo en casa
Cuando la caja toca la puerta, van por 35
Trato de poner de mi parte para mis compañeros, se convierten en enemigos antes de que el ojo de un negro lo haga
Alcanzas un batido, voy a sostener un puño
Dándole a un negro un cuarto de libra sin las papas fritas
Acabo de conseguir doble platino sin colaboraciones
Sólo para mostrarle a un negro que en realidad no lo necesito
Pásale a un hombre un plato y puede hacerlo temblar
Está garantizado que se doblará y morderá la mano que lo alimenta
Y sé que piensas que no lo veo
Y sé que tu perra no tiene auto
Me estás obligando a que vaya y le compre un pequeño Prius
Follemos frente a la cámara, podemos llamarlo incluso
Los amigos son como el otoño, cada año se van
Y voy a rastrillarlos en una pila, tirarlos en una bolsa
Atarlos junto a sus perras y dejarlos
Porque la mayoría de estos negros son engañosos
Y yo (Uh)

Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Maldición)
Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí (Uh)

[Puente: Post Malone]
Es demasiado tarde para cambiar esta mierda (Demasiado tarde)
Solo me sostuviste cuando querías que me ahogara
Es demasiado tarde para cambiar esta mierda (Demasiado tarde)
Así que no intentes decirme que estás feliz por mí ahora

Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos
Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí

میتونستم یه ذره کمگ بگیرم که از این بحث و جدل بکشیم بیرون، آره
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
خیلی خوشگل شدی، عزیزم، پس دیگه اون سوالو اینجا نپرس
This is my only fear: that we become
تنها ترسم اینه که: بشیم مثل ....

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Beautiful people
آدمای خوشگل
Drop top, designer clothes
با ماشینای بدون سقفشون، و لباسای مارک دارشون
Front row at fashion shows
توی ردیف جلویی نمایش مد (فشن شو) میشینن
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
چی کار میکنی؟ و چی میدونی؟
Inside the world of beautiful people
توی دنیای آدمای خوشگل
Champagne and rolled-up notes
شامپاین میزنیم و پولای رول شده رو آماده میکنیم
Prenups and broken homes
توافقای قبل از ازدواج و زوج هایی که از همدیگه طلاق گرفتن
Surrounded, but still alone
کلی آدم دور و برمونه، اما هنوزم تنهایییم
Let's leave the party
بیا این پارتی رو ول کنیم بریم

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Both, Khalid]
That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)

99,Christmas Tree Farm,"[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""

Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)

I've never felt so certain
All my life I've been torn

Could it be the reason I was born?
I have always been so different
Normal rules did not apply
Is this the day?
Are you the way
I finally find out why?

Show yourself
I'm no longer trembling
Here I am
I've come so far
You are the answer I've waited for

104,We Were,"[Verse 1]
We were just a couple years short of the age
By my name on a fake ID
And still 'bout a hundred away from the day
Your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line steppers
Who just couldn’t wait to step over the line
Never thinkin' we wouldn't last
I was your first and you were mine

[Chorus]
And we were leather jackets hangin’ onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin' out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mm-hmm

[Verse 2]
We were gonna make it, weren't we, baby?
Had it all laid out in our mind
By the time we knew time was runnin' out
We'd done run out of time
And we were downtown Saturday night, last-call cover band
'Til the last song played, never thought we'd fade
Like the stamp on the back of her hand

[Chorus]
We were her on my shoulders, lighter in the air
""Pour Some Sugar On Me""
We were a top down at Johnson’s field
When she whispered that she wants me
At least there’s a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Oh, mm-hmm

[Chorus]
We were leather jackets hangin' onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin’ out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mmm, yes, I do

""Oh well, let that ship sail
You gotta let go of her""

Back when I was tryna find a way for all my partners
Rema hit the window, popped the door for me and Lijah
'Member wakin’ up with no destination
But I had some dedication, couldn't use my education
'Cause no nine dollars could help me face what I was facing
My light bill due, envelope blue, that mean you behind on payments
Rap slowed down and I was low on cash
Fresh out of high school, kicked out the house for living fast
Went and got a spot, then got a job, 'cause pops was on my ass
Then that's when pops had went to jail so it didn't last
Hit the block with Brock 'cause I was tryna pay my bills
Like fuck a rap career, let's touch these streets and make a mil’
Fast forward, like Rod Wave, tell me how you feel
When I think about my past, that shit give me chills, uh

[Chorus: Rod Wave & Kevin Gates]
Wake up in the morning, hit my knees, and I pray
Because He finally made a way
I been runnin’ up that paper, mama
And before I let 'em come and take it, mama
I’ma die in these Cuban links
I'm gon' die in these Cuban links (Bangers again)
Die in these Cuban links (Right now today, let's go)
Die in these Cuban links (Yes, Lord)

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
All my life it been a struggle
You on and fall off, you find out who really love you
Playin’ in the storm drain, came out the gutter
Good relationships, I admit I had a couple
Making love to the money, me and bae lil' couple
Yola cooked down to the oil in it, don't switch around
I need everything when it lock in the pot, yeah
Grab it off the top, let it dry, work the clock, yeah
Finally up in rank, movin' blocks, holdin' sham, yeah
Havin' my lil' way, ghetto pussy used to act funny
Now I'm hittin' her hard from the back, she throw it back for me
And when I went to jail, shawty left, turned her back on me
Flexin' on they ass, pants sag with them racks on 'em

[Chorus: Rod Wave]
Wake up in the morning, hit my knees, and I pray
Because He finally made a way
I been runnin' up that paper, mama
And before I let 'em come and take it, mama
I'ma die in these Cuban links
I'm gon' die in these Cuban links

Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up

I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up

A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I’m workin'
Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
Actin’ like I’m gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you’re at the end of your rope
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
Just the pride talkin', isn’t it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of ""wreck"" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if—

We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if—

I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way

[Verso 1: Post Malone]
Kurt y yo sentimos lo mismo, demasiado placer es dolor
Mi chica me escupe en vano, todo lo que hago es quejarme
Necesita que algo cambie, necesito salir del margen
Así que a la mierda todo esta noche
Y no me digas que me calle
Cuando sabes que hablas demasiado
Pero no tienes una mierda que decir (Decir)

[Coro: Post Malone]
Quiero que salgas de mi cabeza
Quiero que salgas de mi habitación esta noche (Habitación)
No hay manera de que pueda salvarte (Salvarte)
Porque yo también necesito ser salvado
No soy bueno con las despedidas

[Verso 2: Post Malone]
Los dos estamos actuando como locos, pero somos demasiado tercos para cambiar
Ahora estoy bebiendo otra vez, con 80 grados de alcohol en mis venas
Y mis dedos se tiñeron, mirando por encima del borde
No me jodas esta noche
Dijiste que necesitabas este corazón, ahora lo tienes (Lo tienes)
Resulta que no era lo que querías (Querías)
Y como no lo soltabamos, lo perdimos
Ahora soy un desahuciado

[Coro: Post Malone]
Quiero que salgas de mi cabeza (Cabeza)
Quiero que salgas de mi habitación esta noche (Habitación)
No hay manera de que pueda salvarte (Salvarte)
Porque yo también necesito ser salvado (Salvado, también)
No soy bueno con las despedidas

[Verso 3: Young Thug]
Te quiero fuera de mi vida
Te quiero de vuelta aquí esta noche
Estoy tratando de cortarte, sin cuchillo
Quiero rebanarte y cortarte en cubitos
Mi argumento es posesivo, te hizo preciso
¿No puedes apagar el televisor? Estoy viendo la pelea
Inundé el garaje, de diamante azul, sin tiburón
Eres una muñeca de Barbie, como Nicki Minaj
No necesitas una llave para conducir, tu coche tiene el cargador
Solo quiero ver el lado, ese que no es molestado (Sí)
Y no quiero que nunca salgas afuera (Afuera)
Prometo que si te engañan, mis colegas aparecerán (Aparecerán)
La estoy follando, y el autobús del tour sigue andando (Andando)
Sí, sí, sí, sí, sí

[Coro: Post Malone]
Quiero que salgas de mi cabeza (Cabeza)
Quiero que salgas de mi habitación esta noche (Habitación)

How I'm chosen? I'm so heartless, so, so heartless

Mind in a rage, I'm way too young to feel this pain
I ain't know how to fade, but I dove in 'cause I'm a man
I love that girl to death, as we get old, our feelings change
I pay for therapy because my thoughts ahead of me
They keep on draggin' me, I play for keeps, they scared of me
I cannot barely, can barely sleep or even breathe
I cannot hold on without you on side of me
I never knew this fame would take the ones I love from ‘way from me

Right now I'm all alone, I pray that grandmom keep me strong
Can't even leave my home, my bracelet beeping plus I'm down
I just wan' be gone, my son straight, my money long
Tell me what you feelin', I hope that I can help you out
My youngins in that North, I pray that y'all gon' make it out
These bitches comin' 'round, and they don't even like my songs
I'll burn up the town, before them niggas bust my dome

Unzippin' the tight jeans and that feminine hygiene is magnificent
Tryna show you, girl, I'm different
I get to lickin', and stickin', and lickin', and stickin' it
'Til the pussy get too wet and it's drippin'
And splittin' both them legs like dividends
If it ends up how I want it, then you'll end up sittin' all over my bottom lip, baby
The feelin' of fuckin' you, feelings all up in you
Make it hard for you to bottle 'em, baby
This dick is too big just to swallow it, baby
But still you do it like it's Thanksgiving
And you gobblin', gobblin', gobblin', gobblin', baby

Buy you a Wraith, I'ma give you my safe
Put you in apartments, you parkin' in places
Yeah, that's the real-life Monopoly, baby
We got all night to get it right, babe

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill

Sometimes we're oil and water, but I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest, your first and my last name

What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?

148,It All Comes Out In The Wash,"[Verse 1]
If you wear a white shirt to a crawfish boil
Stonewashed jeans while you're changing the oil
When you find yourself dating the bridesmaid's ex
You accidentally bring him to the wedding, whoops
If you pour yourself a Merlot to go
You dip your fries in your ketchup on a bumpy road
You spill the beans to your mama, sister got knocked up
In a truck at the 7-Eleven, don't sweat it

[Chorus]
'Cause it'll all come out, all come out in the wash
It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
Every little stain, every little heartbreak
No matter how messy it got
You take the sin and the men and you throw 'em all in
And you put that sucker on spin

[Verse 2]
You got frisky with your boss at the copy machine
You drunk-dialed your ex-husband, don't remember a thing
Had a fancy dinner at your mother-in-law's
Spilled A1 Sauce on her table cloth
Don't sweat it, a Tide stick will get it

[Chorus]
It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
(All come out in the wash)
And it'll all come out, all come out in the wash

Every dirty cotton sheet, let it line dry

A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'

What all you've been given

And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'

She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said ""Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough""

And you don't need a reason
Sometimes the world's just right
Your clear eyes ain't even blinkin'

For all you've been given

I can't take back what I never said
But if I could, man I would
Try and make her see
That me and Tennessee want her back
I wish it worked like that
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I had half a clue
Where she was headed now
I'd do what I had to do
To make her turn that car around

She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

[Bridge]
Yeah, I should've held her close
I should've let her know
How I felt about her 'bout a couple county lines ago

She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone

Someone to play catch with out in the backyard

Someone to say slow down when you turn sixteen
Yeah, I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be

Someone to scare the monsters, when it's dark in your room

[Verse 3]
Someone to let you fall down and teach you how to get back up
Teach you how to be sweet like mamma and how to be tough
Yeah, I'll never be perfect, but sure as those lines are pink
Yeah, I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be

They say dads are supposed to shape you and in a way I guess mine did
I knew what I wouldn't do if I ever had a kid

We got the minds, we got the youth

When I thought the Book of Job was a job
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie
Life gon' have some lows and some highs
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod
I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn't hide
In '03, they told me not to drive
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died
But I survived, that's on God
I've been tellin' y'all since '05
The greatest artist restin' or alive
That's on L.A. Reid, that's on Clive
That's no Jive, that's on God
Off the 350s He supplied
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe
Man, that's over half of the pie

That's why I charge the prices that I charge
I can't be out here dancin' with the stars
No, I cannot let my family starve

Everything that hath breath praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions
I know I won't forget all He's done
He's the strength in this race that I run
Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still
Everybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store
From the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door
You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane
And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision
Giving me a revelation
This ain't 'bout a dead religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll
All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let 'em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right

And in my arrogance, took a camera pose

Blindfolded on this road, watch me faith walk
Just hold on to your brother when his faith lost

Told God last time on life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike

I've been working for you my whole life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
I've been working for you my whole life
Nothing worse than a hypocrite
Change, he ain't really different
He ain't even try to get permission
Ask for advice and they dissed him
Said I'm finna do a gospel album
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
They'll be the first one to judge me
Feelin' like nobody love me
Told people God was my mission
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
Make you feel alone in the dark and you'll never see the light
Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight
From the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas

And I'm just somewhere fucked up thinkin' 'bout my father and shit
They found him dead a couple days before I started tour
Same day I flew back to the city from Miami
I was out there with the family
Just lookin' at my daughter
Thinkin' to myself like, ""Damn, my baby look just like my daddy""
Same time I got the news, my shit went number one, that's fucked up
That shit there was confusin', a lil' bit, you know I flew in with the stick
Okay, like let me know what's up before I lose it in this bitch
And everybody tryna talk, I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna click
I'm tryna send somebody wit' him
Somebody let me know what's happenin'
My last name K-I-R-K, Kirk
You know how I rock behind my daddy
You know I never gave a fuck about the world, just about my family
How the fuck I make it to the top same day I lost the nigga that had me?
How a nigga perform on BET and a year ago couldn't afford a sandwich?
I had to move in with TG when I went broke movin' out to Cali
What you know about smilin' every day for all your fans, actin' like you happy?
I spent a hundred thousand layin' my daddy to rest, but I ain't braggin'

177,What She Wants Tonight,"[Verse 1]
She walks up, velvet rope unhooks
She snaps her fingers and a drink comes
She locks you down with just one look
She’s got this whole club undone

[Verse 2]
If she’s on the rebound, you ain’t gonna know it
Coming off a heartbreak, she ain’t gonna show it
She’s eyes caught, red dot, locked on me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she’s made of fire
Said, she ain’t going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry

[Chorus]
Don’t even know what she’ll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I’m hers in the blink of an eye
She don’t take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight

[Verse 3]
I get to catch all her secrets
Sequins bouncing off flashing lights
If she wants it then we’re leaving
Get me home, park the truck, cut the tires

[Verse 4]
I get to be where she goes when she’s lonely
The last door of the night she’s closing
Oh, I know she could have anything but

[Pre-Chorus]
She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she’s made of fire
Said she ain’t going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry

[Chorus]
Don’t even know what she’ll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I’m hers in the blink of an eye
She don’t take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight

[Bridge]
And I don’t know how I got to be the only thing she needs right now

[Pre-Chorus]
She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she’s made of fire
Said she ain’t going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry

[Chorus]
Don’t even know what she’ll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I’m hers in the blink of an eye
She don’t take no and i love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight, yeah
I get to be what she wants tonight, tonight",Luke Bryan,Luke Bryan,2019,[93],1

All day, all night
You're the only one who understood me
And all that I was going through
Yeah, I just gotta tell you
Oh baby, I

Oh, you're the light
And I almost lost ya
But I can't forget ya

모든 건 네게 돌아가기 위해
이제 너라는 지도를 활짝 펼칠게

너의 향기는 여전히 나를 꿰뚫어 무너뜨려
되돌아가자 그때로

날 위했던 게 아닌 되려 너를 위한 거란 걸
안다면 주저 말고 please save my life
너 없이 헤쳐왔던 사막 위는 목말라
그러니 어서 빨리 날 잡아줘
너 없는 바다는 결국 사막과 같을 거란 걸 알아

[Chorus]
I gotta bring it
Any time and however you want it
Late at night and I can't sleep
I'm staying up, I'm tossing, turning
That's them bodies from my temper creeping on me
That's from me cuttin' 'em off and being home all by my lonely
Bricks and bales
I prefer that chopper, it's gon' kiss you and won't never tell
I can cook that dope just like a worker, you can ask VL
Look and I can eyeball, I don't talk loud, I don't need a scale
Plenty money, but I'm still thuggin', this the rich as hell

[Verse 1]
Get it and bring it, I flip it
You know how I get it, I know some hard layers
I can speak that work and talk that work
I leave it scarred and pale
Presser, I got solids on that semi, bust your head for real (Presser)
Give me head and then I flip or get that dick for real
Ballin', my niggas haulin'
Niggas be talkin' and I catch 'em walkin'
I do this often, fuck it, I off 'em
Know that I got 'em, you know I'ma stalk 'em
Fuck his fam, I pick his coffin
Catch who bad? Bitch, I doubt it
I got youngins wanna off 'em
All this smoke, it got me coughin'
MAC's-11, I be steppin', bitch, I'm reckless, I'm dumb
Catch you wrestling in your section with that Wesson, you slumped
I got bro on top, ain't tell through a message, we come
We hang guns with them drums, Draco sounding like a bomb
Yeah, you talk that shit, I'm with it, hmm
Watch how quick I whip it
I go Shmurda with them glizzies
I got murder on my tension
I got black on top my lenses
I got straps inside that Bentley
You wan' play, I make you feel it
Come your way, make sure you get it

[Pre-Chorus]
Bitch, I trap out like Griselda, hollows, I mail 'em
Mojo with my celly, police walk in, I won't tell 'em
Talkin' on my celly with this bitch who came from Heaven
Stutter in my precious, I got uh-uh in my mansion

[Chorus]
I gotta bring it
Any time and however you want it
Late at night and I can't sleep
I'm staying up, I'm tossing, turning
That's them bodies from my temper creeping on me

Plenty money, but I'm still thuggin', this the rich as hell

[Verse 2]
Whip that bitch out and she lick it
Check how a nigga be kickin'
I got cases pending, I got THC, it's liquid
If I point, them youngins hit it
I got bitches throwin' up Billy, Blood
I got problems, really, I piss out red inside the tub
Choppin' it
Run her a song, she follow that
Smoking strong, a pressure pack inside my bag, got big racks
She took the Roxies out her pocket, told that bitch don't sniff that
'Cause bitch, I'ma kick you out, you know that we ain't with that
I put that strap in her mouth, bitch
I thought I told you don't talk, bitch
I don't care 'bout what they talkin', fuck her best friend, bitch, I'm rich
Fuck your man man, ho, I'm lit
Plus my whole clique full of pits

Keep here taking another dri-
(¡This is the remix!)
Life has not been easy for you
You went wrong in love
There's something about him that doesn't please you anymore (Please you)
That's why she goes out and do what she does (Woh, oh)
Life is one and time will not stop
I tell you because I have seen how you get lost loving (Loving‚ oh)
Baby‚ I think time is running out
He changed you being better than her (No-no-no‚ no-oh-oh)
For women and a couple of bottles (Of bottles; no-no-no, no-oh-oh)
For friends who aren't really friends (Ah, ah; ice)
Because I know they will write to you when he leaves you
(Uah‚ uah; *everybody go to the discotek!*)

[Pre-Chorus: Anuel AA, Sech & Darell]
And now in secret and without dissimulation (That's right)
I found her wanting to forget her ex (Uah-ah-ah; hah!)
Now she does what she wants when she wants (Oh-oh)
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too (Here we go again!)

[Chorus: Sech, Ozuna, Anuel AA & Darell]
When the DJ turns on the music (That's like that)
She dances like never before (Real until death, baby; so that you knows)
And now in secret (Oh-oh)‚ and without dissimulation (Oh-oh)
I found her wanting to forget her ex (Ra-ta-ta-tá!)
When the DJ turns on the music
She dances like never before (The Real Rondón)
Now she does what she wants when she wants
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too

[Verse 1: Anuel AA]
They left her alone, now she shows it on the disco
She always dances uncensored, for a man she doesn't cry (She doesn't cry)
Don't trust anyone, anyone (Anyone)
Today's are drink day and for the street, street (Street)
She wants to drink, she wants to dance (Dance)
And she wants to smoke and she's going to get drunk (Drunk)
She doesn't love anymore and doesn't call and doesn't claim
And I look for her in Lambo' and we end up in my bed

[Verse 2: Nicky Jam]
I don't want to talk about him, let's go to the wall (Wall)
I want to see everything you know (You know)
You are asking me to put, but here it doesn't fit (Fits)
She wanted to lose her rhythm and I have the key, yeh-yeh-yeh
Do you want to see how hard am I? (Hard)
Come on, baby, it's that I'm without insurance
When I'm with you, I always feel good, yeah
You are mine, I swear you

[Chorus: Ozuna, Sech & Darell]
Baby, when the DJ turns on the music (That's like that)
She dances like never before (So that you knows)
And now in secret (Oh-oh), and without dissimulation (Oh-oh)

When the DJ turns on the music
She dances like never before (The Real Rondón)
Now she does what she wants when she wants
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too

[Verse 3: Ozuna]
Who wants me to take her to a private place
But to do it without anyone noticing
She told me he has a tough boyfriend
She tells me that why I arrive and don't greet
I said: ""Forgive me, baby, I'm unique""
Drop the music bass, I want to see you
Sweating, baby, until dawn
There's another baby that wants to see me, you have to know
But, calm down, I'm having a good time, you too
It doesn't matter, baby, whatever who says (Whatever says)
I know that he doesn't value you (Value)
But I'm not for love now, baby
Enjoy and don't look at the time (The time)
I only fall in love with you, lady (Lady)

[Verse 4: Darell]
Woh-woh-woh, stop that shit, nigga
Now, the days are gray for her (That's right)
Because their mornings aren't happy (Hah!)
He no longer treats her as before (So that you knows)
She is single and she want to go to the disco (Ra-ta-ta-tá!)
Let me take you and ride you in the red Mercedes (That's right; red)
You going to get excited (You get excited; hah!)
For that you blush with me (Here we go again!)
While you forget everything bad he did to you
Forget it, it's been a while since he forgot about you (That's right)
I want to keep you, baby, I want to be your boyfriend (Oh-oh)
You are pretty with your beautiful body (Hah!)
And that tummy with more squares than Tetris

[Coro: Sech, Anuel AA & Darell]
When the DJ turns on the music (That’s like that)
She dances like never before (Real until death, baby; so that you knows)
And now in secret (Oh-oh), and without dissimulation (Oh-oh)
I found her wanting to forget her ex

[Verse 5: Sech]
When the DJ puts the music, music (-ic)
She enjoys it while she can (Woh, oh)
Now dance, smoke, drink, all alone
She arrives at the house and they don't tell her anything
What a good life she has (She is)
She is drunk, but asks for another bottle (Ah-ah-ah)
Is that at that time the note is high
She highlights happiness

[Pre-Chorus: Sech, Anuel AA & Darell]
And now in secret and without dissimulation (That's right)
I found her wanting to forget her ex (Uah-ah-ah; hah!; Anuel)
Now she does what she wants when she wants (Oh-oh)

Picture me, new 3D denim, I'm city rollin' (Rollin')
But did I mention this my own clothin'?
The fuck you mean?
Made nigga, bought my own Rollie
But if them crackers pull me over, they gon' say I stole it
Good mornin', we on it, I went bought two S trophies
My father left my sis and bros, to them, I feel I owed it
But let's not be heroic, 'cause everybody roguish
They don't want us totin' guns, but they let the fuckin' killers tote it
Let's take a ride and see, though, where them people be, though
Colt 45, the grip design, bought this bitch from Casino
Soprano, no Soprino, we live life like Yung Bino
Had a show in B-more, after that post on the block with Chino (I'm a hustlin' motherfucker)
Look for a star on every hundred, C note
I'm the top on YouTube, fuck a new school, I don't use no Vevo
These niggas 'round me, they too cruel, they bust tools and die for me, though
I don't pay money for no life, the murder pay off me, so

[Chorus]
Came out alright
But I'm blinded from the life, I can’t see, though
Got juveniles on the block, thirty stick hangin' out the Glock
Bandana tied 'round the clip, and they go all out for me, though

[Verse 2]
Sucked all the pain up, let's fuck the game up
Plenty niggas on the block pushin' that rock (It's the Carter's son)
You got your change up, they brought your name up
When it's war, we wet they block, and when it's said, this shit'll never be done
I can't say I'm fucking with all this involvement
These niggas ain't right and they ballin'
I don't give a fuck, no, I call up Osama, my baba
Like, ""Load up and come and rob all them"" (Rob all them)
Venezuela ventilator
My first trip to Georgia made 'em
Some companions with ambitions, was
Double G, NBA native
I wish baptism could've saved us
Never broke until the grave in
Excuse ourselves, knock on the tables
I make a pussy bite the pavement
I can't say I'm fucking with all this involvement

I don't give a fuck, no, I call up Osama, my baba

I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth

209,Die For Me,"Songtekst van Post Malone - ""Die For Me"" ft. Future & Halsey (Vertaling)

[Intro: Future & Post Malone]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, je zou dood voor me gaan
Zei dat je dood, zei dat je dood
Maar je loog, je loog tegen mij

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Zei dat je een kogel zou vangen, zei dat je dood voor me zou gaan
Ik had een slecht gevoel dat je tegen me had gelogen
We waren voorzichtig, maar jij werd high met me
Als het na 11 uur is, dan zie ik een andere kant van je
Zei dat je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor je zou gaan
Maar je loog tegen me, je loog tegen me, loog tegen me
Zei dat je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor je zou gaan
Maar je loog tegen me, je loog tegen me, loog tegen me

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Het was liefde op het eerste gezicht, voelde alsof je uitverkoren was (Oh)
Maar dat bloed in je aderen, ja, ik weet dat het bevroren is (Het is zo koud)
Heb geen geduld meer (Nee)
Heb te lang gewacht (Yeah)
Je verstopte die shit en ik was de laatste die het wist, bitch (Ayy)
Ik hoorde je binnenkomen, ik lag daar wakker
Wist niet dat jij het was, heb het pistool uit de kluis gepakt (Damn)
Herinner je nog dat je mij gearresteerd kreeg (Wow)
Toen ik in de gevangenis zat kreeg ik tenminste wat rust (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Ooh, ik geef me over (Ayy), tijd om je te vergeten (Ayy)
Ik ben te moet om je te vergeten (Ayy), het is te moeilijk voor mijn lever (Ayy)
En je weet (Ayy) het is allemaal (Ayy) klaar nu
Al je vrienden (Ayy), je weet (Ayy) dat ze je hebben verraden

[Chorus: Post Malone & Future]
Zei dat je een kogel zou vangen, zei dat je dood voor me zou gaan (Dood voor me)
Ik had een slecht gevoel dat je tegen me had gelogen (Loog tegen me)
We waren voorzichtig, maar jij werd high met me (High met me)
Als het na 11 uur is, dan zie ik een andere kant van je (Kant die ik zie)
Zei dat je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor je zou gaan (Dood, dood, dood)
Maar je loog tegen me, je loog tegen me, loog tegen me (Loog, loog, loog)
Zei dat je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor je zou gaan (Dood, dood, dood)
Maar je loog tegen me, je loog tegen me, loog tegen me (Maar je loog, yeah)

[Verse 2: Future]
Het was een VIP, gebeurde op één van mijn beste nachten
9 uur 's ochtends, ik kwam van de club, het was licht buiten (Licht buiten)
Heb een slecht meisje, behandelde haar te goed (Behandelde haar te goed)
Betrapte je toen je kwetsbaar was, dat is niet wat ik nodig heb (Dat is niet wat ik nodig heb)
Je hebt je ziel zojuist verkocht, meisje, stop met huilen (Ziel verkocht)
Je paspoort, het lijkt alsof je liegt (Wist dat je koud was)
Je bent door je verleden beschadigd, ontken het niet (Je weet dat ik weet)
Je ex heeft gebeld, je was kwetsbaar, je vliegt, nah (Vliegt)
Was niet op het beste moment, meisje, ik probeerde (Ik probeerde het voor je)
Ik deed alles om je te bereiken (Ik probeerde je te bereiken)
Zei dat je me nooit had gezien in geen drama (Geen drama)
Ik rende zo in mijn karma (Ik rende zo)

[Chorus: Future]
Zei dat je een kogel zou vangen, zei dat je dood voor me zou gaan (Dat je dood voor me zou gaan)
Ik had een slecht gevoel dat je tegen me had gelogen (Loog tegen me)
We waren voorzichtig, maar jij werd high met me (Je was high)
Als het na 11 uur is, dan zie ik een andere kant van je (Een andere kant)
Zei dat je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor je zou gaan (Zei dat je dood zou gaan, zei dat je dood zou gaan)
Maar je loog tegen me, je loog tegen me, loog tegen me (Nu lieg je)
Zei dat je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor je zou gaan (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Maar je loog tegen me, je loog tegen me, loog tegen me

[Verse 3: Halsey]
Gesettled met je, ik spel het uit, het is makkelijk genoeg
Ik bedacht me, ik kwam erachter, ik moet mijn gevoel volgen
Ik speel niet meer, ik ging door je telefoon heen
Ik belde alle meisjes in je DMs en nam ze mee naar huis
En ik weet dat het een tijd geleden is dat je van me hoorde
Ik groeide in een savage en daarom gaven ze deze verse aan me
Blijkt te werken, want ze komen naar shows
Ik verkocht 15 miljoen CDs van een breakup liedje
Nam wat vreemden mee in ons bed
En nu ben je je recht op privacy verloren
Vertel al je geheimen
Terwijl je dacht dat ze waarschijnlijk met me het graf in zouden gaan
Weet dat je het fucking leuk vindt uit het zicht
En je hoeft niet te zeggen dat ik gek ben
Want ik weet namelijk dat er niets is veranderd

[Chorus: Post Malone & Halsey, Halsey]
Zei dat je een kogel zou vangen, zei dat je dood voor me zou gaan
(Dood zou gaan, dood zou gaan, dood zou gaan)
Ik had een slecht gevoel dat je tegen me had gelogen
(Maar je loog, je loog, je loog)
We waren voorzichtig, maar jij werd high met me
(Dood zou gaan, dood zou gaan, dood zou gaan)
Als het na 11 uur is, dan zie ik een andere kant van je
(Maar je loog, je loog, je loog)
Zei dat je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor je zou gaan
(Dood zou gaan, dood zou gaan, dood zou gaan)
Maar je loog tegen me, je loog tegen me, loog tegen me
(Maar je loog, je loog, je loog)
Zei dat je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor me zou gaan, je dood voor je zou gaan
(Dood zou gaan, dood zou gaan, dood zou gaan)
Maar je loog tegen me, je loog tegen me, loog tegen me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there

Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)

Two jobs, all alone, she couldn't quit
We was home alone when we was jits
That was before I was grown, before I was on
I ain't had no shoes, I ain't had no clothes
Lemme wear your shoes, lemme fuck your bitch
I ain't had no car, I ain't had no whip
Wonder why a nigga cover his ears when y'all talk
'Cause it ain't nobody could tell me shit
I spent 30K on my daughter birthday, everybody had fun
Nigga, everybody lit
When a nigga go home, I don't answer my phone
Everybody want to leech, everybody want a loan
Everybody wanna talk, everybody wanna clique
I don't wanna be friends and get off my dick
I ain't had time to think, I ain't had time to breathe
I've been prayin' to the Lord, I've been talkin' on my knees
I been thinkin' 'bout my pops, I been thinkin' about my opps
Thinkin' how can I stop me a nigga when he breathin'
When a nigga play with me, I ain't lookin' for my phone
I ain't finna drive away, I ain't lookin' for my keys
The fuck these niggas know about me?

Bitches know I'm a dog off the leash
A big dawg, niggas call me ""OG"" (OG)

220,By My Lonely,"[Intro]
Killers in my hood, they know me by my first name
You know 'em by their work name, I know 'em by their birth name
Type of weight make a man stand on principle
Kill yourself but get your whole fam slammed on principle

[Chorus]
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (Lonely)
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (By my lonely)
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (By my lonely)
Fuck nigga, I don't wanna be your homie (For real)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, Speaker Knockerz, I just ordered up, I got a hundred in
Keep the mop, watch how you talk to me, bitch, I'm not one of them
General for real, g-give a decree, the streets salute me
Sweaty sheets, jumpin' up outta my sleep, this how we gotta go eat
Safety pin apiece, cocaine resin stuck on the side of the scale
Watchin' the cameras
If you can deal with the smell, dealin' with paraphernal'
Weight in the pale, keepin' 'em off of the trail
Texture up under my nails
Storm comin', bond money, inevitable that you sit in a cell

[Chorus]
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (Lonely)
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (By my lonely)
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (By my lonely)
Fuck nigga, I don't wanna be your homie (For real)

[Verse 2]
Sick and tired of my phone ringin', workin' that bitch, I'm takin' a call (Hello)
Workin' with bricks, I'm drivin' a car, (Killer) got my body hard
Big ol' stepper with a rod, shop in the mall, no bodyguard
Heavy metal in my section, I'm controllin', I'm in charge
It's the heavily respected, I'll take a bitch to war
Bitch, I got steppers in my section, bodies on their firearms
Blow the clothes off your back, boom, boom, set off car alarms
C-C-Carbon with a drum, tiger, you no try to run
Give a fuck 'bout your Chanel (I don't)
I'm tied in with the mayor (Achoo)
Go sit down, went to jail
I'm part of the cartel
I'm a Breadwinner don and we came up from nothin'
And we prayed off crumbs, I was raised in the slums

[Chorus]
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (Lonely)
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (By my lonely)

221,On The Road,"[Letra de ""Post Malone - On the Road ft. Lil Baby & Meek Mill (Traducción al Español)""]

[Intro: Post Malone]
Mm, mm, mm
Mm

[Estribillo: Post Malone]
Porque nunca me han visto caer bajo presión
Nunca me vieron caer, nah, nunca
Siempre me mantengo porque soy demasiado inteligente
Nunca, nunca vendería mi alma, nah, nunca
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo

[Verso 1: Post Malone]
Sí, ellos apuestan a que voy a caer
Sólo tengo 24, perra, pero he pasado por todo
Tengo tantos éxitos que no puedo recordarlos todos (Uh)
Mientras estoy cagando, miro las placas en la pared
Ustedes sólo siéntense y tomen su patada de vuelta
Sigan actuando como si lo hubiesen hecho, no tengo respeto
Para nadie que sea falso en la vida, ey, ey
Realmente no eres quien dices ser
Así que acelera el ritmo, no hay porqué frenar (Frenar)
Sal de mi cara, ¿puedes dejar de chupármela?
Porque mi tiempo es caro, un millón por repertorio
Compré un auto nuevo antes de que te despertases para el desayuno, sí

[Estribillo: Post Malone]
Porque nunca me han visto caer bajo presión
Nunca me vieron caer, nah, nunca
Siempre me mantengo porque soy demasiado inteligente (Demasiado inteligente)
Nunca, nunca vendería mi alma, nah, nunca
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo

[Verso 2: Meek Mill]
Sí, ¿dónde estuviste? (¿Dónde estuviste?)
Cuando llegó el momento de trabajar y ponerle ganas
Tan sólo me río cuando los veo, míralos (Ja)
Se van cuando pierdo y aparecen de nuevo tan pronto gano (Uh)
No estabas conmigo el primer día y sé que no eres mi amigo
Así que no puedo juzgarte cuando haces mierda falsa y sólo finges
Como si realmente estuvieses conmigo, porque ser leal inicia de dentro
He visto que el amor aumenta ese amor y a la vez lo debilita
Pero no me detuvo, seguí subiendo aunque no quisiese
Ojalá cada vez que dijeran que voy a caer, ganase un millón
Jugando y todo, pero tal vez sea igual de rico que Jeff Bezos, dilo de nuevo
Nunca pierdo, voy adelantado, me quedo en ese gimnasio
Consigámoslo

[Estribillo: Post Malone]
Porque nunca me han visto caer bajo presión
Nunca me vieron caer, nah, nunca
Siempre me mantengo porque soy demasiado inteligente (Demasiado inteligente)
Nunca, nunca vendería mi alma, nah, nunca
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo

[Verso 3: Lil Baby]
Estoy cansado de estar cansado
Esta es mi última oportunidad, no puedes enojarte, al menos lo intenté
Se supone que somos adultos, pero aún así eres infantil
Puedo subirme al avión solo, no necesito equipaje extra
Este año me convirtió en un salvaje, llevo baguettes en mi collar
Conduzco rápido, no chocaré y se supone que debo estar sobrio
Pero de una u otra manera, me sigo drogando
Se necesitará más que sólo presión para tumbarme
Intenté lo más fuerte que pude, pero en este punto está fuera de mis manos
No me quedo sin estos fajos por nada ni nadie
Ella dice que soy un perro, pero se necesita ser uno para reconocer a otro
He estado haciéndolo duro, he estado solo, no necesito amor

[Estribillo: Post Malone]
Porque nunca me han visto caer bajo presión
Nunca me vieron caer, nah, nunca
Siempre me mantengo porque soy demasiado inteligente
Nunca, nunca vendería mi alma, nah, nunca
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo

223,The Ones That Didn't Make It Back Home,"[Verse 1]
Tour was up middle of June
She was plannin' a welcome home barbecue
Green bean casserole, grandma's recipe
There was a knock on the door around two o'clock
Two uniforms and her heart stopped
Yellow ribbon 'round an oak tree, blowin' in the breeze

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'
The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home

[Verse 2]
The whole town shut down, the whole town showed up
Sang Amazing Grace, watched a slide show of
His 22 years, there was laughs and there was tears
And that preacher talked about sacrifice
And traffic stopped for them Cadillac lights
Johnny sold beer half priced that night
And everybody raised 'em high singin'

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'
The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home

[Bridge]
Back to that front porch
Back through that front door
To the life they were fightin' for

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there

Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith

I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'Chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

[Verse 1]
Stay in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust

Think you know me? That's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slewed
Throwin' up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck 'bout jeans and crep
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like goin' tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that",Drake,Drake,2019,"[83, 75]",2

236,Queen Of Mean,"[Intro]
I'm so tired of pretending
Where's my happy ending?

[Verse 1]
I followed all the rules
I drew inside the lines
I never asked for anything that wasn't mine
I waited patiently for my time
But when it finally came
He called her name
And now I feel this overwhelming pain
I mean it's in my veins
I mean it's in my brain
My thoughts are running in a circle like a toy train
I'm kinda like a perfect picture with a broken frame
I know exactly who to blame

[Chorus]
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen

[Verse 2]
Being nice was my pastime
But I've been hurt for the last time
And I won't ever let another person take advantage of me
The anger burns my skin, third-degree
Now my blood's boiling hotter than a fiery sea
There's nobody getting close to me
They're gonna bow to the Evil Queen
Your nightmare's my dream
Just wait until they fall to my wicked schemes

[Chorus]
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
(Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean

[Verse 3]
Something's pulling me
It's so magnetic
My body is moving
Unsure where I'm headed
All of my senses have left me defenseless
This darkness around me
Is promising vengeance
The price that I'm willing to pay is expensive
There's nothing to lose
When you're lonely and friendless
So my only interest is showing this princess
That I am the queen
And my reign will be endless (Endless)

[Bridge]
I want what I deserve
I want to rule the world
Sit back and watch them learn
It's finally my turn

[Chorus]
If they want a villain for a queen
I'm gonna be one like they've never seen
I'll show them what it means
Now that I am that
I will be the ruler of the dark and the bad
'Cause the devil's on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)

The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)

Wiped the footprints off my dash
Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back
I'm outta here

Flipped off that ""ya'll come back"" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear

It ain't nothin' but a rearview town

Roots ripped right up out of the ground

I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new

Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I’d be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)

[Intro: Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Épico
Salte 'el medio, ¿okay?
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh, eh (Suénalo)
Me dijeron que te acabas de dejar (Eh)
Que el bobo aquel te engañó
Que ya no crees en el amor (No)
Que andas suelta igual que yo (Bad Bunny)
No sé, pero la noche está pa’ desquitarno' (Hey, hey)
Otro shot vamo' a darno’ (Mujeres, get ready, sube)
Que yo también quiero joder, vacilar (¿Qué, qué, qué?)
Trae a to'a tus amiga', que yo las voy a poner a fumar
Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar, yeh

[Coro: Lunay, Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Porque 'tar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Rra, rra)
'Tar soltera está de moda
Por eso no va a cambiar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Estar soltera está de moda (¿Qué, qué, qué?)
Por eso ella no se enamora (Dile; ¡no!)
Estar soltera está de moda (D-D-D-D-D-D.Y.)
Por eso no va a cambiar (¡Da-ddy Yan-kee!)

[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Ella 'tá soltera (Wuh, wuh), con su' amiga’ revuelta’
Va pa' la disco y a nadie le rinde cuenta’ (Prr)
'Tá soltera (Fuego), con su' amiga' revuelta’
Va pa' la disco y a nadie le rinde cuenta' (Fue', fue'. fue')

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee]
Ella vacila y vive en la joda
No 'tá lista pa' un trajecito blanco en la boda
Puede perrear con uno, como sea, lo baila sola (Chi-chi-chi)
Batea pa' .500, siempre bota la bola (¿Cómo?)
Pon-, pónme a prueba, a ver, que to' el peso te va a caer
La orden de cateo, las mano' contra la pare'
Pa' darle pa'l piso no pide permiso (No, wuh!)
Si está soltera, sin compromiso (¿Qué, qué?)
'Tá pa' la rumba y hacer dinero y yo que soy un bandolero
Me gustan como tú, las que no creen en sentimiento' ni un 14 de febrero (D-D-D.Y)

[Pre-Coro: Lunay]
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar
Solita pa' romper la disco
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Chi-chi-chi)
Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar

[Coro: Lunay & Daddy Yankee]
Y estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (¡Ble!)
Estar soltera está de moda (Yeh)
Por eso no va a cambiar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Y estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Blu, blu)
'Ta-'tar soltera está de moda (Sube, sube)
Por eso no va a cambiar

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh
Se cansó de lo' embuste' y a su vida le hizo un ajuste, ey (Prr)
Si la ves en la disco con las de ella', no te asuste' (¡No!)
Puesta pa'l problema, así que no la busque'
Y déjala volar como decía Tito (Hu-huh)
A ese culo el traje le queda chiquito (Ah)
La leona no está puesta pa' gatito' (No), ey
Y sin ti, le va bonito
Hoy se siente coqueta (¿Qué, qué?)
Siempre activa, nunca quieta
To'a las moña' son violeta'
El corazón lo tiene a dieta, ey
Pa' que ningún cabrón se meta (Sube, sube, sube, sube)
Te dejó en read otra ve'
Te ha picha'o to' las llamada' y to' lo' text
¿Tú no entiende' que hace rato dijo ""Next""?
La nena está haciendo más ticket que el ex, eh (¡Chin'-ching!)

[Verso 3: Lunay & Daddy Yankee]
Ponte-ponte pa' la vuelta, que yo voy pa'l party (Lunay, dile)
Si no, nos vemo', mami, en el after party
Ponte pa'l problema, ándale, déjate ver
Lo que aquí empezamo', lo matamo' en el motel (Fuego)
Tú estás suelta por ahí, yo estoy suelto por acá
Hacerte wiki-wiki, como dice Yaviah
Soltó el corazón, sacó a pasear la maldá'
(Tiene la mente dañá')

[Pre-Coro: Bad Bunny, Daddy Yankee & Ambos]
(Yeh, yeh)
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Vacilar ¡Wuh!)
Solita pa' romper la disco

Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar (Brr)

[Coro: Bad Bunny, Lunay & Daddy Yankee]
Que estar soltera está de moda
Hace lo que quiera y que se joda
Estar soltera está de moda
Ella no le va a bajar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Rra-rra)
'Tar soltera está de moda (Sí)
Por eso no va a cam-cam-cambiar (Fue')

[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Ella 'tá soltera (Wuh-wuh), con su' amiga' revuelta' (D-D-D)
Revuelta', revuelta', revuelta' (Rrr)

271,The Archer,"[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?

272,Paper Rings,"[Verse 1]
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)

I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy

273,Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince,"[Verse 1]
You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Verse 2]
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

274,I Think He Knows,"[Verse 1]
I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
I got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Verse 2]
I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He'd better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue
I got that, ah, I mean (I mean)

""Where we gonna go?""

275,Cornelia Street,"[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Bridge]
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away

We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Oh, I'd...

[Verse 1]
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you

[Bridge]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen

Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)

You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet

That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...

I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?

[Chorus]
’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can’t pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)

Put you in jail for something you didn’t do

Thought I had reason to attack, but no

Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us

Hey, it's all me, in my head

But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you

I don’t wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it’s all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Verse 2]
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It’s on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you

Meet me in the afterglow

Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love

[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah

[Outro]
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love",Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,2019,[77],1
281,Daylight,"[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)

[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love",Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,2019,[89],1
282,Raised On Country,"[Verse 1]
Got a little southern drawl in my talk
Little pickup truck on my highway
Got a little boot stomp in my walk
Little neon lighting my Friday
Got some Tennessee in my whiskey
Raise a cup up if you with me

[Chorus]
I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie
Daddy did too, it's family tradition
If someone cranks it up, you can't help but listen
My upbringing sounds like George Strait singing
And I gotta give props to the radio
'Cause if you know me, I was raised on country

[Verse 2]
It's the only reason that I survived
Every breakup and every party
It's the soundtrack to my life
It runs deep in my DNA

[Chorus]
I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie
Daddy did too, it's family tradition
If someone cranks it up, you can't help but listen
My upbringing sounds like George Strait singing
And I gotta give props to the radio
'Cause if you know me, I was raised on country
I was raised on country

[Bridge]
(Raised on country music)
Learned a lot about living and a little 'bout love
(Raised on country music)
And you know that's something I'm so proud of

[Chorus]
I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie

Ooh

284,Never Really Over,"[Verse 1]
I'm losing my self control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, ""Draw the line""
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

Beer don't keep
Love’s not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves

Daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't a wishin' well
Money ain't rich
Everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

[Verse 2]
Girls like to laugh
Tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat

And love's worth living for

'Til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again

Some of it you read on a page

300,Happier,"[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand, they'll never understand me

Love makin' love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us
But they speakin' on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Love givin' back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale

I really bought cars for women on face

College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil
Livin' on the edge, she keepin' me level
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever (Forever)
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
I'll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin' on your hands, your body's a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, ménages with bitches
Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest (Biggest, biggest)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasn't actin' right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin' light
You movin' funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas' conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of 'em parked
Your niggas' money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, that's not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock 'em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'
Bitch, we on the real, it's time to stop talkin' (Stop talkin', stop talkin')

And need a place to hide from all the pain

I'm single again (Single again)
Told her we'll be better off friends (Uh)
Baby, I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again (Single again)
Told 'em that we better off friends (Off friends)
Blaming you is just so easy (Woah)
But maybe the problem's me
I'm single again (Single again)
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Gon' be)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (On me)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me (On me)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Instead of blaming all my old girls when I leave (What?)
Instead of calling up these fake hoes that I don't need (What?)
Old relationships turn to new déjà vus
Got me feeling like, ""I don't fuck with you""
Oh nah, nah, that's the old me
You fucking with the new me (Yeah)
Honestly, all the disrespect had damn near ruined me (Damn near)
All the trust gone, seems like all you say is, ""Prove it to me"" (Straight)
And you know I suck at lying, don't, don't do it to me (Don't)
Maybe 'cause my mom had never worked it out with my dad (Damn)
Maybe 'cause he had insecurities and she had 'em back (Uh-huh)
Maybe 'cause single parent love was all I ever had
Who knows? (Who knows?)

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, Big Sean]
I'm single again (Single again)
Told her we'll be better off friends (Off friends)
Maybe I should just focus on me (On me)

Told 'em that we better off friends (Off friends)
Blaming you is just so easy (Uh-huh)
But maybe the problem's me (Straight up)
I'm single again (Single again)
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Yeah, yeah)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (On me)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me

Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time
Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time

[Verse 2: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]
What have you done for yourself?
What have you done for your mental health? (Yeah, yeah)
I even tried the drugs and they didn't help
Short term fix, that breaks everything else (Oh, oh)
And my bros keep throwing me these random girls in stallions
I need the best advice, went across the street to Khaled (Oh)
He said the major key is to be strong on your own
Lose your other half, you're never off balance (Oh)
Lookin' for the love in somebody else
That I probably should've gave to myself
Cycles I need to break in myself
If I'm alone, I'm second to no one else, so (Yeah)

[Chorus: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm single again (Oh)
Told her we'll be better off friends (Better off friends)
Maybe I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again
Told 'em that we better off friends (Oh, yeah)
Blaming you is just so easy (Oh)
But maybe the problem's me (Ooh)
I'm single again
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Way)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (Way)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me (Ooh)

And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one (Ayy), fuck it, I'm on one (Yeah)
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one

But you're the only one 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different

Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh

[Bridge]
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you

It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion

Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said ""no strings attached"" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 2: Drake, Drake & Sampha]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Outro: Drake, Sampha]
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

I got car money, fresh start money
I want Saudi money, I want art money
I want women to cry and pour out they heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeah, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell 'em I love 'em and don't ever mean it
We go on dates, I send the Maybach out in neighborhoods
They never seen it
That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient, I ain't lying
Yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia's some fly shit
It's sitting at the house like I bought it in '96
'Cause honestly I'm too fucking busy to drive stick, I swear
Too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me, pre-heated oven
I'm in this ho
But I ain't finished though, it's been a minute though
My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled ""Surprise!"", I wasn't surprised
That's only 'cause I been waiting on it, nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Of course...

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympias
We talked music for hours, she never mentioned ya
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB
These niggas make it so hard to be friendly
When I know part of it's envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far, these are empty
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ooh! I never seen the car you claim to drive
Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately, it went from top five to remaining five
My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me it's like a high, and it wasn't a lie, yeah
Just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
And fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Aw, yeah

Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

Ha, yeah

[Verse 1]
They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, ""Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?""
They said, ""Fucking right, they were the first to go""
It's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With ""I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you""
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, ""Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?""
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home

[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Verse 2]
I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home

[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Verse 3]
My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say ""What up, though?""
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home

[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Outro: Bob Marley]
Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel
Well, you ask plenty musicians – them know it, but them can't do it

Lack of interest, why'd you visit? Hit the road, yeah
I'm kinda twisted, so keep your distance, be a ghost
Yeah, see I'm inventive, but quite the menace, you ain't know?
Well then I'm offended, let's jog your memories, here we go, yeah
I went from nobody to kinda famous
Hide my plaques inside the closet, I just can't explain it
My wife, she tells me that she's proud and thinks that I should hang 'em
But I just leave 'em on the ground right next to my self-hatred
Yeah, yeah, mental health, where's my mental health?
Diagnosed with OCD, what does that mean? Well, gather 'round
That means I obsessively obsess on things I think about
That means I might take a normal thought and think it's so profound (Leave me alone)
Ruminating, fill balloons up full of doubts
Do the same things, if I don't, I'm overwhelmed (Leave me alone)
Thoughts are pacing, they go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's so draining, let's move onto something else, fine (Oh) (Leave me alone)
Runnin' the game, but they don't even know it
Like I'm undercover and don't wanna blow it
I come out of nowhere, they don't even notice
The flow is so cold, you would think it was snowin' (Oh) (Leave me alone)
I'm under the weather, but wind isn't blowin'
I got an umbrella for difficult moments
You got to admit it, I'm very devoted
I'm out in the rain, but it don't always open, so I… (I, I)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face
I can feel them weighin' on me every day
I should let 'em go and watch 'em float away
But I'm scared if I do, then I'll be more afraid (More afraid)
Tell them how I feel, but they don't wanna change (Don't wanna change)
Tell them how I feel, but they remain the same (Same)
Loosen up my grip, they say that's not okay
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy, leave me alone! (Oh!)

[Chorus]
Ayy, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!
Woo, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone! (Leave me alone)

[Verse 2]
I hate when they debate if we're underrated
We're so overlooked that they're lookin' over our numbers, Nathan (Leave me alone)
We don't do enough interviews or go out in public lately
We don't post enough on our socials
To keep the buzz from fading (Leave me alone)
Let it fade, yeah, let it fade
Once it's decimated, then you drop a song outta nowhere
And all the fans embrace it (Leave me alone)
Then the buzz will surface again, it's part of my operation
I don't need advice from my doubts right now
End of conversation (Leave me alone)
Shut your mouth, yeah, shut your mouth
Better tone it down, close it now
If you make a sound, I'ma change the dial (Leave me alone)
Funny how they be acting loud, comin' unannounced
It's floating 'round
Man, the kid is wild, pretty vile, true (Leave me alone)
I'm kinda funny but don't really show it
I keep it together but have a disorder
I go to my room and I sit in my corner
And talk to myself in a language that's foreign (Leave me alone)
I think of a rhyme and I have to record it
But know if I don't, I'll wake up in the mornin'
And question my life again, always avoiding
I hate to be different, but hate to be normal, so I... (Leave me alone)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face
I can feel them weighin' on me every day
I should let 'em go and watch 'em float away
But I'm scared if I do, then I'll be more afraid
Tell them how I feel, but they don't wanna change (Wanna change)
Tell them how I feel but they remain the same (They remain the same)
Loosen up my grip, they say that's not okay
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy
Leave me alone!

[Chorus]
Ayy, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!
Woo, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!

[Verse 3]
Remember back in ""NO NAME,"" I said fame called? (Yeah, yeah)
Told you I hung up, it kinda felt wrong (Leave me alone) (Wrong, wrong)
Finally called him back, we didn't talk long (No)
He asked me how I'd been, I sent him this song (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Yeah, think he took offense, he kinda seemed off (Off)
I texted him that night to ask what he thought (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
It took a couple days to get a response
But once I finally did, he said this song sucks (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Feel the symptoms, couldn't miss 'em, wrestle with 'em
Then I pin and flip 'em, brought some back up
No, well, you should get some (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Who you dissin'? Mood is switchin', don't come in the kitchen
You should listen, cookin' record for my hands are blisterin'
So persistent, don't forget this, hold the tension, soul is bendin'
No pretendin', open-ended, low percentage, so demented (Leave me alone)
Whole consensus, flow tremendous, no apprentice, dope incentive
Show intensive, so possessive, tone aggressive, watch your step when I... (Leave me alone)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face (Up my face)
I can feel them weighin' on me every day (Yeah, every day)
I should let 'em go and watch them float away (Yeah, float away)
But I'm scared if I do then I'll be more afraid
Leave me alone (Yeah), leave me alone, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Leave me alone, leave me alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Leave me alone, leave me alone (Yeah, leave me alone)
Yeah, leave me alone, leave me alone, ayy, leave me alone!

[Chorus]
Ayy, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!
Woo, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!

332,The Search,"[Verse]
""Hey, Nate, how's life?""
I don’t know, it's alright
I've been dealin’ with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night
""I'm sorry,"" that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny’s goin’ on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out
I’ve been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate?"" I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin’ my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it?
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm saying, and—
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great—not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith (Woo)
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me ""Tone that down,"" but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist
The search begins, I'm back, so enjoy the trip, huh",NF,NF,2019,"[86, 70]",2

Yup
And we back (Igh)
Na-na-na (Igh)

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
If you blink you might miss it
You gotta click it or ticket
You gotta go get the gettin' before it's gone
End it quickly as it begun
Life is short as a midget, but mine's a little LeBron
Been a minute since Eminem was a blonde
I need a peace prize‚ mom invented the bomb
A nigga wanted more‚ I would only sit on the lawn
A nigga up next like strongly scented colognes
I'm 'bout to book a show at the Dimmsdale Dimmadome
I still could hit up Sony today and get a loan
And shout out to Miss Sylvia Rhone‚ we get along
But that boy advance gotta be bigger than Diddy Kong
I need stock and it gotta be Pippi Long
Can't stop, won't stop boppin' like Diddy's song
My next tour got eight legs like daddy long
I'm 'bout to have two kids that like daddy's song

[Chorus: John Legend]
We can't be out here pleasin' everybody (Oh, I...)
We know who we are (Oh‚ yeah)

This is, this is the day
Took it the scenic route, but this is the way
That's old news, baby, this is today

Took it the scenic route, but this is the way
That's old news, baby, this is today
They gon' miss us today, you a ""Mrs."" today

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Backyard blasted, dance 'til it's grassless
Patio glass, the mazel tov cocktails
Bomb, b-bombastic, used to drop acid
Marli come soon, I only drop classics
Everyone ask
""When that heat gon' drop?""
""When that knee gon' drop?""
""When is he gon' pop the question we all got?""
""'Cause this could be y'all block
You're livin' in a glass house, we can see y'all clocks""
But I can see you from the other side, see y'all rocks
And we could've been Magneto, if you seen our locks
But we share it with the world, not just fans
Come out clean lookin' like we jumped the broom and the dustpan
So now it's here and we actin' out
Dame Dash, champagne in the back of Tao
Now I'm back in my bag and the cat is out
Burn a hole in my pocket like a Black & Mild (Igh)

[Chorus: John Legend]
We can't be out here pleasin' everybody (Oh, I...)
I know, you know, we know just who we are (Oh, yeah)
And if you with me, then I'm with you darlin' (Oh, baby)

Hey, we made it, we made it
I'm feelin' grateful
I'm here with my favorite
Oh God, I'm thankful
Our song and we played it
So good, we played it (Yeah)
I just wanted to keep on playin' (Hey)

335,Do You Remember,"[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The  summers all lasted forever?
Days  disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos, these niggas is altos
First  album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the feds if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I remember the last summer of the teens
I can't recall too many summers in between
Will Smith, Genie, Donald Glover, Lion King
My daughter on the swing like the 2017 Cubs
My daughter mother double-ringed up
Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups
Used to have obsession with the ""27 Club""
Now I'm turning twenty-seven, wanna make it to the 2070 club
Put the 27's down, Lord, give me a clean lung
Took the ring up out the box, I know this ain't no brief love
This story arc so sharp that it made the streets flood
This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Outro: Ben Gibbard & Chance the Rapper]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever? (Summer everlasting)
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever",Chance the Rapper,Chance The Rapper Featuring Death Cab For Cutie,2019,[95],1

I comb my hair like an old school scene
I'm feelin' high like a late night summer of last year (Yeah)
Standin' there with the red dress on ya

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Must've done something right 'cause all these
Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees
And every time that song comes on it's about me
Oh, I feel like Post Malone when I get home
Sittin' there, winning like it's Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for

That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

How many nights we hung out together

Round this old dance floor

Making a motion like ""'Could y'all get any closer?""
They wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true?
We make it true
Oh, we make it true

Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them something to talk about

Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep them talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?

I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest

We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal

We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well

I'm glad that I'm calmin' down, can't let no one come control me
Keep dancin' and call it love, she fightin' but fallin' slowly
If ever you are in doubt, remember what mama told me

[Chorus: Wizkid]
Brown skin girl, ya skin just like pearls
Your back against the world
I never trade you for anybody else, say
Brown skin girl, ya skin just like pearls
The best thing in all the world
I never trade you for anybody else, say

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Pose like a trophy when Naomis walk in
She need an Oscar for that pretty dark skin
Pretty like Lupita when the cameras close in
Drip broke the levee when my Kellys roll in
I think tonight she might braid her braids
Melanin too dark to throw her shade
She minds her business and wines her waist
Gold like 24k, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Wizkid & Beyoncé]
Tonight I might fall in love, dependin' on how you hold me
I'm glad that I'm calmin' down, can't let no one come control me
Keep dancin' and call it love, she fightin' but fallin' slowly
If ever you are in doubt, remember what mama told me

[Chorus: Wizkid & Beyoncé]
Brown skin girl, ya skin just like pearls
Your back against the world
I never trade you for anybody else, say
Brown skin girl, ya skin just like pearls
The best thing in all the world
I never trade you for anybody else, say

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Oh, have you looked in the mirror lately? (Lately)
Wish you could trade eyes with me (Because)
There's complexities in complexion
But your skin, it glow like diamonds
Dig me like the earth, you be giving birth
Took everything in life, baby, know your worth
I love everything about you, from your nappy curls
To every single curve, your body natural
Same skin that was broken be the same skin takin' over
Most things out of focus, view
But when you're in the room, they notice you (Notice you)
'Cause you're beautiful
Yeah, you're beautiful

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Them men, them gon' fall in love with you and all of your glory
Your skin is not only dark, it shines and it tells your story
Keep dancin', they can't control you
They watchin', they all adore you
If ever you are in doubt, remember what mama told you

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Wizkid]
Brown skin girl (Brown skin girl), ya skin just like pearls (Brown skin girl)
Your back against the world (Oh)
I never trade you for anybody else, say (No, no)
Brown skin girl (Brown skin girl), ya skin just like pearls (Brown skin)
The best thing in all the world
I never trade you for anybody else, say

If you miss me
And you can't find
Me nowhere
I done seen it all, oh my God
Uh
I done seen it all, oh my God, I swear
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Nothing new under the sun, nobody fucking with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She digging me and I’m cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that’s my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn

I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with, ayy

[Verse 2: Lute]
Potato over my gun
I move in silence 'cause niggas be clocking my funds
When they should keep eye on they bitch ’cause baby girl coming with son
Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?
My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don’t even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a Caprice on them thangs
I'm Beatties Ford ’til the wheels fall
Know some niggas probably pissed off
Who would thought I made it this far?
Gold Mouf, bitch, fuck 'em all

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with

[Verse 3: DaBaby]
I just put diamonds on all of my teeth, now they probably think I ain't intelligent
In the homicide unit interrogation, asking questions, you know I ain’t tell 'em shit
Bitches call me a jock, all-American
I'm at the top of my class with my lettermen
I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door
I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers
They mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
Reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a Glock with a dick, let's get physical
They gon' be hollerin' out, ""Rip,"" and they missin' you
They got me started, I might as well finish it (Talk your shit)
I'm from Charlotte, you know how these niggas do
Baby

348,Pure Water,"[Intro: Quavo & YG]
Woo!
Y'all already know who I am? Right?
Mustard on the beat, ho
Let's go

[Chorus: Quavo]
Uh (Woo, woo), no Master P (Ayy)
Ten bad bitches and they after me (Bad)
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece (Uh)
Lookin' for a dunk, like a athlete (Uh)
Big drip, what you call it? (Big drip, yeah)
Ice chain, pure water (Ice, ice, ice)
You got the cash, but can't afford it (Cash, no)
You got the bag, but can't afford it (Give me the bag)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Give me the beat, I ride it like a jetski (Hey)
So many bad bitches they harassin' me (Bad)
They like me 'cause I rap and be with the athletes (Athletes)
Stop askin' me (Uh), I know they mad at me (Nah)
Hop in the coupe, then I slide like it's Vaseline (Skrrt, skrrt)
West coast 6-4 jump like a trampoline (6-4)
Take a brick out, put it on a triple beam (Brick out)
I'm not from Canada, but I see a lot of tings (Canada)
Dismantle her, I know how to handle her (Woo, hey)
Light the candle up, make you put a banner up (Up, up)
Toss a 50 up, make 'em tear the club up (Tear the club up)
Took your bitch out the game, I had to sub her (Swap, swap, here we go)

[Chorus: Quavo & Offset]

Somebody got shot, what you talkin' 'bout, Willis? (Who?)
In the lobby with a brick, I'm Ricky Bobby with your bitch
I go Lawrence with the fit, in the 'Rari with no tint ('Rari, drip, drip)
I'm from the trench, I got the dirty money rinsed (Oh)
He was poppin' so I popped and prayed to God, repent (Oh, oh, oh, let's go)

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
T-Takeoff, no limit to the money (Money, nah)
I picked the gang up, took a flight across the country ('Cross the country, where?)
I tipped the waitress, told her, ""Keep the ones comin'""
Hit the store to get some Backwoods and left the Wraith runnin', fuck it
Lookin' like they plottin', but we already on it (On it)
In the lab with Celine like that bag that she wanted (Celine)
A lot of tings, ass bustin' out them jeans, make you want it (Ting)
Make you wanna spend a 50, hit the scene with her, don't it? (Scene)
Whole team full of queens, gotta keep their eyes on me (Queen)

I bet they ride on 'em when I put that prize on 'em (Prize)
Ten bad bitches, rotate 'em, got five of 'em (Five)

Ten bad bitches and they after me (Bad)
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece (Uh)

349,Remember The Name,"[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Yeah I was born a misfit, grew up ten miles from the town of Ipswich
آره، من مثل یه آدم استثنایی بدنیا اومدم، و ده مایل اونور تر از شهر ""ایپسوییچ"" بزرگ شدم
Wanted to make it big I wished it to existence
همیشه میخواستم که این شهرو بزرگ کنم، ای کاش الان وجود داشته باشه
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
من هرگز یه بچه ی مریض نبودم، همیشه به سرعت از بیمارستان مرخص میشدم
Stick to singing, stop rapping like it's Christmas
چسبیدم به خوانندگی و خوندن، از رپ کردن دست کشیدم انگار که الان کریسمسه
And if you’re talkin' money then my conversation's shiftin’
و اگه داری راجبه پول درآوردن از خوانندگیم صحبت میکنی، بعدش موضوع بحثمون عوض میشه
My dreams are bigger than just being on the rich list
رویاهام بزرگتر از داخل لیست ادمای پولدار بودن هستش
Might be insanity but people call it gifted
شاید دیوونه بازی باشه، ولی مردم میگن بهش میگن استعداد خدادادیه
My face is going numb from the shit the stuff is mixed with
صورتم داره بیحس میشه بخاطر این شر و ورا و جنس گندی که باهاش ترکیب شده
Watch out the lyrics and the songs might get twisted
مراقب متن آهنگا باش و آهنگا ممکنه بد جلوه داده بشن
My wife wears red but looks better without the lipstick
زنم لباس قرمز میپوشه ولی بدون رژلبش خوشگل تر و بهتر به نظر میاد
I'm a private guy, yeah, you know nothin' 'bout my business
من ادم محرمانه ای هستم، اره تو هیچی راجب کارم نمیدونی
And if I had my fifteen minutes I must've missed it
و اگه 15 دقیقه ی خودمو داشتم، احتمالا از دستش میدادم

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
Twenty years old is when I came in the game
بیست سالگی زمانی بودش که اومدم داخل این بازی
And now it's eight years on and you Remember The Name
و الان نزدیک هشت ساله که از اون موقع میگذره و اسم منو یادت میاد
And if you thought I was good well then I'm better today
و اگه فکر میکردی که خوب بودم خوب بعدش امروز خیلی بهترم
But it's ironic how you people thought I’d never be great
اما این طعنه آمیزه که چطور شما آدما فکر کردید که من هرگز آدم بزرگی نمیشم
I like my shows open-air Tokyo to Delaware
من اجراهامو که روباز و در هوای آزاد بودنو دوست دارم از اجرام توی توکیو بگیر تا توی دلور
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
گوشیاتونو ببرید تو هوا اگه میخواید که ترکونده باشید
You know I want way more than I’ve already got
میدونی میخوام خیلی بیشتر از چیزی که قبلا داشتم داشته باشم
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club
بهم یه آهنگ با امینم و فیفتی سنت داخل کلاب بدید

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
میدونی که وقت من نرسیده این کار رو کنار بذارم
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
میخوام کارم رو انجام بدم و میخوام که پولشو بهم بدن
But it’s 'bout time you Remember The Name
ولی الان تقریبا زمان این رسیده که اسم مارو یادت بیاد
Ayy, ayy!
هی، هی
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
میدونی که وقت من نرسیده این کار رو کنار بذارم
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
میخوام کارم رو انجام بدم و میخوام که پولشو بهم بدن
But it's ’bout time you Remember The Name
ولی الان تقریبا زمان این رسیده که اسم مارو یادت بیاد
Ayy, ayy!
هی، هی

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can still remember tryna shop a deal from Taco Bell to TRL
من هنوزم میتونم به یاد بیارم که تلاش میکردم یه وعده غذا از رستورانهای زنجیره ای ""تاکو بل"" بخورم تا شو های ""تی آر ال"" رو اجرا کنم
I climb the Billboard Charts to the top until
به بهترین های جدول بیلبورد رسیدم
As fate would have it, became an addict
تا اینکه دست تقدیر خواست و یه معتاد شدم
Funny ‘cause I had pop appeal but they said time would tell (what?)
جالبه چونکه من قرص میخوردم، ولی اونا گفتن که زمان خواهد مشخص میکنه
If I'd prevail (huh?) and all I did was (what?)
اگه بخوام برنده ی این بازی شم و رقبام رو شکست بدم (ها؟) و تمام کاری کردم این بودش (چی؟)
Put nine inch nails (where?), in my eyelids now (what?)
ناخن مصنوعی 9 اینجی بزارم رو دستام (کجا؟)، روی پلکام الان (چی؟)
I'm seein' diamond sales ... like I'm in Zales
دارم میبینم که الماس ها فروخته میشن، انگار که داخل فروشگاه های ""زیلس"" هستم
Without a doubt by any means if rap was skinny jeans
بدون شک با هر معنی ای اگه رپ یه شلوار جین اسکینی و جذب بودش
I couldn't do anything in'em, I'd be splitting seams of denim
هیچکاری نمیتونستم توش انجام بدم، میخوام که درز این شلوار جین رو بشکافم
When I'm spitting schemes, which really means
زمانیکه دارم دارم این برنامه و طرح رو کنار میزارمش، که در واقع یعنی
No if, ands or buts are squeezin' in between
نه ""اما"" نه ""و"" و نه ""اگری"" بینشون چپونده نمیشه
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fucking with me in your dreams
شما منو نادیده میگیرین، چونکه شما کسخلا فقط تو خواب میتونین حریف من بشین
Not even when I'm on my death bed
نه حتی زمانیکه من روی تخت مرگم دراز کشیدم
Man I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
رفیق منم احساس ""اِد"" رو دارم، هنوز زمانش نرسیده که میکروفون مون رو زمین بندازیم
So why would I quit?
پس چرا من بخوام کنار بکشم؟
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
فکر اینکه من بس میکنم وقتی که بمیرم، توی ذهنم خطور کرد
Just popped in my head, I said it then forgot what I said
فقط این حرفو زدم و بعدش یادم رفتش

[Hook: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
It ain't my time to call it a day
میدونی که وقت من نرسیده این کار رو کنار بذارم
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
درگیر رپ کردن بودمو پولمم قبلا گرفتم
But it's 'bout time you Remember The Name
ولی الان تقریبا زمان این رسیده که اسم مارو یادت بیاد
Ayy, ayy!
هی، هی

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
میدونی که وقت من نرسیده این کار رو کنار بذارم
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
درگیر رپ کردن بودمو پولمم قبلا گرفتم
But it's 'bout time you Remember The Name
ولی الان تقریبا زمان این رسیده که اسم مارو یادت بیاد
Ayy, ayy!
هی، هی

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Ain't nobody cold as me I dress so fresh so clean
هیچ کسی به سردی من نیستش، خیلی تر و تمیز لباس میپوشم
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
منو میتونی از ماشین لوکسم بشناسی، با تیپ لباس مارک ""فندی"" دارم میترکونم
Man you know just what I mean
داداش خوب میدونی منظورم چیه
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it
میدرخشم، با جواهراتی که روی دستم هستش
Buscemi's with locks on it
کفش مارک ""بوسمی"" با قفل روش
Everything my voice on, the shit knock, don't it?
روی صدام هر چیزی هستش، یه گهی تق تق میکنه، مگه نه؟؟
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
مثل داستان حماسی بالینشیاگا، داخل پاساژ ""برگدورف"" بخوبی دارم زندگی میکنم
It's just another episode my hoes I spoil 'em
این فقط قسمت دیگه ای از جنده های منن، مستشون میکنم
She like the fly shit, and I like to buy shit
اون مثل یه کسخل چت کرده، و من دوست دارم براش شر و ور بخرم
Shit I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
کیر توش دارم پول مفت میدم، چیکارای دیگه ای میتونیم با پول بکنیم
Bitch we be ballin' out, the king brings you 50 bottles
جنده خانم داریم کلی پول خرج میکنیم، پادشاه بهتون 50 بطری مشروب دیگه میده
Tonight we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout the shit tomorrow
امشب قراره که کل پولمون رو خرج کنیم، نگرانی رو بذاریم واسه فردا
The turn up it so real, we 'bout to be super lit
بالا اومدنمون کاملا واقعیه، قراره خیلی کارمون خفن باشه
Boy I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
رفیق من واقعیتارو رک و راست میگم، این روشی ـه که باهاش این کار رو انجام میدیم
Tomorrow we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
فردا بخاطر الکل سردرد شدید میگیریم تا اینکه دوباره حس هوشیاریمون شروع شه
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again
بعدش زمان اینه که دوباره از نو شروع کنیم، دوباره روز از نو روزی از نو

[Hook: Ed Sheeran & 50 Cent]

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
میدونی که وقت من نرسیده این کار رو کنار بذارم
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
درگیر رپ کردن بودمو پولمم قبلا گرفتم
And it's just 'bout time you Remember The Name
ولی الان تقریبا زمان این رسیده که اسم مارو یادت بیاد
Ayy, ayy!

350,Walk Me Home,"[Verse 1]
There's somethin' in the way you roll your eyes
Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good
Tryna stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?

Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Verse 2]
There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm

Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm

[Verse 1]
I picked you up with a cowboy nod at the hotel bar
It was less than eight seconds, girl, you stole my heart
We had drinks and smokes, played your songs on guitar
I was crazy out the gate and you were wild from the start
You hopped in my Bronco and we had the time of our life
We've come a long way since then, girl
But it's been one hell of a ride

Love is like a rodeo, tryna see how far we go
After one touch, became obsessed with the rush

Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

Girl, there's something kind of dangerous about the way you move
I knew it wouldn't be easy hanging on to you
'Cause when you hit the light, put your lips on mine
It gets hotter than a Houston night

354,Best Part Of Me,"[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too

Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else?

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2: Halsey]
17, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned 23
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride

We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair (No fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)

365,Don't Check On Me,"[Verse 1: Chris Brown, with Ink]
If I'm out at the bar havin' a night on the town
Life of the party, pourin' shots of the brown
And you see me from the street but I don't turn around
Would you say, ""Hi""? Would you keep going?
If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true, but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
Your head and your heart won't feel the same
Even if it feels like it every time

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Might run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no-oh
Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I don't need your pity

[Chorus: Justin Bieber, with Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Don't check on me
Oh, don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown, with Ink]
Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry when the world was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time
No matter how hard you try

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Ink & Justin Bieber]
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June",Chris Brown,Chris Brown Featuring Justin Bieber & Ink,2019,[67],1

Look see
Everybody hatin when i'm buzzin like a satellite givin off a wave
Ta the earth for the kids
That's TV
People wanna say, they wanna fight n get the kids all hype
Like a crowd in the night
No pg
A kid a doing it right you never knew me
But i'm coming around the corner kinda dark and no
Can't see me
I tryna to be the one who's always talkin, when i think and let it out n let it go like
Free weed

[Verse]

Sorry that i gotta be the one ta flip it off
But i told you ima king, so better think twice
Of lyin on a track while comin against me
I'm fiendin to give thoughts, don't plan to be nice
So i gotta give a hundred when i'm runnin
When i'm jumpin on a mic, ima say whats in my head
I don't care about the cost, i faught for the spot that i rock
Straight raw, home grown, I don't care if you talkin

Name up in your throat like coughin
No stoppin cuz i'm sick like your mom so often
I'm back up from the ground, like the dead, In a coffin
Got a bat wit a nickname, lucy, call it
Steppin in the game like look
Callin all these Mother f****** out on the truth, then the wallet
Ill be gettin what i want In the end quit stallin
I'm ready for the fun, I've been done, gonna run this

I don't wanna hear you f****** say, 'where i'm from b****  ?'
Its all up on google n now who the dumb b****
Lookin for a reason bro, for me to get dumb rich
So never am i done doin better by minute
When i'm lifted, I be gifted, when i gimmick
Wit the image like boss
I'm fully automatic, I'm n addict in the halls
Trippin like the days i was takin adderall n i'm talkin kid days
Sorry had to do it mom
Said i had to focus everyday when i was young
Took it to level now look what i become
Kxng jay, don't play
Everyday ima in the lab wit ammunition for the punks

Still pickin around the world, tell the rats from snakes
Dumb stickin around ta see how it ends aye
Livin in Atlanta full of graves n dealin wit allizeh
A holy legend fading the hell away
I met him downtown i should have known tho
Atlanta try to play you in a sick way
Be ready for the set up you gon get played
By every mother f***** that's the broke way
Learned first hand two years wit paid slots
Don't be tryna play the artist workin harder then your pops
From the 50's n 60's respect me or not
Cuz the time within my life is all i got
I took shot. My aim is good
You better watch from the city ta hoods
I'm telling these kids, If you dream then its good n to follow that s***, when you know that you should

Jay back like a tic
I'm buggin, I'm gettin pissed
Working this really hard n nobody see how lit
It's really gonna be the minute we hit a shift
N everybody lookin be patient i'm comin big, wit the steps now
Walkin the road slow I keep cool now, ooh wow
How he spittin venom, I gettin em n never sweat it
Don't forget it, make em get it like a dube cloud
Prouder then a mother f**** spittin all the truth out

Never playing wit the 808's, I don't plan ta get away
Until the day i got to, when it come I'm gonna make way
Pirate wit the life, only tryna make the dope bay
Paddle wit the raft in the tide, ain't a joke aye
We gonna get a bottle gonna chill up in the sand
Got da brother in boat n he goin full throttle
Jay up on the finger tip, baby girls fishin
Please just hear, when you do start bloggin

Aye, lemme slow this up
Lemme say this clear, for the stupid f****
Wit a slow mind, a homie had enough
But ima say this once in case you do respond
If you wanna hear what i gotta say
Wit so many words i can do that
Its only three words, said back ta back
Its 'YOU ARE A B****', so learn to read fast
Had so many years ta learn here
But lemme be clear, you'll burn here
I'm up in the world, its my work yeh
I'm gonna get what i deserve b****
Until ima corpse in the floor near
A bag full of weed buried under a stage wit the mic in my hand
Cuz ill never change, i'm climbin this game its my turn yeh

But when i get attackin, i'm taggin, i'm gonna drag em
When they rappin, when i say its gonna happen, Its gon happen
Ain't no question on the matter, i'm handle all the hatters
Haters
Braggin everyday bein hella instigators on the side be talkin I see the plot, you be hatin on a nigga tryna get up in the spot
N ima get it better watch, n get you mad like ha
Cuz you tryna be like me, man ill see you at the top

Spittin all the cold on the earth for the genocide
Ain't nowhere to go you better hide before the homicide
Promise ima get it cuz im Ready for the punks

368,When I Grow Up,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I grow up, you know what I wanna be?
Take a seat, let me tell you my ridiculous dreams
I wanna rap, yeah, I know it's hard to believe
And I can tell you're already thinkin' I will never succeed
But I'm okay with it, I admit the lyrics are weak
I've been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me, ahh
I know this prolly isn't really realistic
And honestly, I might not ever make a difference
But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it
I've been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician
To see the odds ain't rootin' for me
I can't lie though, it's kinda how I like it to be
The underdog, yeah, you prolly think you know what I mean
But what I'm saying is they ever push me, I'm gonna swing, yeah
I could go to college, get in debt like everybody else
Graduate and prolly get a job that doesn't pay the bills
That don't make a lot of sense to me, forget the Happy Meals
I don't like the dollar menu, I would rather make a meal
Huh? Make a mil'? Nah, I said make a meal
Home-cookin', get the grill, how you want it? Pretty well?
Everything I see is overdone to me, I'm not Adele
But I'ma get a record deal and say hello to mass appeal

[Chorus]
When I grow up, I just want to pay my bills
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
I just want to make a couple mil'
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah)
I just want to sign a record deal
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Oh, yeah)
Might not be the best in my field
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, ayy
When I grow up
Yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
I'ma make 'em notice me, rhymin' like it's poetry
Everything I oversee, I just like to overthink
Mockin' me, you pay the fee, no return and no receipts
Those of you that don't believe, quiet, you don't know a thing
Quiet when I'm tryna sing, quiet when I'm making beats
Quiet when I'm tryna think, sorry, I don't mean to scream
I just feel like no one really gets me and it's sad to see
'Cause someday I'ma grow up and show all of you it's meant to be (Yeah)
Anybody wanna hear me rap? ""No""
Come on, let me play a couple tracks, ""No""
Come on, I can spit it really fast, ""No""
You think I should throw this in the trash? ""No""
Tricked ya; haters, go away before I hit ya
I am not a beggar or a kiss-up
You don't understand? Well, I forgive ya
I am not a quitter, you ain't really think that, did ya?
Maybe someday I could even be up on the radio
Have a tour bus and maybe even play a couple shows
Everybody in the crowd singing every word I wrote
Tellin' me that I am not the only one that feels alone
Huh? You feel alone? Yeah, I kinda feel alone
Wonder if that feelin' ever goes away when you get old
Will I ever make it as an artist? I don't really know
Might not make a lot of dough
I'ma have to try it, though

[Chorus]

369,Eyes On You,"[Verse 1]
We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Verse 2]
Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my)
Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Bridge]
Don't you remember Times Square?
And people counting down everywhere
2000-whatever, no, I didn't care
'Cause baby you were there
And once again, couldn't help but stare

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah, you guessed it, girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

Y lloras hoy porque fallaste

Después que tú me traicionaste
Ahora tengo que alejarme
Busqué la forma de olvidarte

I think you too loyal, you stay, you stay

Uh, I don’t know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level’s no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain’t even bedtime
And don’t you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy
I wonder

Why, oh why? (Oh why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don’t know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
You stay, tell me why you

[Verse 2: Jeremih & DJ Khaled]
I think you're too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl
And that's real
That ain’t the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that
Baby, you can't take that
Hit the gym and get your shape back, oh
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga (Work)
With your mind and your heart and your soul (Let's go)
For your goals, in control, you let it go (Work)
I just want to see you happy
I just want to see you laughing
I just want to see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who really about you
Who gon' see about you
'Cause it's been a while, so baby

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh why? (Oh why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal

[Verse 3: Lil Baby & J Balvin]
You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day he'll grow up and be a man
And lately you been pouring out your heart on the 'Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by the ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision, I'm with it, no asking why
I catch you slipping at all, you gon' be mine (J Balvin, men; ¡wuh!)

377,Omerta,"[Verse]
Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah",Drake,Drake,2019,"[99, 35]",2
378,Summer Days,"[Intro: Patrick Stump]
I got this feeling on a summer day
Knew it when I saw her face
I just thought that she could be the one

[Verse 1: Patrick Stump]
She looks good in the morning
And she don't even know it
I don't want you to go yet
Can we stay in the moment?

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes
When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like
Oh, you look good in the morning
And you don't even know it
I knew that

Knew it when I saw her face

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Sundress with you on my arm
Take the coupe out the garage
Pull the roof back, just me, you, and the stars
Toast to the Gods
She's the one, a masterpiece
She a drug, got a fast release
Got me sprung, wrapped in sheets
Wake up, fuck, and then we going back to sleep

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Uh, me and you on an island
With the ocean color stuck in your iris
We comfortable in silence
But I prefer it when we wilding
Sundress, nothing underneath as we undress (Woo!)
You could look in my eyes, see I'm some mess
Couple of broken people
Trying to complete each other under one breath

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes
When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like
Oh, you look good in the morning
And you don't even know it
I knew that

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
I got this feeling on a summer day
Knew it when I saw her face
I just thought that she could be the one
I got this feeling on a summer day

379,When The Party's Over,"[Verse 1]
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle

Ay

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I was riding ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em
We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em
It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double check the details
Gotta cross my T’s and dot my I’s or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin’ battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild
Look

Look, under no condition would you ever catch me slippin'
Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur driven
If they catch me wit' it, gon' send me off to prison
Judge ain't sympathizin', court don't show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin' out the music
Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans
Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish
Closin' Escrow twice this month, both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know
If it was me, I would tell you, ""Nigga, live your life and grow""
I'd tell you, ""Finish what we started, reach them heights, you know?
And gas the V-12 'til the pipe in smoke""

When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit

Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck
I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck

385,Beautiful Crazy,"[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that ""come get me"" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, ""Let's stay on the couch and watch TV""
And she falls asleep

The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve

We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'

[Verse 3]
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

You listen to the talk
But ain’t nobody ever hear me squawk
All of y'all are quick to hate  but y'all gon’ love me when I finally meet the chalk
Watch what I make

Everything you've ever said about me is about to come undone
Acting like i haven't changed
Four passed and you're stuck in the past and you saying that its me to blame
Damn, i moved 500 miles away
Took my life back from the sauce
Reap what you sow and i came to close to being another corpse

If we all sitting ducks tell me who the fucks picking goose
I will
My days are grey
And i take it out on bae
Cos I'm para that she won't stay
Either way I'm pushing her away
When I wanna hold her close
Im so sorry but even in the best of times we don't have the dough so I don't see the need to toast
Far from a chicken but ima give you roast
Cooking up the heat tho I don't like to boast
If a woman’s place in the kitchen ima make my self at home

Hit it sit back and I'm riding this

Chose not to fuck you over like I didn't know what virgin is
Yet you painted me to be the villain come and tell me to my face what your version is
Im telling you you raped
Every avenue I paved

And I know a yungen that would say the same

That the life's for everyone around me will change

398,Shut Up About Politics,"The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing Sept. 3 to debate the possible authorization of U.S. military action against the Syrian government , featuring testimony by Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

SENATOR ROBERT MENENDEZ (D-NJ): This hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will come to order.

Let me first say that there -- I neither -- actions of approval or disapproval from the audience. We welcome you to be here on this important occasion, but we welcome you to be observers of this important occasion. And the chair will not tolerate actions that are in violation of the committee rules.

Let me welcome Secretary Kerry back to the committee that he chaired; Secretary Hagel, on a committee that he served on; and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dempsey, to the committee.

We convene this hearing as we have convened many before to make one of the most difficult decisions we are asked and tasked to make, the authorization of the use of American military power, this time in Syria, to respond to the horrific chemical attack of August 21st that took the lives of 1,429 Syrians, including at least 426 children. The images of that day are sickening. And in my view, the world cannot ignore the inhumanity and the horror of this act.

I do no take our responsibility to authorize military force lightly or make such decisions easily. I voted against the war in Iraq and strongly have supported a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. But today I support the president's decision to use military force in the face of this horrific crime against humanity. Yes, there are risks to action, but the consequences of inaction are greater and graver still: further humanitarian disaster in Syria, regional instability, the loss of American credibility around the world and an emboldened Iran and North Korea and the disintegration of international law.

This decision will be one of the most difficult any of us will be asked to make, but it is our role as representatives of the American people to make it, to put aside political differences and personal ideologies, to forget partisanship and preconceptions, to forget the polls, the politics and even personal consequences. It is a moment for a profile in courage and to do what one knows is right. It is our responsibility to evaluate the facts, assess the intelligence we have and then debate the wisdom and scope of a military response fully and publicly, understanding its geopolitical ramifications and fully aware of the consequences.

At the end of the day, each of us will decide whether to vote for or against a resolution for military action based on our assessments of the facts and our conscience. The decision rests with us. It is not political. It is a policy decision that must be based, I believe, on what we believe is in the national security interests of the United States.

To be clear, the authorization we will ultimately seek is for focused action, with a clear understanding that American troops will not be on the ground in combat, and the language before us is but a starting point.

The president has decided to ask Congress for our support. Now the eyes of the world are upon us. The decision we make, the resolution we present to the Senate and the votes we take will reverberate around the world. Our friends and allies await our decision, as does the despot in Pyongyang, the ayatollahs of terror in Tehran and terrorist groups wherever they may be.

What we do in the face of the chemical attack by the Assad regime against innocent civilians will send a signal to the world that such weapons, in violation of international law, cannot be used with impunity.

The question is: Will we send a message that the United States will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons anywhere in the world, by anyone, for any reason? Will we, in the name of all that is human and decent, authorize the use of American military power against the inexcusable, indiscriminate and immoral use of chemical weapons? Or will we stand down?

What message do we send the world when such a crime goes unpunished? Will those who have these weapons use them again? Will they use them more widely and kill more children? Will they use them against our allies, against our troops or embassies? Or will they give them or sell them to terrorists who would use them against us here at home?

Are we willing to watch a slaughter just because the patrons of that slaughter are willing to use their veto at the United Nations to allow it to happen so their beneficiary can stay in power? And are we so tired of war we are willing to silence our conscience and accept the consequences that will inevitably flow from the silence -- from that silence to our national interests?

We will hear the arguments and the options presented to us today and we will look at the facts as we know them according to the declassified assessment released last Friday that Secretary Kerry has so passionately presented to the nation. According to that assessment, we know with high confidence from the intelligence community that the Syrian government carried out a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs on August 21st.

We know that the Assad regime stockpiled chemical agents including mustard, sarin, and VX gas and has thousands of munitions capable of delivering them. We know that President Bashar al-Assad makes the decisions when it comes to the regime's stockpile of chemical agents, and that personnel involved in the program are carefully vetted to ensure loyalty to the regime and the security of the program.

We have evidence that chemical weapons have been used on a smaller scale against the opposition on several other occasions in the past year, including in the Damascus suburbs, that sarin gas has been used on some of those occasions, and that it was not the opposition that used it.

We know that chemical weapons personnel from the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, subordinate to the regime's Ministry of Defense, cooperating in the Damascus suburb of Adra, from Sunday, August 18th until early in the morning on Wednesday, August 21st near an area the regime uses to mix chemical weapons, including sarin; and human intelligence as well as signal and geospatial intelligence have shown regime activity in the preparation of chemicals prior to the attacks, including the distribution and use of gas masks. We have multiple streams of intelligence that show the regime launched a rocket attack against the Damascus suburbs in the early hours of August 21st, and satellite corroboration that the attacks were launched from a regime-controlled area and struck neighborhoods where the chemical attacks reportedly occurred, clearly tying the pieces together. That is what we know in terms of who deployed these weapons.

More evidence is available, and we will be looking at all of the classified information in a closed session of the committee tomorrow that more clearly establishes the use of chemical weapons by the regime, the military responses available to us and the results we expect from those responses. But as of now, in my view, there is a preponderance of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Assad's forces willfully targeted civilians with chemical weapons.

Having said that, at the end of the day, the chemical weapons attacks against innocent civilians in Syria is an indirect attack on America's security with broader implications for the region and the world.

If chemical weapons can be used with impunity, in violation of the Geneva protocol crafted by the League of Nations and signed by the United States in 1925, in fact signed by Syria itself in 1968, they can be used without fear of reprisal anywhere by anyone. And in my view, such heinous and immoral violations of decency demand a clear and unambiguous response.

We are at a crossroads moment. A precedent will be set either for the unfettered and unpunished use of chemical weapons or a precedent will be set for the deterrence of the use of such weapons through the limited use of military force that sends a message that the world will not stand down. We will either send a message to Syria, Iran, North Korea, Hezbollah, al-Qaida and any other nonstate actors that the world will not tolerate the senseless use of chemical weapons by anyone, or we will choose to stand silent in the face of horrific human suffering.

We need to consider the consequences of not acting. Our silence would be a message to the ayatollah that America and the world are not serious about stopping their march to acquiring nuclear weapons. Israel would no longer believe that we have their back and would be hard-pressed to restrain itself. Our silence would embolden Kim Jong Un, who has a large chemical weapons cache, and would send a message that we are not serious about protecting South Korea and the region from nuclear or chemical weapons, and would embolden Hezbollah and Hamas to redouble their efforts to acquire chemical weapons, and they might succeed.

Clearly at the end of the day our national security is at stake.

I want to thank our distinguished witnesses, who will present the facts as they know them. We'll evaluate them, debate a resolution, and at the end of the day, each of us will decide whether to send a message to the world that there are lines we cannot cross as civilized human beings or stand silent and risk new threats.

Let me say before I turn to Senator Corker for his opening statement, the president is asking for an authorization for the use of limited force.

It is not his intention or ours to involve ourselves fully in Syria's civil war.

What is before us is a request, and I quote, ""to prevent or deter the use or proliferation of chemical or biological weapons within, to or from Syria and to protect the United States and its allies and partners against the threat posed by such weapons."" This is not a declaration of war but a declaration of our values to the world, a declaration that says we are willing to use our military power when necessary against anyone who dares turn such heinous weapons on innocent civilians anywhere in the world.

We know the facts. We'll hear the arguments. We will have the debate. And then it will be up to each of us to search our conscience and make a decision on behalf of the American people.

I trust that we can achieve that in a bipartisan way. I have been working with Senator Corker as we move towards a resolution that I hope will get broad bipartisan support.

And before I turn to him, I just want to acknowledge the presence -- and we're thrilled to see her here today -- of Teresa Heinz Kerry to join us on this momentous occasion. I'm glad to see you so well and being here with us.

And with that, Senator Corker.

SENATOR ROBERT CORKER (R-TN): Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your comments and the time we've spent together recently, and I want to thank our witnesses for being here, not only for their service to our country in their current capacity but in their service in every way for many, many years. I thank you for being here.

Today you're beginning the formal request of asking each of us to make the most important decision many of us will make during our tenure in the United States Senate. And I know that everybody here on the dais and those who are not take that decision very seriously.

I've noticed a distinct sense of humility as we've gone about the various questions, conference calls, the earlier meetings we've had today and previously this week.

And I know that every member here knows that whether they decide to support an authorization for the use of military force or not, they are making a decision about our country's national interests. And I know that everybody is going to be taking that decision very, very seriously.

One of the issues that many members will have is, the fact is that should we support an authorization for the use of military force -- and I think that everyone here knows that I am very generally inclined to do so and am working closely with Senator Menendez for something that will be a starting point for this committee's discussions -- and I know each member will have its imprint on what it is that we end up deciding to vote upon.

But one of the problems that members have -- and I think this hearing and tomorrow's hearing is important to answer -- is, while we make policy, you implement. And the implementation of this is very, very important. And I think there have been mixed signals about what that implementation actually is going to mean and the effect it's going to have on the country that we're involved in.

I want to say that I was just in the region, as I know many people have been, and I am still totally dismayed at the lack of support we are giving to the vetted moderate opposition. We publicly stated what that support is going to be even though it's being carried out in a covert way. But it is, to some degree, humiliating to be in a refugee when our policy has been that we are going to train, we're going to equip, we're going to give humanitarian aid to the vetted opposition, and yet, when you sit down with the people we're coalescing around, like General Idris and others, very little of that has occurred.

So I know today's focus is going to be largely on the issue of chemical warfare. And I know that the case has to be made. And I know that each of us have had the opportunity to hear that case, to see intelligence, to understand on what basis these claims have been made. And my guess is that most everyone here fully believes that chemical weapons have been used on civilians to a large degree.

So I know that case is going to be made to the American people today as you're making it to us, but it's my hope that a big part of what you're going to do here today -- and I know we talked about this earlier this morning at the White House -- but is to make a case as to why Syria is important to our national interests, why Syria matters to the region, why it's important for us to carry out the stated strategy and how we're going to continue to carry out that stated strategy.

One of the things that I do not want to see in this authorization is after -- if it's authorized and force takes place, I want to see us to -- I want to see us continue to carry out the strategy that has been stated, and that is building the capacity of the vetted moderate opposition. So I'd like to have you address that. I'd like to have you today also address how this use of military force supports that strategy, how it's going to affect the region in the aftermath.

So I thank you for being here today. I know a big part of what we're discerning today and what we're making decisions upon is the credibility of the United States of America.

I know that people in the region are watching. I know that we've been hesitant to move on with many of the activities that we've stated we're going to be carrying out. So today, I hope that each of you will bring clarity to this. I know we're going to talk about chemical warfare, but I hope you'll give us even more clarity about our opposition strengthening, about how this is going to affect us overall. And I hope we'll all leave here today with a clear understanding of how this strategy is going to be carried out.

I thank you, and I look forward to your testimony.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Secretary Kerry.

SECRETARY JOHN KERRY: Well, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, Ranking Member Corker, thank you very, very much for having us here today. We look forward to this opportunity to be able to share with you President Obama's vision with respect to not just this action, but as Senator Corker has inquired appropriately about Syria itself and the course of action in the Middle East.

Mr. Chairman, thank you for welcoming Teresa. This is her first public event since early July, so we're all happy she's here.

As we convene for this debate, it's not an exaggeration to say to you, all of you, my former colleagues, that the world is watching not just to see what we decide, but it's watching to see how we make this decision, whether in a dangerous world we can still make our government speak with one voice. They want to know if America will rise to this moment and make a difference.

And the question of whether to authorize our nation to take military action is -- as you have said, Mr. Chairman, and you've echoed Mr. Ranking Member -- this is obviously one of the most important decisions, one of the most important responsibilities of this committee or of any senator in the course of a career.

The president and the administration appreciate that you have returned quickly to the nation's capital to address it and that you are appropriately beginning a process of focusing with great care and great precision, which is the only way to approach the potential use of military power.

Ranking Member Corker, I know that you want to discuss, as you said, why Syria matters to our national security and our strategic interests beyond the compelling humanitarian reasons, and I look forward with Secretary Hagel and General Dempsey to laying that out here this afternoon.

But first, it is important to explain to the American people why we're here. It's important for people who may not have caught every component of the news over the course of the Labor Day weekend to join us, all of us, in focusing in on what is at stake here. That's why the president of the United States made the decision, as he did, contrary to what many people thought he would do, of asking the Congress to join in this decision. We are stronger as a nation when we do that.

So we're here because against multiple warnings from the president of the United States, from the Congress, from our friends and allies around the world and even from Russia and Iran, the Assad regime, and only, undeniably, the Assad regime, unleashed an outrageous chemical attack against its own citizens.

We're here because a dictator and his family's personal enterprise, in their lust to hold on to power, were willing to infect the air of Damascus with a poison that killed innocent mothers and fathers and hundreds of their children, their lives all snuffed out by gas in the early morning of August 21st.

Now, some people here and there, amazingly, have questioned the evidence of this assault on conscience. I repeat here again today that only the most willful desire to avoid reality can assert that this did not occur as described or that the regime did not do it. It did happen, and the Assad regime did it.

Now, I remember Iraq. Secretary Hagel remembers Iraq. General Dempsey especially remembers Iraq. But Secretary Hagel and I and many of you sitting on the dais remember Iraq in a special way because we were here for that vote. We voted. And so we are especially sensitive, Chuck and I, to never again asking any member of Congress to take a vote on faulty intelligence.

And that is why our intelligence community has scrubbed and rescrubbed the evidence. We have declassified unprecedented amounts of information, and we ask the American people and the rest of the world to judge that information.

We can tell you beyond any reasonable doubt that our evidence proves the Assad regime prepared for this attack, issued instructions to prepare for this attack, warned its own forces to use gas masks; that we have physical evidence of where the rockets came from and when.

Not one rocket landed in regime-controlled territory -- not one. All of them landed in opposition-controlled or contested territory. We have a map -- physical evidence -- showing every geographical point of impact. And that is concrete.

Within minutes of the attack -- 90, I think, to be precise, maybe slightly shorter -- the social media exploded with horrific images of the damage that had been caused -- men and women, the elderly and children sprawled on a hospital floor with no wounds, no blood, but all dead. Those scenes of human chaos and desperation were not contrived. They were real. No one could contrive such a scene.

We are certain that none of the opposition has the weapons or capacity to effect a strike of this scale, particularly from the heart of regime territory. Just think about it in logical terms, common sense. With high confidence, our intelligence community tells us that after the strike the regime issued orders to stop and then fretted openly, we know, about the possibility of U.N. inspectors discovering evidence.

So then they began to systematically try to destroy it, contrary to my discussion with their foreign minister who said we have nothing to hide. I said, if you have nothing to hide then let the inspectors in today and let it be unrestricted. It wasn't. They didn't. It took four days of shelling before they finally allowed them in under a constrained pre-arranged structure. And we now have learned that the hair and blood samples from first responders in east Damascus has tested positive for signatures of sarin.

So my colleagues, we know what happened. For all the lawyers, for all the former prosecutors, for all those who have sat on a jury, I can tell you that we know these things beyond the reasonable doubt that is the standard by which we send people to jail for the rest of their lives.

So we're here because of what happened two weeks ago. But we're also here because of what happened nearly a century ago, in the darkest moments of World War I and after the horror of gas warfare, when the vast majority of the world came together to declare in no uncertain terms that chemical weapons crossed a line of conscience, and they must be banned from use forever. Over the years that followed, over 180 countries, including Iran, Iraq and Russia, agreed, and they joined the Chemical Weapons Convention. Even countries with whom we agree on little agreed on that conviction.

Now, some have tried to suggest that the debate we're having today is about President Obama's red line. I could not more forcefully state that is just plain and simply wrong. This debate is about the world's red line. It's about humanity's red line. And it's a red line that anyone with a conscience ought to draw.

This debate is also about Congress' own red line. You, the United States Congress, agreed to the Chemical Weapons Convention. You, the United States Congress, passed the Syria Accountability Act, which says Syria's chemical weapons are -- quote, ""threaten the security of the Middle East and the national security interests of the United States.""

You, the Congress, have spoken out about grave consequences if Assad in particular used chemical weapons. So I say to you, Senator Corker, that is one of the reasons why Syria is important.

And as we debate and the world watches as you decide and the world wonders not whether Assad's regime executed the worst chemical weapons attack of the 21st century -- that fact I think is now beyond question -- the world wonders whether the United States of America will consent through silence to standing aside while this kind of brutality is allowed to happen without consequence.

In the nearly 100 years since the first global commitment against chemical weapons, only two tyrants dared to cross the world's brightest (line ?). Now Bashar al-Assad has become the third, and I think all of you know that history holds nothing but infamy for those criminals, and history reserves also very little sympathy for their enablers.

So the reality is the gravity of this moment. That is the importance of the decision that this Congress faces and that the world is waiting to learn about in these next days.

Now, Ranking Member Corker asked a central question: Why should Americans care, beyond what I just said, which ought to be enough in the judgment of the president and this administration?

Well, it is clear that in addition to what I just mentioned about the Syria Accountability Act and the threat to the Middle East, we cannot overlook the impact of chemical weapons and the danger that they pose to a particular volatile area of the world in which we've been deeply invested for years because we have great friends there.

We have allies there. We have deep interests there. Since President Obama's policy is that Assad must go, it is not insignificant that to deprive him of the capacity to use chemical weapons, or to degrade the capacity to use those chemical weapons, actually deprives him of a lethal weapon in this ongoing civil war, and that has an impact. That can help to stabilize the region, ultimately.

In addition, we have other important strategic national security interests, not just in the prevention of the proliferation of chemical weapons but to avoid the creation of a safe haven in Syria or a base of operations for extremists to use these weapons against our friends. All of us know that the extremes of both sides are there waiting in the wings, working and pushing and fighting. They'd be desperate to get their hands on these materials. And the fact is that if nothing happens to begin to change the equation or the current calculation, that area can become even more so an area of ungoverned space where those extremists threaten even the United States, and more immediately, if they get their hands on those weapons, allies and friends of ours, like Jordan, or Israel, or Lebanon or others.

Forcing Assad to change his calculation about his ability to act with impunity can contribute to his realization that he cannot gas or shoot his way out of his predicament.

And as I think you know, it has been the president's primary goal to achieve a negotiated resolution. But you've got to have parties prepared to negotiate to achieve that.

Syria is also important because, quite simply -- I can't put this to you more plainly than to just ask each of you to ask yourselves: If you're Assad, or if you're any one of the other despots in that region, and the United States steps back from this moment, together with our other allies and friends, what is the message? The message is that he has been granted impunity -- the freedom to choose to use the weapons again or force us to go through this cycle again with who knows what outcome after once refusing it. We would have granted him the capacity to use these weapons against more people with greater levels of damage, because we would have stood and stepped away.

As confidently as we know what happened in Damascus, my friends, on August 21st, we know that Assad would read our stepping away or our silence as an invitation to use those weapons with impunity. And in creating impunity, we would be creating opportunity -- the opportunity for other dictators and/or terrorists to pursue their own weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons.

I will tell you, there are some people hoping that the United States Congress doesn't vote for this very limited request the president has put before you. Iran is hoping you look the other way. Our inaction would surely give them a permission slip for them to at least misinterpret our intention if not to put it to the test. Hezbollah is hoping that isolationism will prevail.

North Korea is hoping that ambivalence carries the day. They are all listening for our silence. And if we don't answer Assad today, we will erode a standard that has existed for those hundred years. In fact, we will erode a standard that has protected our own troops in war, and we will invite even more dangerous tests down the road.

Our allies and our partners are also counting on us in this situation. The people of Israel, of Jordan, of Turkey, each look next door, and they see that they're one stiff breeze away from the potential of being hurt, their civilians being killed as a consequences of choices Assad might take in the absence of action. They anxiously await our assurance that our word means something. They await the assurance that if the children lined up in unbloodied burial shrouds were their own children that we would keep the world's promise. That's what they're hoping.

So the authorization that President Obama seeks is definitively in our national security interest. We need to send to Syria and to the world, to dictators and to terrorists, to allies and to civilians alike the unmistakable message that when the United States of America and the world say, never again, we don't mean sometimes; we don't mean somewhere; never means never.

So this is a vote for accountability. Norms and laws that keep the civilized world civil mean nothing if they're not enforced. As Justice Jackson said in his opening argument at the Nuremburg trials, the ultimate step in avoiding periodic wars, which are inevitable in a system of international lawlessness, is to make statesmen responsible to the law.

If the world's worst despots see that they can flout with impunity prohibitions against the world's worst weapons, then those prohibitions are just pieces of paper. That is what we mean by accountability and that is what we mean by we cannot be silent.

So let me be clear: President Obama is not asking America to go to war. And I say that sitting next to two men -- Secretary Hagel and Chairman Dempsey -- who know what war is. Senator McCain knows what war is. They know the difference between going to war and what President Obama is requesting now. We all agree, there will be no American boots on the ground.

The president has made crystal clear, we have no intention of assuming responsibility for Syria's civil war. He is asking only for the power to make clear, to make certain that the United States means what we say, that the world, when we join together in a multilateral statement, mean what we say. He's asking for authorization to degrade and deter Bashar al-Assad's capacity to use chemical weapons.

Now, some will undoubtedly ask, and I think appropriately, what about the unintended consequences of action? Some fear a retaliation that leads to a larger conflict. Well, let me put it bluntly: If Assad is arrogant enough, and I would say foolish enough, to retaliate to the consequences of his own criminal activity, the United States and our allies have ample ways to make him regret that decision without going to war.

Even Assad's supporters, Russia and Iran, say publicly that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable.

Now, some will also question the extent of our responsibility; to them, I say when someone kills hundreds of children with a weapon the world has banned, we are all responsible. That is true because of treaties like the Geneva Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention and for us, the Syria Accountability Act. But it's also true because we share a common humanity and a common decency.

This is not the time for armchair isolationism. This is not the time to be spectators to slaughter. Neither our country nor our conscience could afford the cost of silence. We have spoken up against unspeakable horror many times in the past; now, we must stand up and act. And we must protect our security, protect our values and lead the world with conviction that is clear about our responsibility.

Thank you.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary --

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Secretary -- (off mic) -- there are people today who don't -- (off mic) --

SEN. MENENDEZ: (Sounds gavel.) The committee will be in order.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: -- people who said -- (off mic) -- go to war.

SEN. MENENDEZ: The committee will be in order.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: We don't want another war.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Could I ask the police to restore order?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic) -- nobody wants this (war ?) -- (inaudible) -- is because of war. The American people did not want this. Secretary -- (off mic) --

SEN. MENENDEZ: Secretary Hagel.

SEC. KERRY: Can I just say, before I -- (inaudible) -- you know the first time I testified before this committee, when I was 27 years old, I had feelings very similar to that protester.

And I would just say that is exactly why it is so important that we are all here having this debate, talking about these things before the country and that the Congress itself will act representing the American people. And I think we all can respect those who have a different point of view, and we do.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Secretary Hagel.

SECRETARY CHARLES HAGEL: Mr. Chairman, thank you. Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Corker, members of the committee, as we all know, in the coming days Congress will debate how to respond to the most recent chemical weapons attack in Syria, a large-scale sarin gas assault perpetrated by the Syrian government against its own people.

As a former senator and member of this committee, I welcome this debate, and I strongly support President Obama's decision to seek congressional authorization for the use of force in Syria.

As each of us knows, committing the country to using military force is the most difficult decision America's leaders can make, as Ranking Member Corker noted. All of those who are privileged to serve our nation have a responsibility to ask tough questions before that commitment is made. The American people must be assured that their leaders are acting according to U.S. national interests, with well- defined military objectives, with an understanding of the risks and consequences involved.

The president, along with his entire national security team, asked those tough questions before we concluded that the United States should take military action against Syria because of what the Assad regime has done.

I want to address how we reached this decision by clarifying the U.S. interests at stake, our military objectives, and the risks of not acting at this critical juncture.

As President Obama said, the use of chemical weapons in Syria is not only an assault on humanity, it is a serious threat to America's national security interests and those of our closest allies. The Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons poses grave risks to our friends and partners along Syria's borders, including Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq.

If Assad is prepared to use chemical weapons against his own people, we have to be concerned that terrorist groups like Hezbollah, which has forces in Syria supporting the Assad regime, would acquire them and would use them. That risk of chemical weapons proliferation poses a direct threat to our friends, our partners and to U.S. personnel in the region. We cannot afford for Hezbollah or any terrorist group determined to strike the United States to have incentives to acquire or use chemical weapons.

The Syrian regime's actions risk eroding the nearly century-old international norm against the use of chemical weapons, which Secretary Kerry has noted, a norm that has helped protect -- helped protect the United States homeland and American forces operating across the globe from those terrible weapons. Weakening this norm would embolden other regimes to acquire or use chemical weapons.

For example, North Korea maintains a massive stockpile of chemical weapons that threatens our treaty ally the Republic of Korea and the 28,000 U.S. troops stationed there. I've just returned from Asia, where I had a very serious and long conversation with South Korea's defense minister about the threat, the real threat that North Korea's stockpile of chemical weapons presents to them.

Our allies throughout the world must be assured that the United States will fulfill its security commitments.

Given these threats to our national security, the United States must demonstrate through our actions that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable. The President has made clear that our military objectives in Syria would be to hold the Assad regime accountable, degrade its ability to carry out these kinds of attacks, and deter the regime from further use of chemical weapons.

The Department of Defense has developed military options to achieve these objectives. And we have positioned U.S. assets throughout the region to successfully execute this mission. We believe we can achieve them with a military action that would be limited in duration and scope. General Dempsey and I have assured the President that U.S. forces will be ready to act whenever the President gives the order.

We are also working with our allies and our partners in this effort. Key partners, including France, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and friends in the region have assured us of their strong support of U.S. action. In defining our military objectives, we made clear that we are not seeking to resolve the underlying conflict in Syria through direct military force. Instead we are contemplating actions that are tailored to respond to the use of chemical weapons.

A political solution created by the Syrian people is the only way to ultimately end the violence in Syria. And Secretary Kerry is leading international efforts to help the parties in Syria move toward a negotiated transition, a transition that means a free and inclusive Syria.

We're also committed to doing more to assist the Syrian opposition. But Assad must be held accountable for using these weapons in defiance of the international community.

Having defined America's interests and our military objectives, we also must examine the risks and the consequences of action as well as the consequences of inaction. There are always risks in taking action. The Assad regime under increasing pressure by the Syrian opposition could feel empowered to carry out even more devastating chemical weapons attacks without a response. Chemical weapons make no distinction between combatants and innocent civilians and inflict the worst kind of indiscriminate suffering as we have recently seen. Our refusal to act would undermine the credibility of America's other security commitments, including the president's commitment to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The word of the United States must mean something. It is vital currency in foreign relations and international and allied commitments.

Every witness here today -- Secretary Kerry, General Dempsey and myself -- have served in uniform, fought in war and seen its ugly realities up close -- as has already been noted, Senator McCain. We understand that a country faces few decisions as grave as using military force. We are not unaware of the costs and ravages of war.

But we also understand that America must protect its people and its national interests. That is our highest responsibility.

All of us who had the privilege and responsibility of serving this great nation owe the American people, and especially those wearing the uniform of our country, a vigorous debate on how America should respond to this horrific chemical weapons attack in Syria. I know everyone on this committee agrees and takes their responsibility of office just as seriously as the president and everyone sitting at this table.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Thank you, Secretary Hagel. And I know that General Dempsey is available to answer questions from the members of the committee. And in that regard, let me start off by urging members tomorrow there will be a(n) intelligence briefing for the committee on both the issues at hand as well as potential military actions. So in this setting, we obviously are somewhat constrained about what we might discuss with greater specificity tomorrow.

Mr. Secretary, you make and have made a compelling case. And I think it's important, and I appreciate you reiterating the high degree of confidence that exists in our intelligence assessments. I think those are the conditions precedent to be able to move forward.

This weekend, I was at a soccer tournament, and I had a group of moms come up to me and say, Senator, we saw those pictures. They're horrific. We can't imagine the devastation those parents must feel about their children. But why us? Why us? And so I ask you, would you tell them that we would be more secure or less secure by the actions that are being considered for which the president has asked for the authorization of the use of force?

SEC. KERRY: Well, Senator I would say unequivocally that the president's actions will make us more secure, less likely that Assad can use his weapons or chooses to use his weapons, and the absence of taking the action the president has asked for will, in fact, be far more threatening and dangerous and potentially ultimately cost lives.

SEN. MENENDEZ: And do you consider the consequences of inaction greater than the consequences of action?

SEC. KERRY: I do.

SEN. MENENDEZ: General Dempsey, what do we envision, in broad terms, this potential military campaign to be in terms of its effect? What do we expect at the end of any authorized action to see the results look like? What is our expectation?

GEN. DEMPSEY: Yes, thank you, chairman. The task I've been given is to develop military options to deter -- that is to say, change the regime's calculus about the use of chemical weapons and degrade his ability to do so -- that is to say, both activities directly related to chemical weapons themselves, but also potentially the means of employing them -- and anything further than that I would prefer to speak about in a classified setting.

SEN. MENENDEZ: I understand that. Let me ask you this: In the process of achieving those two goals that you just outlined, would there not be a collateral consequence to the regime of further degrading its overall capabilities?

GEN. DEMPSEY: Yes.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Mr. Secretary, we received from the administration a proposed resolution for the authorization of force, and of course that is a negotiation between the Congress and the administration.

Would you tell us whether you believe that a prohibition for having American boots on the ground -- is that something that the administration would accept as part of a resolution?

SEC. KERRY: Mr. Chairman, it would be preferable not to, not because there is any intention or any plan or any desire whatsoever to have boots on the ground. And I think the president will give you every assurance in the world, as am I, as has the secretary of defense and the chairman. But in the event Syria imploded, for instance, or in the event there was a threat of a chemical weapons cache falling into the hands of al-Nusra or someone else and it was clearly in the interest of our allies and all of us, the British, the French and others, to prevent those weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of the worst elements, I don't want to take off the table an option that might or might not be available to a president of the United States to secure our country. So that was the only kind of example, that's the only thing I can think of that would immediately leap to mind to say, you know --

SEN. MENENDEZ: Well, if we -- if we said that there'd be no troops on the ground for combat purposes, that clearly would, I assume --

SEC. KERRY: Well, assuming that in the going to protect those weapons, whether or not they had to, you know, answer a shot in order to be secure -- I don't want to speak to that. The bottom line is this -- can I give you the bottom line?

SEN. MENENDEZ: We're going to have to -- we're going to have to -- we're going to have to work to -- (inaudible) --

SEC. KERRY: I'm absolutely confident, Mr. Chairman, that it is easy, not that complicated, to work out language that will satisfy the Congress and the American people that there's no door open here through which someone can march in ways that the Congress doesn't want it to while still protecting the national security interests of the country.

I'm confident that can be worked out.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Well, I --

SEC. KERRY: The bottom line is, the president has no intention and will not, and we do not want to, put American troops on the ground to fight this -- or be involved in the fighting of this civil war, period.

SEN. MENENDEZ: I appreciate that. And I appreciate the response about chemical weapons and the possibility of securing them in our national security interests as well our allies', but I do think we're going to have to work on language that makes it clear that this is an overriding issue that I thing that members as well as the American people want to know.

Let me -- let me ask you, what -- you mentioned it in your remarks -- what do you think is the calculus of Iran, North Korea, if we fail to act, and what is the calculus of our allies if we fail to act?

SEC. KERRY: Well, if we fail to act, we're going to have fewer allies. I mean, we're going to have fewer people who count on us, certainly in the region.

We have -- we have huge doubts right now. I hear them. I mean, you know, I have the privilege of talking with many of the leaders of these countries with respect to what they may or may not be inclined to do. I've heard their warnings very clearly about what is at stake, not just for them but for us in the region. And I think that it's fair to say that our interests would be seriously set back in many respects if we are viewed as not capable, or willing, most important, to follow through on the things that we say matter to us.

As I said earlier in my testimony, this really is not President Obama's red line. The president drew a line that anyone should draw with respect to this convention that we have signed up to and which has been in place since the horrors of World War I.

And the truth is that through all of World War II, through Vietnam, through Korea, through both Gulf Wars, through Afghanistan, through Iraq, the combatants in those efforts have never resorted to this use. So I think that it's clear, with those two prior usages that I referred to, that we would be opening Pandora's box with respect to a whole set of dangerous consequences as a result of the United States not keeping its word. And it would make our life very, very difficult with respect to North Korea and Iran.

There's no question in my mind that those countries are watching. The mullahs and many others are watching what we are doing now with great interest. And that's why even the quality of this debate and the nature of this debate are very important.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Thank you. Senator Corker.

SEN. CORKER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And again, thank you for your testimony.

I want to first thank you for bringing this to Congress. I think our foreign policy through the years has been far too focused on the administration. I don't think Congress has played the role that it should play in foreign policy. And I want to thank you for bringing it hear and giving us the opportunity to have this debate in advance.

I want to focus a little bit on our strategy with the vetted opposition. I don't know how anybody -- matter of fact, I know of no one who's been to the area and spent time with opposition that isn't incredibly dismayed at the lack of progress that is occurring there.

I know there's a lot of capacity that has to be built. I know there are interagency discussions about whether we should move to industrial-strength training, move away from the kind of activities that are taking place now to build capacity more quickly.

And I just would like for whichever one of you wants to respond to talk with us, those of us who have been to the region, who do believe that Syria is important, who are watching what is happening in Iraq as this sectarian issue moves over to there, it's moving into Lebanon, it's moving -- certainly destabilizing Jordan -- why have we been so slow, so inept in so many ways at helping build capacity of this opposition that we have said publicly that we support?

SEC. KERRY: Well, Senator, it's a -- it's a worthy and important question. I have had a number of different meetings with the opposition over the course of the months now since I came in in February, beginning with a meeting in Rome and subsequently, in Istanbul and in Amman, Jordan. And the opposition -- one has to remember that as little as a year ago, there was no great clarity to the structure of that opposition or to who they were, and they certainly had had no experience in this kind of an endeavor.

Over the course of that year, they have evolved, I would say, significantly. Are they where they need to be? Not completely. But they have changed markedly over the course of the last few months.

At our insistence -- and when I say ""our"" insistence --- the insistence of all of their supporters, the so-called London 11 -- they reached out and expanded significantly their base within Syria. They elected new leadership. They brought in a much broader base of Syria representation, including women, including minorities, Christians, others. And so they've built up a much more competent leadership -- (inaudible).

SEN. CORKER: If I could -- I've only got a few minutes.

SEC. KERRY: OK.

SEN. CORKER: I am very aware of all those things.

SEC. KERRY: (Inaudible) --

SEN. CORKER: What I'm unaware of is why it is so slow in actually helping them with lethal support -- why has that been so slow?

SEC. KERRY: I think -- I think, Senator, we need to have that discussion tomorrow in classified session. We can talk about some components of that. Suffice it to say, I want to General Dempsey to speak to this, maybe Secretary Hagel. That is increasing significantly. It has increased in its competency. I think it's made leaps and bounds over the course of the last few months.

Secretary Hagel, do you -- or General, do you want to --

SEN. HAGEL: I would only add that it was June of this year that the president made a decision to support lethal assistance to the opposition, as you all know. We have been very supportive with hundreds of millions of dollars of nonlethal assistance. The vetting process, as Secretary Kerry noted, has been significant. But -- I'll ask General Dempsey if he wants to add anything -- but we, Department of Defense, have not been directly involved in this. This is, as you know, a covert action, and as Secretary Kerry noted, probably to go into much more detail would require a closed or classified hearing.

General Dempsey?

SEN. CORKER: As he's answering that, and if you could be fairly brief, is there anything about the authorization that you're asking that in any way takes away from our stated strategy of empowering the vetted opposition to have the capacity over time to join in with a transition government, as we have stated from the beginning?

Is there anything about this authorization that in any way supplements that?

GEN. DEMPSEY: To your question about the opposition, moderate opposition, the path to the resolution of the Syrian conflict is through a developed, capable, moderate opposition. And we know how to do that.

Secondly, there's nothing in this resolution that would limit what we're doing now, but we're very focused on the response to the chemical weapons. I think that subsequent to that, we would probably return to have a discussion about what we might do with the moderate opposition in a -- in a more overt way.

SEN. CORKER: So, you know, I'm very sympathetic to the issue of chemical warfare and very sympathetic to what this means to U.S. credibility, and I'm very sympathetic to the fact that people are watching in the region and this'll have an impact. But I want to say I am not sympathetic regarding the lack of effort that is taking place, in my opinion, on the ground as it relates to the vetted opposition. And I hope the end state that you imagine here is something that, while it will be proportional and will be surgical, is something that enhances the strategy that we've already laid in place. And I hope you'll answer that, yes or no, at this time.

GEN. DEMPSEY: The answer to whether I support additional support for the moderate opposition is yes.

SEN. CORKER: And this authorization will support those activities in addition to responding to the weapons of mass destruction.

GEN. DEMPSEY: I don't know how the resolution will evolve, but I support --

SEN. CORKER: But what you're seeking -- what is it you're seeking?

GEN. DEMPSEY: I can't answer that, what we're seeking.

SEC. KERRY: The action, if it is authorized, the answer is, as I said in my opening comments, that the consequence of degrading his chemical capacity inevitably will also have downstream impact on his military capacity.

SEN. CORKER: And is this only -- this authorization is only about weapons of mass destruction?

SEC. KERRY: That is correct. This authorization is a limited, targeted effort to focus on deterring and degrading the chemical weapons capacity of the Assad regime.

SEN. CORKER: Is it against any other enemies other than the Assad regime?

SEC. KERRY: I -- no, Senator.

SEN. CORKER: Is it to be utilized in any other country except inside Syria?

SEC. KERRY: No, Senator.

SEN. CORKER: I will say that -- in response to your answer to Senator Menendez, I didn't find that a very appropriate response regarding boots on the ground. And I do want to say that -- that that's an important element to me, and I hope that as we together work through this, we work through something that's much clearer than the answer that you gave. I don't think, while we're all -- we all feel the actions by the Assad regime are reprehensible, I don't think there are any of us here that are willing to support the possibility of having combat boots on the ground.

SEC. KERRY: Well --

SEN. CORKER: And I do hope as we move through this, the administration can be very clear in that regard.

SEC. KERRY: Well, let me be very clear now because I don't want anything coming out of this hearing that leaves any door open to any possibility. So let's shut that door now as tight as we can. All I did was raise a hypothetical question about some possibility -- and I'm thinking out loud -- about how to protect America's interests. But if you want to know whether there's any -- you know, the answer is, whatever prohibition clarifies it to Congress and the American people, there will not be American boots on the ground with respect to the civil war.

SEN. CORKER: Thank you.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Thank you. Senator Boxer.

SENATOR BARBARA BOXER (D-CA): Mr. Chairman and Senator Corker, thank you so much for holding this hearing on a vote of conscience. And I ask unanimous consent that my full statement be entered into the record.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Without objection.

SEN. BOXER: So I'm going to make a brief statement because a lot of people have been asking me -- including my own constituents -- on how I view this. And then I will ask some questions about the intel if I can.

Mr. Chairman, thank you for showing us those images of children because even though it's really hard to look at we have to look at it. Children gasping for air, young bodies lined up in a row should shock the world. And the failure to act, I think, gives license to the Syrian president to use these weapons again and it sends a terrible signal to other brutal regimes, like North Korea.

And can I thank you, Secretary Hagel, for bringing up the issue of North Korea in your opening statement -- and Secretary Kerry for your bringing it up. I mean, how many of us have been there through the lines where we see thousands of our troops standing there just a stone's throw away from North Korea? We need to think about it. Maybe because I'm from California I tend to look at Asia, but this is very serious. We've seen that danger up close when we go to that line.

Now, since I came to the Senate I voted against the Iraq War, but I did vote for the use of force against Osama bin Laden. I voted to support air strikes against Serbia, but I vocally opposed the military surge in Afghanistan. So I approach the Syria issue in the same way I approached those -- with a very heavy heart and a very independent mind.

I've heard some of my colleagues compare President Obama's position on Syria to the decision to invade Iraq in 2003, and I thank Secretary Kerry for discussing this because I believe it's a totally false comparison.

And I know it's been mentioned before. You drew that line again. In Iraq, the Bush administration prepared to invade and occupy a country with well over a hundred thousand troops. In this case, the president's been clear: no ground invasion, no occupation. We'll have that in our resolution.

So why should we take any targeted action against Syria? Not only is it important to keep North Korea in mind, but also allowing the continued use of chemical weapons to go unanswered makes it much more likely that we'll see it used again in Syria and we'll see it used maybe elsewhere, and terrorists could obtain those and use them on America or our allies or our troops -- use them, for example, against Israel and other friends. It makes it more likely.

And this is key: that Iran will view us as a paper tiger, when it comes to their nuclear program, and that is dangerous not only for us and our friends but for the world.

Now, in 1997 the Senate supported a ban on chemical weapons by a vote of 74-26. Shouldn't an overwhelming vote like that mean something? Shouldn't the Senate stand behind its words and actions?

And then in '03, we passed the Syria Accountability Act by a vote of 89-4. I wrote that bill with Senator Santorum. We had a huge vote in favor of it. This is what it says: Acquisitions of weapons of mass destruction threaten the security of the Middle East and the national security of the United States.

Shouldn't an overwhelming vote like that mean something? Shouldn't the Senate stand behind its words and its actions?

So I believe -- as Secretary Kerry said, and so I'll reiterate it -- that not only has our president drawn a line, a red line, on the use of chemical weapons, and not only has the world done so, but we in the Senate, we did so.

Now, I know this tremendous reluctance to get involved in another military effort, and sometimes, the easiest thing to do is to walk away. Well, I believe we cannot close our eyes to this clear violation of long-standing international norms. I believe America's morality, America's reputation and America's credibility are on the line.

I applaud this administration and our president for coming to Congress. I applaud those who asked him to come to Congress. It's the right thing to do. And I will support a targeted effort, but not a blank check, to respond to Syria's unspeakable deeds to gas its own people to death.

Now, my question involves the intel here, and I don't know how much you can give us, so I'm going to try to make this pretty broad so you can answer it and whoever feels most comfortable. A lot of people are fearful, because of what happened in Iraq, that there might be some disagreement between the intel agencies. And we have a lot of intelligence agencies, 17 in all, all over the place. I don't know how many were involved in this, whether it was four or six or eight, I don't know whether you can disclose that.

But my question is, was there any argument about this fact that they agree, that there's high confidence that these weapons were used by the Assad regime?

Was there any debate -- I mean, there was debate -- was there any dissension between the various agencies?

SEC. KERRY: The intelligence community, represented by DNI Clapper, has released a public document, unclassified, available for all to see in which they make their judgment with high confidence that the facts are as they have set forth. So you know, I think that speaks for itself.

SEN. BOXER: Well, I'm going to press just a little bit harder here, John, but, Mr. Secretary, if I can. Out of all the different agencies -- because I remember in Iraq -- sure, eventually, the word came down; everyone agreed. But then we found out there was disagreement.

To your knowledge, did they all come to the same conclusion -- the various intelligence agencies?

SEC. KERRY: To my knowledge, I have no knowledge of any agency that was a dissenter or anybody who had, you know, an alternative theory. And I do know -- I think it's safe to say that they had a whole team that ran a scenario to try to test their theory to see if there was any possibility they could come up with an alternative view as to who might have done it, and the answer is, they could not.

SEN. BOXER: OK, last question on intel and Russia. I read -- and I didn't know if this is true or false, but I read in one of the publications today that members of the Russian parliament were going to come here to lobby colleagues here to tell colleagues here that there is no such intelligence, that there is no proof. I myself met with the Russian ambassador several times on this matter, and I knew right away -- a long time ago -- they were going to do nothing to help us.

But what are they clinging to here? What -- how could they make that case given what you said?

SEC. KERRY: I -- honestly, I don't know. I mean, there's no way for me to hang on hat on what it is. I think that -- I've had personal conversations with the foreign minister. They make an argument to some effect that we don't have evidence and that the opposition did it. No matter what you show, that's the argument they take. Now, as to why they do that or what the rationale is, I'm not going to speculate. The president, as you know, is leaving this evening to go to St. Petersburg for the summit. He will have ample opportunity to hear firsthand from President Putin, and I'm confident they'll have a discussion about it.

SEN. BOXER: Thank you.

SEC. KERRY (?): Thanks.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Senator Risch.

SENATOR JIM RISCH (R-ID): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

SEC. KERRY: Could I just say -- I want to add, though, our Russian -- you know, the Russians -- I think it's important for us not to get into an unnecessary sort of struggle over some of his with the Russian for -- there are a lot of reasons. The Russians are working with us and cooperating on this effort to try to make a negotiated process work. And I think they're serious about trying to find a way forward with that, number one. Number two, on major issues, like START, North Korea, Iran, the Russians are cooperating. So I think, you know, we have to sort of deal with this thoughtfully, and let's hope the summit might produce some change of heart as the president makes the evidence available to President Putin.

SEN. BOXER: Thank you.

SEN. RISCH: Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me say that I've seen the pictures of what happened, and I've been seeing pictures for 14 months or more, two years, I guess, of what's going on over there, and you can't have an ounce of compassion in you and not be moved tremendously by what's happening there.

It's awful. It's horrendous. There's been almost a hundred thousand people killed there, and we all know -- I guess in an unclassified setting, we can say that these people have used gas on multiple occasions, but the deaths have only been in the hundreds and not in the thousands. But all of this is moving, and there is no question about it.

I do -- nonetheless, I am reluctant. If there was one American -- if this was an attack against any American, against any American interest, this would be a no-brainer for me. But I'm reluctant at this point. And part of it stems from where this is going to go, as to the limit that we're going to put on it.

Secretary Kerry, you said you've met with your -- with the -- your counterpart from Russia. And first of all, you say they're cooperating with us on all major issues. I view this as a major issue, and I don't view them as cooperating with us. They're printing their currency. They're providing them with information. They're providing them with technology. They've provided them with a tremendous amount of military power. And so the question I have is what's your counterpart telling you as to what they're going to do when and if America pulls the trigger?

SEC. KERRY: Senator, I -- look, I understand anybody's reluctance about this. But again, I'd ask you to confront the greater reality of what happens if you don't -- if we don't do something. I mean, if you think it's bad today what they're doing, just think about what happens if they confirm their suspicion that the United States isn't going to do anything.

One of the reasons Assad has been using these materials is because they have, up until now, made the calculation that the West writ large and the United States particularly are not going to do anything about it.

Impunity is already working to kill a lot of people and to make things more dangerous. I guarantee you that is in their assessment.

So if we make it worse by not being willing to do something, those terrible images you see are going to be -- (inaudible) -- but worse than that, our interests will be set back; Israel will be at greater risk; Jordan will be at greater risk.

The longer that this conflict goes on, and particularly with Assad's ability to be able to use chemical weapons, the more you will see the humanitarian crisis grow. We are already the largest contributor -- thanks to the, you know, generosity of the American people and the willingness of Congress to move, we're already the largest contributor to refugee camps in the borders. Many of you have been to them. You want to see them grow? You want to see Jordan, which is already fragile --

SEN. RISCH: Of course not.

SEC. KERRY: Many of you -- many of you have met with the king. You know King Abdullah's judgment is that he's at risk because of what is happening.

So I believe the best way to curb that and reduce the threat is by acting.

SEN. RISCH: And I -- I don't disagree -- I don't disagree with anything you said, but let's take that and try to expand on that. We need the credibility. There is no question about it. But are we really going to be giving them credibility if we go in with a limited strike and, the day after or the week after or the month after, Assad crawls out of his rat hole and says, look, I stood up to the strongest power on the face of this Earth and I won? And so now it's business as usual here. And he may say, and by the way, I'm not going to use chemical weapons anymore because I don't like what just happened, but I'm going to continue to use conventional weapons and we're going to go on with business as usual, and the refugees are going to continue and the thousands are going to be killed.

And our allies are going to say, what's the matter with the United States? You said you'd do something about this, you did -- you did a limited strike but you didn't finish Assad off and the problem is just as bad as it was.

What does that do to our credibility? You know, that concerns me.

SEC. KERRY: Well, Senator, let me -- let me speak to that. That's a good question. First of all, I think General Dempsey will tell you, Assad may be able to crawl out of the hole and say, look, I survived, but there's no way that with reality and other assessments he's going to be able to say he's better off.

There is no question that whatever choices are made by the president, that he and his military effort will not be better off, number one. And the opposition will know that and the people in Syria will know that. Already today, just with the threat that action may be taken, defections have gone up and people in Syria are reconsidering whether Assad is a long-term bet.

Moreover, General Dempsey has made it clear, and Secretary Hagel's make it clear and the president's made it clear that there will be additional support to the opposition, which is only now in its third month of receiving the overt support -- or about to receive, in fairness, Senator McCain and others know there are things that haven't gotten there yet. But that process is in place and that will increase.

So I believe --

SEN. RISCH: My time is almost up, Senator Kerry.

SEC. KERRY: OK.

SEN. RISCH: Let me -- I really want to get a handle on this. I think all of us feel strongly about this. And I need -- I need my -- I need to be reassured on this. The other thing that is -- really troubles me about this is what happens if this thing gets away from us? I mean, what's happens -- you've been on the border between Israel and Lebanon, as I have. And since the last war, I mean they have -- the -- Hezbollah has really beefed that up.

What happens if they get into it with Israel? What's our response to that going to be?

SEC. KERRY: Well, I talked with Prime Minister Netanyahu just yesterday, and he made it pretty clear to me that Israel feels very confident about Israel's ability to be able to deal, as they have previously, with a miscalculation by Assad. And the rest of the community, the Turks, the Jordanians, the Emiratis, the Saudis, Qataris, the United States, France, others, all have a capacity.

So as I said in my -- in my statement, you all have to make a kind of calculation here, just as Assad does. If he is foolish enough to respond to the world's enforcement against his criminal activity, if he does, he will invite something far worse, and I believe, something absolutely unsustainable for him.

Now --

SEN. RISCH: First of all --

SEC. KERRY: -- that doesn't mean the United States of America going to war, as I said in my comments. There are plenty of options here.

SEN. RISCH: Well, we do know --

SEC. KERRY: Let me finish one other comment, because it's important to the earlier question: Russia does not have an ideological commitment here. This is a geopolitical transactional commitment. And our indications are, in many regards, that that's the way they view it, there may be more weapons to sell as a result of weapons sold, but it's not going to elicit some kind of major confrontation.

Now, let me go further: They have condemned the use of chemical weapons, the Russians have. The Iranians have. And as the proof of the use becomes even more clear in the course of this debate, I think it is going to be very difficult for Iran or Russia to decide against all that evidence that there is something worth defending here.

So this is the kind of calculation you have to make, but I'd measure that against a calculation of what happens if we don't respond.

If we don't respond, we're going to be back here asking you to respond to some greater confrontation with greater potential for damage and danger because somebody miscalculated as a result of believing the United States isn't good for what it says. And that will invite much greater danger for the American people, much greater risk for our armed forces and conceivably much greater chances of a (genuine ?) kind of conflagration that we don't want to see.

SENATOR RISCH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is up.

Thank you, Secretary.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Senator Cardin.

SENATOR BENJAMIN CARDIN (D-MD): Well, let me thank all of you for being here, but also thank you very much for your service. And Mr. Chairman, Senator Corker, I thank you very much for arranging this hearing.

It's very clear that the type of conduct that President Assad has done in Syria, the pattern of his actions, creating a humanitarian crisis, and now the use of chemical weapons -- the evidence that's been presented -- it's clear that we have to respond, and a military response is justified.

So I support your efforts. And Mr. Secretary, the way that you have described it is what I think we need to do. We have to have a tailored mission that deals with degrading and deterring the use of chemical weapons. We need to have it focused on that mission. It's got to be done in a way that protects civilians the best that we can. And it's got to be of very limited duration.

But I just want to come back to the point that the chairman raised in your own comments, where you say we should shut that door as tightly as possible when dealing with putting our troops on the ground in Syria. I've read the resolution that you presented to us. I think it is broader than what you have stated the president's intentions on the mission.

And I understand that, and I understand the president's strong desire to keep the mission very tight. And it certainly does not leave open -- it does not close the door on the introduction of ground troops.

I've also heard your comments about the unexpected. Something could happen. I would just point out that the president as commander in chief has the authority, the inherent authority to act in urgent situations where time requires that action. And I would suggest, as you have come to Congress for this authorization, if circumstances change and there is time to come to Congress, you'll have the opportunity to come back to Congress and seek our participation. We are a separate branch of government, as you recall.

So I just want to urge you in the strongest possible terms to work with our leadership to draft a resolution that is as tight as we can make it that'll allow you to carry out the mission that you have defined here today so that we can go back and tell the American people that we in Congress are supporting your action but are not leaving open the door for the introduction of American troops into Syria.

I want to talk a little bit about the specific military operations, and I'm going to leave most of this for tomorrow in our discussions, but I just want General Dempsey and Secretary Hagel to understand whether the mission is to degrade the weapons and deter the use of chemical weapons. Had you put into that equation the fact that obviously, Syria is aware that we are contemplating military action and therefore may try to change the equation during this period of time to make it more difficult for us to carry out that mission? Has that been brought into your planning stages?

GEN. DEMPSEY: Yes, Senator, it has. And, you know, time works both ways. You recall, about a week and a half ago, there was a significant leak of military planning that caused the regime to react. So time works both ways. We have some pretty significant intelligence capabilities, and we continue to refine our targets.

SEN. CARDIN: Both of you have indicated your concern about American military involvement in Syria -- that it could draw us in in a way that we do not want to be drawn into an internal conflict. Are you also putting into your plans ways to prevent that type of drawing in of America into the internal conflict in Syria?

SEC. HAGEL: Senator, we are. As I noted in my opening statement, we have taken great care and much time in looking at all -- not only the options to present to the president, but the contingencies that may be a consequence of the president selecting one of those options, including what you have just noted. It is imperfect; as I said -- and I think everyone recognizes -- there is always risk. We've tried to minimize that risk in every way we can -- every presentation we've made to the president. The president has insisted on that -- collateral damage across the board. So yes, we've taken a lot of time to focus exactly on your point.

SEN. CARDIN: Secretary Kerry, you point out that if we don't act, we're liable to lose some friends. And I just really want to point out, we do have a direct interest here. We not only have a humanitarian reason to respond to the use of chemical weapons, we have a direct American interest in that region, and we have Americans that are in that region that are at risk if additional chemicals are used. So I see a direct connection to U.S. interests.

You say we may lose some friends if we don't act. Why don't we have more participation in the U.S. military response in addition to just support? It seems to me that this appears to be -- we understand America will be in the lead, but it does not seem like we have a growing list of countries that are actively joining us in the military operation.

SEC. KERRY: Well, first of all, there is no definitive list at this point in time because the president has not made the decision as to specifically which set of choices he's going to operate on. Secondly, as many countries as we could conceivably need to be able to be helpful in a limited operation have volunteered to be helpful. And they stand ready to take part in any specific operation. And we're very, very comfortable with that.

But the bottom line in many ways remains that we're talking about very specific kinds of capacities that, in some cases, only the United States of America possesses. And so you know, that remains open. It's a process that will evolve as this debates evolves and as the president makes his decisions and the joint chiefs of staff and the military present him with the various options. And those will probably evolve, as you mentioned. People may make adjustments in Syria. And I can assure the Syrians that General Dempsey and his people will be making adjustments as they go along.

SEN. CARDIN: Well, I would hope we would have stronger international participation. Is there a consideration of a role for NATO to play here considering that one of NATO's partners, Turkey, is on the direct front line here on the use of chemical weapons? Can we -- is that being considered?

SEC. KERRY: Well, as you say, is it being considered -- everything is being considered, and all of these things are being evaluated. Discussions are taking place. I will be meeting on Saturday in Vilnius with European ministers. I know this topic will come up. And most of them -- they're all members of NATO, so we will have -- or most of them are, not all of them. So we'll have some discussions when we're there.

But I -- at the moment, this is a limited operation, with the scope of support that the president makes a judgment that we ought to have.

We will have very broad -- we have already very broad -- I think we've -- I've been in -- you know, we've had some 53 nations or countries and organizations have acknowledged that chemical weapons were used here and have condemned it publicly. Thirty-one nations have stated publicly that the Assad regime is responsible, and I think we're at about 34 countries have indicated that if the allegations are true that they would support some form of action against Syria.

So there's a very broad coalition that's growing of people who believe we ought to take action against Syria, but the question is, you know, whether or not it makes sense for whatever number to be part of it is a decision that our military and the president have to make as we go along here.

SEN. CARDIN: I'll reserve the rest of the questions for the closed session. Thank you.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Senator Rubio.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic.)

SEN. MENENDEZ: (Sounds gavel.) The gentleman will sit down, or I'll have the officer remove you. (Sounds gavel.) Police will make sure that the committee is in order.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic.)

SEC. KERRY: Yeah, that's why I said -- (off mic) --

SEN. MENENDEZ: Senator Rubio.

SENATOR MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Let me begin by answering a fundamental question that I get asked a lot as we discuss this very important issue, and that is, why do we even care about what's happening in Syria? And I want to very clear my belief that I think reflects the belief of most of the members of this committee. And that is that what happens in Syria is a -- is of vital national interest to the United States and to our national security for reasons that have already been outlined.

The Syrian relationship with Iran is very significant, it's a key part of their ambitions to be the regional power, the dominant regional power. In fact, the Iranians love to brag that Syria gives them a border with Israel.

Number two, Assad is an anti-American supporter of terrorism, is a supporter of Hamas, he's a supporter of Hezbollah. And by the way, he's a supporter of al-Qaida in Iraq, the same al-Qaida in Iraq that's responsible for the death and maiming of countless brave young men and women who served our country in uniform.

It's also of interest to us because of the instability that this is creating in Syria, instability that's allowing portions of Syria to quickly become kind of what Afghanistan was before 9/11, the premier operational space for global jihadists from abroad to come train and fight and plan attacks in the future.

And now added to that is this chemical attack which undermines and -- the post-World War II world order, which basically said that these things are unacceptable. And allies that look at the United States and our capabilities of living up to our security promises is all at risk now as a result of all of this.

This is why Syria and what's happening in Syria matters to our national interests, which it's so clearly tied to a critical national security interest of the United States.

By the way, most of if not all of this was true two years ago, when I joined other voices on this committee and in the Senate and beyond that advocated that at that time, when Assad was on the ropes, the United States should engage in trying to identify moderate elements and equip them so that they became the predominant rebel force in Syria and not others. But that didn't happen. Instead, the choice was made to lead from behind.

The choice was made to watch at this thing unfolded, as others advocated that we should just mind our own business. And what we're seeing here now is proof and an example that when America ignores these problems, these problems don't ignore us; that we can ignore them but eventually they grow and they come to visit us at our doorstep. And now we're faced with what we have.

In fact, as -- Secretary Kerry, a moment ago, you said that one of the calculations that Assad used in deciding to use chemical weapons was that the U.S. wouldn't do anything about it. Now I understand, perhaps, why he made that calculation because, yes, this is a horrible incident where a thousand people died. But before this incident, a hundred thousand people had died, including snipers that were used to pick off civilians, including women that were raped as part of -- they were going to these villages and carried this out. And nothing happened. So of course he reached that calculation.

So this is a reminder of what happens when we ignore the world, when we look inwards sometimes and we ignore these problems: They only get worse and more difficult to solve. And that's the mess that we have here right now. We are left with options, all of which are less than ideal. And I want to walk through the three that have been presented to us by different voices and then ask specifically about the one the president is considering.

The first option is to decide to help Syrians remove Assad and replace (with ?) a more -- a more moderate government. I think that's the ideal outcome, but it has its own complications. Today the rebel forces on the ground are not just the moderate rebels, they're nonmoderate rebels. They're jihadists that now control major portions of the country, and in other parts of the country are intermingled with these rebels forces, creating a real prospect that after the fall of Assad, a new civil war could be triggered -- one that could involve sectarian violence, massacres of minorities, et cetera. (As I said ?), this comes with its own set of complications.

The other, which some voices have advocated, is doing nothing. But that would guarantee the following outcome: an emboldened Assad, an emboldened Iran, increased instability in the country because portions of that country will still be ungoverned. And it will also send a message to the world that there is no red line that they should fear crossing. So Iran will move forward toward nuclear weapons. North Korea can act crazier, if that's even possible. Our allies in South Korea and Japan may start to doubt their security arrangements with us. Israel may decide it needs to strike Iran unilaterally. Iran will move towards the bomb, which, by the way, it won't just be an Iranian bomb.

It'll be a Turkish bomb as well and a Saudi bomb and maybe even an Egyptian bomb one day.

The third is the action the president is asking us to consider, what he termed, not me, what he called a shot across the bow -- a military strike of limited duration and scope that has three goals, as I understand it, that have been outlined here today. Goal number one is to hold Assad accountable. Goal number two is to deter this behavior in the future. And goal number three is to degrade Assad's capacity to carry out these attacks in the future. This is -- the president wants us to authorize a limited strike that would accomplish these three things.

The question that I have, quite frankly, I'm a bit skeptical that the act -- that what the president is asking for will provide the support needed to achieve these objectives, and that these objectives are even realistic at this point. So here's my first question, and I think I'll ask this of General Dempsey. The calculation that Assad has made is that the reason why he's using these chemical weapons is because he's afraid that if he doesn't he could lose this war, be overthrown and killed. That's the calculation that he's made. That's why he used these chemical weapons. He wants to beat the rebels.

So my question is this: Can we -- can we structure an attack that tips that calculation where he'll basically decide that he would rather risk being overrun by rebels than risking a limited attack from the U.S. if he uses these chemical weapons. He has to decide: I'll use chemical weapons and take on a limited U.S. attack in the future or I'll risk being overrun by the rebels. How are we going to unbalance that and lead him to calculate that he's better off risking losing to the rebels?

GEN. DEMPSEY: Well, Senator, I think the -- it may be even more insidious than that. He's reached the point where he now thinks of chemical weapons as just another weapon in his arsenal. And that's the part that makes this so very dangerous.

And I think that as I've provided advice on what targets may be appropriate, I certainly want to degrade his capabilities coming out of this. So I want to come out of it stronger than we go into it.

SEN. RUBIO: Leads me to my second question: How confident are you and how confident can you express to this committee you are that we can in fact put in place a military plan that's limited in scope and duration, that can effectively degrade Assad's capability to carry out future chemical attacks?

GEN. DEMPSEY: I'm confident in the capabilities we can bring to bear to deter and degrade. And it won't surprise you to know that we will have not only an initial target set but subsequent target sets should they become necessary.

SEN. RUBIO: And this question is probably for Secretary Kerry, and I think this was asked earlier, but I think it's important to elaborate on it. One of the concerns that I have and I've heard others express is that Assad could take three, five, six days of strikes, maybe longer, maybe shorter, and emerge from that saying, I have faced down the United States and I have held onto power and survived, and at that point be further emboldened both domestically and perhaps even abroad. Have we taken that into account? And I understand your argument that inaction would be worse, but have we taken into account what the implications could be of an Assad that could weather a limited strike and what that could mean for the long- term prospects of the conflict?

SEC. KERRY: Yes, we absolutely have. For certain, we've taken that into account. He will -- I mean, he will weather. The president's -- the president's asking for a limited authority to degrade his current capacity and to deter him from using it again. He is not asking for permission from the Congress to go destroy the entire regime or to, you know, do a much more extensive kind of thing. That's not what he's asking. So he will be able to stand up, and no doubt he'll try to claim that somehow this is, you know, something positive for him.

But I think General Dempsey has made it clear and I think we believe deeply, as do others who are knowledgeable about this in the region, that there is no way that it will, in fact, be beneficial for him, that it will not translate for him on the ground; that the defections that are taking place now and other things that will happen will further degrade his capacity to prosecute it going forward.

And I want to emphasize something. I want to come back to it because I don't want anybody misinterpreting this from earlier. This authorization does not contemplate and should not have any allowance for any troop on the ground. I just want to make that absolutely clear. You know, what I was doing was hypothesizing about a potential it might occur at some point in time, but not in this authorization, in no way -- be crystal clear -- there's no problem in our having the language that has zero capacity for American troops on the ground within the authorization the president is asking for. I don't want anybody in the media or elsewhere to misinterpret that coming out of here. As I said earlier, I repeat it again now, that's important.

SEN. RUBIO: Thank you. And --

SEN. MENENDEZ (?): I can assure you that will be in the resolution.

SEN. /SEC. KERRY (?): Good.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Senator Shaheen.

SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-NH): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Thank you, gentlemen, for your testimony. I agree that we should not turn our back on such a blatant violation of international norms with respect to the use of chemical weapons, and that if we stand quietly by while a tyrant like Assad uses chemical weapons on his own people, that we will be giving carte blanche to any dictator anywhere in the world to develop and use chemical weapons.

I think the question now, as we've all said, is how do we respond specifically? How do we best send a message that it's completely unacceptable to develop, much less use, these types of weapons, and how do we do that without inadvertently spreading the conflict beyond the borders of Syria? That's really the question that we have today.

And we've heard that we want to deter the future use of chemical weapons, but according to the president and to your testimony today, we don't want to tip the scales on the ground. So how do we ensure that we can do that without spreading the conflict throughout the region? And how do we hit Assad hard enough so that we deter his future use of chemical weapons and yet, don't affect the military outcome on the ground?

SEC. KERRY: Well, General, do you want to ask -- address this other just military piece and I'll take the other piece?

GEN. DEMPSEY: Sure. And I think the language about not to -- not using American military power to tip the scale is -- would be our direct action. In other words, this resolution is not asking for permission for the president to be able to use the United States' Armed Forces to overthrow the regime.

On the other hand, back to the earlier questions about developing a moderate regime that has capabilities to be a stabilizing force inside of Syria, that's the path -- our military action, in this case, is very focused on the chemical weapons, but will have the added benefit of degrading -- and it will also have the added benefit of supporting the diplomatic track.

And with that, let me turn it over the secretary.

SEC. KERRY: Senator Shaheen, the president has made it very, very clear that the policy of this administration -- and sometimes, people have sort of said -- you know -- questioned precisely what it is, and I'll tell you precisely what it is -- the president is asking for the Congress to take steps that will specifically deter and degrade Assad's capacity to use chemical weapons.

He is not asking the Congress for authorization to become whole-hog involved in Syria's civil war, to try to change the regime through military action.

This is a targeted action to deal with the problem of chemical weapons, but there is a separate track which the president has already committed the administration and the country to, which is that Assad must go, that he has lost all moral authority or capacity to ever govern Syria and that he is pursuing that -- the president is pursuing that track by helping the opposition, by now having made the decision to lethally arm that opposition by upgrading the efforts for the opposition to be able to fight the fight -- not the United States -- the opposition -- and to be able to come to a negotiated settlement, because the president is convinced, as I think everybody is, that there is no military solution, that ultimately, you want to get to Geneva, you want a negotiated settlement, and under the terms of Geneva One, there is an agreement which the Russians have signed onto, which calls for a transition government to be created with the mutual consent of the current regime and the opposition. And that transition government will establish the rules of the road for the Syrian people to choose their new government.

There is no way possible that by mutual consent, Assad is going to be part of that future. The Russians have agreed that that is in fact Geneva I, and the purpose of the Geneva II meeting is to implement Geneva I.

Now, it's complicated, obviously. How do you get there? And that's part of this struggle. But the president is convinced that as the support to the opposition increases, there is a much greater likelihood that you will wind up ultimately with a negotiated settlement.

The alternative is that you stand back and do nothing and Syria in fact implodes, becomes an enclave state, there are huge ungoverned spaces, al-Nusra, al-Qaida, Hezbollah, others become more of a threat to our friends in the region, and the region becomes much more of a sectarian conflagration. That is part of the effort.

SEN. SHAHEEN: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

Secretary Hagel and General Dempsey, you made a number of statements throughout the spring cautioning against intervention in the conflict in Syria. Why do you feel at this point that it's appropriate for us to take action? What's changed?

SEC. HAGEL: Senator, thank you. I'll let General Dempsey respond for himself.

Well, first, very clear intelligence and evidence that the Assad regime used chemical weapons on its own people. So we are dealing with a new set of realities, based on facts. And I think -- it is at least my opinion -- that that needs to be addressed, that needs to be dealt with, for the reasons I have noted -- I have said in public and also addressed in my statement, I think -- and what Secretary Kerry and General Dempsey have said, and obviously what the president has said.

So that's the most specific reason. The dynamics have changed.

One additional point in regard to your question on this, as to your previous question: If in fact the president is given the authorization from Congress to go forward -- and as he's already said, he believes he has within his constitutional power as commander in chief to act as well -- and he's given his reasons, which we all support, why he came to the Congress -- there are parallel actions that would work along with whatever action the president would take: opposition strength, which Secretary Kerry has noted; second, defections within the Syrian government and military, as Secretary Kerry has noted; other intelligence, other consequences.

And this is about getting to an end game. That end game is a diplomatic settlement. It is driving this toward what we believe, the president believes is the only way out of this, if for no other reason than what Secretary Kerry has noted: We do not want to see the country of Syria disintegrate, result in ungoverned space, which I think the consequences would be devastating for our partners, for our allies, the entire Middle East. Then we would all have to respond in some way. So I just add that on to answering your last question.

GEN. DEMPSEY: Chairman, may I -- I'll make it brief, but in response to your question about the -- let's say the past year.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Yes, General.

GEN. DEMPSEY: Over the past year, we've provided a full range of options. And my advice on those options was based on my assessment of their linkage to our national security interests and whether they would be effective.

On this issue, that is the use of chemical weapons, I find a clear linkage to our national security interest. And we will find a way to make our use of force effective.

SEN. SHAHEEN: Thank you all.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Senator Johnson.

SENATOR RON JOHNSON (R-WI): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm trying to reconcile, I guess, the two tracks of goals we got going here, military action and then negotiated settlement. Secretary Hagel, you said we are not seeking to resolve the underlying conflict in Syria. Isn't that exactly what we're trying to do? Why aren't we trying to resolve that?

SEC. HAGEL: I was referring in my statement to the authorization to use military force. That specifically is not why we have come to the Congress, why the president asked for the Congress' support. As he has said, the authorization is for a very specific and focused military action.

SEN. JOHNSON: But our stated goal really is to remove Assad and move to a negotiated settlement. Why wouldn't we use this opportunity, military action, to move toward that goal?

SEC. HAGEL: Well, that is one option. If those options would range from an invasion or a lot of military options on the table. But the president has said what this authorization is about is a -- is a limited authorization for a limited exercise. The goal of removing Assad from office, as the president has stated, is still the policy of this administration.

SEN. JOHNSON: General Dempsey, how confident are you that you can calibrate, tailor, fine-tune military action that doesn't have spillover effects, so we that we keep it to the limited, stated goal of, I guess, degrading and deterring?

GEN. DEMPSEY: Well, the task was to do just that -- to deter and degrade, not -- and to be limited and focused in scope and duration.

I mean, that's the task I've been given and the task I've been --

SEN. JOHNSON: Yes, but how can you calibrate that?

GEN. DEMPSEY: Well, we can calibrate it on our side. There is always the risk of escalation on the other. But they have significantly limited capabilities to do so, and most of the intelligence informs us -- we could talk about that in a closed session.

SEN. JOHNSON: But what planning is being undertaken right now in case this does spin out of control? I mean, you know, we were talking about potential for boots on the ground.

Secretary Kerry, I'm very glad to hear you're bringing into the equation what I think is our number one national security interest, and that is those chemical weapons falling in the hands of al-Qaida elements or possibly even Hezbollah. What commitment do we have long- term to make sure that doesn't happen? And if you have a very limited resolution here, how do we know that we're not -- that we will prevent that from happening?

SEC. KERRY: Senator Johnson, this is -- this moment in time and -- as the president has said, he is asking for a limited military response, recognizing that neither he nor most of America want to be dragged into a civil war in Syria.

SEN. JOHNSON: But our goal is to get rid of Assad.

SEC. KERRY: Our goal is to help the opposition, and there are lots -- I mean, you have to look overall. The president and, I think, all of us agree -- I mean, can you imagine Assad running Syria? Can you imagine this man who has gassed his people and -- (inaudible) --

SEN. JOHNSON: Again, I'm trying to reconcile why, if we're going to go in there militarily, if we're going to strike, why wouldn't we try and do some kind of knock-out punch? Is it because we simply have no faith that there's anybody on the ground, the rebels, to take -- (inaudible) --

SEC. KERRY: No. No, absolutely --

SEN. JOHNSON: I mean, is -- or is it not for regime change? Is that -- is that the problem?

SEC. KERRY: No, Senator, that's not the reason. The reason is that the president is listening to the American people and has made a policy decision, in addition, that that is not something that the United States of America needs to engage in or ought to engage in.

That is a much broader operation.

SEN. JOHNSON: But it -- but it's the stated goal.

SEC. KERRY: Well, yeah, it is. It is, Senator. Is the Congress of the United States read to pay for 30 days of 30,000 air strikes to take out -- and is there a legal justification for doing that? And you can run through a whole series of different questions here that are very serious about what you're talking about.

SEN. JOHNSON: What do we know about the opposition? I mean, what is -- have we been tracking them for the last two years? I mean, it seems like -- and this is more of an impression I have as opposed to any exact knowledge, but it seems like initially, the opposition was maybe more Western-leaning, more moderate, more democratic, and as time has gone by, it's degraded, become more infiltrated by al-Qaida. That -- is that basically true? Or to -- (inaudible) -- has that happened?

SEC. KERRY: No, that is -- no, that is actually basically not true. It's basically incorrect. The opposition has increasingly become more defined by its moderation, more defined by the breadth of its membership and more defined by its adherence to some, you know, democratic process and to an all-inclusive, minority-protecting constitution, which will be broad-based and secular with respect to the future of Syria. And that's very critical.

SEN. JOHNSON: Secretary Hagel, do you --

SEC. KERRY: Let me -- let me just finish. One other point about the opposition. It's my understanding, because I talked to the president to the opposition yesterday -- he's in Germany now; he's meeting with the German parliament. He is coming to Great Britain. He will be meeting with the Parliament in Great Britain. And he is prepared to come here as soon as those meetings are over in order to meet with you, and you can have an opportunity to talk to President Jarba and meet with the opposition, have a much better sense of who they are.

SEN. JOHNSON: We appreciate that.

Secretary Hagel, do you have a feel for the number of members of the opposition? I mean, how large is their force?

SEN. HAGEL: I don't know the numbers. Our intelligence communities have estimates of those numbers.

But I think, as Secretary Kerry said, the momentum has shifted, in the opinion of our intelligence community and others who are close to the situation, where --

SEN. JOHNSON: I'm kind of a numbers guy.

General Dempsey, do you know the force strength of the rebel forces?

GEN. DEMPSEY: I don't have them committed to memory, Senator.

SEN. JOHNSON: But we have them. I can --

GEN. DEMPSEY: Yeah, the intelligence community has that available, and we'll make it available --

SEN. JOHNSON: And do you also have a pretty good feel for how many really would be considered moderate versus elements of al-Qaida?

GEN. DEMPSEY: I have seen documents that lay that out.

SEN. JOHNSON: How do we know that Hezbollah, because they've been so cooperative with the Assad regime -- how do we know that they already don't have access to chemical weapons? Do we have any feel for that at all?

SEC. KERRY: I think we need to talk about that in our classified session. But let me just say to you that in terms of the opposition numbers, you see ranges up to 80(,000), 90,000, 100,000 in total opposition. You see ranges from -- well, I don't want to go into all the numbers, but in the tens of thousands in terms of operative, active combatants. The -- I've seen some recent data on the numbers of the extremists in al-Nusra. They're actually lower than former expectations.

I would also say to you, Syria historically has been secular, and the vast majority of Syrians, I believe, want to remain secular. It's -- it's our judgment that -- and the judgment of our good friends who actually know a lot of this in many ways better than we do because it's their region, their neighborhood -- I'm talking about the Saudis, the Emirates, the Qataris, the Turks, the Jordanians -- they all believe that if you could have a fairly rapid transition, the secular component of Syria will re-emerge and you will isolate --

SEN. JOHNSON: OK. Very good.

That tends to argue for a more robust response.

Final question. You said this is the world's red line. I agree. So in the intervening time period before we potentially act here, how many additional countries will be supportive of this action? What is your goal? And what do we have right now? What is your goal?

SEC. KERRY: Well, our goal is to have as broad a coalition and support of what we might do as is possible, and we're working that right now. But the military and the president are going to have to decide how many they actually want to have take part in the action, as I said. We already have more partners ready to do something kinetic than the military feels, under this particular operation, we need to effect that.

Now, obviously we want them to participate because we want it to be a broad coalition. But the final numbers will have to be decided by the president and by the specific operation that he defines together with you in the authorization.

SEN. JOHNSON: OK, thank you. I look forward to tomorrow's briefing. Thanks.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Thank you. Senator Coons.

SENATOR CHRISTOPHER COONS (D-DE): Thank you, Chairman Menendez. I'd like to thank Secretaries Kerry and Hagel and Chairman Dempsey for your service to our nation and for your testimony in front of us today. I think the authorization of the use of force, I think the commitment of American military strength is one of the most important issues that we will ever debate in this Congress, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have this conversation today. As Secretary Kerry said in his opening testimony, not just what we decide but how we decide it will send a very important message around the world that this Congress can still function in a nonpartisan way, in the interests of the people of the United States.

As I've listened to Delawareans in recent days, I think they reflect a nation that is weary of war and that is wary of inadvertently repeating some of the challenges of our engagement in Iraq. I've heard specific and pointed concerns that we not rush into action based on uneven or inaccurate intelligence, that we not be drawn into a civil war we don't fully understand or where we can't quite discern the good guys from the bad guys, and more than anything, that we not commit to an open-ended participation, a direct military invasion and an occupation of a country in a part of the world that is often confounding and is full of competing priorities.

Having reviewed the intelligence this morning in a classified briefing, having participated in a number of briefings from you and folks leading in your agencies and departments, I am persuaded that this is not that circumstance, that the intelligence is solid, that we have, in this instance, a clear violation of a long-standing global red line against the use of chemical weapons -- as you've stated, something embedded in America's statutes and in our treaty commitments, something that is a truly global standard.

My view, as I've watched both the images on TV that were presented at the beginning of this hearing and as I've spoken to family and friends and neighbors at home, is that we face a real risk here if we do not act, that this is an instance where one of the world's worst dictators has steadily ratcheted up an ascending crescendo of death in his own nation. He began with thugs, police and the military taking on peaceful demonstrators, graduated to snipers killing innocent civilians, has used helicopters and jet fighters against his own people, has deployed cluster bombs and scud missiles.

I think over the last two years, there is no doubt that Bashar al-Assad and his regime is willing to go to any length to stay in power. So the challenge now, for those of us who seek an appropriate path forward, is to make sure that we craft an authorization for the use of military force that responds to Americans' legitimate concerns but still allows the administration to act in a decisive and timely way to both deter and punish the Assad regime for what they've done.

So I have a few questions for you, if I might, the first to General Dempsey. And I know we've spoken to this before, but I think it is worth repeating: How do we strike the right balance between military action that is too insignificant to actually effectively deter or degrade Assad's capabilities, and one that is so decisive and overwhelming that it reaches beyond the scope of an authorization and becomes actually a regime change effort?

GEN. DEMPSEY: Well, Senator, I'll assure you, I won't recommend an option or a set of targets that won't effectively deter and degrade. That's the task I've been given. And that -- now, we'll continue to refine that, not just based on intelligence, but based on the resolution that comes out of this committee.

SEN. COONS: And could you, in your view, accomplish that mission, with an authorization that is limited in scope in terms of a time duration and in scope, as has been discussed with Secretary Kerry, in terms of not introducing U.S. troops on the ground?

GEN. DEMPSEY: Well, it won't surprise you to know that as the military leader responsible for this, the more -- the broader the resolution -- the less limiting, the better off I will be in crafting a set of options. But I completely -- I defer to the secretary of state to give me what I need to do that.

SEN. COONS: Well, if I might then to Secretary Kerry, because our goal here is to not pass or even consider an authorization that is so narrow that it prevents any effective message to be sent here, as you said, I think in a compelling way in your opening statement, our actions here are not just meant to deter Assad, but to send a strong message to Pyongyang, to Tehran, to nonstate actors around the world who might use chemical weapons or might seek nuclear weapons -- how do we craft an authorization? How do we take actions that are effective here in deterring other countries that are watching our decisiveness and our action in this instant?

SEC. KERRY: Well, I think the language that the administration submitted with respect to the military action necessary to degrade and deter and prevent the use of chemical weapons specifically is very targeted.

But I -- as I've said several times now and will repeat again, I know the administration has zero intention of putting troops on the ground, and within the confines of this authorization, I'm confident we'd have zero problem in including some kind of prohibition there if that makes you comfortable.

I would not urge an excessively pinpointed, Congressionally- mandated set of targets -- and I think, in the course of the classified briefings, the intelligence community and the military community will make it very clear to you why that's not advisable -- and I think they have to have general need -- some latitude here to be able to make sure he can accomplish his task. But I think the broad confines and constraints of this particular operation are not hard for us to arrive at in agreement. And I'm confident we'll do it very quickly.

SEN. COONS: Thank you. One of my other concerns, Mr. Secretary, is the flood of refugees and their impact on the region. In a visit in January to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan, I was moved both by the humanitarian situation they're facing and by the very real impact that this is having on our regional allies -- on Jordan, on Turkey, the destabilizing impact on Lebanon, and of course, the real impact it's potentially going to have on our close ally, Israel.

I was encouraged to hear there was a successful missile defense system test earlier today, Secretary Hagel. What steps are we taking to ensure that our allies in this immediate area of Turkey and Jordan and Israel are able to defend themselves from a potential response by the Assad regime?

SEC. HAGEL: Well, Senator, first, Jordan -- you know we have Patriot Missile defense batteries in Jordan.

And we also are working very closely with the Israelis. You know they have a very sophisticated Iron Dome, an aerial system -- missile defense system there. We are in constant coordination with all the allies in the region, and as you may know, General Dempsey was just in Jordan for a commanders meeting, which included all the senior military from the neighboring countries and our partners. So we are closely connected with and assisting our allies on this and other issues.

SEN. COONS: Thank you. Last question, Secretary Kerry, if I might. I am interested in our having a follow-on conversation about how this specific strike and this specific authorization that you're seeking can also lead to a broader strategy, a strategy for support and engagement with the opposition that'll lead to the diplomatic resolution of the Syrian civil war that you've spoken about repeatedly. I don't think these are mutually exclusive. I do think it's possible for us to take action that reinforces a global red line against chemical weapons use but to still continue to strengthen and broaden our engagement with the opposition in a way that moves towards a post-Assad Syria that is sustainable and secure. And I'd look forward to your input with us in our next hearing on that topic.

SEC. KERRY: Absolutely, Senator. I look forward to it too. And what I'd like to do is get the whole committee maybe to come down to the department, and we could, you know, have this discussion in that confine as a committee also, and I think that might be helpful, in addition to what we do in the classified briefing tomorrow.

SEN. COONS: Thank you.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Senator Flake.

SEC. KERRY: Mr. Chairman, is that -- if you want to do that, I'm happy to do that.

SEN. MENENDEZ: We'll follow up.

Senator Flake.

SENATOR JEFFRY FLAKE (R-AZ): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

And thank you all for your testimony. And I want to thank you, particularly the State Department, for making information available with regard to unclassifying certain information and also for the classified hearings that have taken place with regard to the chemical attack.

I think that one would have to suspend disbelief, as you mentioned, to assume that the regime was not in charge of this.

Secretary Kerry, in your initial testimony, you asked us to ask ourselves what Assad's calculation would be if we failed to act. I think that's an appropriate question. But I think it is appropriate for us to ask you or the administration, what is the calculation of Assad right now when rather than after we have proof that he did engage in what he engaged in, that we're waiting for a congressional authorization? I think one would have to suspend disbelief to assume that we wouldn't be better off attacking those targets right now or a week ago than waiting three weeks for Congress to take action.

And just drawing some parallel to the conflict in Libya, I think the president's statement was, before we went ahead and engaged in combat there or at least along with NATO, the president said, I refuse to wait for the images of slaughter and mass graves to take action and did so without congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution, and we had some dispute when he came back, but initially, we went ahead. Here we have evidence that chemical weapons were used. And how can we assure or tell our constituents that this isn't political when we come, when you come, when the administration comes to the Congress to ask for authorization to take action that the president clearly has said he has authority to take?

SEC. KERRY: Well, Senator Flake, it's somewhat surprising to me that a member of Congress, particularly one on the Foreign Relations Committee, is going to question the president fulfilling the vision of the founding fathers when they wrote the Constitution and divided power in foreign policy to have the president come here and honor the original intent of the founding fathers in ways that do not do anything to detract from the mission itself.

Now, General Dempsey will tell you that he advised the President of the United States that not only was there not a deterioration in this mission by waiting, there might even be some advantages. And so, in fact, we're not losing anything by waiting. And I personally believe there are advantages because we have time to work with our friends in the international community, because we have time to make the case to the American people and share with them the evidence that we have shared with you in the last days, because we have an opportunity to be able to build greater support.

And as the general has said, we can adjust to any changes or shifts that they make in that time. This does not in any way deteriorate the fundamental mission of degrading and deterring the use of chemical weapons. Now, if at any moment Assad were foolish enough to believe that this period of waiting is somehow an invitation to do more of his criminal activity, I can assure you that the president of the United States, and I think you all, would probably speed up your process and/or the president would respond immediately. So I -- this is working.

There are defections taking place. There's great uncertainty in Syria. We are building support, a greater understanding. And I would far rather be playing our hand than his at this point in time.

So I don't think we're losing anything. I think the president made a courageous decision to take the time to build the strength that makes America stronger by acting in unity with the United States Congress.

SEN. FLAKE: Well, if I may, I can certainly understand if there -- if that is a secondary goal or the primary goal that will -- in this intervening time it causes our allies to get with us, it causes Russia to put the pressure on maybe the Assad regime to get back to the table, peace talks, something like that; that's great. But purely in terms of military strategy -- and I don't have a military background, but I would have to suspend disbelief, and I think all of us would, to assume that we're better off in a couple of weeks doing what we're planning to do, what we will authorize the administration to do.

General Dempsey, is there evidence that the Assad regime is right now moving some of the targets that can be moved or surrounding targets with civilians or others to make it more difficult to give effect to our strategy?

GEN. DEMPSEY: Yeah, thanks, Senator. First I do want to -- for interest of clarity here, what I actually said to the president is the following: The military resources we have in place can remain in place, and when you ask us to strike, we will make those strikes effective.

In other sessions, in the principals committee, not with the president present, we talked about some targets becoming more accessible than they were before.

But to your question, there are, in fact -- there is evidence, of course, that the regime is reacting not only to the delay, but also they were reacting before that to the -- to the very unfortunate leak of military planning.

So this is a very dynamic situation.

SEN. FLAKE: Secretary Hagel, you seem eager to jump in.

SEC. HAGEL: I was just going to add something that you added, Senator, and that is the international community. In addition to what the president has already noted, a nation is always stronger when it is together, when he gets the Congress and the American people with him to begin with. But also, the international community, as many of the members of the international community with us on this, I think the president feels pretty strongly would be also an important part of whatever decision he might make.

And it doesn't end with whatever military option the president decides to go with, as we have all heard. That's all the more important we would want the international community with us.

SEN. FLAKE: Secretary Kerry, what will happen if the Congress says no and does not authorize this strike or this use of force? What will the president do?

SEC. KERRY: Well, I can't tell you what the president is going to do, because he hasn't told me, but the president, as you know, retains the authority, always has the authority, had the authority to strike before coming to Congress, and that doesn't change.

But I'll tell you what will happen, where it matters, in Pyongyang, in Tehran, in Damascus, folks will stand up and celebrate. And in a lot of other capitals in parts of the world, people will scratch their heads and sign a sort of condolence for the loss of America's willingness to stand up and make itself felt where it makes a difference to the world. I think it would be an enormous setback to America's capacity and to our vision in the world and certainly to the role of leadership that we play.

SEN. FLAKE: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Senator Durbin.

SENATOR RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

On Saturday I was standing with a group of friends watching the television screen with the announcement at any minute the president would make a statement. And I turned to them and said, I'll bet the missiles were launched and shot off hours ago and we'll hear about it now. And to my surprise, of course, the president came forward and said, I have that authority, I made that decision, but I'm going to respect our constitutionals democracy and give the Congress -- that is, the American people through Congress -- a voice in this decision.

From where I was standing, that was good news because for as long as I've been in Congress, House and Senate, I've argued about that congressional responsibility. Some presidents have respected it; some have not. Most of the time Congress, in writing or in speeches, insists on being respected and being given this authority and then starts shaking when it's given because it calls on us to be part of historic life-and-death decisions. It's one of the toughest calls we'll ever make as members of Congress. But I salute the president for respecting the Constitution and giving us that responsibility. And I think the turnout today on short notice in the midst of a break in this committee, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, is an indication we're taking this seriously and solemnly.

I'll also note to Senator Kerry and also to -- pardon, Secretary Kerry -- and Secretary Hagel, we all served together some 12 years ago and faced similar awesome historic decisions related to Iraq and Afghanistan.

We saw those differently, in some respects. But I voted against the Iraqi resolution and going to war in that country, and felt that the events that transpired afterwards gave me some justification for my vote.

But I voted for the war in Afghanistan, believing that it was a clear response to 9/11. We were going after those responsible for killing 3,000 innocent Americans, and we were going to make them pay a price. I still believe that was the right thing to do.

But I didn't know at the time that I voted for that authorization for the use of military force I was voting for the longest war in the history of the United States and an authority to several presidents to do things that no one ever could have envisioned at that moment in history.

So, Secretary Kerry and Secretary Hagel, I take this very seriously. I understand this president, I understand his values, but I take it very seriously that the language be as precise as possible when it comes to this whole question of expanding this mission into something much larger, something that would engage us in a new level of warfare or a new authority for this president or a future president. So I hope that we can have your word and assurance that we can work together in bipartisan fashion to craft this in a way that it carefully achieves our goal but does not expand authority anywhere beyond what is necessary.

SEC. KERRY: Senator, thank you. Very important statement, and you not only have my word that it will not do that, but we will work with you very, very closely, with the White House, in shaping this resolution. We -- there's no hidden agenda.

There's no subterfuge. There's no surrogate strategy here. There's one objective, and that objective is to make sure we live up to our obligations of upholding the norm with respect to international behavior on the use of chemical weapons. And that is what the president is seeking in this authorization.

SEN. DURBIN: Let me speak to the issue of Chemical Weapons. I don't know if General Dempsey or Secretary Hagel or perhaps Secretary Kerry is the appropriate person. The French have done an assessment of what they believe the Syrians have in terms of their chemical weapons arsenal. General Dempsey, are you familiar with it?

GEN. DEMPSEY: I'm not familiar with the French assessment. I'm familiar with our own.

SEN. DURBIN: Well, let me ask -- we have it here, a copy of it here, and it's been published. And we have talked a lot about sarin gas and other nerve agents. And what we hear from this report -- and I'd ask you if it's close to what your assessment is -- the Syrians have more than 1,000 tons of chemical agents and precursor chemicals, several hundred tons of sarin representing the bulk of their arsenal. It's also been speculated that they have the missile capability of delivering these chemical weapons in Israel, portions of Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and beyond. What is your assessment of their potential when it comes to the delivery and their capacity when it comes to the amount of chemical agents they have available?

GEN. DEMPSEY: Our assessment very closely matches the French assessment.

SEN. DURBIN: I guess my question to you, Mr. Secretary, Secretary Kerry, is in light of the vulnerability of these countries, what has been the response of the Arab and Muslim world to this?

I mean, you've listed four or five who've stepped forward to say they support our efforts. It would seem that if this danger in the region is so profound that we would have even greater support.

SEC. KERRY: Senator, I think -- this is something I'd be happier discussing in greater detail with you in the closed session. There are -- there are obviously some countries for whom public statements are more complicated than others. And I think we should talk about that at the other session.

SEN. DURBIN: Fair enough.

General Dempsey, we saw these photographs earlier -- these heartbreaking photographs. Page three of The Washington Post this morning, an ad by a group supporting the president's effort has a photograph that's riveted in my mind, as a father and grandfather, of the children on the floor in shrouds, victims of this chemical agent gas attack.

What the administration is asking us for is military authority to launch additional attacks. What have you been charged with in terms of the issue of collateral damage from those attacks as it would affect innocent people and civilians in the nation of Syria?

GEN. DEMPSEY: Senator, the guidance that we've received on targeting is to maintain a collateral damage estimate of low. And I just -- briefly on how we come up with our assessments of collateral damage, it's based on how much we know about a target through intelligence, its proximity to civilian structures and weapons effects as we decide what weapon to weaponeer against it.

And a -- and a collateral damage estimate of low means just that, that we will keep collateral damage lower than a certain number, which I would rather share with you in a classified setting. That doesn't mean, by the way, that we would have the same constraint, if you will, in what damage could be done to regime personnel.

So that's a separate issue, although even in that case I could probably tell you some more things in the classified setting.

SEN. DURBIN: I look forward to that.

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Thank you, Senator.

Senator McCain.

SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the witnesses.

And may I say, John, it's very good to see Teresa here with you, in good health and good spirits. Thank you. So Teresa, I apologize for what I'm about to do to John.

John.

SEC. KERRY: Man, there's a set-up.

SEN. MCCAIN: John, when you tell the enemy you're going to attack them -- I'm not going to take any time on this -- you tell the enemy you're going to attack them, they're obviously going to disperse and try to make it harder. I'm looking right here at a(n) AP story, report, Syria said to be hiding weapons and moving troops. There's even open-source reporting that they may be moving some of their assets into the Russian naval base. But let's not get -- it's ridiculous to think that it's not wise from a pure military standpoint to -- not to warn the enemy that you're going to attack.

Secretary Hagel, in the Wall Street Journal today we read the following: Pentagon planners were instructed not to offer strike options that could help drive Mr. Assad from power. The big concern is the wrong groups in the opposition would be able to take advantage of it, a senior military officer said.

Is there any truth to that Secretary Hagel?

SEC. HAGEL: Senator, as I've said, the president asked us for a range of options and we provided him a range of options.

SEN. MCCAIN: I'm asking if there's any truth to the Wall Street Journal --

SEC. HAGEL: Our options were not limited to any --

SEN. MCCAIN: I will just ask if there's any truth to the story that's in the Wall Street Journal.

SEC. HAGEL: No.

SEN. MCCAIN: Secretary Kerry, in the same Wall Street Journal article quote: The delay in providing arms to the opposition in part reflects a broader U.S. approach rarely discussed publicly but that underpins its decision-making. According to former and current U.S. officials, the current administration doesn't want to tip the balance in favor of the opposition for fear the outcome may be even worse for U.S. interests than the current stalemate.

Is that story accurate?

SEC. KERRY: No.

SEN. MCCAIN: Thank you.

SEC. KERRY: By the way, can I add something, Senator -- on the warning issue, I don't disagree with you about warning. In fact, the general wouldn't disagree with you either. And we are all --

SEN. MCCAIN: But the general said it would be just as easy --

SEC. KERRY: No, we're deeply --

SEN. MCCAIN: Let's not get into that when we just --

SEC. KERRY: All I want to -- all I want to say to you is that there were leaks, which are the bane of everybody's existence, and the fact is that the newspapers began to carry stories about a strike in targeting well before any decisions were made, and that began a process of moving. So now there is the belief --

SEN. MCCAIN: OK. I got it. I really would like to move on to some more important questions, if you don't mind.

SEC. KERRY: Well, I thought all your questions were important, John.

SEN. MCCAIN: (Chuckles.) Thank you, John. That's good. I'll try to remember that.

The president said today that the purpose of the military action in Syria is not just to respond to Assad's use of chemical weapons but to degrade his military capabilities as part of a broader strategy to change the momentum on the ground and, as the president said, quote, allow Syria ultimately to free itself. Do you agree with that assessment, John?

SEC. KERRY: I said upfront, I've said several times here, they will automatically be, as a result of degrading his ability for chemical weapons, there will be downstream impact, which will have an impact on his military capacity.

SEN. MCCAIN: And to let --

SEC. KERRY: I agree with the president.

SEN. MCCAIN: Thank you. General Dempsey, do you agree with that statement of the president's?

GEN. DEMPSEY: I agree. I have never been told to change the momentum. I have been told to degrade capability.

SEN. MCCAIN: Do you think, General, that without a change in momentum, that Syria ultimately could free itself? Secretary Hagel?

SEN. HAGEL: Well, Senator, I think they all are connected. Degrading a military capability, as you know, is a -- is a pretty significant part of momentum shifts.

SEN. MCCAIN: Secretary Kerry -- John, over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal ran an important op-ed by Dr. Elizabeth O'Bagy -- I hope you saw it -- a Syria analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, spent a great deal of time inside Syria, including just this month.

And I want to read her assessment of the situation on the ground. And I quote the story. ""The conventional wisdom holds that the extremist elements are completely mixed in with the more moderate rebel groups; this isn't the case. Moderates and extremists wield control over distinct territory. Contrary to many media accounts, the war in Syria is not being waged entirely or even predominately by dangerous Islamists and al-Qaida die-hards. The jihadists pouring into Syria from countries like Iraq and Lebanon are not flocking to the front lines. Instead, they are concentrating their efforts on consolidating control in the northern rebel-held areas of the country. Moderate opposition forces -- a collection of groups known as the Free Syrian Army -- continue to lead the fight against the Syrian regime. While traveling with some of these Free Syrian Army battalions, I've watched them defend Alawi and Christian villages from government forces and extremist groups. They've demonstrated a willingness to submit to civilian authority, working closely with local administrative councils, and they've struggled to ensure that their fight against Assad will pave the way for a flourishing civil society.""

John, do you agree with Dr. O'Bagy's assessment of the opposition?

SEC. KERRY: I agree with most of that. They have changed significantly. They have improved, and as I said earlier, the fundamentals of Syria are secular, and I believe, will stay that way.

SEN. MCCAIN: And I think it's very important to point out, again, as you just said -- it's a secular state. They would reject radical Islamists, and they, in some cases -- in the areas in which they have control, the people are demonstrating against them, is the information I have.

So when we see these commentators say, well, we don't know which side will win; we don't know, you know, who the bad -- who the bad guys are, if you agree with this assessment, we certainly know who the bad guys are. Is that correct?

SEC. KERRY: I believe we do, for the most part.

SEN. MCCAIN: For the most --

SEC. KERRY: There are -- there are some worse than al-Nusra, and they tend to be, most of them, in the northern area and the -- and the east.

SEN. MCCAIN: I thank you. And again, I'd like to ask again, can you assure the committee that the administration does not see a protracted stalemate and conflict in Syria as somehow a good thing or a goal of U.S. policy?

SEC. KERRY: The goal of U.S. policy is not a stalemate. The goal is a negotiated solution which results in the departure of Assad and the free choice of the Syrian people for their future.

SEN. MCCAIN: And finally, I'd like to ask again, if we reject this resolution, doesn't it send a serious -- as you already said, a seriously bad message to our friends and allies alike, encourages our enemies and would dispirit our friends, particularly those fighting in Syria, but not only there but around the world?

SEC. KERRY: Senator McCain, I have gotten to know my counterparts in the Mideast particularly well because of the number of crises and initiatives that we've had to deal with in that region. And I cannot emphasize enough how much they are looking to us now, making judgments about us for the long term, and how critical the choice we make here will be, not just to this question of Syria but to the support we may or may not anticipate in the Mideast peace process, to the future of Egypt, to the transformation of the Middle East, to the stability of the region and other interests that we have.

There's no way to separate one thing from all of the rest. Relationships are relationships and they are integrated. And that's why this is so important.

SEN. MCCAIN: But I would also emphasize, if it's the wrong kind of resolution it can do just as much damage, in my view.

I thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Thank you, Senator.

Senator Udall.

SENATOR TOM UDALL (D-NM): Thank you. Thank you, very much. And I thank all the witnesses for their testimony and for their service here today. And I also want to thank Chairman Menendez for the way he has conducted his hearing.

Like everyone here, I deplore what Bashar al-Assad has done to his own people. By attacking them with chemical weapons Assad has committed an atrocious crime so heinous that international law singles it out as an assault deserving of international action. But let there be no mistake, I fully agree his horrific acts deserve an international response.

But what should that response be? That is why we are here today, to ask that question and many others. And I hope this hearing will do more than just rubber stamp a decision that has already been made by this administration. I have grave concerns about what the administration is asking of us, of our military and of the American people.

Here's the situation as I see it: With limited international support, we are being told the United States must retaliate for the use of chemical weapons with a surgical bombing campaign of our own.

We're being told we're bombing in order to send a message. But what message are we sending? To the international community we're saying once again the United States will be the world's policeman. You break a law, and the United States will step in.

We are on shaky international legal foundations with this potential strike, and we need to know whether we exhausted all diplomatic and economic sanction options to affect Syria's behavior. We need to increase our attention on the source of Assad's ability to continue to ruthlessly kill his own people, and that is support from nations including Russia and China, who are cynically trying to hold the moral high ground. Assad would not be able to maintain his grip on power if he were not being supported from outside. The full force of international outrage should come down on those nations that are refusing to allow the U.N. to act and find a solution.

And finally, I see this potential bombing campaign as a potential next step towards full-fledged war. We've been here before. The Iraq War began as an international effort to kick Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, and then years of a no-fly zone and airstrikes to prevent Saddam from threatening his neighbors or reconstituting his arsenal of chemical weapons. And as we all know, this limited military action eventually led to what is one of the biggest blunders in U.S. foreign policy: a war that I voted against. Many who voted for it came to regret that vote.

Americans are understandably weary. After the fiasco of Iraq and over a decade of war, how can can this administration make a guarantee that our military actions will be limited?

How can we guarantee that one surgical strike will have any impact other than to tighten the vice grip Assad has on his power or allow rebels allied with al-Qaida to gain a stronger foothold in Syria?

I take our role extremely seriously here, like many of the other senators have said, and I will hear the president and his team out. The president made the right decision to pursue an authorization for the use of military force. I hope these hearings will give the American people the answers they deserve. But there are troubling questions that need to be answered. And Secretary Kerry, I want to start with you.

You've assured the American people -- I watched your national television performances -- that the U.S. action will not include, and I think you've said this here today, will not include the use of ground troops, that it will be limited in nature to deter Assad and others from using weapons of mass destruction. Yet the draft authorization of force proposed by the administration states that it would allow the president to use the armed forces -- and I quote here -- as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in connection with the use of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in the conflict with Syria.

Now, this is a very open-ended proposal with no specific limits on types of forces that would be used, with no limit on their duration. Why was it proposed in a way that it conflicts with the statements of no ground troops? And what kind of language Secretary Kerry or the precise language are you willing to back in terms of showing the American people that we really mean what we say in terms of no boots on the ground?

SEC. KERRY: Senator, all good questions, and I will respond to all of them. But I want to -- I want to -- I want to address sort of the suspicion and concern that you have, which is appropriate. I think everybody understands that Iraq left a lot of folks reeling for some period of time. So it's appropriate to ask the questions you've asked.

But please let me try to emphasize: This is not sending a message per se. This is having an effect, an impact. This is taking action to achieve something more than just a message. It is to degrade his current capacity. It'll make it harder for him to do that in the future, and it will also facilitate our ability to hold him accountable in the future if he does. And he will know that. So this will affect his calculation. That's number one. That's not just a message.

SEN. UDALL: Secretary Kerry, by degrading his capacity, don't you in fact make him weaker and make the people out there like al- Nusra and al-Qaida and these other extremist forces stronger? And this is what I want General Dempsey to talk about in a little bit too, but --

SEC. KERRY: Well, I'm happy to --

SEN. UDALL: -- could you answer that? Could you answer that? By degrading him, you make these extremist forces stronger, do you not?

SEC. KERRY: No, I don't believe you do. As a matter of fact, I think you actually make the opposition stronger. And the opposition is getting stronger by the day now. And I think General Idris would tell you that, that he is not sitting around, and his daily concern is not the opposition; it's Assad and what Assad is doing with his Scuds, with is airplanes, with his tanks, with his artillery to the people of Syria.

But I think it's important also to look at this -- because you raised the question of doesn't this make the United States the policeman of the world. No. It makes the United States a multilateral partner in an effort that the world, 184 nations strong, has accepted the responsibility for. And if the United States, which has the greatest capacity to do that, doesn't help lead that effort, then shame on us. Then we're not standing up to our multilateral and humanitarian and strategic interest.

Now, that said -

SEN. UDALL: Can I stop you, Secretary Kerry, just there on that one --

SEC. KERRY: (Any time ?).

SEN. UDALL: -- because if you're talking about multilateral efforts, what we're talking about is the world being able -- this is a breach of a treaty, and the world put within the United Nations that enforcement mechanism. And what we have done here, with Russia and China holding up the ability of the U.N. to act, we've just turned --

SEC. KERRY: Well, Senator, with all due respect --

SEN. UDALL: -- (inaudible). We should be standing up. We should be standing up and making sure that they are condemned, those countries that are not allowing us to move forward to find a solution where the solution should reside. I just --

SEC. KERRY: Well, Senator, I don't disagree that we should be finding the solution where it resides. But the fact is that just a few weeks ago, just a few weeks ago, at the U.N. we sought a condemnation of a chemical attack -- without blame, without citing Assad, without saying who was responsible -- simply a condemnation of a chemical attack, and the Russians blocked it.

SEN. UDALL: Right.

SEC. KERRY: So we have no illusions. Yes, is the U.N. Security Council having difficulties at this moment performing its functions?

x x functions? Yes. Does that mean the United States of America and the rest of the world that thinks we ought to act should shrink from it? No. And that's really what's at test here. I would urge you -- you said, how do we know it won't result in X or Y or Z happening if we don't do it?

Let me ask you: I -- it's not a question of what will happen if we don't do it; it's a certainty. Are you going to be comfortable if Assad, as a result of the United States not doing anything, then gasses his people yet again and they -- and the world says, why didn't the United States act? History is full of opportunity of moments where someone didn't stand up and act when it made a difference. And whether you go back to World War II or you look at a ship that was turned away from the coast of Florida and everybody on it lost their lives subsequently to German gas, those are the things that make a difference. And that's what's at stake here.

And I would say to you, you know, these are troubling questions -- it's a guarantee, if the United States doesn't act together with other countries, we know what Assad will do. That's a guarantee. I can't tell you what's guaranteed that some country will do if we do act, but I know what will happen if we don't. And I'm pretty darn clear that a lot of things that people think will happen won't happen if the United States acts; it will in fact have enforced this international standard with respect to the use of chemical weapons.

And if the multilateral institution's set up to do it, the Security Council is being blocked and won't do it, that doesn't mean we should turn our backs and say there's nothing we can do. That's not the case. And we did it in Bosnia and made a difference; we saved countless numbers of lives. And I believe, Mr. -- the president of the United States believes we can do that now.

SEN. UDALL: Well, I don't believe that we -- I don't believe that we should have given up so easily on using the United Nations, using --

SEC. KERRY: We haven't given up.

SEN. UDALL: -- yes, we have.

We haven't -- we haven't taken Russia to task. We haven't taken China to task. And that's what we should be pointing out at this point.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Time of -- time of the senator is expired.

SEN. UDALL: Oh, I mean we -- I want to respectfully disagree with you and say also I very much appreciate your service. I know that you're trying very, very hard to find, on the diplomatic side, as secretary of state, a peace resolution.

Thank you for your courtesy. Sorry for going over.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Senator Barrasso.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

Thank you for being here.

Over Labor Day weekend in Wyoming, I heard from people all across the state. All believe what is happening in Syria is awful, despicable, do have concerns about the administration and what the plan really is, what a strategy really is. They want to know what the core national security interests of the United States are that are at stake in Syria, what is our ultimate goal of proposed military strikes and what happens if the strikes are not effective.

And to that end, Mr. Chairman, I would -- I would ask you what exactly it is that we are going to be voting on. Is it what the White House has set forward? And when we're going to see the specifics? I think Senator Durbin also asked about the narrowness or the expanse of what would be -- and would we be voting within the next 24 hours?

SEN. MENENDEZ: The chair is working with the ranking member and others to come to an agreed-upon text that we believe would meet the goals of achieving the ability for the administration to pursue the military action they have sought the Congress' support for in a way that would allow them to have the maximum ability to succeed in that action but by the same token tailor it sufficiently so that this is not an open-ended engagement, and specifically not with boots on the ground, American troops on the ground.

We're not there yet. It is our aspiration to try to get there before the end of the day and then to look forward to the possibility of a markup tomorrow.

We'll see if we can get there, and if we do we'll give all members ample notice of that time. We start off in the morning, as I said, with a classified briefing and we'll move from there.

SEN. BARRASSO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Secretary, I appreciate you coming to Congress to seek legislative authorization for the military action. President Obama specifically asserted on Saturday that he already had the authority. Now, when the British Parliament rejected a motion supporting U.K. participation, the prime minister specifically said that he would respect the will of the British people and would -- there would be no British military intervention. Where does President Obama stand with that, based -- now that he has come to Congress?

SEC. KERRY: He intends to win the passage of the resolution.

SEN. BARRASSO: And on the case that he does not, are you still -- is the plan the he --

SEC. KERRY: Well, we're not contemplating that because it's too dire.

SEN. BARRASSO: OK. We talked a little bit about the risks of delays. There are already reports that by delaying military action that Assad is moving military assets, hardware, troops to civilian neighborhoods. Reports indicate that Russia plans to send an anti- submarine ship, missile cruiser, to the Mediterranean in the next few days. I wonder what this means to our contingency planning and what this impact is going to be for our military operations.

GEN. DEMPSEY: Well, the movement of the Russian -- there's already four Russian warships in the eastern Med. And if the -- they are staying a respectful distance. I don't see that as a factor.

SEN. BARRASSO: Has the administration created -- conducted, perhaps, a threat assessment of how Russia, how Iran, how Hezbollah is going to respond to a U.S.-led attack? And what response do we expect from Syria's allies including, you know, Russia, Iran, Hezbollah, to our -- to military action?

SEC. KERRY: We all agree that that would be best handled in a classified session.

SEN. BARRASSO: All right.

The -- in terms of what success looks like, I think Senator Udall specifically, you know, said, what happens if gases are used again? I'm wondering, if we do a limited strike, as proposed, and still Assad goes back and uses chemical weapons on his people -- and that engenders an entire new set of hearings? How does this -- how does this end? Where we are we a month from now?

GEN. DEMPSEY: Well, as I said, Senator, the -- there's a -- we're preparing several target sets, the first of which would set the conditions for follow-on assessments, and the others would be used if necessary and on -- we haven't gotten to that point yet. What we do know is that we can degrade and disrupt his capabilities and that that should put us in a better position to make the kind of assessment you're talking about.

SEC. KERRY: Let me -- let me add to that, if I can, John. Senator Feinstein brought this up today at the meeting at the White House. It would be really -- it would not be sensible to pass this resolution with a view to degrading and degrading his capacity and preventing him from doing it -- if he were foolish enough to do it again, the general does have follow-on possibilities. And since the objective would remain the same, it'd be important for Assad himself to know that you have no limited this to one specific moment with respect to chemical weapons. You can still have a limited authorization, but with respect to chemical weapons, it'd be a huge mistake to deprive General Dempsey and company of their options to enforce what we're trying to achieve.

SEN. BARRASSO: Trying to achieve, Mr. Secretary -- the negotiated departure of Assad. You keep mentioning -- trying to get him to do this from the negotiating table. It seems to me that somebody who will, as Senator Coons said, go to any length to stay in power to the point of even using chemical weapons against his people -- that -- wouldn't he be just driven to a more serious level of determination to keep power rather than the negotiation table?

SEC. KERRY: John, it's a very decent -- it's a very appropriate question. And the answer is, I don't believe so, and there are a number of different reasons why I don't believe so. And most of them are best discussed -- and I look forward to it with you in the private session -- but there are very strong indications from a number of -- a number of discussions that have taken place between countries and individuals over the last months that Assad would not necessarily avoid making a different decision under certain circumstances. So I think we ought to leave it at that, but in the private session, I think we ought to dig into it.

SEN. BARRASSO: I was going to ask about the chemical weapons stockpiles -- and maybe you want to reserve this for the discussion tomorrow as well, in terms of steps that we could take in terms of command and control of the regime's chemical weapons stockpiles to make sure that these things are protected in a way that could not (potentially ?) be used.

SEC. KERRY: Absolutely. And I want you to know -- and this is, again, something that ought to be done in the other session, but I will just say generically that General Dempsey and his team have taken great pains, at the instruction of the president of the United States, to make certain that whatever we do doesn't make it -- doesn't make people less safe or potentially more exposed to weapons or that those weapons would have less control and so forth.

All of these things have entered into the calculation.

SEN. BARRASSO: Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Thank you, Senator Barrasso. Just one add-on to my original response to you. The resolution as sent to us by the administration will not be the resolution that we will be working on, but it is a good opening as to what the desires are, intentions are, but it will not be the specific resolution we'll be working on.

Senator Murphy.

SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Kerry, Secretary Hagel, General, thank you very much for being with us and for taking so much time with us.

We all are referencing the conversations that we've had over the last week. I've never, frankly, seen a greater level of public engagement on an issue since, frankly, the health care reform debate of 2009. And while there are certainly hard-liners that have come to me with a resolution that we should go in, or many more with a resolution that we should stay out, most people see both sides of this issue. And they, frankly, appreciate the fact that they have an American president who has taken so much time and put in so much thought into arriving at this decision, even if they disagree.

And they, frankly, appreciate even more the fact that this president trusts them and trusts their elected representatives enough to bring this conversation to the United States Congress, albeit the fact that it may be a little messy to get from Point A to Point B. And so given all of the commotion that we will hear from our constituents, that, maybe more than anything else, comes out to me loud and clear.

I guess when I look at this question, I see two questions inherent in the one. One, we have to ask ourselves, is there a moral or national security imperative?

And I think you've very plainly made the case, as has the president, that there is atrocities committed that we cannot let stand and a country that has very vital security interests to the United States.

But there's a second question, and that's the one that I have trouble with and I think some of my colleagues have trouble with. And that's this: Will our action lessen the acuity of that moral atrocity or advance or national security interest? There both has to be a problem that needs to be solved and then a way to solve it. And that's why I struggle with this.

And frankly, I don't think the fact that I and many others struggle with that question means that we lack courage or that we are, frankly, enabling the Syrian regime. I just think it's that we wonder whether there is a limit to the ability of American military power to influence the politics on the ground in the Middle East.

And clearly, though there is not some direct linkage between what happened in Iraq and what happened in Syria, it does chill the ability of people to believe that American military might can influence politics on the ground in Syria after they have watched the last 10 years.

The second problem people have is this question of escalation. And I think one of the most important things, Secretary Kerry, that you said in your prepared remarks was this. You said that we would be prepared to respond to, I think as you stated, a miscalculation of Assad, whether it be in reprisals against his own people or attacks against our allies in the region, that we would be prepared to respond without going to war. Now, some people will find that statement a little incongruous. How do you respond without going to war?

And so let me maybe ask the question this way. There are a variety of responses from Assad. He could launch another chemical weapons attack against his own people. He could launch a ferocious conventional weapons attack against his own people.

He could -- of course, he or his allies could launch attacks against our allies in the region.

I don't expect you necessarily to explain exactly what the response will be today, but does this resolution that we're debating today give you the ability to respond to those reprisals or in any of those situations that I just outlined, responses within Syria against his own people or responses outside of Syria against our allies? Would you have to come back to Congress for a new authorization of force?

SEC. KERRY: Well -- excuse me, sorry. As I think the president has made clear and as we have seen in many of these crisis (ph) over the course certainly of my career here in the Senate, I saw presidents do both, and I supported some and I opposed others. And on a number of occasions, presidents acted without the authorization of Congress. So there is no question but that the president would have the authority and the right, and conceivably, the imperative to respond without any other authorization if Assad were to attack again. And so I can't -- you know, I can't speak for the president in terms of what decision he would make, but he has the authority, and that right would be available to him.

Now, if I can just say quickly with respect to -- you know, it's absolutely appropriate to ask the question: Will this make a difference -- totally appropriate -- and to think about this question of escalation.

But let me -- let me say something quickly about both of those. If the Congress decides not to do this, it is a guarantee, whether it is with Assad in Syria, or nuclear weapons in Iran, or nuclear weapons in North Korea, we will have invited a for-certain confrontation at some point in time that will require you to make a choice that will be even worse, with a potential even greater conflict.

That, I guarantee you because that's the message that will be sent.

Now, there's a distinction between this and Iraq. I understand all the Iraq -- you know, we lived through that here. In Iraq, intelligence purported to suggest that weapons of mass destruction existed but we didn't know if they existed. And so we had a massive invasion in order to try to find out if they existed. And we found out they didn't.

Here, we have weapons of mass destruction that we not only know do exist, they have been used. Not once, not twice, not three times, but multiple times -- we estimate in the teens and the opposition estimates more than that. And now we have this most recent use of weapons of mass destruction in contravention of nearly a hundred years of a prohibition against their use.

SEN. MURPHY: OK, but that's -- I don't think that's the dispute. The dispute is not that there's a correlation between intelligence --

SEC. KERRY: Well, but the dispute is -- the dispute is what are you going to do about it?

SEN. MURPHY: -- it's the ability of the military to be able to influence the reality on the ground.

SEC. KERRY: No, no. But, Chris, the dispute is what are you prepared to do about it. That's the dispute. If you believe that by doing nothing you are going to stand up for the norm and somehow reduce the threat of the use at some future time, that's your right to believe that. But I think and the president believes deeply and everybody at this table believes that flies against all common sense and all human behavior.

SEN. MURPHY: Mr. Secretary, let me ask just a question about Iran because I think it's very important and a compelling narrative here.

Let me just ask you this. The circumstances are very different. Not to trivialize what has happened in Syria, but the stakes of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, which could kill millions, is different than Syria killing thousands with chemical weapons. And I wonder whether or not it lessens our moral authority to make a different decision with respect to Iran just because on Syria, we decided not to act.

And second, I worry about this weariness that we've talked about within the American public that it may ultimately make it harder -- I'm not saying it will, but it could make it harder for us to rally the American public with respect to a response to Iran having gone through what could be at least a slightly protracted engagement with Syria.

And so I just -- I guess I want to challenge you for a second on the automatic nature of a failure to step in in Syria with respect to compromising our ability to respond in Iran.

SEC. KERRY: Well, let me -- let me just make it very, very clear. The world decided after World War I and the horrors of gas in the trenches and the loss of an entire generation of young people in Europe that we would never again going to allow gas to be used in warfare. And so if all of a sudden at this moment, where the third instance -- it was used by Adolf Hitler to gas millions of Jews; it was used by Saddam Hussein in order to gas Iraqis and his own -- Iranians and his own people; and now it has been used by Bashar al- Assad. Three people in all of history. And if the United States, knowing it and knowing that we've drawn a line that the world has drawn with us, is unwilling to stand up and confront that, it is an absolute certainty that gas will proliferate. We've had sarin gas in the Tokyo subway.

Do you really want to have a situation where that gas may be available to these groups if it continues to deteriorate, because Assad can use this gas to continue to subjugate his population that's looking for a governance that is, you know, representative and different and respectful of their rights? I don't know how we could live with that.

Now, is there a difference between gas and a nuclear weapon? Well, I suppose it would depend on the scale, to be honest with you. It would depend on the scale. But the world decided that chemical, biological and nuclear are the, you know, prohibited entities of warfare, and we as a nation and we as a global community have struggled to try to enforce that through the years. It's hard for me to imagine that the United States would not stand with the world against that.

Now, is it going to be effective? I'm convinced that what we can do will reduce the possibilities of more use of gas and degrade his capacity to use this weapon. And I think it's imperative for us. As I've said again and again, we all have to take that step. But it's significantly different from what took place in Iraq originally with respect to weapons that we didn't know existed, and the two just are not similar.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Senator Paul.

SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-KY): Thank you for coming today.

It's not often that I get to compliment the president. I can probably count the number of times maybe on one hand. But when I first heard that the president was going to come to Congress, boy, was I pleasantly surprised. I was proud that he was my president. I didn't vote for him, and I still am opposed to him quite a few times, but I was proud that he did this.

And so that does concern me. I want to be proud of the president, but every time I'm just about there, then I get worried that really, he doesn't mean it, that he's going to sort of obey the Constitution if he wins. So I heard Secretary Kerry say, if we win, sure, but if we lose, what? I mean, make me proud today, Secretary Kerry. Stand up for us and say, you're going to obey the Constitution and if we vote you down, which is unlikely, but if we do, you would go with what the people say through their Congress, and you wouldn't go forward with the war that your Congress votes against. Can you give me a better answer, Secretary Kerry?

SEC. KERRY: I can't give you a different answer than the one I gave you. I don't know what the president's decision is, but I will tell you this, it ought to make you proud, because he still has the constitutional authority, and he would be in keeping with the Constitution.

SEN. PAUL: Well, I disagree with you there. I don't believe he has the constitutional authority. I think Congress had -- has this. Madison was very explicit when he wrote ""The Federalist Papers,"" he wrote that history supposes or the Constitution supposes what history demonstrates, that the executive is the -- is the branch most likely to go to war, and therefore, the Constitution vested that power in the Congress. It's explicit and runs throughout all of Madison's writings. This power is a congressional power and it is not an executive power. They didn't say big war, small war; they didn't say boots on the ground, not boots on the ground. They said, declare war. Ask the people on the ships launching the missiles whether they're involved with war or not.

If we do not say that the Constitution applies, if we do not say explicitly that we will abide by this vote, you're making a joke of us. You're making us into theater. And so we play constitutional theater for the president. If this is real, you will abide by the verdict of Congress. You're probably going to win; just go ahead and say it's real. And let's have a real debate in this country and not a meaningless debate that in the end you lose and you say, oh, well, we have the authority anyway. We're going to go ahead and go to war anyway.

A couple of items --

SEC. KERRY: Senator, I assure you there's nothing meaningless, and there is everything real about what -- (inaudible).

SEN. PAUL: Only if you adhere to what we vote on. Only if our vote makes a difference. Only if our vote is binding is it meaningful.

SEC. KERRY: And I will leave to the man who was elected to be president of the United States the responsibility for telling you what his decision is, if and when that moment came. But the president intends to win this vote, and he's not going to make prior announcement.

SEN. PAUL: We've had a lot of discussion about, you know, whether or not we're going to make the world safer with this. Somehow, we're going to have less chemical weapons. But I think that's an open question, and I think it's conjecture at best. You can say, oh, well, we think Assad will be less likely to launch chemical weapons after this. We may be able to degrade his capacity somewhat. He's got a thousand tons. Are we going to wipe it out? Most reports I hear say we're not even probably going to directly bomb chemical weapons because of what might happen to the surrounding population. So my guess is he still will have the ability.

Most people say Assad acted very illogically. Why would he release chemical weapons on his own people when it brought the anger and enmity of the entire world? So he's already acting irrationally or illogically, and now we're going to deter him and he's going to act in a rational manner. I think it's equally likely that he either does it again or he doesn't do it. I don't think you can say for certain which is better. I don't know that we can say that by attacking them, he's not going to launch another chemical attack.

SEC. KERRY: Well --

SEN. PAUL: Will region -- will the region -- I've got a few of them and then I'll stop. Will the region be more stable, or less stable? We all say we want stability in the Middle East, and stability in the Middle East is a national interest for our country. Will it be more stable, or less stable? I frankly think there are equal arguments on both sides of that. Will Israel be more likely to suffer an attack on them, a gas attack or otherwise, or less likely?

I think there's a valid argument for saying they'll be more likely to suffer an attack if we do this. Will Russia be more likely or less likely to supply more arms or get more heavily involved in this? I think there's a valid argument that they may become more likely to be involved. Iran -- more likely or less likely to be involved with this? If Iran gets involved, more likely or less likely that Israel launches a reprisal attack on Iran?

There are all kinds of unknowns that I can't tell you absolutely the answer, and neither can you, but I think there's a reasonable argument that the world may be less stable because of this and that it may not deter any chemical weapons attack.

So what I would ask is how are we to know? How are we to go home -- I haven't had one person come up to me and say they're for this war, not one person. We get calls by the thousands. Nobody's calling in favor of this war. I didn't meet one when I was home all month. I went to 40 cities. I didn't have one person come up and say -- do they all agree it's a horrendous thing? Yes, we all agree that chemical attacks are a horrendous thing. But people are not excited about getting involved, and they also don't think it's going to work. And they're skeptical of what will occur with this.

But I'd appreciate your response, and try to reassure the rest of us, one, that the vote is meaningful and valid, that you'd adhere to it, and also that you're convinced that all of these different items will be better, not worse, by this attack.

SEC. KERRY: Well, Senator, I'd be very happy to do that. Will Israel be more likely to suffer an attack, or will they be safer; will they be less safe? I can make it crystal clear to you that Israel will be less safe unless the United States takes this action. Iran and Hezbollah are two of the three biggest allies of Assad. And Iran and Hezbollah are the two single biggest enemies of Israel. So if -- if -- if Iran and Hezbollah are advantaged by the United States not curbing Assad's use of chemical weapons, there is a much greater likelihood that at some point down the road, Hezbollah, who has been one of the principal reasons for a change in the situation on the ground, will have access to these weapons of mass destruction. And Israel will for certain be less secure.

SEN. PAUL: But I would also argue that --

SEC. KERRY: Let me just finish.

SEN. PAUL: -- it would be more likely that Hezbollah will attack, because of this attack, in response.

SEC. KERRY: And Israel feels quite confident of its ability to deal with Hezbollah if they were to do so. You will notice that Israel has on several occasions in the last year seen fit to deal with threats to its security because of what's in Syria, and not once has Assad responded to that to date. I think there are a bunch of things we should talk about in a -- in a classified session.

But let me just make it very clear to you that -- you know, you ask these questions, will this or that be more likely to happen or not likely to happen. If the United States of America doesn't do this, Senator, is it more or less likely that Assad does it again? You want to answer that question?

SEN. PAUL: I don't think it's known. I don't think it's known --

SEC. KERRY: Is it more or less likely that he does it again?

SEN. PAUL: -- (inaudible) -- the attack. I think it's unknown whether it's more or less likely (whether you have ?) the attack.

SEC. KERRY: It's unknown? Senator, it's not unknown. If the United States of America doesn't hold him accountable on this, with our allies and friends, it's a guarantee Assad will do it again. A guarantee. And I urge you to go to the classified briefing and learn that.

Secondly, let me just point out to you that with respect to this question of Americans wanting to go to war, you know, you got three people here who've been to war. You got John McCain, who's been to war. There's not one of us who doesn't understand what going to war means, and we don't want to go to war. We don't believe we are going to war in the classic sense of taking American troops and America to war. The president is asking for the authority to do a limited action that will degrade the capacity of a tyrant who has been using chemical weapons to kill his own people.

SEN. PAUL: But I think by doing so, you announce -- you announce --

SEC. KERRY: It's a limited -- it's limited.

SEN. PAUL: By doing so you announce in advance that your goal is not winning.

SEC. KERRY: But that's not what --

SEN. PAUL: And I think the last 50 years of secretaries of defense would say if your goal is not to win, then you shouldn't be involved.

SEC. KERRY: Senator, when people are asked, do you want to go to war with Syria, of course not. Everybody, a hundred percent of Americans will say no. We say no. We don't want to go to war in Syria either. It's not what we're here to ask. The president is not asking you to go to war. He's not asking you to declare war. He's not asking you to send one American troop to war. He's simply saying we need to take an action that can degrade the capacity of a man who's been willing to kill his own people by breaking a nearly hundred-year- old prohibition, and will we stand up and be counted to say, we won't do that. That's not -- I don't -- you know, I just don't consider that going to war in the classic sense of coming to Congress and asking for a declaration of war and training troops and sending people abroad and putting young Americans in harm's way. That's not what the president is asking for here.

General, do you want to speak to that, alter that?

GEN. DEMPSEY: No, not really, Secretary. Thank you for offering.

SEC. KERRY: Right. (Laughter.)

SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-VA): (Off mic.) Great. Thank you to all of you. This has been a good discussion.

I want to echo what Senator Paul, Senator Durbin and others have said: I very much appreciate and celebrated the president's decision to bring this matter to Congress. I also believe with others that the Constitution reserves the power to initiate military action to Congress. Five hundred and thirty-five people get to vote on that.

There's only one commander-in-chief after the vote is taken, after we do that searching inquiry. It's the commander-in-chief that has to decide how to execute the decided-upon mission, but I applaud the president for doing it. I view it not only as a matter of constitutional law, I view it as reflecting a very important underlying value, and the value is this -- we shouldn't put servicemembers into initiating battle -- putting people into harm's way if they don't have the consensus behind them -- the American public political leadership is behind them. To send young men and women into war or into a military action where they are exercising military options with a divided political leadership class is the worst thing we can do. And so we need to come to a consensus and then execute on that consensus, whatever it is. And it would be my hope that Congress' consensus would then be what the president would do and not otherwise.

There is a basic principle at stake. I think you've stated it well: it's the principle of international law and American law. No use of weapons of mass destruction against civilians. I don't know of a higher principle of the relations of states -- of the law of nations, of sort of international legal morality than no use of weapons of mass destruction against civilians. And that is the principle that is at stake as we wrestle with this request of the president on this committee. That is a principle that is very clear. As you said, Secretary Kerry, it's not about, do weapons of mass destruction exist; they exist. It's not just whether they exist; they've been used. They've been used against civilians -- they've been used against civilians on a massive scale, including women and children.

And so it's a principle that is squarely at stake. We know that Bashar al-Assad does not care about the principle. Contrary to things that you've said, we know that Vladimir Putin, until he shows otherwise, does not care about the principle. I hope Congress still cares about the principle. It is a principle of long-standing origin. Syria signed onto it. The Geneva Convention. The Soviet Union signed onto the Geneva Convention and then again in the 1990s era chemical weapons convention as Russia under the leadership of the -- of the previous president, President Yeltsin. So we know that there are some who don't care, but I hope that Congress shows that we do care by our action.

Couple of questions. First, Russia. I want to associate with something that Senator Udall said earlier. The fact that they -- we have not done enough to demonstrate that Russia has essentially become a pariah nation by being pro-chemical weapons. It is hard to read their action and come up with any conclusion other than the current governor -- government of Russia is pro use of chemical weapons against civilians.

We should make them wear being the pro-chemical weapons like a rotting carcass around their neck in every instance we can so that at some point they'll ask themselves the question: Do we really want to be the nation that is pro use of chemical weapons against a civilian population? If we make that as painful as we can ever day at the U.N., even if they're going to block it we come back with another.

We should make it painful every day so that at some point they'll ask themselves the question: Why do we want to carry this water for a dictator who's using chemical weapons against his own civilians? We haven't done enough on that score. The fact that they're going to block us shouldn't dissuade us. We should do more and more and more. I think that will ultimately contribute to a political negotiation.

When I asked you the question about the Syrian opposition's position on chemical weapons I was unclear about their position on chemical weapons, but I understand that the opposition may have made some commitments and compacts that have been negotiated, Mr. Secretary, that they are anti-chemical weapons, that they would commit to turn over chemical weapons to the international community either if they take control of those weapons during the course of this civil war or whether they are in the lead in a post-Assad government.

Can you talk about the opposition and their commitment to get rid of this stockpile of chemical weapons that is currently being used?

SEC. KERRY: Yeah, we've had some discussions with him about that, and I hope that when the president comes here, when President Jarba comes here, that he will make that position clear to all of you.

SEN. KAINE: That would be very helpful. I think that would be one of the best things the opposition could do, is make that plain.

There is a little bit of a confusion. I think we can talk shorthand here in ways that might make it hard for senators and certainly the public to follow. We are here talking about military action on the same time we're saying there will be no solution to this civil war that's not a negotiated political solution. So those can seem to be at odds.

I want to state my understanding of how they fit together, and you tell me if I'm right or wrong. If we take action, action to degrade the ability of Syria to use chemical weapons, action to degrade their ability to violate international law, it will take away a significant asset that they have in their battle against the opposition. It will level the playing field by removing the ability to use chemical weapons, and it will therefore increase the odds that the parties will then come to the table to try to figure out that political solution. Is that the connection between the military option you are proposing and the stated end goal of a solution to the civil war only being -- only being achieved through a political end?

SEC. KERRY: It's the collateral connection to it. It's not the purpose of it, but it is a collateral connection.

SEN. KAINE: I don't have any other questions, Mr. Chair. I'll save them for tomorrow.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Thank you.

Senator Markey.

SENATOR EDWARD MARKEY (D-MA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much. Without question, there is great horror and disgust at Assad's use of chemical weapons, and great sympathy for the people of Syria, that their leader would use chemical weapons upon his own people and that his murderous regime is so dedicated to retaining power that they would use those weapons.

At the same time, in our own country, there is great concern that we could be invoking the law of unintended consequences as we talk about using our own military in Syria. Back in 2001 and 2002, the threat obviously was that the next attack at the United States could come in the form of a mushroom -- a mushroom cloud from Iraq. And although there were inspectors on the ground for 100 days in Iraq -- could not find it before the war started, nonetheless, that war began. And I think people are understandably apprehensive about what we're talking about right now, because of what did precipitate that war in Iraq.

So I continue to look forward to additional evidence being presented and my hope is that we can act in a way that does not bog us down into the middle of a Syrian civil war. I think there are many people who want us in the middle of the Syrian civil war, many people. But I don't think that the American people do. I think they are very wary of having our country once again drawn into a civil war in another country.

The concern that I think many people have is that we don't fully understand as well what the reaction of the Russians will be to this action. So General, you -- and I thank you, General, and Secretary Kerry and Secretary Hagel, for your -- this is a tough job, and we really appreciate the sensitivity and the professionalism with which you are handling this.

You talked about the Russians now having four vessels in the eastern Mediterranean, but you did not seem to be that concerned about it. Syria is a proxy state of Russia. They provide the military assistance, the training to Syria. Are you concerned in any way that a strike by the United States could increase the amount of military assistance that Russia sends into the Syrian regime?

GEN. DEMPSEY: It could, Senator. I mean, they -- there is some indication that they have assured the regime that if we destroy something, they can replace it. But you know, that's not a reason for me to hesitate to act. And to the -- to your point, there's always unintended consequences of conflict, but as the secretary has mentioned, we know what the consequences could be, probably would be if we do not act.

SEN. MARKEY: Thank you. Mr. Secretary -- and Teresa, you look great. You look absolutely fantastic here today. It's my understanding that the U.N. chemical inspection team left Syria on Saturday and that U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon has directed the team to expedite the mission's analysis of the samples and information it has obtained. When do we expect to obtain that data and the analysis of -- made by the U.N., and when do we expect that information to be made public?

SEC. KERRY: I'm sorry, which information?

SEN. MARKEY: The United Nations inspection team.

SEC. KERRY: Senator -- by the way, Mr. Chairman, I'm looking over here at my successor in the United States Senate, and I don't know if there's a new initiation process here on the committee, but I notice he doesn't even get a nameplate. (Laughter.)

SEN. MARKEY: Oh, I -- (making an adjustment).

SEC. KERRY: Oh. (Laughter.) All right. I was worried about you.

SEN. MARKEY: In the House, they put it up for you. (Laughter.) So I'm learning what the protocol is over here.

SEN. : We're dealing with sequester, so you're -- (inaudible).

SEC. KERRY: I thought -- I thought Massachusetts was on an uneven keel here for a minute.

Senator, first of all, welcome to the committee and welcome to the Senate.

SEN. MARKEY: Thank you.

SEC. KERRY: It's good to see you here.

With respect to the U.N. process, we're hearing somewhere, you know, three weeks, anywhere from two to four weeks, I suppose, is the range, but I think about three weeks is what we've been told.

SEN. MARKEY: So would it be wise for us to wait for that information from the United Nations in order to ensure that there is a signal sent to the international community as to the veracity as to the analysis by the United States that chemical weapons have been used?

SEC. KERRY: Well, let me speak to that, because it's a very important and legitimate question. First of all, the mandate of the United Nations inspection team, which we have great respect for and we're grateful to them and to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for their courageous effort to go in under difficult circumstances -- and we have obviously pushed for inspections in other circumstances -- the distinction here is that their mandate will only allow them to say that a chemical weapons attack took place. They have no mandate to assign blame, who did it. And Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has reaffirmed that this is in fact what they won't do. They won't assign blame. They will confirm what happened. Now, can they provide additional information in terms of details and some additional evidence? The answer is yes. But will they tell us anything that we do not know today beyond a reasonable doubt? The answer is no.

They can't tell us because they don't have the technical means or the intelligence operation or the capacity in the -- to put together what we have released to the world in an unclassified document. And when you add what we have in classified form, that I obviously can't go into here, we have an even more persuasive case about what has happened here.

Now let me add to that, if I can, just one more thing. Iran and Syria itself have both admitted that a chemical weapons attack took place. So Iran and Syria are already telling us an attack took place. But they've chosen the improbable and illogical notion that the opposition did it, not the regime.

SEN. MARKEY: My only suggestion would be that the United States declassify a high percentage of the information that we have so that the American people and the international community can see it. And I think that would be helpful in this whole discussion, that if we declassify it, I think it would actually give more assurance to the international community.

SEC. KERRY: Sir, I understand. And I have to tell you, the unprecedented level of declassification already according to the intel community could possibly put at risk some sources and methods. Now, one of the reasons that it was chosen to release one is somehow it leaked from someplace in the world and it was already in several newspapers.

So as a result of that, it was -- it was further declassified.

But that itself is an intercept, an actual conversation now out in public that shows the regime acknowledging its own culpability and expressing fear about the U.N. discovering it. So there's already, it seems to me, a sufficient level without tempting fate on sources and methods.

SEN. MARKEY: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

And Secretary Hagel, if I may, just quickly, on the administration's draft resolution, would that draft -- authorization allow the U.S. military to conduct military operations outside of Syria?

SEC. HAGEL: No, it would not.

SEN. MARKEY: And would it allow military operations against foreign governments other than Syria?

SEC. HAGEL: No.

SEN. MARKEY: And would it authorize military operations against nonstate actors?

SEC. HAGEL: No.

SEN. MARKEY: Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

SEN. MENENDEZ: Thank you, Senator Markey.

Let me -- on behalf of the committee, thank all of our distinguished witnesses. They have been testifying for an excessive 3 1/2 hours, and I appreciate their information they've imparted with the committee.

Let me say that I appreciate the thoughtfulness with which each member has come to this issue at this hearing and expressed their concerns and their views. And I have listened closely and understand some of those concerns.

I've listened to my colleagues particularly express concern as to whether the actions we conceived would in fact deter or degrade the ability of Assad to pursue chemical weapons attacks in the future, and I'm reminded in a much different context of an experience I had in my own life -- General Dempsey is actually originally from my area, Jersey City and Bayonne.

And I grew up in a tough neighborhood. And we had a bully in the neighborhood. And I was walking along the street one day, and he just slapped me in the face, and I went away and told my mom, and she said, avoid him. Avoid him. Just avoid him. And a week later I saw the bully again, and I did all my best to avoid him, and this time he punched me in the nose, and it was bloody. And I went back to her and said, you know, Mom, I tried to avoid him. She says, well, just avoid him. And it wasn't till the third time, when we were by a construction site, that I got a piece of wood and whacked the bully, and that was the end of it. I never got whacked again. (Laughter.)

It's not quite this, but there is a lesson to be learned. Assad has made a calculation now to -- inching up several times, that he can use chemical weapons, or he believes he can use chemical weapons without consequences. And in doing so, there is a global message that in fact other state actors and other nonstate actors may believe they can do so as well. That's a critical challenge for the national security of the United States. And I hope members will consider that as we move towards the final action.

I want to advise members -- I think we're close to a text on a -- on a resolution, and so that they should consider that it is likely that we may very well be in a business meeting sometime after the classified hearing tomorrow morning. And we look forward to working with all the members of the committee.

Senator Corker, is there anything else you --

SEN. CORKER: I think you've said it well enough. I want to thank the witnesses for spending this much time not only in the hearing but also in advance of the hearing.

I look forward to the classified meeting tomorrow.

And I want to thank all the members for incredible thoughtfulness throughout all of this, and I appreciate everybody coming back to be a part of this and taking it so seriously and -- (inaudible). Thank you.

SEN. MENENDEZ: With the thanks of the committee, this hearing is adjourned.

Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

Migrate, spend time, lay back, watch the sky change, woah

She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)
We can finally be together

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go

Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me

You got wrapped up in other plans
But this ain't the way the story ends

Have you ever seen a whole thang?
What you drove through to the streets 'cause you grew up on short change?
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they clothes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix wit my sack for the whole day

Taught you how to charge more than
What they paid for you niggas
Own the whole thing for you niggas

It gotta be love, who run the city? It gotta be cuz
This for the pieces I took off the Monopoly board
And y'all niggas false claims—it gotta be fraud
Just keep the hood up out your mouth and you gotta be charged

It was visionary; either I'm genius or you niggas scary
Maybe it's both, and this balance I deliver daily
For every nigga in these streets tryna feed the babies
The single mamas working hard not to miss a payment
And dirty money get washed on royalty statements
Black owners in this game of powerful racists
Young niggas in the set that's doing it makeshift
Out the garage is how you end up in charge
It's how you end up in penthouses, end up in cars
It's how you start off a curb-server, end up a boss
It's how you win the whole thing and lift up a cigar
With sweat dripping down your face

I say man you should've been down in Tupelo
Seen what was in the front row

[Chorus]
There was this girl, beer in her hand
Shootin' me a ""Play a little Skynyrd"" grin
She's turnin' it up, she's turnin' me on
And I'd play her anything she'd sing along
I was out of my mind, she was out of this world
There was this girl
Yeah, there was this girl

[Verse 3]
Didn't know a diamond ring could cost so much (Damn)
Took six months on a farm 'fore I saved up
All my drinkin' buddies still out on the town
Wonderin' why I ever settled down

[Chorus]
But there was this girl, holdin' my hand
Shootin' me a ""Start a life together"" grin
She's pullin' me in, she's straightenin' me out
And now I know what love is all about
I'm still out of my mind, she's still out of this world
There was this girl
Yeah, there was this girl
Yeah, there was this girl
There was this girl",Riley Green,Riley Green,2019,"[98, 70, 75, 71, 72, 74, 71, 91]",8
467,My Bad,"[Verse 1]
Can't count up the times you've blown my line
And that's been on my mind a lot lately
I wanna leave the extra all behind, mmm
And I know that you wanna be my baby, mmm yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Verse 2]
Oh, we both care about it
But arguing with me just isn't worth it
No, no, no
Don't go reachin' in your bag, your bag, yeah
I didn't text you back 'cause I was workin'
Ah, yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Bridge]
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
(Gave you all my time and all my love)
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin' (Vibin')
Gotta put my phone on silent (On silent)
So my, my, my, my bad (My bad)
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin' (Blowin' me up)
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

Yeah

[Verse 1: Victoria Monét]
I've been on a roll, where you been?
Real protective with my soul, where you been?
Is your GPS even on, where you been?
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I swerve both ways, dichotomy

[Post-Chorus: Victoria Monét & Ariana Grande]
I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin
How you hit the club and you barely got in?
Then we hit the bank, making them investments for the win, oh

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Said, I been on a roll, where you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where you been? (Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I show them my discography (Yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin (Hey)
You'd be straight for life if I gave you my PIN (Yeah)
Even though we gave up that 90% for the win, go

[Verse 3: Victoria Monét & Ariana Grande]
I've been on a roll, where you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where you been? (Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, hell nah
I don't even care where you been (Oh, yeah)
Hell nah (Oh, yeah)
Said I don't even care

[Verse 4: Victoria Monét, Ariana Grande & Both]
Remember when we made a fuckin' album off that Clicquot? (Ooh)
I never track my vocals, so shout out to Eric Vetro (I love Eric Vetro, man)
This been buildin' up, I guess this friendship like Home Depot (Ooh)
I'm so thankful working with my best friend, she the cheat code
She the cheat code (Yeah)

[Outro: Victoria Monét & Ariana Grande]
Where you at? Where you been? (Oh yeah)
Where you been? Where you at, ho? Hey (Where you been?)

471,Bad Luck,"[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
Don’t save me, I'm in no need of saving (Oh yeah)
And if you stay with me, I know you need patience (Yeah, yeah)
Blood and cologne on the fragrance (Mmm, yeah, yeah)
'Cause if ya deal with me, I know you know what pain is (Oh no)

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
And I don't even like to think about it
On my own, but still so crowded
Walls come down and the guards come up
But there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded
Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?
I've been burning rubber on the Michelin
Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck

[Outro]
Yeah (I'm in love with bad luck)

[Intro]
Tu grupo favorito

[Pre-Coro]
Nadie entiende cómo este amor funciona
No se quiebra, no se dobla, nada lo destroza
Les presto mi cerebro que examinen
Anularte de mi mente, ni quemando mis neuronas

[Coro]
Mami, yo te amo hasta lo infinito
Sólido como meteorito
Lo que siento jamás lo van a entender
Dudan, los expertos buscan la cura
Porque te quiero con locura
Desconfían que sea humano, mujer

[Verso 1]
Me someto a la ciencia con demoras
En mí la testosterona solo se activa por ti
Vengan, háganme un estudio cerebral
Porque mi conducta no es normal
Y este corazón Dios lo hizo eterno
Sepan que este sentimiento es inmortal
En el libro Guinness va a parar
Hombre que más ha amado a una hembra

[Coro 2]
Mami, yo te amo hasta lo infinito
Sólido como meteorito
Lo que siento jamás lo van a entender
Perpetuo, impecable como la luz
La demencia de mi actitud
Te repito nadie me va a entender

[Puente]
Your playboy
Llora

[Coro]
Mami, yo te amo hasta lo infinito
Sólido como meteorito
Lo que siento jamás lo van a entender
Dudan, los expertos buscan la cura
Porque te quiero con locura
Desconfían que sea humano, mujer

[Verso 2]
Me someto a la ciencia con demoras
A mí la testosterona solo se activa por ti
Vengan, háganme un estudio cerebral
Porque mi conducta no es normal
Y este corazón Dios lo hizo eterno
Sepan que este sentimiento es inmortal
En el libro Guinness va a parar
Hombre que más ha amado a una hembra

[Coro 2]
Mami, yo te amo hasta lo infinito
Sólido como meteorito
Lo que siento jamás lo van a entender
Perpetuo, impecable como la luz
La demencia de mi actitud
Te repito nadie me va a entender

Let's go!
It's like we never left

473,Dedication,"[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, my nigga this is dedication, this is anti-hesitation
This a real nigga celebration
This a Dime Blocc declaration
59th and 5th Ave, granny house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy, the separation
2Pac of my generation, blue pill in the fuckin' Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he can't change it
Know he a genius, he just can't claim it
'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you can't fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long 'til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
'Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'
Dedication
It's dedication, look

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies three-on-one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life starin' at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss? Shit, don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said, ""You do a song with Nip, K. Dot he a better Crip""
I said, ""He a man first, you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?""
Level four, yard livin', given to false imprisonment
Listen close, my nigga
It's bigger than deuces and fours, my nigga
Since elementary we close, my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's
I'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?
Hol' up

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Look
This ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to they amazement
Now I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be, ""Stay safe,"" now it's, ""Stay dangerous""
'Cause ain't no point in playin' defense, nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end, nigga, without a life jacket
Couple mil', tour the world, dawg, my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heist backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok Classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'

I'm prolific, so gifted
I'm the type that's gon' go get it, no kiddin'
Breaking down a Swisher front of yo buildin'
Sitting on the steps feeling no feelings
Last night, it was a cold killin'
You gotta keep the devil in his hole, nigga
But you know how it go, nigga
I'm front line every time it's on, nigga
Hunnid proof flow, run and shoot pro
458 drop, playin' ""Bullet Proof Soul""
Every few shows I just buy some new gold
Circle got smaller, everybody can't go
Downtown diamond district, jewelers like ""Yo
Hussle, holla at me, I got Cubans on the low""
Flew to Cancun, smokin' Cubans on the boat
And docked at Tulum just to smoke, look
Listening to music at the Mayan Ruins
True devotion on the bluest ocean, cruisin'
My cultural influence even rival Lucien
I'm integrated vertically, y'all niggas blew it
They tell me, ""Hussle, dumb it down, you might confuse 'em""
This ain't that weirdo rap you motherfuckers used to
Like the beginning of ""Mean Streets""
I'm an urban legend, South Central in a certain section
Can't express how I curbed detectives
Guess it's, evidence of a divine presence
Blessings, help me out at times I seem reckless, F it
You got a L but got an E for effort, stretch it
Dropped him off in the Mojave desert, and left him
Ain't no answer to these trick questions
Money makin' Nip, straighten out my jewelry on my bitch dresser
Well known, flick up and jail pose
Matchin' champagne bottles from Ricos til' T show
Whatever, nigga, we playin' chess, not checkers, nigga
Thirty-eight special for you clever niggas
See bro, if you ain't live and die by the street codes
Been through all these motions, up and down like a see-saw
I can never view you as my equal
Fuck I want to hear your CD for?

Yeah, look
I'm finna take it there, this time around I'ma make it clear
Spoke some things into the universe and they appeared
I say it's worth it, I won't say it's fair
You find your purpose or you wastin' air
Fuck it though, y'all niggas scared, eyes opened, I can see it clear
They don't make 'em bar none, they don't make 'em real
They don't make it where I'm from, they don't take it here
They don't see in due time, I be makin' mil's
Bossed up in this game, I been makin' deals
Get your lawyer on the phone, we can make it real
I got checks and balance, I flex dramatic
Other fifty on my neck, just my reckless habit
Ain't no pussy on my rep, disrespect the savage
I make one phone call and the rest get handled
This just another front step with candles

And say ""That boy is sure livin' in luxury""
Sweet luxury

[Chorus 2]
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

Love how you close your eyes when I pull you in closer

You're gonna take me all the way up
Something about you baby, got me going crazy
I don't know what to do

Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top

Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you

487,Down To The Honkytonk,"[Verse 1]
I got a house down a back road
I got a flag on the front porch
I got a dog named Waylon
I got a driveway that needs pavin'
I got a boat with a two stroke
A couple guaranteed-to-make-ya-laugh jokes
I got friends in low places
Yeah, life is what you make it

[Chorus]
I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on a sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk

[Verse 2]
I got a girl named Shelia
She goes batshit on tequila
Got a job that gets the job done
I got a loan at the bank, it's a big one
The only place you might see my name
Is on a wall, ""For a good time, call""
I'm a local legend on a Friday night
Then a Pabst Blue Ribbon and a neon light

[Chorus]
I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on a sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk

I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk
(Yeah, let's go, come on)

I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on a sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk

488,Price On My Head,"[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Yeah, I pull up to my town with a price on my head
I pull up to my town, I'm outside
They wanna see me drown, it’s on sight's what they said
I heard these niggas want to take my life
I don't apologize, I would die for this shit
I don’t apologize, I don't hide
I'm Kubrick with the shine, got the ice on my neck
They wanna throw a bag on him

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Price on my head, got a price on my head
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I’m dead
Price on my head, got a price on my head (Price on my head)
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed (Knife by my bed)
I’m so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I’m dead (When I'm dead)
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I’m dead

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I cut off all my side hoes, in du Cap with a dime though
All these girls been ran through, on the low real snipe mode
I can't sleep, that's insomnia, so much ice like I'm Tonya
All my boys livin' debt free, your squad like Wesley
I want head on a jet ski, she gave me head for a Fendi
For a Prada, she got sexy, for a Lambo or a Bentley
My mansion is no joke, house party like 1 OAK
Weed louder than gun smoke, get high off one toke
You beefin' with yourself, tell the truth
Niggas on your side, they would ride for me too
Still wasting they time, tryna come for me too
I'm too busy, faded in Japan with the crew
With the crew, with the crew, with the crew
Shout out all the girls who've been riding for me too
Niggas want me dead, I've been dead, nothing new
Niggas want me dead, for a bag and a

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Price on my head, got a price on my head (Price on my head)
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed (Knife by my bed)
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead

[Verse 3: NAV]
They tried to get me and they missed, if we send shots then they gon' hit
I could get your top taken off for less than a quarter brick (Yeah)
One of my rings could get him off, we'll check him off the list
My shooter a codeine addict, he'll do it for a pint of Actavis
Since I met Cash, got a lot of racks, I still want more (Racks)
I can tell by the way you carry yourself, you never sold no dope (Dope)
Growin' up, my mama beat my ass, then cleaned my mouth with soap (Soap)
Now she showin' up to work in a Balenciaga coat
Price on my head, got your life 'round my neck
Put a brown kid in the Southside Rex and me is what you'll get
My block was like the car wash, you drive in, you gon' get wet
Had take a lot of losses, made me comfortable with death (Death)
Took too much Act', had to pop a Xan to reset
His bitch gave me some top, and now he wanna send me threats
Live my best life, I know my opps just wanna see me dead
Took his life, I paid him double what they put on my head

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Price on my head, got a price on my head (Price on my head)
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed (Knife by my bed)
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead (When I'm dead)
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead
Price on my head, got a price on my head (Price on my head)

489,Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind,"[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't get no better, can’t get no more cheddar
I feel like a king and my queen is Coretta
I been made a livin', I'm never gon’ give in
I'm just way too driven, that's why I been thinkin'
I'm scared that I'm sinkin', I'm scared that I’m fallin’
The world think I'm ballin’ and maybe I am
But don't give a damn, back in the beginnin'
Did not have a plan, don't know who I am
Or who I’m becomin' but I'ma do me to the fullest, alright
Bustin' and dodgin' them bullets all night
Take over the world, yeah I'm thinkin' I might
Got 'em all in my sight
I know that I'm strong, I know that I am
I know I'm the man
And whether you poor or you filled with financial security
Everyone deal with they own insecurity
Even the preacher was born with impurity
Scared to go out even with my security
Scared of the world and all of its obscurity
Pray for maturity, hope that I grow
Hope my anxiety stay on the low
I swear I hope that shit don't fuck up my flow
Where do I go? What would you do
If suddenly all of your dreams came true?
What would you do if you did it all?
If you ain't never have to lift a finger
Would you linger like, ""Fuck 'em all""?
Guess that's your call, but I can't
This a marathon, not a sprint
Switch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint
Can you hear me now? Does anybody out there feel me now?

[Chorus]
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know

[Interlude]
How I feel (How I feel), yeah that's how I feel (That's how I feel)
Break it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)
How I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)
Down, roll it up, yeah

[Verse 2]
Searchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits
Only led me to battle depression
I done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain
What if your life was under a glass?
And people tried to dig up shit from your past
And tell you what's good and what's not
And every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot
And don't give a damn that it came from the heart
They tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers
This here for the people that know what I'm sayin'
All of the people that know what I'm sayin'
Fuck social media
Tellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap
They always compare, they always compare me to others
And try to hit me up against all my brothers
Now, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?
(Overdosin' at the crib)
'Cause people just won't let 'em live
And the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em
But nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside
And they wonder why we all hide, shit
Maybe I'm just overthinkin'
Or maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'
And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate
Sit in the corner and think of a better day
Maybe this bullet can help me to get away
I just cannot seem to think of a better way
Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'
That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'
Even when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag
I'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least
I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)
'Cause ""you'll never be Kenny""
""You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole""
""You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old,"" yeah
These are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now
That make me depressed and they pullin' me down
I'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown
So I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound
And play it when nobody else is around
Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground
God, give me the power to battle depression
Yeah, round after round
I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich
I wish I could just get up out of this bitch
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be
My life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be
'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division
Ain't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am
Do what you love and do not give a damn
Fuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram
Just mind your own business and be a good man
Be a good boss and be a good friend
Spread your imagination to the millions
Don't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions
Just spread that positivity for the children
And all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em
'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em
Know somebody feel 'em
Last but not least, put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love your—'member, love yourself

Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah",Logic,Logic,2019,[78],1

You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Just take it from me

Take my kiss and maybe take it too far
But baby take it from me

Life goes on, I can't take breaks
I need face, no, I need faith
In my mind, I can't escape

Climb right in, let me break your heart

I put my heart in my lyrics
I gave it all I could give
I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, got me bending sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention

I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits

I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks
Where I’m from we don’t say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top

Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
Locked up, they fighting with locks
Locked up, they swinging they knifes
I can't be living this life
No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice
My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace
I'll show you I'm destined to get it

I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag is terrific (Glee, glee)

I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain

I sip ill, pop pills, crack seals
Doing anything to numb the weight that I feel, yeah
I chase thrills, you still crashin' Hot Wheels
Ride a dirt bike down the ditch, see if I live
I'm not in my subconscious, I'm conscious
They tell me that they can help me, I got this
Watch this, I took my demons into the bank of life and I made the biggest deposit
Without drugs, I'm losing my logic
These pills and my Pro Tools still got logic
I run, I run, I run
I run, I run, I run

503,What Makes You Country,"[Verse 1]
People talkin' ’bout what is and what ain’t country
What gives ’em the right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth

[Pre-Chorus]
You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin’ on the rain
We’re all a little different, but we’re all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing

[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

[Verse 2]
Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know

[Chorus 2]
Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

[Brdge]
Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out

[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country

Vibe on this bitch, though
A lighter?
Nah, in the room
Oh
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
You work numbers, work wonders
You done woke me up from my eternal slumber
I'm the lightning, you’re the thunder
There's a difference 'tween, ""I need you,"" and, ""I want you""
Girl, I need you
Good sex led to conversations getting a little deeper, uh
Tell me your darkest secrets, shit you wouldn’t even tell Jesus, uh
My karma been tweaking so much, I don't even believe in karma
But you give me a reason to thank God for all these recent falls
Percocet 30 E 8, I've been gettin' off
I done chilled out on the drugs since you've been involved
Suck it like it's love, fuck me like it's love
No protection on my heart, goddamnit, I'm gon’ hit it raw
Traumatized from my past, yeah, I keep a log
In my mind, in my head, where that shit belong
They say you after my bread, shit, I hope they wrong
You already ran up the bands, we could have a ball
Hit it from the back, humina, call a play, huddle up
This that good love in the bedroom
Fuck you in the Prada, poke her face like Lady Gaga
Ride it like a Mazda, zoom, zoom, zoom

[Chorus]
I’m all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain’t that a weird way to give compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
I fell in love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
I see your light in all the darkness

[Verse 2]
Woah
'Atta boy, I done turned to a man
Hot chills when my skin is on your skin
Hope you know that if you ever try to end
You gon’ catch a couple out the F&N
That mean Cupid ain't give you a headshot
So I ain't got no choice but to leave you with a headshot
Look at the way I make that fucking bed rock, uh
Where your ring finger at? I need wedlock
Got my sights on your ass, ooh, red dot
We some bats that made it out of Hell, ooh, red hot
Don't, ayy, go all night, bitch, don't stop
We ain't even gon' be finished 'til the sun's up

[Chorus]
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way of giving compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
That's my way of giving compliments
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way to give compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in

505,Nights Like This,"[Verse 1: Kehlani]
You act like you need remindin'
Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

[Chorus: Kehlani]
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
All them times I played the fool for you
Thinkin' we could put it back together, thought we had forever
You never see my point of view
Our connection is so severed, you don't show no effort

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
Took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window

You gon' get my hopes high, girl

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, ""Hit my line""
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin'
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but...

And then I lost everything

If you put your hands on the flame
You've got no right to complain

When the glow comes to an end
Like scattered embers in the wind
Leaves you lookin' for a brand new spark

I'm gonna quit
But who am I kiddin'?
I just can't put you down
So I keep hangin' around

Holdin' the revolver with the laser (Boop)
They done killed my nigga, start the war, bring the nation (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
I got a boss situation (Boss)
Military basis when we travel 'cross the nation (Military)
Double up the cup with maple (Hoo)
Abomination on your paper, I got acres
Black man when you walking and you labeled
Beat the odds, they don't wanna see you greater
Eat you alive like a lion or a 'gator
Mommas crying cause the police shot they babies
They crooked, the motherland they done took it (Crooked)
They take us and lock us up and throw the booklet (Take us)
Started rapping then I shook it (Shook it)
I hate the fame, everybody keep on looking (Fame)
We done sold out Brooklyn (Sold out)
Man, I miss my Grandma cookin' (Grandma)
Treat me like a don 'cause I'm gifted (Don, don)
I'm a run the money up, gotta go and get it (Hey)

If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I’ll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (Yeah)
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)
But after all this damage, I can’t help it (Help it)
But what you can trust is I need your touch

I’ma scream and shout for what I love

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

[Verse 2]
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I heard you on the phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it

This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking, we both know it

But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken

Mmm, well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
We'll leave each other cold as ice
And high and dry, the desert wind

Just jumped on the private jet and rolled a joint
Played the beat then wrote that joint
Wrote a whole movie, then I sold that joint

Why it seem like every single celebrity shameless, it's dangerous
Got 50 million but my swag on food stamps
All these models poppin' bottles, bitch, I ain't tryna dance
She said, ""No, I don't wanna pay my bills""
I need a hard workin' woman with respect who will
This for everybody who ain't made it yet

Give you some game, that's slow motivation
We need the gas straight in the basement
Switch up the swag, switch up the bag
Niggas, they jockin' my swag 'cause it's fashion
I do it bigger than niggas imagine
Heard that bitch makin' up rumors
She gave more head than a tumor
And I got facts, I can prove it, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got real rich and ain't get no diploma
She think it's somethin' got to do with my mama
Well I can't love her, like she need me
That's what you get when you thinkin' I'm average
Now I wake up and I fuck on a bad bitch
Drugs got me savage

[Bridge]
It's so hard, it's so hard, these Perkys keep me sane
All my dawgs, all my dawgs, found 'em locked up in the cage
We gettin' paid, we so paid, move them bricks, then move on
Switch them bags, switch them bags, then move on, then move on

[Chorus]
Copped me a presi', yeah, yeah
Straight out the trenches, yeah, yeah
My niggas came with me, yeah, yeah
The riches, the riches, the riches, yeah
Rich nigga out of Zone 6, yeah
All of these hoes came with it, yeah
Audemars Piguets came with it, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I was tryna fight temptation, yeah
Top gone, it's on vacation, yeah
I'm not tryin' to hurt nobody
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Car full of bullets, ain't findin' no shooter
That's what you get when you niggas delusional
I remember when they thought I was average
Now I wake up and I fuck on a bad bitch

[Outro]
I tried to fight temptations, yeah
Riches on riches on riches on riches on riches...
And I can't lie, you... Future had the first bust down Richard Mille I had seen, by far

You chargin' 4K for Actavis, dawg, it's good, you need to bring it all
Police done stopped comin' through Lil Mexico 'cause we made the laws
Soon as I got my first check I was crooked, so I had paid 'em off
Soon as they get word a nigga snitchin', they gotta knock him off
Soon as we get them birds, we go tweakin', then we go ship 'em off

571,Call The Coroner,"[Intro]
He always has been the largest drug kingpin, you know, out there
(Say fuck the drug test, gon' pass my gas mask)
I think he's responsible for, for hundreds of quantities of drugs moving it into the United States
(Flat screen, I back back, I see my racks stacked)

[Chorus]
I wanna live like a drug lord, but I wanna be glorious
Sometimes I feel like a kingpin, I'm so victorious
I got a white and a black girl, they look like an Oreo
I come through poppin' it off, call the coroner
You see these chains on my neck, look like Mardi Gras
I'm throwin' the cash in the air like a volleyball
Pink shirt on me just to match my diamonds
NASCAR Lamborghini when I'm drivin'
Big dawg but I feel just like a giant
Withdrawals, pass my cup, I think I'm dyin'

[Verse]
Say fuck the drug test, go'n pass my gas mask
Flat screen, I back back, I see my racks stacked
Super like Goldie Mack, ho caught an asthma attack
Hoes gettin' their toes tagged, kill 'em dead at Hermes
Turn up on purpose, I have her nervous
I don't have no stylist, make my own purchase
Low top my Gucci, I was wrapped in turban
Knew she was a hoochie, I had to murk it
Now I got power, I feel like Curtis
I gave her Pucci, I felt like she was worth it

[Chorus]
I wanna live like a drug lord, but I wanna be glorious
Sometimes I feel like a kingpin, I'm so victorious
I got a white and a black girl, they look like an Oreo
I come through poppin' it off, call the coroner
You see these chains on my neck, look like Mardi Gras
I'm throwin' the cash in the air like a volleyball
Pink shirt on me just to match my diamonds
NASCAR Lamborghini when I'm drivin'

Say fuck the drug test, gon' pass my gas mask

Say fuck the drug test, gon' pass my gas mask

572,She Got The Best Of Me,"[Verse 1]
Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like kerosene dancing around a fire
But you're in it

[Pre-Chorus]
So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Verse 2]
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So sing along

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

Ten (Yeah) thousand dollar plates
Thousand dollar plates
Thousand dollar plates, fine china
Shorty like a, uh
Shorty like a
(Wheezy outta here)

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Goin' insane, feel you pickin' up and movin' things inside my brain
I know I don't have to argue about everything
But we don't have the same soul
Would've sold yours too and got a bigger bankroll
You tell me that you love me, baby, say it again
Repeat it over and over until it's in my brain
Picked up the drugs so I let my brain go
Woulda fried yours too, but I'm selfish about my Percs, oh

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm so crazy about mine (Wheezy outta here)
I'm goin' to Pluto with my girl (Oh, shorty)
I'm goin' to Jupiter with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm goin' to Mars with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm goin' to Saturn with my girl
Been feelin' like I'm runnin' out of space
You need to send your location, I can't think
I done fell in love twice but I gotta be lyin'
'Cause I'm livin' ten lives, I go crazy about mines (Ayy)

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver

Eu deixo ele comer o biscoito, pois é bom para ele
E sempre que ele come o biscoito, ele fica em boa forma

Pois tudo que quero são os quilates e muito dinheiro de droga
Eu só sou leal àqueles que atiram pra mim

F*** the system, I'm that brother, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
F*** you too, woo!

[Chorus]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bulls***, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood s***, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't f** with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not f*** with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
I run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
B**** I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
S*** get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, everybody just really want me to get tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these people to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Took the wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a f*****' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Bridge]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the f*****' recognition
F***'s the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, f*** the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
F*** you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the f*** happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any f*****' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
F*****' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
F*** it, I'm goin' for the jugular
S*** is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherf***
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya d**** in the f*****' back, *** (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this s***, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a f*****' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherf*****, know I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice",Ajay Jones,Eminem Featuring Joyner Lucas,2019,"[100, 94]",2
589,Drunk Me,"[Verse 1]
Some people don't know when to quit, and that's why they quit
Some need to hit the bottom to see they got a problem, they can't handle it
But that ain't why I started cleaning up my life
Wish it was, but, ooh, that would be a lie

[Chorus]
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl
No, no, no
Baby, can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you (There ain't no hangover like you)
Can't get over, can't get over (There ain't no hangover like you)
Oh, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
All those bottles sitting up on the shelf are just salt on the wound
One sip and I'm picking up the phone tryin' not to go home without you
And that ain't nothin' but a whole lotta pain
And that kind of hurt, ooh hurts, it ain't worth another drink

[Chorus]
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl
No, no, no
Baby, can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah

Can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me, yeah drunk me, yeah drunk me

I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed

601,Cozy Little Christmas,"[Verse 1]
Everybody's in a hurry, in a flurry
Shopping 'til they're droppin' in the snow
Kids are cryin', dogs are barkin'
Catchin' up with folks we barely know
Sure, it's madness, but it's magic
As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
'Cause you're the reason for the season
No, we don't need to keep up with the Jones

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is something priceless

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Bridge]
I don't need anything
Take back all the Cartier, and the Tiffany's and the Chanel
Well, can I keep that Chanel? Please?
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Bridge]
They know that Santa’s on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
