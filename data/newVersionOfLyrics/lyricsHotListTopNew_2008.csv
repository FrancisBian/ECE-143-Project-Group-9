[Intro]
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

[Verse 1]
Up in the club (club), just broke up (up)
I’m doing my own little thing
Decided to dip (dip), but now you wanna trip (trip)
'Cause another brother noticed me
I’m up on him (him), he up on me (me)
Don’t pay him any attention
Cried my tears (tears), for three good years (years)
You can’t be mad at me

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it

[Verse 2]
I got gloss on my lips (lips), a man on my hips (hips)
Hold me tighter than my Deréon jeans
Acting up (up), drink in my cup (cup)
I can't care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention?
Don’t pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn (turn)
But now you gon' learn
What it really feels like to miss me

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Don't treat me to the things of the world
I’m not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here’s a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I’m the one you want
If you don’t, you’ll be alone
And like a ghost, I’ll be gone

[Bridge]
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it

[Intro: T.I.]
Ay... this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
E'rybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
Start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)

My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
[You steady chasin' that paper]
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know

Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road

8,If I Were A Boy,"[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus 2]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted

9,Love Lockdown,"[Produced by Kanye West & Jeff Bhasker]

[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-nooo!""
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown

Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown

10,Love Story,"[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

I tried to be chill but you're so hot I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my best-est
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
We are just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short

But do you want to come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

Oh oh
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free

You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well, you made your bed
I made mine

Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father
When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart, so he stuck his middle finger

And you stand in line
Well, you'll get what's yours
I got mine

And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound

You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

[Verse 1]
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

[Chorus]
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Verse 2]
It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

[Chorus]
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

[Chorus]
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes

Baby, baby, when we first met
I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden, you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

[Chorus: Rihanna]
And now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)

It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab

I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'll do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me, I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way that I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?

26,Better In Time,"[Verse 1]
It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to
See, somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through

[Pre-Chorus]
Going, coming
Thought I heard a knock
Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know
If you didn't notice, you mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be okay

[Chorus]
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too (oh, yeah)
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

[Verse 2:]
I couldn't turn on the TV
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings?

[Pre-Chorus: Leona Lewis]
If I'm dreaming, don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings, but that's the path
I believe in, and I know that time will heal it
If you didn't notice, boy, you meant everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be okay

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals, too (oh, yeah)

I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

[Bridge: Leona Lewis]
Since there's no more you and me (no more you and me)
It's time I let you go so I can be free
And live my life how it should be (and I know, and I know)
No matter how hard it is, I'll be fine without you
Yes, I will!

[Chorus: Leona Lewis]
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals, too

28,You Found Me,"[Verse 1]
I found God on the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west was all but won
All alone smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?"" He said, ""Ask anything""

[Verse 2]
Where were you when everything was falling apart?
All my days were spent by a telephone
That never rang and all I needed was a call
That never came to the corner of First and Amistad

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?, Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

[Verse 3]
In the end, everyone ends up alone
Losing her, the only one who's ever known
Who I am, who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know how long she will be next to me

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?, Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

[Bridge]
Early morning the city breaks and I've been calling for years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages, you never send me no letters
You got some kind of nerve taking all I want

[Pre-Chorus]
Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, where were you, where were you?

Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming ""Ahhh!""
Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid
Number one hustla get money
Why you wanna count a nigga money?
I'm a hustla and I don't need them!
One of them ya'll see! I'm so paid

[Verse 1: Akon]
I see police on the crooked I
Doing a 100 on the Interstate 95
My shawty leanin', blasting that Do or Die
Wishing that motherfuckin' would, ‘cause we're certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off
And them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than let them haters come and make the name off me
That's why

She said, ""Young, why your voice so hoarse?""
I just sound like money, baby, I should've been a Porsche (vroom)
Paint look like a sugar free Red Bull
I'm so paid, you know I keep a pocket full
And that's before the taxes
Took my own gross net and hid it under my mattress
Used to get bored and count 20's for practice
Paper therapy we let money relax us
Gold chains around my neck just like Michael Phelps
I made a killing in the water, kill them in the water
Against all odds and I will not stop
They try and keep me on bottom, but I prefer the top
And my project chick, I moved her next to Joc
She said the house too small, I moved an extra block
So, baby, get your ass up, I need an extra block
I told her do the speed limit and no extra stops; and that's why

[Chorus: Akon]
I get it in 'til sunrise

I am the boss it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off, that's all
Guess what? I won't be taking that fall
Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm paying them for
Ha ha, ain't that funny?
‘Cause niggas want war but ain't got money
‘Cause I've seen them all talking 'til they start gunning
Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing running
Yeah! Akon! Weezy!
Black Royals holdin' down Jersey
Devine making sure we getting it up front
My little brother Bu got that vision, baby

I get it in 'til sunrise

Ahem, Big Money Weezy
White wife beater with the Sig underneath it
How do I feel? Bitch, I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers, disappear from the precinct
Yeah, I'm ballin', we ball out
Ball 'til we fall until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns at y'all house
Only to find out you live in a doll house
Damn, but I thought you was tough, though
We carry choppers on our necks; call it cut throat
We bury cowards on the set that they come from
We know magic, turn weed smoke to gun smoke
We bomb first when we ride
You in a hearse when you ride
I put my shoe down, baby
And I'm holding down Young Moolah, baby! That's why

30,Viva La Vida,"LYRICS:

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now, in the mornings I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Up on my pills and salt, just pills and glands
I hear Jerusalum bells are ringing
Roman cavulry choirs are singing
""Be my mirror, my sword and shield""
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you go,  there was never, never an honest word but that was when I ruled the world

It was wicked and a wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I've become

Revolutainiers wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet and a lonely string
And I thought, ""who would have a job, being king?""
I hear Jerusalum bells are ringing
Roman cavulry choirs are singing
""Be my mirror, my sword and shield""
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you go, there was never, never an honest word but that was when I ruled the world

So now Im slowing it down
And im looking around
And im loving this town
And im doing alright
Ain't worried about nothing
Except for the man I wanna be
Im thinking maybe its time
To be living the rhyme
When im singing a song
About nothing but right
And it sure would be nice
If you would roll with me

Saw a kid last winter
Only 20 years old
Being laid to rest
While his mom stood by his side
It sure was hard to watch those tears run down her face
Made me think how we all just have our time

So now Im slowing it down
And im looking around
And im loving this town
And im doing alright
Ain't worried about nothing
Except for the man I wanna be

Gravity like a lunar landing
Make me want to run till I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you’re all I hear
Everything we know fades to black

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I had anymore to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

Find the place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city buzz, it sounds just like a fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur, they’re all the same

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I had anymore to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

So much more to say
So much to be done
Don’t you trick me out
We shall overcome
So all have stayed in place
We should have had the sun
Could have been inside
Instead we’re over here

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time, too long defending
You and I are done pretending

I never thought that I had anymore to give
Pushing me so far

I bust the windows out your car
And, no, it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now, I don't care about that part
I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you laying next to her
I didn't wanna, but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn

[Chorus]
I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when
You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

[Verse 2]
I bust the windows out your car
You know I did it cause I left my mark
Wrote my initials with a crowbar
And then I drove off into the dark
I bust the windows out your car
You should feel lucky that was all I did
After 5 whole years of this bullshit
Gave you all of me and you played with it

[Chorus]
I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when
You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

[Verse 3]
I bust the windows out your car
But it don't compare to my broken heart
You could never feel how I felt that day
Until it happens, baby, you don't know pain
Oh, yeah, I did it. You should know it
I ain't sorry. You deserved it
After what you did to me
You deserved it. I ain't sorry no, no
You broke my heart, so I broke your car
You caused me pain, so I did the same
Even though what you did to me was much worse
I had to do something to make you hurt
Oh, but why am I still crying?
Why am I the one who's still crying?
Oh, oh, you really hurt me, baby

Which hands you shake and which hands you hold

And hang out, make lots of noise

Make the mistakes that she made 'cause she knew all along

They say the first time won't ever last
But that didn't stop me. The first time he laughed
All my friends tried to warn me the day that we met
""Girl, don't you lose your heart yet""
But his dark eyes dared me with danger
And sparks fly like flame to a paper
Fire in his touch burning me up, but still i held on

[Chorus]
I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on

[Verse 3]
The last time i saw him, we packed up my things
And he smiled like the first time he told me his name
And we cried with each other
We split the blame for the parts that we couldn't change
Pictures, dishes and socks
It's our whole life down to one box there he was waving goodbye on the front porch alone

Am I crazy or falling in love?

Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away-ay-ay

Please don't tell me that we had that conversation
I won't remember, save your breath, cause what's the use?

Ah, the night is calling
And it whispers to me softly come and play
Ah, I am falling
And If I let myself go I'm the only one to blame

I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over? (Oh)
No pain
Inside
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober?

Coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning round, spinning round, spinning round
Looking for myself, sober
Coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning round, spinning round, spinning round
Looking for myself, sober

When it's good, then it's good, it's so good 'till it goes bad
'Till you're trying to find the you that you once had
I have heard myself cry, never again
Broken down in agony, just tryna find a friend
Oh, oh

I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me (Nothing can touch me)

48,Here,"[Verse 1]
There's a place I've been looking for
That took me in and out of buildings
Behind windows, walls and doors
And I thought I found it
Couple times, even settled down
And I'd hang around just long enough
To find my way back out
I know now the place that I was trying to
Reach
Was you, right here in front of me

[Chorus]
And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breaking
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me heeere, right here (oh.. baby)

[Verse 2]
It's amazing what I let my heart go through
To get me where it got me
In this moment here with you
And it passed me by
God knows how many times
I was so caught up in holding
What I never thought I'd find
I know now, there's a million roads
I had to take
To get me in your arms this way

[Chorus]
And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breaking
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me heeeere

[Bridge]
In a love I never thought I'd get to get to
-here
And if that's the road
God made me take to be with you

[Chorus]
And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breaking
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me heeere, right here (right here)

49,White Horse,"[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse

No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Mr. West is in the buildin'
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
Ayo I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the Pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
Hermès, Pastelle, I pass the dressin'
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess we should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it
""Why you so mad for? Why you gotta have it?""
‘Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
Tryin' to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
(No one on the corner…) Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans, ‘cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans, ‘cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps is the road to success
Where the niggas know you're thorough when the girls say yes
(Yes…) But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school, but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks, I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap
It's Hooooovaaaa
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda
Hooooovaaaa
Did you even have any doubt? After Doubt it was over

No one on the corner has swagger like moi
Chuch, but I'm too clean for the choir
I require what I desire, I got stripes: Adidas
Mamis scream ""¡Papi, no más!""
Run up in your shit, just me, no más
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these four guys
Now when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than the swag or dagger all metal
And my jewels blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows: stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet, make you feel special
Ha! What the fuck you boys talkin' 'bout?
I know it's us, ‘cause we the only thing to talk about

[Verse 4: T.I.]
You can go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the bird play
Kanyeezy for diversity, and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect, only spit to serve a purpose
You ain't livin' what you kickin', then you worthless
Lookin' from the surface
It may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off, blast off and have outstandin' quality
Sell a lot of records, I'll respect it and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit, hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

51,In Color,"[Verse 1]
I said Grandpa what's this picture here
It's all black and white, and it ain't real clear
Is that you there, he said yeah, I was eleven
And times were tough, back in thirty-five
That's me and Uncle Joe just tryin' to survive
A cotton farm, in the Great Depression

[Refrain]
And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color

[Verse 2]
This one here was taken overseas
In the middle of hell, in nineteen forty-three
In the winter time, you can almost see my breath
That was my tail gunner ole' Johnny McGee
He was a high school teacher from New Orleans
And he had my back, right through the day we left

[Chorus]
And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color

But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color

[Verse 3]
And this one is my favorite one
This is me and grandma in the, summer sun
All dressed up, the day we said our vows
You can't tell it here but it was hot that June
And that rose was red and her eyes were blue
And just look at that smile, I was so proud

[Bridge]
That's the story of my life
Right there in black and white

[Chorus]
And if it looks like we were scared to death

52,She Wouldn't Be Gone,"[Verse 1]
Red roadside wildflower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter
Oh, at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through

Yellow sunset slowly dippin' down in the rearview
Oh, how she'd love to sit and watch you
I could have done that a whole lot more
If I hadn't been so stubborn, been so selfish
Thought about her more, thought about me less
Joked and make her laugh, held her when she cried
A little more that, maybe I

[Chorus]
Wouldn't be drivin' like hell flyin' like crazy down the highway
Callin' everyone we know stoppin' any place she might be
Goin' any place she might go beatin' on the dash

If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone
She wouldn't be gone

[Verse 2]
She warned me it was comin' said if I didn't change
She was leavin'
I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out
God, I believe her now
Called her mamma, cried like a baby to her best friend

Now, I'm cursin' like a fool, prayin' it ain't too late
All I wanna do is fix my mistakes

Find her beg her for one more try until then damn it I'll
Be drivin' like hell flyin' like crazy down the highway

She wants the toy in the Cracker Jack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo
She wants to wear my shirt to bed
She wants to make every stray a pet
And drive around in my truck with no place to go

But she needs to feel that fire

She’s everything I want and more
A real desire, that lets her know I’d walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire

She wants a cabin in the woods
She wants to stand where nobody stood

So as long as there’s a breath to take
A smile to share, A prayer to bring
A chance to hold her hand and fan the flame

It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know

This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

The preacher man said, ""Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?

Don't ya hate hearing that clock on the wall chiming
Saying it's time

All day long
You know it wouldn't be a crime
If we crawl back into bed
Got as close as we could get
Trying to figure out where this thing is going

Baby, Baby don't
Don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you just stay a little bit longer
Got it going on
And I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger

If ya got to go
You got to know
I might go crazy
Here without you baby
We're living every kiss
You ain't leaving me like this
It just ain't right
Wait until tonight
To lite another flame
You know it wouldn't be the same as the fire we got burning this morning

Baby, Baby don't
Don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you just stay a little bit longer

Punk-ass motherfucker, checkin' shit
What you was gonna do?
Kill me in my sleep, you bitch-ass nigga?
2Pac, Biggie – shut the fuck up!
Fuckin' dogs, barkin' and shit
(Don't shoot, don't shoot!)
Fuck you, nigga!

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

[Verse 1: The Game]
Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away, like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away, like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide, I'm from a windy city, like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?
‘Cause that's Jesus, people – and Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Siegel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle
I need some meditation so I can lead my people
They askin', ""Why, why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?""
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle

[Verse 2: The Game]
We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24's spinnin'? I earned 'em
And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson, ‘cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn, I know his mama proud; and since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like M.J.B. no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty like a Glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds

[Verse 3: The Game]
Walk through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts
Listenin' to the Chronic album, playin' backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge (Compton, Compton)
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back, in my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back

63,God Love Her,"[Verse 1]
Just a girl born in Dixie
Washed in the blood
And raised on the banks
Of the Mississippi mud
She always had a thing
About falling in love with a bad boy

Yeah, they could see it all coming
But her daddy never dreamed
She'd grow up that fast
You know what I mean
The way a girl gets
When she turns 17
Kind of crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her

[Chorus]
She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching' to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her

[Verse 2]
She kissed her mama goodbye
Said I'll be sure 'n phone you
She called from a truck stop
In Tucson Arizona
With amazing grace
We made California line
And then my gypsy life
Started taking its toll
And the fast lane got empty
And out of control
And just like an angel
She saved my soul from the devil

[Pre-Chorus]
She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her

[Chorus]
She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching' to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her

[Chorus]
Now she holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there

You see God love her

Wassup, boo? Yeah
Hahahaha, yeah

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Another shady mission
Tricks, like watching pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in Heaven, ‘cause being here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy
Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right

Who you can depend on who

While the world is sleeping
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leaving
Till we're kissing on the porch swing

Standing here feeling like a love struck Romeo
All I wanna do is hold you close and steal a little
More time, is that such a crime?

Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree
It's a good thing and I'm wishing
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window
While the world is sleeping
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leaving
Till we're kissing on the porch swing
Oh my little sweet thing

Sweet thing, sweet thing

Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young

While the world is sleeping
Cause you know I need you

Say Foxx? (Yeah-eah-eah...)
I had, I had a chick man (Yeah-eah-eah...)
She went and did me real wrong, I mean (Yeah-eah-eah...)
I did the same thing to her but
She ain't have no right to do me like that though dawg, for real
(Yeah-eah-eah...)

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
You, been seeing him, and I know
And I was with her, and you knew about it
But I was too bli-i-ind to see it baby
And you was out here doing the same thing as me
I wanna ask, has he been by the crib?
Has he been in our, car? And did you let him, drive?
Cause she's been by the house, she's been in the car
I've even let her push the Porsche around a couple times

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
Oh, we were so the same
I don't know why I can't see it baby
And it ain't a point to feeling blue
You're just like me and I'm just like you

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
You're just like me, shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that Bub, giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me, she don't know how to act
On the floor backin it back, man I can't be mad
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me...

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
Now it's so easy for me to imagine what you been doing baby
So I don't even have to ask (No)
Cause you ain't the only one that's been keeping secrets baby
So it ain't no sense in me playing back
And I, can't say nothing cause I did you wrong
And I was on some bullshit when I let that bitch up in our home
She's also known just like me
And she played the game like one of my homies

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
You're just like me, shorty all up in the club

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Hey!
Shawty who you fooling? You, know I'm way too cool for you
To run that game when we play me, trying to do me like I be doing you
Say you heard I was screwing her just like I hear he doing you
Why you worried about me doing me? I see you doing you
I can make her better though, you gonna let him ruin you
Just for the record know I wouldn't have her unless I could have the two of you
I know why he pursuing you, that booty do be moving boo
Late night, straight pipe, that ain't nothing new to you
Wait a minute, can't tell me shit, wanna tell me something, tell me this
If I would've never would've hit that chick, would you even ever know that dude existed?
Naw, got me twisted, yo ass goodbye I've kissed it
Now you all on his dick, shawty look at this bitch

Show me how to lie

And as you step back into line
A mob jumps to their feet

Take him out today

Slowly out of line
And drifting closer in your sight

Well, it's all because of me

The ways you made me feel alive
The ways I loved you
For all the things that never died
To make it through the night

What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?

What about now?

To start a new day
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace
As shadows fade into the light

I don't need to get fresh, about to grow a beard duke
So much cake even the money look weird too
Domestic bread, and I'm broad, I'm tryna eat right

They respect the value of my worth in Mali, Malaysia

Hey baby, won't you take a little ride with me
Have a look around, see what we can see
I've got the paddle, I've got the boat
Come on baby, I know she'll float

[Chorus]
We'll go rolling on the river of love
We'll go rolling on the river of love

Drift away from all these city lights
Might rock a little bit, so hold on tight
Let's get carried away with the gentle flow
Might get caught up in its undertow

We'll go rolling on the river of love
Let's go rolling on the river of love

I got a little ukulele, let me sing you a song
Got a stream of kisses about ten miles long
Dancing on the water in the moonlight beach
Sparkling down through the sea of dreams

We'll go rolling on the river of love
We'll go rolling on the river of love
We'll go rolling on the river of love

82,Broken,"[Verse 1]
The broken clock is a comfort, it helps me sleep tonight
Maybe it can stop tomorrow from stealing all my time
I am here still waiting though I still have my doubts
I am damaged at best, like you've already figured out

[Chorus]
I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning

[Post-Chorus]
So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you

[Verse 2]
The broken locks were a warning you got inside my head
I tried my best to be guarded, I'm an open book instead
I still see your reflection inside of my eyes
That are looking for a purpose, they're still looking for life

[Chorus]
I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, is there healing?
In your name I find meaning

[Post-Chorus]
So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you

[Bridge]
I'm hanging on another day
Just to see what you throw my way
And I'm hanging on to the words you say
You said that I will be okay

[Middle 8]
The broken lights on the freeway left me here alone
I may have lost my way now, haven't forgotten my way home

[Chorus]
I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning

85,Anything Goes,"[Verse 1]
Normally this time of night, you wouldn't find me here
I'd be reaching for a good night kiss instead of one more beer
I'd never take a second look at the blond across the bar
Much less invite her over and let things go this far

You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong
So bring it on, anything goes, when everything's gone

[Verse 2]
Another morning after, a crazy night before
I'm searching for my blue jeans on the stranger's bedroom floor
Shouldn't I feel guilty? Well I don't feel a thing
I'd wake her up and say good bye but I can't recall her name
Anything goes, when everything's gone
You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong
So bring it on, anything goes, when everything's gone
If you'd a left a single thread for me to hold on to
I'd have one good reason not to do the things I do

Trust me homie I'm not playin' (get up!)
I have the dance floor off the chain, I said (get up!)

You niggas better follow instructions, I said (get up!)

Everybody can’t do it the way I do it
I make it rain, till the sun come out
A nigga playin', we make the guns come out
Now, my question is who they gon' blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again?
Shit shift now, the game done changed
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain
I guess I made the kids want slang
And N.W.A. made the West Coast bang
Nah, it's just music man, it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

I have the savoir-faire
I’m the reason, everybody, here, I said (get up!)

Yeah, lady, you look good, I wanna get to know you better
You look good in them jeans and them red stilettos
You got a Bentley Coupe booty baby, I wanna drive
See it'll tell you what your mileage is when I'm inside
I wanna take you for a spin, you know, round and round
Switch gears till' your love comes down
I take you to the point of no return if you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn, I got money to burn
While they can't get a place, she drop the bomb on me
It's up and down and up and down gracefully
Rick James would've said She a Brick House
But Fifty you should go home and see what that bitch bout
I find out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up, get ya some, I know how to get ya sprung
Tune ya up and use the tongue, under the hood is so good
She said it so good, goddamn I'm so hood, nigga what up?

Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, plus it hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects

No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take

Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
‘Cause I hit you, you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright 'cause

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)

93,No Me Doy Por Vencido,"Me quedo callado
Soy como un niño dormido
Que puede despertarse
Con apenas sólo un ruido
Cuando menos te lo esperas
Cuando menos lo imagino
Sé que un día no me aguanto y voy y te miro

Y te lo digo a los gritos
Y te ríes y me tomas por un loco atrevido
Pues no sabes cuanto tiempo en mis sueños has vivido
Ni sospechas cuando te nombré

Yo, yo no me doy por vencido
Yo quiero un mundo contigo
Juro que vale la pena esperar, y esperar y esperar un suspiro
Una señal del destino
No me canso, no me rindo, no me doy por vencido

Tengo una flor de bolsillo
Marchita de buscar a una mujer que me quiera
Y reciba su perfume hasta traer la primavera
Y me enseñe lo que no aprendí de la vida
Que brilla más cada día
Porque estoy tan sólo a un paso de ganarme la alegría
Porque el corazón levanta una tormenta enfurecida
Desde aquel momento en que te ví…

Yo, yo no me doy por vencido
Yo quiero un mundo contigo
Juro que vale la pena esperar, y esperar y esperar un suspiro
Una señal del destino
No me canso, no me rindo, no me doy por vencido

Este silencio esconde demasiadas palabras
No me detengo, pase lo que pase seguiré

Yo, yo no me doy por vencido
Yo quiero un mundo contigo
Juro que vale la pena esperar, y esperar y esperar un suspiro
Una señal del destino
No me canso, no me rindo, no me doy por vencido",Luis Fonsi,Luis Fonsi,2008,"[100, 99, 97, 97, 97, 100, 100, 92, 98]",9

97,That's Not My Name,"[Verse 1: Katie White]
Four letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm biting on my tongue
And I, I keep stalling, not keeping me together
People around got to find something to say now
Holding back, every day the same
Don't want to be a loner, listen to me, oh no
I never say anything at all
So with nothing to consider, they forget my name

[Chorus 1]
They call me Hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me 'quiet' girl
But I'm a riot

Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

[Verse 2: Katie]
I miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last drip standing up against the wall
Keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring
Getting clamped up and sitting on the fence now
So alone all the time at night
Lock myself away, listen to me, I'm not
Though I'm dressed up out and all
With everything considered, they forget my name

Now it's in my mind
Call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
And though I realize
I cannot emphasize
I'll stick around but just don't promise, nothing binding

That you're so desperately
A standing joker like a vocal one-liner
Instead of sing-a-long

Just one more moment, that's all that's needed
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing
Time to be honest, this time I'm pleading
Please don't dwell on it, 'cause I didn't mean it
I can’t believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground
But it doesn't matter 'cause I've made it up, forgive me now
Every day I spend away, my soul's inside out
Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now, somehow

[Chorus]
By now you'd know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you

[Verse 2]
I was blindfolded, but now I'm seeing
My mind was closing, now I'm believing
I finally know just what it means to let someone in
To see the side of me that no one does or ever will
So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone
I'd search forever just to bring you home
Here and now, this I vow

By now you'd know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you

You know I'd always come for you
You know I'd always come for you

But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you

108,All Summer Long,"It was 1989, my thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Splashing through the sand bar, talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life like when and where
We didn't have no Internet but man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things, we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun, we couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock 'n' roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer

Now nothing seems as strange as
When the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again
Man, I'd like to see that girl again

114,She Never Cried In Front Of Me,"[Verse 1]
Seven Thirty-five
She's someone else’s wife
I can get on with my life
And that thrills me
She married him today
Her daddy gave the bride away
I heard a tear roll down her face
And that kills me

[Break]
'Cause now I
Can see why
She's finally crying

[Chorus]
How was I supposed to know?
She was slowly letting go?
If I was putting her through her hell
Hell I couldn't tell
She could've given me a sign
Could've opened up my eyes
How was I supposed to see?
She never cried in front of me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, maybe I might’ve changed
It's hard for me to say
But the story's still the same
It's a sad one
And I'll always believe
If she ever did cry for me
They were tears that you can't see
You know the bad ones

[Break]
And now I
Can see why
She's finally crying

[Chorus]
How was I supposed to know?
She was slowly letting go?
If I was putting her through her hell
Hell I couldn't tell
She could've given me a sign
Could've opened up my eyes
How was I supposed to see?
She never cried in front of me

[Bridge]
Without a doubt
I know now
How it outta be
Now she's gone
And it's wrong
And it bothers me
Tomorrow I'll still be
Asking myself

[Chorus]
How was I supposed to know?
She was slowly letting go?
If I was putting her through her hell
Hell I couldn't tell
She could've given me a sign
Could've opened up my eyes
How was I supposed to see?
How was I supposed to see?
She never cried in front of me
Hell I couldn't tell",Toby Keith,Toby Keith,2008,"[85, 77, 63, 46, 42, 46, 49, 54, 47, 52, 52, 51, 54, 59, 55, 57, 63, 70, 65, 72]",20
115,I'll Walk,"We were 18, it was prom night
We had our first big fight
She said ""Pull this car over""
I did and then I told her, ""I don't know what you are crying for""
I grabbed her hand, as she reached for the door

She said, I'll walk
Let go of my hand
Right now I'm hurt, and you don't understand
So just be quiet
And later we will talk
Just leave, don't worry. I'll walk

It was a dark night, a black dress
Driver never saw her, around the bend
I never will forget the call, or driving to the hospital
When they said her legs still wouldn't move
I cried, when I walked into her room

She said, I'll walk
Please come and hold my hand
Right now I'm hurt, and I don't understand
Lets just be quiet, and later we can talk
Please stay, don't worry. I'll walk

I held her hand through everything
The weeks and months of therapy
And I held her hand and asked her, to be my bride
She's dreamed from a little girl, to have her daddy bring her down the aisle
So from her wheelchair, she looks up to him and smiles

And says, I'll walk
Please hold my hand
I know that this will hurt, I know you understand
Please daddy don't cry
This is already hard
Let's go, don't worry
I'll walk",Bucky Covington,Bucky Covington,2008,"[88, 83, 77, 70, 80, 77, 84, 93]",8

118,One Step At A Time,"[Verse 1]
Hurry up and wait
So close, but so far away
Everything
That you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste, but you just can't touch

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
(No one knows your name yet)
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face, and the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated (Frustrated)
And you're getting all kind of impatient (Impatient)
Waitin' (Waitin')

[Chorus]
We live and we learn
To take one step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love (Just falling in love)
It's gonna happen when it's supposed to happen
Then we find the reasons why
One step at a time

[Verse 2]
You believe and you doubt
You're confused
And got it all figured out
Everything that you always wished for
Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours
If they only knew

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
(No one knows your name yet)
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it (Make it)
You know you can if you get the chance

Now you're feeling more and more frustrated (Frustrated)
And you're getting all kind of impatient
Waitin' (Waitin')

To take one step at a time
There's no need to rush (No need to rush)

Then we find the reasons why
One step at a time

When you can't wait any longer (You can't wait)
But there's no end in sight (Ooh, oh)

It's the faith that makes you stronger
The only way we get there
Is one step at a time

Oh, take one step at a time
There's no need to rush (No need to rush)
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love (Falling in love)
It's gonna happen
When it's supposed to happen
Then we find the reasons why
One step at a time

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And  it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah",Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,2008,[49],1
120,The Way I Loved You,"[Verse 1]
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone

And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

Never a clean break, no one here to save me

A bad mamajama from down in Alabama

Juicy Georgia peach with a thick southern drawl
Sexy swing and walk, brother, she's all

Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you

Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you

Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
Partying so hard, the ladies don't want it to end
They looked at me and said, ""I heard that you're a heartbreaker""

I'm that type of guy you won't cuff
I'm that type of guy your daddy won't let you go out
Cause he thinks I sell drugs

I'm that type of guy that will save ya
I'm that type that will call you later
Won't be around to give you that time
Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper
That I can do

Gotta keep my baby girl laced in the latest and the fliest suits
Never one for none, let's stay caked up, hold it down, that's all you gotta do
Then I walk up in the place, with a pocket full of money, my brother like I are the dude
Stepping out with the finest suits, look at me now

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Akon]
See I'm that type of guy that like kissing
I'm that type that will pop the clip and
I'm that type of guy that put you in your place
If your bougie just start tripping

I'm that type that will let you go
I'm that type that will let you know
That everywhere I go I can find a pretty ho
But there ain't too many know how to get that dough

That's the type of girl I want around me
Even though I'm a with her, make a man feel free
Roll with the fellas, even hold my cheese
Look like something you would see on TV

She don't mind climbing up that ladder
Similar to the words, it don't matter
But this time they wanna see us together
Look at us now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Akon]
You're not for sure
Even though I wanna take you everywhere I go
Because of you, all the girls is staring, taking notes
And I realize being with you girls bring more girls
And that's just what I'm attracted to

And I'd rather go all the way
Love her long time, till the break of day
I won't let her ever leave my bed
Till she sees the color purple like Anna Mae
Now she wants to start holding on me, like whatever she's smoking on
I'll be long gone before you can say, ""Look at me now""

126,You Belong With Me,"[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me",Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,2008,[12],1
127,You're Not Sorry,"[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you, honey and it never would have gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)
(No, no, no...)",Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,2008,"[35, 11]",2

129,Bleeding Love,"[Verse 1]
Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

[Verse 2]
Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

[Bridge]
And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
(Ooh, you cut me open and I)
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love

Yeah, Estelle, we 'bout to get down

Just touched down in London town
Bet they give me a pound
Tell them put the money in my hand right now
Tell the promoter we need more seats
We just sold out all the floor seats

[Hook 1: Estelle]
Take me on a trip I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy

[Verse 1: Estelle]
He said, ""Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya.""
I just met this 5-foot-7 guy who's just my type
Like the way he's speakin', his confidence is peakin'
Don't like his baggy jeans but I might like what's underneath them
And, no, I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's wide awake
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my bredrin
I'm liking this American boy, American boy

Can we get away this weekend? Take me to Broadway
Let's go shopping, baby, then we'll go to a café
Let's go on the subway, take me to your hood

Dressed in all your fancy clothes
Sneakers looking fresh to death, I'm loving those Shell Toes
Walking that walk, talk that slick talk

Tell 'em wagwan, blud!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Who killing them in the UK?
Everybody going to say ""You, K!""
Reluctantly, because most of this press don't fuck with me
Estelle once said to me, ""Cool down, down
Don't act a fool now, now.""
I always act a fool oww, oww
Ain't nothing new now, now
He crazy, I know what you thinking
Ribena, I know what you're drinking
Rap singer, chain blinger
Holler at the next chick soon as you're blinking
What's your persona about this Americana rhymer?
Am I shallow ‘cause all my clothes designer?
Uh, dressed smart like a London bloke
Before he speak his suit bespoke
And you thought he was cute before
Look at this pea coat, tell me he's broke
And I know you ain't into all that
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
But I still talk that ca-a-ash
'Cause a lot of wags want to hear it
And I'm feeling like Mike at his baddest
Like The Pips at their gladdest
And I know they love it
So to hell with all that rubbish

Would you be my love, my love?
Could you be mine?
Would you be my love, my love?
Could you be mine?
Could you be my love, my love?

Whoah! And yeah, that's her
The big dog tryin' to get her little kitty to purr
Ex-man lookin' at me like I'm Lucifer
'Cause he knows how I deal with the case, yes sir!
If I was the last man on Earth
I would only take that girl, end of search
She give a new definition to the word curve
Got chicks in the strip club envyin' her
Body's like weapons of mass eruptions
Sit her glass on that fat obstruction
Tongue game give a new type seduction

That's what I can't hide when she wanna conceal
I mean, Meagan Good and Halle Berry
Put together, ain't close to the dribby I see

It started with a low light
Next thing I knew, they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess that changed my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name
And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
That was the turning point
That was one lonely night

The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down
It's all in your mind""

[Verse 2]
Well now I'm back at home, and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give
You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You'd better look it over
Before you make that leap

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I’m fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
They justify my claim
And the public don’t dwell on
My transmission ‘cause it wasn’t televised
But it was the turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

[Chorus]
The storm maker says, ""It ain't so bad""
The dream maker's gonna make you mad

They say the Nile used to run

134,It's A New Day,"I went asleep last night
Tired from the fight
I've been fighting for tomorrow
All my life
Yea I woke up this morning
Feeling brand new
'Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming
Have finally come true

It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day

It's been a long time coming
Up the mountain kept runnin'
Souls of freedom kept hummin'
Channeling Harriet Tubman

Kennedy, Lincoln, and King
We gotta invest in that dream
It feels like we're swimming upstream
It feels like we're stuck in between
A rock and a hard place
We've been through the heartaches
And lived through the darkest days

If you and I made it this far
Well then hey, we can make it all the way
And they said no we can't
And we said yes we can
Remember it's you and me together

I woke up this morning
Feeling alright
I've been fightin' for tomorrow
All my life
Yea, I woke up this morning
Feeling brand new
Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming
Have finally came true

It's a new day
(it's a new day)
It's a new day
(it's a new day)
It's a new day
It's a new day!

It's been a long time waitin'
Waiting for this moment
Been a long time praying
Praying for this moment

We hope for this moment
And now that we own it
For life I will hold it
And I ain't gonna let it go

It's for fathers, our brothers
Our friends who fought for freedom
Our sisters, our mothers
Who died for us to be in this moment

Stop and cherish this moment
Stop and cherish this time

It's time for you and me
For us and we
That's you and me together

I woke up this morning
Feeling brand new
Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming
Have finally came true
Yea, I woke up this morning
Feeling alright

'Cause we weren't fighting for nothing
And the soldiers weren't fighting
For nothing
No, Martin wasn't dreaming for nothing
And Lincoln didn't change it for nothing
And children weren't crying for nothing

It's a new day
It's a new day
A new day
It's a new day
It's a new day!",​will.i.am,will.i.am,2008,[78],1
135,My President,"[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Yeah, be the realest shit I never wrote
I ain't write this by the way, nigga
Some real shit right here, nigga
This'll be the realest shit you ever quote
Let's go!

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a plate, anybody seen the scale?
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay?
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Today was a good day, hope I have me a great night
I don't know what you fishin' for, but catch you a great white
Me, I see great white, heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this, who knew it came in bales?
Who knew what came with jail?
Who knew what came with prison?
Just 'cause you got opinions, does that make you a politician?
Bush robbed all of us, would that make him a criminal?
And then he cheated in Florida, would that make him a Seminole?
I say, and I quote, ""We need a miracle.""
And I say a miracle 'cause this shit is hysterical
By my nephews and nieces, I will email Jesus
Tell him forward to Moses and CC Allah
Mr. Soul Survivor, guess that make me a Konvict
Be all you can be, now don't that sound like some dumb shit
When you die over crude oil as black as my nigga Bu
It's really a Desert Storm, that's word to my nigga Clue
Catch me in Las Vegas, A.R., Arizona
Rep for them real niggas, I'm winnin' in California
Winnin' in Tennessee, hands down Atlanta
Landslide Alabama, on my way to Savannah

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a plate, anybody seen the scale?
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay?
Let's go!

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I said I woke up this mornin', headache this big
Pay all these damn bills, feed all these damn kids
Buy all these school shoes, buy all these school clothes
For some strange reason my son addicted to Polo's
Love me some spinach dip, I'm addicted to Houston's
And if the numbers is right I'll take a trip out to Houston
An earthquake out in China, a hurricane in New Orleans
Street Dreams Tour, I showed my ass in New Orleans
Did it for Soulja Slim, brought out B.G.
It's all love, Bun, I'm forgivin' you, Pimp C
You know how the Pimp be, that nigga gon' speak his mind
If he could speak down from Heaven he'd tell me stay on my grind
Tell him I'm doin' fine, Obama for mankind
We ready for damn change so y'all let the man shine
Stuntin' on Martin Luther, feelin' just like a king
Guess this is what he meant when he said that he had a dream

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a plate, anybody seen the scale?
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay?
Let's go!

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yeah, our history, black history
No president ever did shit for me
Had to hit the streets, had to flip some keys
So a nigga won't go broke
Then they put us in jail, now a nigga can't go vote
So I spend dough on these hoes strippin'
She ain't a politician, honey's a pole-itician
My president is black, Rose golden charms
22-inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
That can arouse your ego
We've got mouths to feed so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
'Cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity, never lose your integrity
For years there's been some prize horses in this stable
Just two albums in, I'm the realest nigga on this label
Mr. Black President, yo, Obama for real
They gotta put your face on the 5000 dollar bill

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a plate, anybody seen the scale?
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay?
Let's go!

[Outro: Young Jeezy]
So I’m sittin' right here now, man
It’s June 3rd, haha, 2:08 AM
Nigga, I wanna say win, lose or draw
Man, we congratulate you already, homie
See, I motivate the thugs, right?
You motivate us, homie, that’s what it is
This a hands-off policy
Y'all touch him, we ridin', nigga
Yeah, first black president, win, lose or draw, nigga
Haha, matter of fact, you know what it is, man?
Shouts out to Jackie Robinson, Booker T. Washington, homie
Oh, you ain’t think I knew that shit?

I’m important too though

136,Too Drunk...,"[Intro]
I guess we’re doing, uh, too drunk to fuck right?

[Verse 1]
I hit the bottle in the morning in the summer time
I quit my job because it gets in the way
Find a party by the ocean, buy the cheapest wine
Called up my friends to come and waste the day
I got a dime bag, corduroys, coloured sleeves
And a bindle and some LSD
Now I'm just looking for a girl to meet
To help me forget my name

[Hook]
I could spend my lifetime getting high
Never wanna live in a suit and tie
Most of us are just living a lie
That’s why we get fucked up every night
I'm getting drunk all night
Oh I'm getting drunk all day
Oh I'm getting drunk all night
I'm sorry but I have to say, I'm too drunk to fuck (ya)
(I'm sorry but I have to say, I'm too drunk to fuck ya)

[Verse 2]
Now the party was jumping and the girls were flying
With the lipstick summer glaze
Got so many women coming after me
I put some pussy on lay away
I was smoked out, tore up, drunk as fuck
And I wouldn't wanna change a thing
Young and dumb and full of cum
With a sugar loaded candy cane

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I can’t eat, can’t sleep and I'm bored as fuck
And the girl I want just walked away
She just found out I'm too drunk to fuck
Looks like I'm not getting laid

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah! No, too drunk to fuck you, ooh!
I'm too drunk to fuck you, somebody, help me!
Lord have mercy, somebody help me I can't fucking breathe
I'm too drunk to fuck!",Buckcherry,Buckcherry,2008,[96],1

138,Fearless,"[Verse 1]
There's something 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Verse 2]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Bridge]
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this

140,Now Or Never,"[Round 1: Raz]
Jay? Aye why you really took this battle?
J-A-Y if you didn't catch that you shouldn't have took this battle
But you wanted this, you wanted me to make the metal scream
If Jay sons approach I’ll grip the saw and reenact a horror scene
I’ll give ‘em two options to cross me and get X’d or assist me in your setup
And if I get word that your crew snitched or have plans to let up…
I’m holding something that’ll get more bodies wet than the summertime
And I’ll be back for you to carry out my bloody vow in time
Now that’s Scream, Jason, Saw, Exorcist, Carrie, Bloody Valentine
But I’m just getting warmed up I got more scenarios in my mind
Cause now you’re mad that I took out your crew, you’re sad and blue Jay
Bullets will fly at this bird bitch, you a Blue Jay
Think High School Musical when I pull up with two treys, them ain't food trays
Cause bullets will make your core bend, and leave you blue Jay
Aye what you got locked away safe in a safe Banks? Cash by the knots?
I don’t care if you poor or rich I’ll sneak in your house like Goldilocks
I don’t care if you there you give me a tighty whitey Fruit of the Loom feel
So if your man draws I’ll have three bare if it’s gold he locks
And since I’m leaving you wet and holy I thought about a better theme
Knowing what Ima do to you all I wanna do is pray so here’s a bible scheme
Like you know about the furnace, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego?
Well I know a Trini named Shedrack who fires so much, furnace is code for calico
You say you Tiger Woods with aim well me Shaq, who got better aim and ammo ho?
Your family will know the answer by tomorrow when I dump your body in a bin 'n go
I dump cigs like Cruella when I spot bitches who think I won’t skin 'em, that’s dalmatian
You know I got niggas who keep it 101 on speed dial so that dial may shun
Any ideas you have, you claim you an animal well PETA won’t save you from this cruelty about to go down
For biting the hand that feeds you with this pound I’ll have you restrained and put down
See Jay from Brooklyn but that don’t matter cause he’s in my territory
Know some foul cons with bulldogs and hawks to get rid of shorty
I’ll come to your house and make your mom to drink brown liquor to relax her
Since she the state bird it’s only right I get the lighter and light her when the brown thrash her
Falcons, Bulldogs, Hawks, Brown Thrasher y'all don’t get that? Them Georgia lines
Ray Charles mission cause that’s how I kill with Georgia on my mind
And if your neighbors seen something they weren't suppose to I’m coming loaded with some men in black
To let metal flash before their eyes like The Men In Black
Now he sending threats so I sent a message for Jay to respond
Raz a GA native so his illegal firearm is anchored on a boat in the middle of a pond
But if he wanna cap it’ll be at land to bring to Atlanta the capital
And he’ll find you fresh out of school on your school bus to cap it all
Now he all paranoid knowing that my niggas are hiding and seeking
Flinching at every shadow while they in his window peeping
My nigga called like “he got more heat” I said I’ll send more heat then
I want to make it unfair and ambush like ‘The Last of the Mohicans’
I pulled up with cold thoughts ready to spark fire in his tepee
In all black locked and loaded like “Jay here? Where is he?”
My nigga said he was in the living room sitting in a chair a key
Was under the door I busted in with my niggas airing metal shit, Tuskegee
He tried to run so I a grabbed his shirt and tore out a patch he
Wasn't able to dance around this fire like the Apache
Cause now he on the floor bloody wishing he at least had a mag
Then I’ll tell him he’s the sacrifice as tecs come out of bags
That’s what you get for making idol threats, talk is cheap
In the end for testing a native you’ll be dumped in the creek
Translation you won’t be bulletproof when I grab the titanium that pop bitch when I see ya
Wait bulletproof, titanium, pop bitch, that’s Sia
I’m Game Boy to 3 X box you cause these barz hotter than 360 and classic like Sega Genesis cause I don't play games
For thinking you built for this I’ll aim at your spine and put two K’s on your discs like the latest NBA video games
Ironic you talk all this shit for nothing cause you are shit cause I’ll still be in the picture like a watermark
I don't have to talk shit cause there’s some shit in my house that talks for me like that episode of South Park
Shout out to the ladies tuning in but I don’t think they’ll get this next line so let me see if this sounds familiar to the dudes
Cause for this pussy I got an iron that’ll curl and leave him leaking like Jennifer Lawrence nudes
And I’m not saying I have the best performance or barz in the world, but like the Sims game they've never seen this delivery
I’ll be at your door with a ratchet in hand that’s impatient and she’ll open the door before Jay get a chance, that’s how I kill chivalry
Extended arms these cans non-perishable in case of an emergency you food Banks
I’ll make a small incision in Jay’s back and put something silver in it I’ll piggy Banks
If he told you I’m dying he lying & I’m Daniel so I could give a fuck about Jay’s den
If you bet on Jay he losing get mad at Jay den, and if we scrap he’ll be bloody he ain't no karate kid he ain't Jaden
Round 1 …

[Round 2: Raz]
You 16, so you can’t be mad when I say laughing at the thought of you busting guns was about damn near irresistible
Well since you the “hollow man” my niggas ready to ride like that Sleepy Hollow man and fuck it I got a hollow man that will leave you like the hollow man invincible
I mean really all this shit you saying you gone do to me I don’t believe, cause that ain't you Jay
Cause in your Chiraq verse, you said you wasn't hood, see that ain't cool Jay
Up in my DMs saying we’d make a match I was like LOL cool Jay
You’ll be behind my bars for your lies like Jiggy Walker on OZ, you LL Cool J
How dare he lie I know a cat who’ll bring beef holding a cal boy cause your bull I don’t buy son
If you survive the first few bullets play dead and if you get a chance grab ‘em tight cause my men tend to go overboard when they hear sirens
I’ll pull up to his honor’s day program to do his classmates, him, and his kin bad
They call me Jack Sparrow cause I have dreads and a knife that’s adventurous like Sinbad
I told my niggas to jack and don’t spare a row cause I came here to sin bad
To cause a panic I’ll cap ten in the air and hook you, I ain't come to lollygag
If your mom try to run out I’ll have bullets from the chopper chasing a bitch like Will Turner
Cause when I pull it out she won’t hesitate to run it will turn her
Pull out a big ass machete and like Davy Jones get da crackin'
Stack dead nigga on top of dead nigga like I’m bill stacking
This cannon will make you walk the plank or I’ll shoot at your body cause your body’s a vessel
For thinking you flyer I’ll throw him and his mom in the cellar to let that pair rot cause I am rebel
That’s pirate shit but I’m ready to set sail so lift the anchor
My attitude is fuck it like that black Alaskan anchor
But remember you said you were going to put me in the box in September?
Well it’s pass September but what can you do when I got the chopper chopping except timber?
But maybe I’ll spare you since your last name Banks
Cause shit I might even be able to bank off Banks
Like ..
Ring! Ring! Your mom answers her friend says some news has come up
Quick turn to channel five and turn the volume up
This just in, Raz kidnaps male for ransom identified as Jay Jay Banks
Has his favorite gun named Frankie aimed while he’s tied in constraints
Just think of that scene in Set It Off, you know after that nigga robbed the bank?
Cause even when I get my money Frankie still getting fired in Banks
But try and take that escape route thinking that you’ll get away..
Think Tyra Banks cause that pump click clacks when bitches run way
But wait I’m from the South so how about I fit the scene
And switch things up, like how about another movie scheme?
Y'all ever watched ‘Down in the Delta’? Well I keep a Beretta low I call her Loretta Sinclair
I already said I came to sin bad so that means in this murder I’m committing now I don’t want no sin clear
I’m like the boy in the movie I can’t trust Loretta she’s unpredictable
She might rise and make him go Bye Bye an he will be missing his occipital
And I relate to the boy another way cause he kept his money in a stuffed animal he must not trust Banks
Maybe I should steal money and throw him in this bag like I rob banks
Fuck it I’ll just let my niggas grabs bats and press ya
Like the little boy you’ll be left with a crack head somewhere down in the delta
You think you the shit, you ain't a problem child
Cause you bring hell to none like the Problem Child
I got a gun so big ... SIKE that’s played out, I got a guitar case though
Jay will let his guards down then like the bar scene in Desperado I’ll pull out dis pair of autos
If I feel you’re amounting to anything you’ll be left under the stars like the logo for Paramount
What I withdraw will make large deposits but that’ll be on Bank’s account for thinking he’s paramount
If you not able to dance around this fire then don’t run for the hammer you nailed Banks
You’ll be Dancing with The Stars like Alfonso Ribeiro I’ll Carlton Banks
He ain't ill nobody came here for him nobody wanna hear Jay talk
If I’m in the car and see him crossing the street my car will hit Jay anywhere Jay walk
What can you say? You’ll make the metal sing like Eddie Levert if I owe Jay
Man I’ll let you roll a bunt and take a puff and take it. Talking bout “I hit it 1st” fuck outta here this ain't no Ray J
I’ll invite you over for cards but if I lose I got something under the table that’ll turn tables that’s how I DJ
I have two pistols and that couple will pop off at your reunion to fuck shit up I’ll Joseline & Stevie Jay
Battle rap is a hunger game and to be rude his next round I should interrupt in the middle and start mocking Jay
He’s seen the first two clips but this third clip will be more anticipated than Hunger Games: Mocking Jay
When I shoot you’ll see the light but this gun ain't a flare though
I’ll put you in your tomb with this fine metal like an Egyptian pharaoh
Round 2 …

[Round 3: Raz]
Now these last two rounds I've shown how I make bullets roam and leave families hoping for new miracles when I clock with 9’s and let twelve ring like Big Ben
But for this round I stand out and show how I’m the best then cause I don’t have to put the laser beams on you like cyclops to X men
I’ll grab gasoline and torch you till you’re ash and like Jean Grey you’ll rise with wings
Or I’ll leave you blue cause I’m beast with the hands or blades will pop out of nowhere I’m Wolverine
I told you already I didn't need no guns so I don’t have to be like Magneto and trigger metal things
I’ll appear and disappear every where you look I’m the Nightcrawler and I’ll be in your mind like Professor X all in your dreams
Or I’ll get on my Storm shit cause your sister? Their gonna have to give her a cane when I twist her arm and her leg
You’ll get flipped like them Jamaicans from the movie ‘Cool Runnings’ when they were in their bobsled
And I don’t mean to preach today
But I need to do a quick battle rap PSA
Cause my mentality is if I come up with something I've heard before or that’s similar I change that shit
But some of y'all mentality is well it would sound new if I rearranged that shit
How many times will we hear the same exact wordplay senile, see now
I guess some felt it was up for grabs like I can put this in my round and this will be me now
I’m a supporter of the culture stop reusing it unless your adding to it like in my head I’m senile
I have nightmares that I've never understood but now that Jay is here it’s coming back I see now
I saw blood flowing and birds, pay attention I’m telling you my dream now
What it means? It means I have two options. I’ll sneak in his room and make it a bloody scene I’ll
Cut his throat cause I don’t buy bull and watch his DNA flow out like a bloody river it was as if I had seen Nile
You know the story about the bloody river in the bible? That was the Nile do y'all see now?
Or we can turn it into a hunting strategy like the bird in my dream I’ll
Pull up in the Chevy and have my nigga go to the door and knock, turn all lights off in the car meanwhile
I’ll have niggas across the street on the roof scoping prey from long range like they've observed and seen owl
You know hunting strategy, nocturnal, scoping prey from long range it’s like they've observed and seen owl
Now my addition to it can’t really be flipped any other way so dead it, y'all can’t recycle lines at y'all next event
But who am I kidding? Circus uni-cyclist the way y'all recycle lines every event
Battle rap is becoming weak flips and a bunch of people recycling shit that’s usually trash
Now is that a double meaning cause when you’re recycling shit it’s usually trash
But I’m off that
We have to climb stairs cause there are levels to this shit and you’re not Bruce Lee so the top you won’t get there
You’ll die like the mom from ‘What’s Eating Gilbert Grape"" for trying to take them stairs
It’s no stunner that I’m stone cold and will make you hit rock bottom like The Rock
You’ll get the Mufasa treatment cause I’ll leave any cat with pride rock
When I’m done with Banks they won’t be able to figure out on first glance this person’s identification
Cause my blade, she’s sharp minded and can help rearrange your thoughts that’s personification
You might think I’m lying and all bluff but trust me it’s all facts
It ain't a Hyperbole cause she bout that so ain't no need to hype her belee dat
You’re an asshole who talks shit that no one takes serious cause you speak tongue in cheek
And you dick ride and kiss ass when you see opportunity like you really tonguin' cheek
If I’m out to get your crew, they must be cursed cause they will be skeletons by midnight like the crew of the Black Pearl
If you say you know a chick who hold hot shit, you in ATL you must mean a Hooters girl
Already mentioned how me and my niggas would take anything you got Banks
Call me Jessie James cause I’ll be the first to rob Banks
And how your name Banks but ain't caking up?
I’ll put knots in Banks like I’m saving up
What I can bring with pen and pad trust me you don’t want Banks
I will son you and leave bloody hand prints on you like Tom Hanks
My lucky blade will be cast away after I leave you slumped
If I need my niggas they’ll just keep running and running like Forrest Gump
Cause I don’t know what love is when it comes to Jay, fuck peace I just want to fuck shit up
I said this round wasn't going to be a toy story but I’m tempted to aim at his stomach and cap ten until he feel up
I know chicks who’ll swing bats cause they’re in a league of their own
If it’s beef it’s like you've got mail in my mailbox cause I’m taking it to your home
You sentenced to these barz so walk the green mile time to get right with Jesus Mr. Banks
Anyone trying to intervene will get smacked down and get dis knee nobody saving Mr. Banks
You got cooked the first round my skills I was just starting to unearth
You were cremated the second round from fire, that’s Venus you’re in my universe
The third round I brought you back home to Earth
Earth meaning do you want your ashes in the water or dirt?",Raz,High School Musical 3 Cast,2008,"[85, 68, 94]",3
141,Angels,"[Verse 1]
I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate?
And do they know, the places where we go
When we're grey and old?
'Cause I've been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel that love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

[Chorus]
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

[Verse 2]
When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love, oh
And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And I feel the love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

[Chorus]
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead
Yeah, ohh

[Chorus]
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

142,It's Over,"[Verse 1]
We've run out of words, we've run out of time
We've run out of reasons, really why we together?
We both know it's over, baby, bottom line
It's best we don't even talk at all, whoa
Don't call me even if I should cross your mind
Hard enough, I don't need to hear your voice on my messages
Let's just call it quits, it's probably better so
If I'm not returning your calls, it's 'cause...

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm not coming back, I'm closing the door
I used to be tripping over missing you but I'm not anymore
I got the picture phone, baby, your picture's gone
Couldn't stand to see your smile, every time you dialed

[Chorus]
'Cause it's over, girl, you know it's over this time
So when you call, I'm pressing 7
Don't wanna hear your messages, messages
I'm trying to erase you from my mind
'Cause it's over, I swear it
Girl, it's over this time
So don't be calling, leaving messages, don't wanna know where ya been
Baby, 'cause it's over

[Verse 2]
I still wake up every morning quarter to ten
Still eat my cereal right at the kitchen table
I can't even remember how long it's been
When your troubles stayed & occupied
Oh, ask about you whenever I come around
I do what I can not to put my business in the streets
Last thing I need's another episode
Keep conversations short and sweet because

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm not coming back, I'm closing the door
I used to be tripping over missing you but I'm not anymore
I got the picture phone, baby, your picture's gone
Couldn't stand to see your smile, every time you dialled

[Chorus]
'Cause it's over, girl, you know it's over this time
So when you call, I'm pressing 7
Don't wanna hear your messages, messages
I'm trying to erase you from my mind
'Cause, baby, it's over, I swear it
Girl, it's over this time
So don't be calling, leaving messages, no, don't wanna know where ya been, oh no
Baby, 'cause it's over

[Bridge]
You know that it's over when the burning and the yearning inside your heart ain't there anymore
And you know that you're through when she don't do to you and move you like the way she moved you before
And you wanna pull her close but your heart has froze
You kiss her but her eyes don't close
Then she goes out of your heart forever
And it hurts you but you know that it's better

[Chorus]
Girl, you know it's over, girl, you know it's over this time
So when you call, I'm pressing 7
Don't wanna hear your messages, messages
I'm trying to erase you from my mind, whoa, girl, you know
'Cause it's over, I swear it
Girl, it's over this time
So don't be calling, leaving messages, don't wanna know where ya been
Baby, 'cause it's over, yeah
'Cause it's over, girl, you know it's over this time
So when you call, I'm pressing 7
Don't wanna hear your messages, messages
I'm trying to erase you from my mind

143,Country Man,"[Verse 1]
You need hands, rough not soft
To come and warm you up, up in that cold hayloft
Let me hold you little darling in my big strong arms
Can't get these kind of muscles anywhere but a farm

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm a country man
A city boy can't do the things I can
I can grow my own groceries and salt cure a ham
Hey baby, I'm a country man

[Verse 2]
I've got a jeep with camouflage seats
That way nobody sees us parked back up in these trees
Your little iPod loaded down with Hoobastank
Don't be a tape player hater girl were cruising to Hank

Hey, I'm a country man
A city boy can't do the things I can
I can grow my own groceries and salt cure a ham
Hey baby, I'm a country man

You like the ivy league Humvee tennis sweater type
But girl, I'm here to tell you, don't believe the hype

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm a country man
I can wrestle hogs and gators with my two bare hands
Girl, you better move quick I'm in high demand
Hey, baby, I'm a country man

Why don't you come and join me in my new deer stand?

144,The Day That Never Comes,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Born to push you 'round
Better just stay down
You pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground
Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed, keep praying, just keep waiting

[Chorus]
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes, no
No, the son shine never comes

[Verse 2]
Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your time
God, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day, I'll splatter color on this gray

[Chorus]
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes, no

[Bridge]
Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison
I suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear, the son will shine
This, I swear! This, I swear!
This! I! Swear!

145,Something In Your Mouth,"[Verse 1]
Got to meet the hottie with the million dollar body
They say it’s over budget, but you'd pay her just to touch it, come on
Needs to hit the big screen and shoot a little love scene
If Hollywood had called her, she'd be gone before you hollered, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong
Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long
Doesn't care about the money, she could be with anybody
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along

[Chorus]
(You naughty thing)
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey
(You naughty woman)
You shake your ass around for everyone
(You’re such a mover)
I love the way you dance with anybody
(The way you swing)
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb
You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out
'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth

[Verse 2]
Crafty little lip tricks
Tattoos on her left hip
She bending as you’re spending
There’s no end to it, so baby, come on
Dressed up like a princess
Betting that her skin smells better
Than the scent of every flower in the desert, come on

She’s got money from her parents in a trust fund back East
T—t—t—tongues always pressed to your cheeks
While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl’s teeth

That I’m a vegetarian and I ain’t fucking scared of him

Y la vida se me rompe en mil pedazos

Mariposa ilusionada
Con la luna reflejada en tu mirada
Me perdi en un laberinto
Fui cautivo de tu amor tu prisionero
Y tu has llenado el vacio
Un rincon donde tu boca fue mi alivio
Y tu te me vas de las manos
Y la vida se me rompe en mil pedazos

I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

Baby, you know all the right things to say

I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot sex on the platter no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook
Had her grinding and winding against my leg
She messin with my head, wanna play in the bed
Sexy pumps on, toenails red
Your body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead
It hard to hold you when you movin' vulgar
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
My pulp ain't fiction, it's an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen

While mama play bingo, she ride mandingo

I'm really not sure if her breasts are fake
Cuz wit whipped cream on em, they taste just like cake
We drink some beer, inside of daddy's '64
She shot me in the back with cupids arrow
We finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress n she let me peep that

Bought her some dessert, give a damn if its early
Head spinnin around like roller derby
Everything about her says you don't deserve me

Running and laughing, music blasting
Side over the road, bent over crashing
Mouth all dry, can feel the urge
If you see my mama, don't say a word
The cops wanna know im a word are slurred
Don't ask me officer ask her
Wanna another drink baby she like sure
Wanna hit the club she like I don't curr

Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me

They don't feel me but they fear me

Diamonds on my pinky (ayy), hand on the pine
Bitch touch and now your momma do the second line
Screens fallin' from the sky, syrup fallin' in my cup
Old school Chevy thang, comin' down, nigga, what?
Got diamonds in my mouth, got some Gucci on my seat
Got Gs on my ass, bitch, it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck
You can gon' pass the mic, watch I'm 'bout to catch wreck
Still screamin' out mayne (mayne), pistol in my hand

The name you know of
A little bit of change, now your boy done blown up
In them foreign thangs with the guts exposed
Stunting ain't a thing to me, and it's obvious, it's plain to see
That you gon' make us both
Get into some thangs that is for grown folks
And they might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared, you need to get like me
Stunting is a habit, just gotta have it
Shorty keep throwing that thang at me, I'm gonna bag it
When she see the karats, a real Jessica Rabbit
Can't another boy do the things you like
He ain't your type to change your life, but if you did ya homework
Girl, I'm pretty sure you know what I got, drop-tops
And you know Jones and Banner gonna roll, let me stop

Let them bougie boys ride Maybach
I'm in the candy, laid back like I slang crack
My money stacked to the ceilin'
Gettin' in my Chevy's like climbin' up a buildin', them 28's on deck
37 on my wrist, a hundred five on my neck
This rap money's okay but you should see these movie checks
And this cartoon cash, the SS so sweet
My Bentley's hatin' on that ass, my old school's gettin' pissed
She opened up her arm but then she slit both wrists
There go them suicide doors (doors), wood on the dash
Ferris wheels on the toes and got duals on the ass
And some chrome on the nose, the white boys go, ""Sweet""
But black folks go, ""Oh,"" I got a 'llac full of ammo
I'm brick with the nine throwin' bombs out the Lambo' (uh)

183,Ready For Whatever,"[Intro]
Hate the price of fame 'coz it cost too much (yeah boy)
And you lame niggas talk too much (yeah)
I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em (yeah boy)
I said I'm ready for whatever, hey hey

[Verse 1]
Even though my head in the clouds, I'm planted on the pavement
How I walk around, people starin' at amazement
And I play a lot of game on where I be and I ain't playin with it
They so judgmental, maybe they don't understand
If your life was in jeopardy e'ryday, is you tellin me
You wouldn't need weaponry just because of your felony?
Consider this at least, I got e'rybody sweatin me
On the streets is people who won't rest unless I rest in peace
Killed my folk a year ago, still in my sleep they threaten me
Paranoia stressin me, ain't nobody protectin me
I'm dealin with the pressure from my partner dyin next to me
No one's arrested, they comin for me eventually
This was all the things I was goin through mentally
This could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary
Not mentioning New Orlean niggas comin in the city
Killin all summer long, ain't nobody payin attention

[Bridge]
Now, is it that hard to understand if you listen?
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision
But I'm wrong and I know it, my excuses aren't important
I'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real

[Hook]
I had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison
You waiting on me to die, you gon' be waiting for a minute
Ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
I be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real
Can't afford the price of fame 'coz it cost too much
Plus these sucka niggas lame and they talk too much
Ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
I be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real

[Interlude (over Post-Hook)]
Yeah, I know what you thinking
""First Michael Vick, now this, huh?""
Naw, not exactly
I tell you how this shit went down for real, dog

[Verse 2]
I'm a man, I ain't perfect, I admit it, I'm guilty
But understand, feel me, I was ridin filthy
'Coz niggas out there plottin, to rob me and kill me
500 thousand every year spent on security
And my future was bright, but now it's gettin blurry
'Coz niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me
But surely, God'll deliver me up out it
I'm a fighter to the heart, I forever be about it
I'm a father to my sons, asset to my community
Look at all that I done, my good weigh the negativity
Mentally, I was focused on not lettin history
Repeat itself, that’s why heat was kept in the vicinity
Yes, officially, I broke the law but not maliciously
Through all of the publicity, was anyone considerin
My position and the logic hid in my decision?
But they caught me with it, now I'm off to prison, period

[Bridge]
But is it that hard to understand if you listen?
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision

Ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em

Ay, I said listen, homeboy. You can talk all you want, mayne, you know what I'm saying? Everybody talk to the King, you know what I'm sayin? Everybody's entitled to an opinion, you know what I'm sayin? They like yesterdays, everybody got one
But the fact of the matter remains: if you ain't walk a mile in my shoes and you ain't lived a day in my life, you ain't survive the shit I done survived, you ain't had to deal with the shit I had to deal with, homeboy—you can't muhfuckin' judge me, partner
I mean, look at folk like Sean Taylor. You know what they said?
They said, had he had a strap, he'da lived today. You know what I'm sayin?
Now, true enough, I was dead wrong, I broke the law, I deserve to be punished. I understand that, aight? Cool. But listen, man, I got a house full of kids, a mama, and an old lady, whose life is my responsibility. You dig that?
Now, for all of y'all who think I was just ridin' around on some dumb shit: you know I'm smarter than you man! You know I'm smarter than you dawg! Ay, if you think I was just being stupid, shawty, I got some muhfuckin' oceanfront property in Idaho for sale, homie. If you believe that, I got a bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you, partner
Ay, man, real talk: In order to understand my train of thoughts, you have to put yourself in my position. You can't expect me to think like you, 'cause my life ain't like yours, you know what I'm sayin?
If you don't understand that, you don't understand English. I'm done talking",T.I.,T.I.,2008,[57],1
184,Don't Forget,"[Verse 1]
Did you forget that I was even alive?
Did you forget everything we ever had?
Did you forget?
Did you forget about me?
Did you regret (did you regret) ever standing by my side?
Did you forget (did you forget) what we were feeling inside?
Now I'm left to forget about us

[Chorus]
But somewhere we went wrong
We were once so strong
Our love is like a song
You can't forget it

[Verse 2]
So now I guess this is where we have to stand
Did you regret ever holding my hand?
Never again
Please, don't forget
Don't forget
We had it all
We were just about to fall
Even more in love than we were before
I won't forget
I won't forget about us

And the place where He was laid has rolled up sheets
You know it's like a huge slumber party
You know it's like a huge slumber party

Someone has moved that old huge stone but how could this be
'Cause it must have weighed a ton and all could see
You know it's hard to lose someone's body
You know it's hard to lose someone's body
Someone broke through

All through the night while the eleven of us went off to weep
He waited for the break of morn without a peep
I hope it was a breakthrough moment
I know it was a breakthrough moment

'Holler back when you get back home'

Go ten miles
Take a right on Farm Road 99
And just roll 'til the blacktop ends

And that's where Hillbilly Heaven begins

Ah, she'll pour 'ya some of that cherry wine

I even up the doors to the financial estates (Ross)
She use to fight with her mom
'Til I sat 'em both down, now she tight with her moms
Yeah, I put the ice on her arm

We still blow weed together
Cheated on her but we still gon' be together
Put the house on the water, hit the beach whenever
She from the north and still can't believe the weather

Here I am, here I go
Why you lookin' for the others when you got the best?

Ya last man was a chump and you can tell 'em I said it
He was talkin' loud at first but you can see that he didn't
You can see I ain't sweatin'
Hell I'll call him up myself and tell him how he can get it
Naw, please don't confuse me miss
I'm tryna see how I can put you on my Christmas list
I hope you ain't offended by this
But I think ya ass fine as shit
And that's straight up real talk, all bullshit aside
She replied, ""I, like to do the wild thing""
Actions took place, at my place
Now my place is her place

Sitting here, on this lonely dock
Watch the rain play on the ocean top
All the things I feel I need to say
I can't explain in any other way

[Chorus]
I need to be bold
Need to jump in the cold water
Need to grow older with a girl like you
Finally see you are naturally
The one to make it so easy
When you show me the truth
Yeah, I'd rather be with you
Say you want the same thing too

Now here's the sun, come to dry the rain
Warm my shoulders and relieve my pain
You're the one thing that I'm missing here
With you beside me I no longer fear

I'll say it once and I'll leave you alone

I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't say this
But at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we've shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear

[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know, it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Verse 2]
It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear (Clear, clear)
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here

[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know, it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the seven that I like

[Chorus]
The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you

G4 up up and away, we go, we fly where we want
Haters smile like they like it when they really don't
Wish they could just wish me away that what they really want
""I really hate his ass"", ""I don't like him either""
""We'll do a song together maybe then we can beat him""
Somehow he must be stopped, something must be done
""If we can't knock him off, let's just try him when he get caught with guns""
""And if he really done, and we really won""
""Any more ideas, (I got some) suggestions anyone?""
""How 'bout we stay up all night, on the blog sites""
""Spread, vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write""
But that's all right, let the nerds hate
Cause in my face though, them words getin' ate
And hatin's hard work, when I just bounce back
This God work, tell all the haters I'm back!

[Hook]
Ay, what's Haapnin'
All you haters, can get at me
Cause I hear ya, and I'm watching
But I'm serious
Haters, so all I got to say is, ""What up""

What's haapnin'
All you haters, can get at me
Cause I hear ya, and am watching
But I'm still here, I ain't stoppin'
So what up",T.I.,T.I.,2008,[84],1

[Verse 1: T.I.]
New Akoo outfit with a Gucci rag
Tied to my belt loop and my Louis bag
Full of stacks, rubber bands, round big cash
Got a sick swag 'til the haters get mad, come on
We in the club, Holmes, getting our thug on
Bottles of Patron, if you're grown, get your buzz on
We brought the broads out and brought the cars out
I'm like the moon, I shine and bring the stars out
When it's dark out, get the squad out
We ball hard, sucker nigga, eat your heart out
I'm too advanced, super swag in my Louis pants
Balling on my Louis silk shirt, match my Louis rag

I say, ""Whoa kemosabe,"" big balling is my hobby
I'm bopping while I'm walking, rag falling out my pocket
If big money ain't the topic, homie, I ain't even talking
Hated on by the workers but I'm cool with all the bosses
Catch me flossin at the mall, talking to a broad
She follow me in Gucci and I taught her how to ball
Three pairs of shoes, four shirts, six rags
The chick said, 'Dag, that's more than my bag'
Shorty, I can show you how to spend this bread real fast
Then get a group of chicks to give you head real fast
Silk scarf's hanging out of my jeans
No, homie, I ain't thinking, I'm just doing my thing!

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I took some time off, and now I'm back y'all
You're in the line at the club, I'm in the back, dog
And when this song's on, ballers peel stacks off
And make it rain on them broads, watch them stacks fall
Let it sag with your pants, get your swag just right
Ride Bankhead, flares flying out the Benz
Once a fool with it, we're gon' bring them out again

Buzz. All run-away sheep bound back bopeep, trailing their teenes behind them. And these ways wend they. And those ways went they. Winnie, Olive and Beatrice, Nelly and Ida, Amy and Rue. Here they come back, all the gay pack, for they are the florals, from foncey and pansey to papavere’s blush, foresake-me-nought, while there’s leaf there’s hope, with primtim’s ruse and marry-may’s blossom, all the flowers of the ancelles’ garden.

He was feeling so funny and floored for the cue, all over which girls as he don’t know whose hue. If goosseys gazious would but fain smile him a smile he would be fondling a praise he ate some nice bit of fluff. But no geste reveals the unconnouth. They’re all odds against him, the beasties.

Mischnary for the minestrary to all the sems of Aram. Shimach, eon of Era. Mum’s for’s maxim, ban’s for’s book and Dodgesome Dora for hedgehung sheolmastress. And Unkel Silanse coach in diligence. Discon-nection of the succeeding. He wholehog himself for carberry banishment care of Pencylmania, Bretish Armerica, to melt Mrs Gloria of the Bunkers’ Trust, recorporated, (prunty!) by meteo-romancy and linguified heissrohgin, quit to hail a hurry laracor and catch the Paname–Turricum and regain that absendee tarry easty, his citta immediata, by an alley and detour with farecard awailable getrennty years.

Every monk his own cashel where every little ligger is his own liogotenente with inclined jambs in full purview to his pronaose and to the deretane at his reredoss. Fuisfinister, fuyerescaper!

With tears for his coronaichon, such as engines weep. Was liffe worth leaving? Nej!

Tholedoth, treetrene! Zokrahsing, stone! Arty, reminiscen-sitive, at bandstand finale on grand carriero, dreaming largesse of lifesighs over early lived offs — all old Sators of the Sowsceptre highly nutritius family histrionic, genitricksling with Avus and Avia, that simple pair, and descendant down on veloutypads by a vuncular process to Nurus and Noverca, those notorious nepotists, circumpictified in their sobrine census, patriss all of them by the glos on their germane faces and their socerine eyes like transparents of vitricus, patruuts to a man, the archimade levirs of his ekonome world.

But, by Jove Chronides, Seed of Summ, after at he had bate his breastplates for, forforget, forforgetting his birdsplace, it was soon that, that he, that he rehad himself. By a prayer? No, that comes later. By contrite attrition? Nay, that we passed. Mid esercizism? So is richt.
And it was so. And Malthos Moramor resumed his soul. With: Go Ferchios off to Allad out of this! An oldsteinsong. He threwed his fit up to his aers, rolled his poligone eyes, snivelled from his snose and blew the guff out of his hornypipe. The hopjoimt jerk of a ladle broom jig that he learned in locofoco when a redhot turnspite he. Under reign of old Roastin the Bowl Ratskillers, readyos! Why was that man for he’s doin her wrong! Lookery looks, how he’s knots in his entrails! Mookery mooks, it’s a grippe of his gripes. Seekeryseeks, why his biting he’s head off? Cokerycokes, it’s his spurt of coal. And may his tarpitch dilute not give him chromitis! For the mauwe that blinks you blank is mostly Carbo. Where the inflammabilis might pursuive his com-burenda with a pure flame and a true flame and a flame all too — gasser, soot. The worst is over. Wait! And the dubuny Mag may gang to preesses. With Dinny Finneen, me canty, ho! In the lost of the gleamens. Sousymoust. For he would himself deal a treat-ment as might be trusted in anticipation of his inculmination unto fructification for the major operation.

Like things are m. ds. is all in vincibles. Decoded.

Now a run for his money! Now a dash to her dot! Old cocker, young crowy sifadda, sosson. A bran new, speedhount, out-stripperous on the wind. Like a waft to wingweary one or a sos to a coastguard. For directly with his whoop, stop and an upa-lepsy didando a tishy, in appreciable less time than it takes a glaciator to submerger an Atlangthis, was he again, agob, before the trembly ones, a spark’s gap off, doubledasguesched, gotten orlop in a simplasailormade and shaking the storm out of his hiccups. The smartest vessel you could find would elazilee him on her knee as her lucky for the Rio Grande. He’s a pigtaiI tarr and if he hadn’t got it toothick he’d a telltale tall of his pitcher on a wall with his photure in the papers for cutting moutonlegs and capers, letting on he’d jest be japers and his tail cooked up.

Goal! It’s one by its length.

And he did a get, their anayance, and slink his hook away, aleguere come alaguerre. like a chimista inchamisas, whom the harricana hurries and hots foots, zingo, zango, segur.

Goof!

Hymnumber twentynine. O, the singing! Happy little girly-cums to have adolphted such an Adelphus! O, the swinginging hopops so goholden! They’ve come to chant en chor. They say their salat, the madiens’ prayer to the messiager of His Nabis, prostitating their selfs eachwise and combinedly. Fateha, fold the hands. Be it honoured, bow the head. May thine evings e’en be blossful! Even of bliss! As we so hope for ablution. For the sake of the farbung and of the scent and of the holiodrops. Amems.

A pause. Their orison arises misquewhite as Osman glory, ebbing wasteward, leaves to the soul of light its fading silence (allah — lah lahlah lah!), a turquewashed sky. Then:

Should in ofter years it became about you will after desk jobduty becoming a bank mid-land mansioner we and I shall reside with our obeisant servants among Burke’s mobility at La Roseraie, Ailesbury Road. Red bricks are all hellishly good values if you trust to the roster of ads but we’ll save up ourselves and nab what’s nicest and boskiest of timber trees in the nebohood. Oncaill’s plot. Luccombe oaks, Turkish hazels, Greek firs, incense palm edcedras. The hypso-meters of Mount Anville is held to be dying out of arthataxis but, praise send Larix U’ Thule, the wych elm of Manelagh is still flourishing in the open, because its native of our nature and the seeds was sent by Fortune. We’ll have our private palypeachum pillarposterns for lovesick letterines fondly affianxed to our front railings and swings, hammocks, tighttaught balletlines, accomoda-tionnooks and prismic bathboites, to make Envyeyes mouth water and wonder when they binocular us from their embrassured windows in our garden rare.

You mustn’t miss it or you’ll be sorry. Charmeuses chloes, glycering juwells, lydialight fans and puffumed cynarettes. And the Prince Le Monade has been graciously pleased. His six choco-late pages will run bugling before him and Cococream toddle after with his sticksword in a pink cushion. We think His Spark-ling Headiness ought to know Lady Marmela. Luisome his for lissome hers. He’s not going to Cork till Cantalamesse or may-hope till Rose Easter or Saint Tibble’s Day. So Niomon knows. The Fomor’s in his Fin, the Momor’s her and hin.

Since the days of Roamaloose and Rehmoose the pavanos have been strident through their struts of Chapelldiseut, the vaulsies have meed and youdled through the purly ooze of Ballybough, many a mismy cloudy has tripped taintily along that hercourt strayed reelway and the rigadoons have held ragtimed revels on the platauplain of Grangegorman; and, though since then ster-lings and guineas have been replaced by brooks and lions and some progress has been made on stilts and the races have come and gone and Thyme, that chef of seasoners, has made his usual astewte use of endadjustables and whatnot willbe isnor was, those danceadeils and cancanzanies have come stimmering down for our begayment through the bedeafdom of po’s taeorns, the obcecity of pa’s teapucs, as lithe and limbfree limber as when momie mummed at ma.

214,My Apocalypse,"[Verse 1]
Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

[Bridge 1]
Feel thy name, extermination
Desecrate, inhale the fire

[Chorus 1]
So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

[Verse 2]
Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still

[Bridge 2]
Fear thy name, annihilation
Desolate, inhale the fire

[Chorus 2]
So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
My apocalypse

Go

[Bridge 3]
Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gas
Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shattered face, spitting glass
Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Split
Spit it out!

[Verse 3]
What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over?
Worn to repeat until I feel

See through the skin the bones they all rattle
Future and past they disagree
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me
See the end in me

[Verse 4]
Claustrophobic
Climb out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Violate, annihilate
Wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate
Life itself denied

[Bridge 4]
Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny, inhale the fire

[Chorus 3]
But we've crossed that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

[Outro]
Tyrant awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypse",Metallica,Metallica,2008,[67],1

So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair

But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

Scared to moan 'round you, so all I can say is ""ooh""

I jus' gave her a nick name, it's ""Wet-Wet""
Cause when we finished, she mess up all the bedsets
She got sumthin to relax me when I'm under stress
Never told her or let her know it but she the best
She like to spell her name wit her tongue on my chest
If you'da told me it was this good, I'da never guessed
She full of surprises, I don't know what she'll do next
But while she sleep I sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go out, she shut down the whole set
Love to see her in heels wit the slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair and get her own checks
My BUST IT BA-BY, I keep her on deck

Look at me, look at me
Hands in the air like it's good to be
Alive, and I'm a famous rapper
Even when the paths are all crooked-y
I can show you how to do-si-do
I can show you how to scratch a record
I can take apart the remote control
And I can almost put it back together
I can tie a knot in a cherry stem
I can tell you about Leif Ericson
I know all the words to ""De Colores""
And I'm proud to be an American
Me and my friends saw a platypus
Me and my friend made a comic book
And guess how long it took?
I can do anything that I want 'cause look—

I can keep rhythm with no metronome
No metronome, no metronome
And I can see your face on the telephone
On the telephone, on the telephone

[Verse 2]
Look at me, look at me
Just called to say that it's good to be
Alive, in such a small world
I'm all curled up with a book to read
I can make money, open up a thrift store
I can make a living off a magazine
I can design an engine sixty-four miles to a gallon of gasoline
I can make new antibiotics
I can make computers survive aquatic conditions
I know how to run a business
And I can make you wanna buy a product
Movers, shakers, and producers
Me and my friends understand the future
I see the strings that control the systems
I can do anything with no resistance 'cause—

I can lead a nation with a microphone
With a microphone, with a microphone
And I can split the atom of a molecule
Of a molecule, of a molecule

[Verse 3]
Look at me, look at me, driving and I won't stop
And it feels so good to be alive and on top
My reach is global, my tower secure
My cause is noble, my power is pure
I can hand out a million vaccinations
Or let 'em all die in exasperation
Have 'em all healed from their lacerations
Or have 'em all killed by assassination
I can make anybody go to prison
Just because I don't like 'em
And I can do anything with no permission
I have it all under my command because—

[Chorus 3]
I can guide a missile by satellite
By satellite, by satellite
And I can hit a target through a telescope
Through a telescope, through a telescope

In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)

Something you dream inside your head
You know how I feel because it's just you and me
Something I need to call my own
To feel and call my own

Duck inside this empty room
And I'm waiting for the sun to come to me
Someday, I'm gonna get this right
Gonna find a better way, I wanna lead another life

But I'm trapped inside the fear
And I never said a word though you always seemed to hear
When I take so long to say these words
Yeah, you wait so long for me

With your flip flops, half shirt, short shorts, mini skirt
Walkin' on the beach, so pretty
You wasn't lookin' for a man
When you saw me in the sand
But you fell for the boy from the city

Cause we were feelin' young love
And we couldn't get enough

251,Back When I Knew It All,"[Verse 1]
At the ripe old age of nineteen
I bought a short bed pick up chicks machine
Life ran on beer and gasoline
A half a lap ahead of the law
I had a fake I d that got me into ""Tuffies""
Love was a word I used to get lucky
Was a big time spender with that plastic money
Back when I knew it all

[Chorus]
Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

[Verse 2]
I found out credit cards don't mean you're rich
And beer and gasoline don't mix
Yeah step side trucks can't jump a ditch
And those ""big house"" rooms sure are small
I've learned that love is a woman that will settle you down
A sunday sermon can turn life around
Man I can't believe all the answers I've found
Since, back when I knew it all

[Chorus]
Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

[Bridge]
I've done some growing up
And I'm still growing up
So I know I'll never be
As smart as I once was
That was back

Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back

252,Better As A Memory,"[Verse 1]
I move on like a sinners prayer
Letting go like a levee breaks
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
I'm built to fade like your favorite song
Getting reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
Break my heart, but it won't bleed
My only friends are pirates
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

[Verse 2]
Never sure when the truth won't do
I'm pretty good on a lonely night
I move on the way a storm blows through
I never stay, but then again, I might
I struggle sometimes to find the words
Always sure until I doubt
Walk a line until it blurs
Build walls too high to climb out
But I'm honest to a fault
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

[Bridge]
I see you leaning, you're bound to fall
I don't want to be that mistake
I'm just a dreamer and nothing more
You should know it before it gets too late

[Verse 3]
Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel
You never know where they're gonna land
First you're spinning, then you're standing still
Left holding a losing hand
But one day you're gonna find someone
And right away you'll know it's true
That all of your seeking's done
It was just a part of the passing through
Right there in that moment you'll finally understand
That I was better as a memory than as your man
Better as a memory than as your man",Kenny Chesney,Kenny Chesney,2008,"[99, 90, 70, 60, 55, 50, 46, 46, 53, 51, 54, 58, 60, 56, 64, 72, 87]",17

255,I'm Still A Guy,"[Verse 1]
When you see a deer you see Bambi
And I see antlers up on the wall
When you see a lake you think picnic
And I see a large mouth up under that log
You're probably thinking that you're going to change me
In some ways well maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up, oh, but no matter what
Remember, I'm still a guy

[Verse 2]
When you see a priceless French painting
I see a drunk, naked girl
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember, I'm still a guy

[Chorus]
I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

[Verse 3]
I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying, ""Yeah girls he's come a long way""
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
And building a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well, now, what can I say at the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

[Chorus]
And I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

[Verse 4]
These days there's dudes getting facials
Manicured, waxed and botoxed
With deep spray-on tans and creamy lotiony hands
You can't grip a tacklebox
Yeah, with all of these men lining up to get neutered
It's hip now to be feminized
But I don't highlight my hair
I've still got a pair
Yeah, honey, I'm still a guy

Just can't get through to you (ooh, ooh)
I'm never gonna tell nothing wrong (ooh, ooh)
Listen (ooh)

[Verse 1]
Now, now she loved me, shawty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said she'd stay
And lately, I've been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave, but you lied to me when you said that
""Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back""

[Chorus]
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains... (moving mountains)
It's like moving mountains... (moving mountains)
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Ooh, ooh
Be, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoaaa, whoa

[Verse 2]
She, she don't touch me, I don't touch her
We rarely even ever say a word
I really want to give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the good
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments
Always pissed, man I'm tired
Every kiss that I miss
Girl, you know I'm trying
You never believe when I say
And I never believe it when you say
""I love you"", and I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it
'Cause we will never be the same, ooh
I've been standing in gas and you have been the flame

[Chorus]
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to get through
But it's like moving mountains

Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?

[Bridge]
This must be a slow death that I'm traveling on
It feels so wrong, I'm barely holding on
See, no matter what it takes
I've gotta get it together
And these hills that I'm traveling up
She ain't showing me love
I'm down on my love
Oh, I'm down, whoa

[Chorus]
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving a mountain
Steady trying to move this mountain
So, baby, why you just leave me
Just leave me be?

Everybody tried to warn us
Said we wouldn't make it any further
Than that worn out Chevy would

We broke down a time or two
Thought ""maybe we didn't think it through""
We were all we had to turn to
When it wasn't lookin' good

We're lookin' back laughin'
'cause they called us crazy

(chorus)
We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly - had to get away
Took a chance on that feelin' - baby
We were lovin' blind - borderline reckless
We were livin' for the minute we were spinnin' in
Maybe we were a lot of things
But we weren't crazy

Just a couple kids a couple years ago
Now we gotta couple kids of our own
We turn out right - proved them wrong
Look at us goin' strong

Lookin' back laughin'
'cause they called us crazy

(repeat chorus)
Coulda set it down
When things got tough
Coulda walked away from this love
But that'd been crazy

We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly, had to get away

Trying your hardest to make me give in
But I'mma be down to give you what'chu wanting if you keep it up

And I don't want security rolling up on us (I got you)

I mean, we could do it like a G
On the couch in V.I.P
Shawty, we could get it on
I'm like, shout out to the DJ for playing this song
Girl, we could act like two damn fools
And everybody think we doing a dance move
Call me, so I can make it juicy for ya
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover, girl
And it started with a hug
But now we making love in this club
And we're not gonna stop just because
The people in the crowd are watching us
But we don't give a damn what they say
And this is the, the remix, baby

Come a little closer to daddy, put it on you
Need you to know what happens here, stays here
And I'm ready and willing, almost got to go
Got you standing at attention, keep it on the low

Forgettin' Nas the only true rebel since the beginnin'
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow
Try tellin' Bob Dylan, Bruce or Billy Joel
They can't sing what's in their soul
So ""Untitled"" it is
I never change nothin', but people remember this

With new ideas bein' told what they can and can't spit
I can't sit and watch it, so shit, I'ma drop it

This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust

I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands just take the wheel
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh

And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see?

Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could

It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low
If you love me, won't you let me know?

[Verse 2]
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross held aloft
Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze
And if you love me, won't you let me know?

[Verse 3]
I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below
So if you love me, why'd you let me go?

Hey, yeah

See ever since the day I've got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm makin it known cause, I just want the world to know
I'm payin my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin homage cause, you've paved the way for me, ye-yeah

[Verse 1: The Game]
I swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday
Let the top down, California's my birthplace
So I'mma take you there like B.I.G took niggas to New York
""Juicy"" had us feelin like we was from New York
And that's real shit, blazed the Philly
It's ""Summertime"", shout out to Will Smith
Cause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince?
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks
My nigga Nas told me ""Money Make the World go Round""
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive
I used to think LL stood for ""Love LA""
He from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?
Red Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match
Red Adidas, nigga, Game is back

Public Enemy and N.W.A
Is all my boombox had to say
""Today was a Good Day"" had the hood buzzin
Ice Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggas can't tell me nothing
Everybody first bootleg was ""Boyz N the Hood""
Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood?
When the cars ride by with the ""Boomin' System""
Two door Mustang, and the roof was missin'
Every girl at your school had the new extensions
Even gangstas was dancin' like New Edition
Cause the house parties stayed rockin all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright (alright)
Cause after the cops left, it was a party then
You down with O.P.P.? Then bring Naughty in
They say ""It Never Rain in Southern California"", Tony! Toni! lied
Sit back, watch Game throw his money in the sky

In the back, I relax with all the hunnies
DJ bring it back, let it go
Mix it in with Black Rob, make 'em say ""WHOA!""
Everything full circle, Game livin' major
Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talkin 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em
Just like they showed me, my lyrics is O.G
When it's all said and done, you niggas gon' quote me

You will shiver, 'til you deliver

Started slingin' that air guitar
Man, you sure can play
And I've had that song in my head all day

I just wanna hear it

I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings, and I missed you
But I'm glad we talked through

You never let it show because
You loved me and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today face to face

And everyday life goes on like
""I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by""

Had to take a break
I've been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see

The flashing lights
The honking horns
All seem to fade away
But in the shadow of the hospital
At 5:08
I saw God today

I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

His fingerprints are everywhere
I just look down and stop and stare
Open my eyes and then I swear
I Saw God Today

[Verse 2]
Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But I noticed that she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melting into shades of red

I know He's there
But I don't look

Take the light
And darken everything around me

The way that I love (The way that I love you)

[Verse 1]
I woke up kind of early today and something told me from that moment it wouldn't be the same
Felt like you were hiding something, but I didn't push it
I didn't complain or say nothing
I tried to act like I didn't see it
'Cause deep down, I knew I didn't wanna believe it
There it was, it was you and her, you left your sidekick on the nightstand
And I read

Now I'm standing here looking like damn
I thought it was you and I
Now all I got to say is why

The way that I love (The way that I love you)

I notice now that when I'm around you be tryna lock the doors, whispering on the phone
Now wait a minute, since we been in this house, you ain't never did this before
Tell me what's this about, I tried to sit and say to myself
This here is too good, he don't want nothing else
But there it was, it was you and her
You left the credit card receipt inside the beamer with

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything you bought
Everything you spent, now I'm standing here once again
I thought it was you and I, now all I've got to say is
Why

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees.""
And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?

Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?

299,New Soul,"[Chorus: Yael Naim]
I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take
But since I came here
Felt the joy and the fear
Finding myself making every possible mistake

[Verse 1]
I'm a young soul in this very strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit bout what is true and fake
But why all this hate?
Try to communicate
Finding trust and love is not always easy to make

Everything you have done
Why's everything so wrong

Come and give me your hand
I'll take your far away

Another time to carry the colors again

Another reason, another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered now, for me to light
My dedication to all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders without a regret
A declaration embedded deep under my skin
A permanent reminder of how it began

They tryna tag him, spray a brother frame
But your shots can't reach me, I'm way above your aim

I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song""

Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away

Waited for something to come along

[Verse 2: Fergie x2]
Well it's Fergie motherfucker comin straight from Cali-for-ni-A
Stuntin in my loc-locs, dreamin 'bout me M.I.A
Boyfriend wonderin where I'm at, cause I'm in the spot-spot
Why he always tryin to be puttin me down on lock lock?

[Hook: Fergie & Nelly]
Just walked through the door, what's it gonna be?
I can't get to the floor, boys all over me
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
I just walked through the door, what's it gonna be?
I can't get to the flo', girls all over me
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?

[Verse 3: Nelly & Fergie]
Patiently waitin and takin my time
Watchin these haters done come with they rhymes
Watchin these suckers all mimickin, gimmickin
Then they start fallin off one at a time
You be the searcher but you never could find
I promise you durrty I'm one of a kind
Mold is broken, the formula's mine
I killed the idea and destroyed the design
I was patiently waitin and takin my time
Now that I'm here I'm gettin my shine
All of you haters can kiss my behind
Specifically speakin I'm talkin 'bout mine
Don't need you to tell me I know that I'm fine
I'm killin it baby so call it a crime
Yeah you watch it but I'm stealin my time
I told you before that big girls don't cry

[Break: Fergie & Nelly]
At the liquor store
Girls, go fuck on tour
Where my party people at, oh?

[Hook: Fergie & Nelly]
Just walked through the door, what's it gonna be?
I can't get to the floor, boys all over me
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
I just walked through the door, what's it gonna be?
I can't get to the flo', girls all over me
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?

312,What Kinda Gone,"I heard the door slam
And I couldn't tell was it just the wind
Or was she mad again - ah hell
She's gettin in her car
I hollered baby is there something wrong
Thought I heard her say something sounded like I'm gone
But these days gone can mean so many things

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

Well its gettin dark out, she ain't back yet
Ain't called home, turned off the phone
Ah man hah this might not be good
I would have stopped her, when she went to leave
But I didn't 'cause I didn't really think what I'm thinkin now
I'm still not sure what gone is all about

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

Is it the kind of gone where she's at her mom's cooling down
She'll come around or the kind that says you had your chance
And she ain't comin back

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout
What kinda gone are we talkin bout
Yes what kinda gone are we talkin bout here

314,Psycho,"""Psycho""

[Said twice]
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho (yeah)

[Verse 1]
She lays down on the fresh lawn
She can make everything magical
But she tied one on big time
And it makes me wanna rewind
To back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
And you know we're gonna win again (yeah) [x3]

[Chorus:]
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho (yeah)
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the paranoid Flake-oh

[Verse 2]
She lays down on the sidewalk
Never very analytical
She is something simply beautiful
Re-appear when you feel magical
To back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
Yeah you know we're gonna win again

[Chorus]

You're the one, you're the one who is the schizophrenic psycho [3x]

Back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
And you know we're gonna win again

LAWRENCE OF ARABIA




BRIGHTON
He was the most extraordinary man I ever
knew.

VICAR
Did you know him well?

BRIGHTON
I knew him.

VICAR
Well, 'nil nais ibonam', but did he
really deserve a place in here?

REPORTER
Lord Allenby, could you give me a few
words about Colonel Lawrence?

ALLENBY
What, more words? The revolt in the
desert played a decisive part in the
Middle-Eastern Campaign.

REPORTER
Yes, sir. But about Colonel Lawrence
himself?

ALLENBY
No, I didn't know him well, you know.

REPORTER
Eh, Mr Bentley. You must know as much
about Colonel Lawrence as anybody does.

BENTLEY
Yes. It was my privilege to know him, and
to make him known to the world. He was a
poet, a scholar, and a mighty warrior.

REPORTER
Thank you.

BENTLEY
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

MAN
You, sir. Who are you?

BENTLEY
My name is Jackson Bentley.

MAN
Well, whoever you are, I overheard your
last remark and I take the gravest
possible exception. He was a very great
man.

BENTLEY
Did you know him?

MAN
No, sir. I can't claim to have known him.
I once had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

MURRAY
Knew him? No, I never knew him. He had
some minor function on my staff in Cairo.

(Cairo)


LAWRENCE
Michael George Hartley. This is a nasty,
dark little room.

HARTLEY
That's right.

LAWRENCE
We are not happy in it.

HARTLEY
I am. It's better than a nasty, dark
little trench.

LAWRENCE
Then, you're a big noble fellow.

HARTLEY
That's right.

LAWRENCE
Ah! Here is William Potter with my
newspaper.

POTTER
Here you are, Tosh!

LAWRENCE
Thanks. Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

POTTER
Ta. Is it there?

LAWRENCE
Of course. Headlines, but I bet it isn't
mentioned in The Times. ""Bedouin tribes
attack Turkish stronghold"", and I bet
that no one in this whole headquarters
even knows it happened, or cared if it
did. Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

MESSENGER
Sir. Mr Lawrence?

LAWRENCE
Yes?

FLIMSEY
Flimsey, sir.

LAWRENCE
Thank you.

HARTLEY
You'll do that once too often; it's only
flesh and blood!

LAWRENCE
Michael George Hartley, you're a
philosopher.

HARTLEY
And you're balmy!

POTTER
Ow! It damn well hurts.

LAWRENCE
Certainly, it hurts!

POTTER
Well, what's the trick then?

LAWRENCE
The trick, William Potter, is not minding
that it hurts.

LAWRENCE
Oh, by the way. If Captain Gibbon should
inquire for me, tell him I've gone for a
chat with the General.

POTTER
He's balmy!

HARTLEY
He's all right.


FREDDY
Lawrence!

LAWRENCE
Yes?

FREDDY
You're supposed to be... Do you usually
wear your cap in the mess?

LAWRENCE
Oh, yes.

FREDDY
You're supposed to be on duty, aren't
you? Where are you going?

LAWRENCE
Mustn't talk shop, Freddy. Not in the
mess. Matter of fact I'm going for a
'powwow' with the General.

FREDDY
I'm not asking as a superior; I'm asking
as the secretary of this mess. We don't
want chaps in here who should be on duty.

ORDERLY
Where are you going, please?

FREDDY
I must say! Lawrence!

LAWRENCE
Sorry!

FREDDY
You're a clown, Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
Ah well, we can't all be lion-tamers...
Sorry!

MURRAY
It's an intrigue, Dryden, and I do not
propose to let an over-wheeling,
finicking, crass lieutenant thumb his
nose at his general officer commanding
and get away with it.

DRYDEN
He doesn't sound as though he'd be any
great loss, sir.

MURRAY
Now, don't try that, Dryden. There's a
principle involved.

DRYDEN
There is, indeed. He's of no use here in
Cairo; he might be in Arabia. He knows
his stuff, sir.

MURRAY
Knows the books, you mean. I've already
sent out Colonel Brighton, who's a
soldier, and if Brighton thinks we should
send them some small arms, then we will.
What more do you want?

DRYDEN
There would be no question of Lieutenant
Lawrence giving military advice, sir.

MURRAY
By God, I should hope not!

DRYDEN
It's just that the Arab Bureau would like
its own man on the spot, sir, to eh...

MURRAY
To what?

DRYDEN
...to make our own appraisal of the
situation.

MURRAY
I may as well tell you it's my considered
opinion, and that of my staff, that any
time spent on the Bedouin will be time
wasted. They're a nation of sheep-
stealers.

DRYDEN
They did attack Medina.

MURRAY
Well, the Turks made mincemeat of them.

DRYDEN
We don't know that, sir.

MURRAY
We know they didn't take it. A storm in a
tea-cup, Dryden; a side-show. Do you want
my own opinion? This whole theatre of
operations is a side-show. The real war's
being fought against the Germans, not the
Turks, and not here but on the Western
Front, in the trenches. Your Bedouin
army, or whatever it calls itself, would
be a side-show of a side-show.

DRYDEN
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

MURRAY
Does the Arab Bureau want a 'big thing'
in Arabia? If they rise against the
Turks, does the Bureau think they're
going to sit down quietly under us when
they're asked until this war's over?

DRYDEN
The Bureau thinks the job at the moment,
sir, is to win the war.

MURRAY
Don't tell me my duties, Dryden!

OFFSCREEN
Lawrence, sir.

MURRAY
Send him in!

LAWRENCE
Good morning, sir.

MURRAY
Salute! If you're insubordinate of me,
Lawrence, I shall put you under arrest.

LAWRENCE
It's my manner, sir.

MURRAY
Your what?

LAWRENCE
My manner, sir. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't really.

MURRAY
No, I can't make out whether you're
bloody bad-mannered, or just half-witted.

LAWRENCE
I have the same problem, sir.

MURRAY
Shut up!

LAWRENCE
Yes, sir.

MURRAY
Now, the Arab Bureau seem to think you
would be of some use to them in Arabia.
Why? I can't imagine! You don't seem able
to perform your present duties properly.

LAWRENCE
I cannot fiddle, but I can make a great
state from a little city.

MURRAY
What!

LAWRENCE
Themistocles, sir. A Greek philosopher.

MURRAY
I know you've been well educated,
Lawrence. It says so in your dossier.
You're the kind of creature I can't
stand, Lawrence, but I suppose I could be
wrong. All right, Dryden, you can have
him for six weeks. Who knows? Might even
make a man of him. Come in. Yes? What is
it, Hallon?

HALLON
Navy signal, sir. the convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

MURRAY
Is that certain?

HALLON
Yes, sir. There doesn't seem to be any
artillery, sir.

MURRAY
But there must be artillery!

DRYDEN
Sir, this is something of an expedition.
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs, and then get back. He
can't do that in six weeks.

MURRAY
Two months, then.

DRYDEN
Three.

MURRAY
All right. Three. Now, will you let me do
some work, Mr Dryden.

DRYDEN
Thank you, sir.

LAWRENCE
I'd like to say, sir, that I am grateful
for this...

MURRAY
Shut up and get out!

LAWRENCE
Sir!

MURRAY
How can I fight a bloody war without
bloody artillery!

LAWRENCE
How did you do it. sir?

DRYDEN
You might better ask why I bothered to.

LAWRENCE
Because I'm the man for the job.

DRYDEN
I just wonder about that

LAWRENCE
Of course I'm the man for the job. What
is the job, by the way?

DRYDEN
Find Prince Feisal.

LAWRENCE
Good. And when I've found him?

DRYDEN
Find out what kind of man he is; find out
what his intentions are. I don't mean his
immediate intentions. That's of Colonel
Brighton's business, not yours. I mean,
his intentions in Arabia altogether.

LAWRENCE
Oh! That's new. Where are they now?

DRYDEN
Anywhere within three hundred miles of
Medina. They're Hasami Bedouins. They can
cross sixty miles of desert in a day.

LAWRENCE
Oh, thanks, Dryden. This is going to be
fun.

DRYDEN
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature get
fun of the desert: Bedouins and gods, and
you're neither. Take it from me; for
ordinary men, it's a burning, fiery
furnace.

LAWRENCE
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

DRYDEN
It is recognised that you have a funny
sense of fun.


TAFAS
Here, you may drink. One cup.

LAWRENCE
You do not drink?

TAFAS
No.

LAWRENCE
I'll drink when you do.

TAFAS
I am Bedu.


TAFAS
Truly, now, you are a British Officer?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

TAFAS
From Cairo?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

TAFAS
You did not ride from Cairo?

LAWRENCE
No. Thank Heavens. It's nine hundred
miles; I came by boat.

TAFAS
And before? From Britain?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

TAFAS
Truly?

LAWRENCE
From Oxfordshire.

TAFAS
Is that a desert country?

LAWRENCE
No; a fat country; fat people.

TAFAS
You are not fat?

LAWRENCE
No. I'm different... Here, take it.

TAFAS
First, I take you to Lord Feisal, then
you give it to me.

LAWRENCE
Take it now.

TAFAS
Bedu food.

LAWRENCE
Good.

TAFAS
More...Bedu!

LAWRENCE
Where?

TAFAS
From here to Lord Feisal's camp is Harif
country.

LAWRENCE
Yes, I know.

TAFAS
I am not Harif.

LAWRENCE
No. Hasimi of the Beni Salim.

TAFAS
Put the right foot in tight. Lock it with
your left foot. Then, when you're ready
to go, hit her on the shoulder and say,
'Hut, hut, hut!'

LAWRENCE
Hut, hut, hut!

TAFAS
Ah, today will be difficult, but tomorrow
good riding...  I think we reach Mastura
Well tomorrow. Yes? And from Mastura Well
to Lord Feisal's camp one day more. Now!

At the Harif Well

TAFAS
Good?

LAWRENCE
It's all right.

TAFAS
This is a Harif well. The Harif are a
dirty people.

LAWRENCE
Turks?

TAFAS
Bedu!

LAWRENCE
Who is he?... Tafas!

ALI
He's dead.

LAWRENCE
Yes. Why?

ALI
This is my well.

LAWRENCE
I have drunk from it.

ALI
You are welcome.

LAWRENCE
He was my friend.

ALI
That!

LAWRENCE
Yes. That.

ALI
This pistol yours?

LAWRENCE
No, his.

ALI
His?

LAWRENCE
Mine.

ALI
Then I will use it. Your friend was a
Hasami of the Beni Salim.

LAWRENCE
I know.

ALI
I am Ali of El Karish.

LAWRENCE
I've heard of you.

ALI
So, what was a Hasami doing here?

LAWRENCE
He was taking me to help Prince Feisal.

ALI
You have been sent from Cairo.

LAWRENCE
Yes.

ALI
I have been in Cairo for my schooling. I
can both read and write. My Lord Feisal
already has an Englishman.

LAWRENCE
Yes.

ALI
What is your name?

LAWRENCE
My name is for my friends. None of my
friends is a murderer.

ALI
You are angry, English. He was nothing.
The well is everything. The Hasami may
not drink at our wells. He knew that.
Salaam. Hut, hut, hut.

LAWRENCE
Sherif Ali. So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe, so long will they be
a little people; a silly people; greedy,
barbarous, and cruel, as you are.

ALI
Come. I will take you to Feisal.

LAWRENCE
I do not want your company, Sherif.

ALI
Wadi Safra is another day from here. You
will not find it, and not finding it, you
will die.

LAWRENCE
I will find it with this.

ALI
Good army compass. How if I take it?

LAWRENCE
Then you would be a thief.

ALI
Have you no fear, English?

LAWRENCE
My fear is my concern.

ALI
Truly. God be with you, English.


LAWRENCE
As I walk along the Bois Bou-long,
With an independent air,
You can here the girls declare,
'He must be a millionaire,
You can rum-ti-tum-ti-tum-ti-tum,
Ti-tuddely-tun-ti-tun-ti-tun,
I'm the man who broke the bank at
Monte Carlo.

BRIGHTON
Hey! You!...  I've been waiting for you.

LAWRENCE
Did you know I was coming?

BRIGHTON
I knew someone was coming; Feisal told
me.

LAWRENCE
How did he know?

BRIGHTON
Not much happens within fifty miles of
Feisal that Feisal doesn't know, I'll
give him that. No escort?

LAWRENCE
My guide was killed at the Matsra well.

BRIGHTON
Turks?

LAWRENCE
No. An Arab.

BRIGHTON
Bloody savages!

LAWRENCE
This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?

BRIGHTON
Yes, they're over there; now, just a
minute. What's your name and who sent
you?

LAWRENCE
Lawrence. I've been seconded to the Arab
Bureau.

BRIGHTON
Oh. and what are you to do for the Arab
Bureau?

LAWRENCE
Well, it's rather vague, sir. I'm to
appreciate the situation.

BRIGHTON
Well, that won't be difficult. The
situation's bloody awful. The morale, if
ever they had any, which I doubt, the
Turks knocked out of them in front of
Medina with howitzers. They're fading
away by dozens every night. What I want
to say to you is this; that wherever you
are and whoever you're with, you're a
British serving officer, and here's an
order; when we get into that camp you're
to keep your mouth shut. Do you
understand what I'm saying?

LAWRENCE
Yes, sir. I understand what you're
saying.

BRIGHTON
You'll make your appreciation and get
back to...Oh my God; not again!... I've
told him; God knows I've told him. 'Move
south', I've said, 'You're still in
range'. They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do.


FEISAL
Stand and fight! Stand and fight! Fire
back at them!...  Who are you?

BRIGHTON
Lieutenant Lawrence, sir. Seconded to the
Arab Bureau. This is a bloody mess, sir,
we'll have to move south.

FEISAL
Yes, yes, Colonel; fifty miles south. You
were right and I was wrong. We must take
some thought for the wounded.

BRIGHTON
Well, we can take care of them at Yenbo,
sir.

FEISAL
If they get to Yenbo.

BRIGHTON
Well, they can hardly come with us, sir.

FEISAL
No, they must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant, eh..

LAWRENCE
Lawrence.

FEISAL
You understand, Lieutenant Lawrence, my
people are unused to explosives and
machines. First the guns, and now this.


DAUD
Cigarette?

LAWRENCE
I'm sorry.

SOLDIER
Eh?

DAUD
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

SOLDIER
Hump off!

DAUD
Please, Your Excellency. Just one for
two?

BRIGHTON
Hold it, Jenkins! Jenkins! Jenk...!
Jenkins!

MAJID
'Aurens?

LAWRENCE
'Aurens!

MAJID
'Aurens, you have no servant.

LAWRENCE
I don't need a servant.

DAUD
No? We can do everything. Light fires;
cook food; wash clothes.

FERRAJ
Yes, everything.

LAWRENCE
I don't doubt it.

DAUD
It will be very nice for you...

LAWRENCE
I can't afford it.


SILIAM
Recite, then, as much of the Koran as may
be easy to you. God knoweth that there be
some among you sick while others travel
through the Earth in quest for the
bounties of God; others do battle in his
cause; recite, therefore, as much as may
be easy and observe the prayers; this
will be best and richest in the
recompense. Seek ye the forgiveness of
God; verily, God is forgiving, merciful.

FEISAL
Greetings, Ali.

ALI
My lord.

BRIGHTON
Sherif Ali.

FEISAL
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met Sherif
Ali, I think.

LAWRENCE
Yes, my lord.

FEISAL
And now, Siliam, the brightness.

SILIAM
By the noon-day brightness, by the light
when it darkeneth; thy Lord hath not
forsaken thee; neither hath he been
displeased...

FEISAL
...and surely the future will be better
for thee than the past...

LAWRENCE
...And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee and thou be satisfied.

FEISAL
So...? Yes, Colonel?

BRIGHTON
I want a decision, sir.

FEISAL
You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

BRIGHTON
Well, you're not doing much good here,
sir. I'm sorry to rub it in, sir, but we
can't supply you here.

FEISAL
You could supply us through Aqaba.

BRIGHTON
Aqaba! Well, if you can get hold of
Aqaba, sir, of course we can supply you,
but you can't.

FEISAL
You could.

BRIGHTON
You mean the Navy? The Turks have twelve-
inch guns at Aqaba, sir; can you imagine
what that means?

FEISAL
Yes, I can imagine.

BRIGHTON
Well, put that out of your mind, sir. The
Navy's got other things to do.

FEISAL
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

BRIGHTON
The one essential sector of this front is
and must be the Canal. You can see that,
sir, surely.

FEISAL
I see that the Canal is an essential
British interest; it is of little
consequence to us.

BRIGHTON
I must ask you not to speak like that,
sir. British and Arab interests are one
and the same.

FEISAL
Possibly.

ALI
Ha! Ha!

BRIGHTON
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.
Fall back on Yenbo and we will give you
equipment; give you arms, advice,
training, everything!

FEISAL
Guns?

BRIGHTON
A modern rifle for every man.

FEISAL
No, guns! Artillery! Guns like the
Turkish guns at Medina.

ALI
Yes. Give us guns and keep the training.

BRIGHTON
Your men need training far more then
guns, sir.

ALI
The English will teach the Bedu to fight?

BRIGHTON
We will teach them, Sherif Ali, to fight
a modern, mechanised army.

FEISAL
Yes, Lieutenant? What do you think about
Yenbo?

LAWRENCE
I think it is far from Damascus.

BRIGHTON
We'll have you in Damascus and never
fear.

FEISAL
Have you been in Damascus, Mr Lawrence?

LAWRENCE
Yes, my lord.

FEISAL
It is beautiful, is it not?

LAWRENCE
Very.

BRIGHTON
That'll do, Lawrence. Dreaming won't get
you to Damascus, sir, but discipline
will. Look, sir, Great Britain is a small
country; it's much smaller than yours; a
small population compared with some; it's
small but it's great, and why?

ALI
Because it has guns!

BRIGHTON
Because it has discipline!

FEISAL
Because it has a navy; because of this,
the English go where they please and
strike where they please and this makes
them great.

LAWRENCE
Right.

BRIGHTON
Mr Lawrence, that will do! Lieutenant
Lawrence, sir, is not your military
adviser.

FEISAL
But I would like to hear his opinion.

BRIGHTON
Damn it, Lawrence! Who do you take your
orders from?

SILIAM
From Lord Feisal in Feisal's tent.

ALI
Old fool! Why turn from him to him; they
are master and man!

LAWRENCE
My lord, I think... I think your book is
right. The desert is an ocean in which no
oar is dipped and on this ocean the Bedu
go where they please and strike where
they please. This is the way the Bedu
have always fought. You're famed
throughout the world for fighting in this
way and this is the way you should fight
now!

BRIGHTON
Well, I don't know.

LAWRENCE
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong. Fall
back on Yenbo, sir, and the Arab Rising
become's one poor unit in the British
Army.

FEISAL
What is this to you?

BRIGHTON
Lawrence, do you know you're a traitor?

FEISAL
No, no, Colonel, eh... he is a young man
and young men are passionate, but they
must say their say, but wiser people must
decide, I know you are right.

BRIGHTON
Very well, sir, once we move; the sooner
the better, you'll lose another fifty men
tonight.

FEISAL
You tread heavily, but you speak the
truth. I will give you my answer
tomorrow, now it is late... Colonel
Brighton means to put my men under
European officers, does he not?

LAWRENCE
In effect, my lord, yes.

FEISAL
And I must do it because the Turks have
European guns, but I fear to do it; upon
my soul, I do. The English have a great
hunger for desolate places. I fear they
hunger for Arabia

FEISAL
Then you must deny it to them.

FEISAL
You are an Englishman. Are you not loyal
to England?

LAWRENCE
To England and to other things.

FEISAL
To England and Arabia, both? And is that
possible? I think you are another of
these desert-loving English. Doughty. Stanhope. Gordon of
Khartoum. No Arab loves the desert. We
love water and green trees. There's
nothing in the desert. No man needs
nothing. Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with? Because we
are little people; a silly people;
greedy, and barbarous, and cruel. Do you
know, Lieutenant, in the Arab city of
C¢rdoba were two miles of public lighting
in the streets when London was a village?

LAWRENCE
Yes, you were great.

FEISAL
Nine centuries ago.

LAWRENCE
Time to be great again, my lord.

FEISAL
Which is why my father made this war upon
the Turks. My father, Mr Lawrence, not
the English. But my father is old and
I...I long for the vanished gardens of
Cordoba. However, before the gardens must
come the fighting. To be great again, it
seems that we need the English, or...

LAWRENCE
...Or?

FEISAL
What no man can provide, Mr Lawrence. We
need a miracle.


LAWRENCE
Aqaba! Aqaba...from the land!

ALI
You are mad! To come to Aqaba by land we
should have to cross the Nefud Desert.

LAWRENCE
That's right.

ALI
The Nefud cannot be crossed.

LAWRENCE
I'll cross it if you will.

ALI
You! It takes more than a compass,
Englishman. The Nefud is the worst place
God created.

LAWRENCE
I can't answer for the place, only for
myself. Fifty men?

ALI
Fifty! Against Aqaba?

LAWRENCE
If fifty men came out of the Nefud, they
would be fifty men other men might join.
The Howitat are there, I hear.

ALI
The Howitat are brigands; they will sell
themselves to anyone.

LAWRENCE
Good fighters, though.

ALI
Good? Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

LAWRENCE
They face the sea, Sherif Ali, and cannot
be turned round. From the landward side
there are no guns at Aqaba.

ALI
With good reason. It cannot be approached
from the landward side!

LAWRENCE
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.
Aqaba is over there. It's only a matter
of going.

ALI
You are mad!


FEISAL
And where are you going, lieutenant, with
fifty of my men?

LAWRENCE
To work your miracle.

FEISAL
Blasphemy is a bad beginning for such a
journey.

LAWRENCE
Who told you?

FEISAL
Ali did. Why not you?

LAWRENCE
You are falling back on Yenbo, sir?

ALI
Yes. Yes, I must. But I will spare these
to you. Did Ali break confidence to tell
me?

LAWRENCE
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance, my
lord.

FEISAL
Yet, you did not tell Colonel Brighton.

LAWRENCE
No. But since you do know, we can claim
to ride in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

FEISAL
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence, you may claim
it, but in whose name do you ride?


GASIM
Sherif! I caught them. They had tracked
us. They were here. I caught them.

ALI
Why are you here? Boy!

DOUD
To serve lord Aurens, Sherif.

GASIM
This is true, Aurens. They do wish it.

ALI
You have been tracking us. You were told
to stay.

DOUD
No, Sherif. Our camel strayed; we
followed her.

FERRAJ
She led us here to be lord Aurens'
servants. It is the Will of Allah.

ALI
Blasphemy!

LAWRENCE
Don't do that!

GASIM
No, no! Aurens. These are not servants.
These are outcasts. Parentless!

ALI
Be warned! They are not suitable.

LAWRENCE
They sound very suitable. You can ride
with the baggage.

ALI
These are not servants. These are
worshippers!

FERRAJ
Aurens?

LAWRENCE
Hm?

FERRAJ
One shilling...every week.

GASIM
That is fair.

FERRAJ
Each.

GASIM
NO! That is too much!

LAWRENCE
Alright.

GASIM
They will be lucky for you. Allah favours
the compassionate.


ALI
There is the railway...and that is the
desert. From here until the other side;
no water but what we carry: for the
camels; no water at all. If the camels
die, we die. And in twenty days they will
start to die.

LAWRENCE
There's no time to waste, then, is there?


LAWRENCE
I was thinking.

ALI
You were drifting.

LAWRENCE
Yes. It will not happen again.

ALI
Be warned! You were drifting.

LAWRENCE
It will not happen again!


ALI
That water is wasted. From now on we must
travel by night and rest while it is too
hot to travel. A few hours each day.

LAWRENCE
Why don't we start now?

ALI
No. We will rest now. Three hours.

LAWRENCE
Fine. I'll wake you.


LAWRENCE
Do we rest here?

ALI
There is no rest, now, short of water,
Aurens. On the other side of that.

LAWRENCE
And how much of that is there?

ALI
I'm not sure, but however much it must be
crossed before tomorrow's sun gets up.
This is the Sun's Anvil.


LAWRENCE
Have we done it?

SILIAM
No! But we're off the Anvil.

LAWRENCE
Thank God for that, anyway!

SILIAM
Yes. Thank Him! Aurens, I do not think
you know how you have tempted him.

LAWRENCE
I know. We've done it.

ALI
God willing.

LAWRENCE
When do we reach the wells?

ALI
God willing, midday.

LAWRENCE
Then we've done it.

SILIAM
Thank Him, Aurens. Thank Him.

DOUD
Aurens!

ALI
Gasim's!

LAWRENCE
What's happened to him?

ALI
God knows!

LAWRENCE
Why don't you stop?

ALI
For what? He will be dead by midday!

LAWRENCE
We must go back.

ALI
What for? To die with Gasim? In one hour
comes the sun. In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!

LAWRENCE
I can! Take the boy!

ALI
If you go back, you kill yourself, is
all! Gasim you have killed already.

LAWRENCE
Get out of my way!

ALI
Gasim's time is come, Aurens. It is
written.

LAWRENCE
Nothing is written!

ALI
Go back, then! What did you bring us here
for with your blasphemous conceit! Hey?
English blasphemer! Aqaba? Was it Aqaba?
You will not be at Aqaba, English! Go
back, blasphemer, but you will not be at
Aqaba!

LAWRENCE
I shall be at Aqaba; that is written...in
here.

ALI
English!!! English!!!


LAWRENCE
Nothing is written.

GASIM
Aurens?

GASIM
Aurens?

ALI
El Aurens?

LAWRENCE
Ferraj. Wash!


ALI
Ferraj. El Aurens, truly for some men
nothing is written unless they write it.

LAWRENCE
Not 'El' Aurens; just Aurens.

ALI
El Aurens is better

LAWRENCE
True.

ALI
Your father, too, just Mr Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

ALI
Is that a lord?

LAWRENCE
A kind of lord.

ALI
And when he dies, you too will be a lord.

LAWRENCE
No.

ALI
Ah, you have an elder brother.

LAWRENCE
No.

ALI
But, then? I do not understand this. Your
father's name is Chapman...

LAWRENCE
Ali, he didn't marry my mother.

ALI
I see.

LAWRENCE
I'm sorry.

ALI
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

LAWRENCE
Yes. I suppose I am.

ALI
El Aurens is best.

LAWRENCE
Alright. I'll settle for 'El Aurens'.


ALI
They are the robes of a Sherif of the
Beni Wadji.

LAWRENCE
Very fine. A great honour.

ONLOOKER
The honour is to us. Salaam, Sherif.

LAWRENCE
Is it permitted?

ALI
Surely.

LAWRENCE
Salaam.

CROWD
Salaam.

SILIAM
He for whom nothing is written may write
himself a                 , salaam.

ALI
They are good for riding. Try!


AUDAR
What are you doing, Englishman?

LAWRENCE
As you see. Are you alone?

AUDAR
Almost. Are you with that party of dogs
who are drinking at my well?

LAWRENCE
Yours?

AUDAR
I am Audar Abu Tayi.

LAWRENCE
I've heard of another man of that name.

AUDAR
Other? What other?

LAWRENCE
The Audar I'd heard of wouldn't need
someone's help to look after his wells.

AUDAR
Ah. He must be a great hero.

LAWRENCE
He is. He wouldn't refuse water to men
coming out of the great Nefud Desert.

AUDAR
Now, would he not? Hm. No, that must be
some other man. Here is my help.  Son,
what fashion is this?

SON
Harif, father.

AUDAR
What manner of Harif?

SON
A Beni Wadji Sherif.

AUDAR
And is he Harif?

SON
No, father. English!

AUDAR
Son! They are stealing our water; tell
them we're coming. Tell them!... Empty
that!

ALI
Do not!!

AUDAR
It is Audar of the Howitat who speaks.

ALI
It is Ali of the Harif who answers.

AUDAR
Harif? Ali, does your father still steal?

ALI
No. Does Audar take me for one of his own
bastards?

AUDAR
No, there is no resemblance. Alas, you
resemble your father.

ALI
Audar flatters me.

AUDAR
You're easily flattered. I knew your
father well.

ALI
Did you know your own?

LAWRENCE
Auda! We are fifty, you are two. How if
we shot you down?

AUDAR
Why, then you have a blood feud with the
Howitat. Do you desire it?

LAWRENCE
Not the generals in Cairo, nor the Sultan
himself desire that. Call off your men.

AUDAR
No, no, boy. This honours the unworthy.
I've only just begun to teach him.

LAWRENCE
And what are you teaching him today?
Howitat hospitality?

AUDAR
Be not clever with me, English! Who is
he?

LAWRENCE
A friend of Prince Feisal's.

AUDAR
Oh. So, you desire my hospitality.

LAWRENCE
Yes.

AUDAR
Is he your tongue?

ALI
We do desire it.

AUDAR
Ugh. Then, it is given, if you will take
it. I am at my summer camp; a poor place.
Well, to me it seems a poor place. Some
men find it marvellous. Tomorrow, maybe,
I will allow the Turks to buy you,
friends of Feisal. But, dine with me.
Dine with Auda, English; dine with the
Howitat, Harif. It is my pleasure that
you dine with me in Wadi Ram.

In Auda's tent

AUDAR
This thing you work against Aqaba, what
profit do you hope from it?

ALI
We work it for Feisal of Mecca. The Harif
do not work for profit.

AUDAR
Well, if a man was meant to be a servant,
Ali, he could find worse masters than
Feisal, but I...I cannot serve.

LAWRENCE
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

AUDAR
Yes, it is my pleasure.

LAWRENCE
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

AUDAR
No? For the English, then?

LAWRENCE
For the Arabs.

AUDAR
The Arabs. The Howitat, Ajili, Rala, Beni
Saha; these I know, I have even heard of
the Harif, but the Arabs! What tribe is
that?

LAWRENCE
They're a tribe of slaves; they serve the
Turks.

AUDAR
Well, they are nothing to me. My tribe is
the Howitat...

ALI
Who work only for profit.

AUDAR
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

LAWRENCE
And Auda's pleasure is to serve the
Turks.

AUDAR
Serve. I serve?

LAWRENCE
It is the servant who takes money.

AUDAR
I am Audar Abu Tayi! Does Audar serve?

CROWD
No!

AUDAR
Does Audar Abu Tayi serve?

CROWD
No!! Ha! Ha! Ha!

AUDAR
I carry twenty-three great wounds, all
got in battle. Seventy-five men have I
killed with my own hands in battle. I
scatter, I burn my enemies tents. I take
away their flocks and herds. The Turks
pay me a golden treasure. Yet, I am poor,
because I  am a river to my people! Is
that service?

LAWRENCE
No.

SILIAM
And yet now it seems Audar has grown old
and lost his taste for fighting.

AUDAR
It is well you say it in my tent, thou
old tulip!

ALI
Yet, this is a tulip that the Turks could
not buy.

AUDAR
Why should they wish to? Now! I will tell
you what they pay me, and you will tell
me if this is a servant's wages. They pay
me, month by month, one hundred golden
guineas.

LAWRENCE
One hundred and fifty, Auda.

AUDAR
Who told you that?

LAWRENCE
I have long ears.

AUDAR
And a long tongue between them.

LAWRENCE
A hundred; a hundred and fifty; what
matters? It's a trifle...a trifle which
they take from a great box they have...

ALI
In Aqaba.

AUDAR
In Aqaba!

LAWRENCE
Where else?

AUDAR
You trouble me like women.

LAWRENCE
Friends, we have been foolish. Audar will
not come to Aqaba.

AUDAR
No.

LAWRENCE
For money.

AUDAR
No.

LAWRENCE
For Feisal?

AUDAR
No.

LAWRENCE
Nor to drive away the Turks. He will come
because it is his pleasure.

AUDAR
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.


AUDAR
Make God your agent! Aqaba!

CROWD
Aqaba!

AUDAR
God be with you.


ALI
Yes, Aqaba. Tomorrow, we will go and get
it.

LAWRENCE
Do you think we shall?

ALI
Yes. If you're right about the guns.


AUDAR
He killed: he dies.

ALI
This is the end of Aqaba.

SILIAM
One of our men murdered one of Auda's
men.

LAWRENCE
Why?

SILIAM
Theft? Blood-feud? It makes no matter
why.

LAWRENCE
Ali!

ALI
It is an ancient wound.

LAWRENCE
I didn't come here to watch a tribal
bloodbath.

AUDAR
It is the law, Aurens.

LAWRENCE
The Law says the man must die.

AUDAR
Hm!

LAWRENCE
It he dies, would that content the
Howitat?

AUDAR
Yes.

LAWRENCE
Sherif Ali. If none of lord Auda's men
harms any of yours, will that content the
Harif?

ALI
Yes.

LAWRENCE
Then, I will execute the Law. I have no
tribe and no one is offended. Gasim! Did
you do it?

AUDAR
Well. Aurens. What ails the Englishman?

ALI
That man he killed was the man he brought
out of the Nefud.

AUDAR
Ah, it was written, then. Better to have
left him.

ALI
It was execution, Aurens: no shame in
that. Besides, it was necessary. You gave
life and you took it. The writing is
still yours.

On the beach at Aqaba

ALI
The miracle is accomplished. Garlands for
the conqueror. Tribute for the prince;
flowers for the man.

LAWRENCE
I'm none of those things, Ali.

ALI
What, then?

LAWRENCE
Don't know. Thanks. My God I love this
country. What!

AUDAR
No gold in Aqaba!

MAN
I've found it!

LAWRENCE
That's a pity. Ali. You get a message
down the coast to Yenbo. Tell Feisal to
find boats...any boats, and bring the
Arab army here to Aqaba quickly.

ALI
And you?

LAWRENCE
I'm going to tell the generals in Cairo.
Yes, cross Sinai. Come on!

ALI
Sinai!?

LAWRENCE
Yes!

ALI
With these?

LAWRENCE
They'll be alright with me. Look, Ali. If
any of your Bedouin arrived in Cairo and
said, 'We've taken Aqaba. the generals
would laugh.

ALI
I see. In Cairo you will put off these
funny clothes. You will wear trousers and
tell stories of our quaintness and
barbarity, and then, they will believe
you.

LAWRENCE
You're an ignorant man.

AUDAR
Paper! Paper! There is no gold in Aqaba.
No gold! No great box!

LAWRENCE
Did Audar come to Aqaba for gold?

AUDAR
For my pleasure as you said, but gold is
honourable, and Aurens promised gold.
Aurens lied.

LAWRENCE
See, Auda. The Crown of England promises
to pay five thousand golden guineas
to Audar Abu Tayi, signed in His
Majesty's absence, by...me. In ten days,
I'll be back with the gold. With gold,
with guns, ...with everything.

AUDAR
Ten days. You'll cross Sinai?

LAWRENCE
Why not? Moses did.

AUDAR
And you will take the children?

LAWRENCE
Moses did!

AUDAR
Moses was a prophet and beloved of God.
He said there was gold here: he lied. He
is not perfect.


FERRAJ
Lord, can we not rest?

LAWRENCE
I told you, 'No rest till they know I
hold Aqaba'. Have you two slept in beds?
Ferraj? Doud? With sheets. Tomorrow the
finest sheets in the finest room in the
finest hotel in Cairo, I promise.

MAJID
Then it shall be so, lord.

LAWRENCE
Look! a pillar of fire.

DOUD
No, lord. Dust.


LAWRENCE
My compass! No matter. If we ride west,
we must strike the Canal...


LAWRENCE
Come on!


DOUD
Aurens!! Aurens!!

FERRAJ
Aurens!

LAWRENCE
Ferraj! Ferraj! Don't! Don't! Don't!


FERRAJ
Aurens? Why do you walk? But why, lord?
Aurens! But why, lord? There's room for
both. It serves no purpose...
Aurens! Look!      Aurens!

LAWRENCE
It's all right, Ferraj. It's all right.

FERRAJ
Hey!

MOTORCYCLIST
Who are you? Who are you?

Cairo

FERRAJ
Doud!

SOLDIER
We're here, sir.  You taking him in
there, sir?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

SOLDIER
Here! Here! You! And where the hell do
you think you're going to, Mustafa?

LAWRENCE
Eh, we're thirsty.

SOLDIER
Mr Lawrence, is it?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

SOLDIER
Are you going to the officer's bar, sir?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

SOLDIER
You can't take him in there, sir.

OFFICER
What do you think you look like?

BAR MAN
No, no, you mustn't! Not another! Go
effendi! Go! Get out! You must get out!
Get out!

LAWRENCE
We want two large glasses of lemonade!

BAR MAN
This is a bar for British Officers.

LAWRENCE
That's alright; we're not particular

FREDDY
Lawrence! Are you off your head?

LAWRENCE
No. Oddly enough, I'm not.

OFFICER
Now, look here, Lawrence, just clear out
of here, will you?

CROWD
Go on, Lawrence, clear off! Get that boy
out of here!

OFFICER
Pogo! We'll have this one out, anyway.

CROWD
Get out! Get that wog out of here! Yes,
clear off! Go on, get the little wog out!

BRIGHTON
What's going on?

OFFICER
It's Lawrence, sir.

LAWRENCE
Lemonade with ice.

BRIGHTON
Well, explain yourself.

LAWRENCE
We've taken Aqaba.

BRIGHTON
Taken Aqaba? Who has?

LAWRENCE
We have. Our side in this war have. The
wogs have. We have. He likes your
lemonade.

BRIGHTON
You mean the Turks have gone?

LAWRENCE
No, they're still there, but they've no
boots. Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners; the entire garrison. No,
that's not true. We killed some; too many
really. I'll manage it better next time.
There's been a lot of killing, one way or
another. Cross my heart and hope to die,
it's all perfectly true.

BRIGHTON
It isn't possible.

LAWRENCE
Yes, it is. I did it.

BRIGHTON
You'd better talk to Allenby.

LAWRENCE
General Allenby?

BRIGHTON
Yes, He's in command now Murray's gone.

LAWRENCE
Well, that's a step in the right
direction. First I want a room, with a
bed, with sheets.

BRIGHTON
Yes, yes, of course.

LAWRENCE
It's for him.

BRIGHTON
Right! You want a bed yourself, don't
you?

LAWRENCE
See Allenby first, though. Will he see
me?

BRIGHTON
I think so.

LAWRENCE
Do that then. I'd better shave

BRIGHTON
Yes, you had. You'd better get into some
trousers too.


ALLENBY
Undisciplined...unpunctual...untidy...sev
eral languages...knowledge of
music...literature...knowledge
of...knowledge of...you're an interesting
man, there's no doubt about it. Who told
you to take Aqaba?

LAWRENCE
Nobody.

ALLENBY
Sir.

LAWRENCE
Sir.

ALLENBY
Then, why did you?

LAWRENCE
Aqaba's important.

ALLENBY
Why is it important?

LAWRENCE
It's the Turkish route to the Canal.

ALLENBY
Not any more. They're coming through
Bethsheda.

LAWRENCE
I know, but we've gone forward to Gaza.

ALLENBY
So?

LAWRENCE
So that left Aqaba behind your right.

ALLENBY
True.

LAWRENCE
And it will be further behind your right
when you go for Jerusalem.

ALLENBY
Am I going for Jerusalem?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

ALLENBY
Very well. Aqaba behind my right.

LAWRENCE
It threatened El Herish and Gaza.

ALLENBY
Anything else?

LAWRENCE
Yes. Aqaba's linked with Medina.

ALLENBY
Do you think we should shift them out of
Medina now?

LAWRENCE
No. I think you should leave them there.

ALLENBY
You acted without orders, you know?

LAWRENCE
Shouldn't officers use their initiative
at all times?

ALLENBY
Not really. It's awfully dangerous,
Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
Yes. I know.

ALLENBY
Already?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

ALLENBY
I'm promoting you major.

LAWRENCE
I don't think that's a very good idea.

ALLENBY
I didn't ask you; I want you to go
back...and carry on the good work.

LAWRENCE
No, thank you, sir.

ALLENBY
Why not?

LAWRENCE
Well, I...eh, let me see...I killed two
people. I mean two Arabs; one was a boy.
that was... yesterday! I led him into
quicksand. The other was a man; that was
before Aqaba, anyway. I had to execute
him with my pistol. There was something
about it I didn't like.

ALLENBY
Well, naturally...

LAWRENCE
No, something else...

ALLENBY
I see, well, that's all right. We'll give
you a warning.

LAWRENCE
No. Something else.

ALLENBY
What then?

LAWRENCE
I enjoyed it.

ALLENBY
Rubbish! Rubbish! You know that you're
tired. What do you mean by coming here
dressed like that? Amateur theatricals?

LAWRENCE
Oh, yes. Entirely.

ALLENBY
Let me see that hat-thing, or whatever it
is. Fascinating gear they wear. How do
you think I would look in this hat,
Harry?

BRIGHTON
Damn ridiculous, sir.

ALLENBY
Here, you keep it.

LAWRENCE
What I'm trying to say is I don't think
I'm fit for it.

ALLENBY
Really!? What do you think, Dryden?

DRYDEN
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said it
couldn't be done.

ALLENBY
Brighton?

LAWRENCE
I know what he thinks.

BRIGHTON
I think you should recommend a
decoration, sir. I don't think it matters
what his motives were; 'twas a brilliant
bit of soldiering.

ALLENBY
Mr Perkins!

PERKINS
Sah!

ALLENBY
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

PERKINS
Sah!

ALLENBY
You've heard about this, Mr Perkins.

PERKINS
Yes, sir.

ALLENBY
What do you think about it?

PERKINS
Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done, sir.

ALLENBY
Thank you, Mr Perkins.

PERKINS
Sah!

ALLENBY
Come on, then.

LAWRENCE
You're a clever man, sir.

ALLENBY
No, but I know a good thing when I see
one. That's fair, surely.  Look here,
lad. If I'm going to break through to
Jerusalem, I must concentrate not
discipline...

LAWRENCE
Guns.

ALLENBY
Do you know of better?...

ALLENBY
I fight like Clausewitz, you fight like Saxe.

LAWRENCE
We shall do very well, indeed, sir.


ALLENBY
Easy, gentlemen, please. Will you give us
something to drink? Waiter    Of course,
sir.

ALLENBY
I'm here at the invitation of Major
Lawrence. Tracy. Shall we go outside?
So, you'll hold down the Turkish desert
army.

LAWRENCE
Yes.

ALLENBY
With a thousand Arabs?

LAWRENCE
A thousand Arabs means a thousand knives,
delivered anywhere, day or night...means
a thousand camels; that means a thousand
packs of high explosive and a thousand
crack rifles. We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round. I'll
smash his railways, and while he's
mending them I'll smash them somewhere
else. In thirteen weeks I can have Arabia
in chaos.

ALLENBY
You are going back then?

LAWRENCE
Yes, of course I'm going back.

ALLENBY
Well, if we can see it, so can the Turk.
If he finds he's using four divisions to
fend off a handful of bandits, he'll
withdraw.

LAWRENCE
He daren't withdraw. Arabia's part of his
empire: if he gets out now, he knows
he'll never get back again.

BRIGHTON
I wonder who will.

LAWRENCE
No one will. Arabia's for the Arabs now.
That's what I've told them, anyway.
That's what they think: that's why
they're fighting.

ALLENBY
Oh, surely.

LAWRENCE
They've only one suspicion, if we'll let
them drive the Turks out and then move in
ourselves. I've told them that that's
false: that we've no ambitions in Arabia,
have we?

ALLENBY
I'm not a politician, thank God. have we
any ambition in Arabia, Dryden?

DRYDEN
Difficult question, sir.

LAWRENCE
I want to know, sir, if I can tell them
in your name that we have no ambitions in
Arabia.

ALLENBY
Certainly.

LAWRENCE
Two thousand small arms is not enough: I
need five.

ALLENBY
Right.

LAWRENCE
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns: they
don't like paper.

ALLENBY
Right.

LAWRENCE
Instructors for the Lewis guns.

ALLENBY
Right.

LAWRENCE
More money.

ALLENBY
How much more?

LAWRENCE
Twenty-five thousand now: a lot more
later.

ALLENBY
Dryden?

DRYDEN
It can be done, sir.

LAWRENCE
A couple of armoured cars.

ALLENBY
Right.

LAWRENCE
Field artillery.

ALLENBY
Right. I'm going to give you every
blessed thing I can, Major Lawrence,
because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations and thank you. Thank you
for your hospitality, gentlemen.

CROWD
Congratulations.

DRYDEN
Are you really going to give them
artillery, sir?

BRIGHTON
I was wondering that, sir. It might be
deuced difficult to get it back again.

DRYDEN
Give them artillery and you've made them
independent.

ALLENBY
Then, I can't give them artillery, can I?

DRYDEN
For you to say, sir.

ALLENBY
No, it's not. I've got orders to obey,
thank God. Not like that poor devil. He's
riding the whirlwind.

DRYDEN
Let's hope we're not.


BENTLEY
Excuse me, friend. Who do these bags
belong to?

SILIAM
To Prince Feisal.

BENTLEY
You're not Prince Feisal, by any chance.

SILIAM
No.

BENTLEY
You know him, though.

SILIAM
He is my master. I am his servant.

BENTLEY
Em. Can you read?  The Chicago Courier is
my own particular paper, but my work is
syndicated throughout America.

FEISAL
I understood so from your letter, Mr
Bentley.   Now?

BENTLEY
Where can I find Major Lawrence?

FEISAL
Is that what you've come for?

BENTLEY
Not all together, sir, no.

FEISAL
Well, Mr Bentley, you will find Major
Lawrence with my army.

BENTLEY
Well, that's what I meant, sir. Where can
I find your army?

FEISAL
I don't know. Last week they were near El
Hira.

BENTLEY
Gira!

FEISAL
Oh, yes. I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

BENTLEY
I've never tried.

FEISAL
Take a mule. Avoid Malal. The Turks are
there.

BENTLEY
In Malal, now? They move fast.

FEISAL
They do, but not so fast as we do, you
will find.

FEISAL
Myself? I am going to Cairo, as you know.

BENTLEY
Yes.

FEISAL
There is work for me there of a different
kind.

BENTLEY
Yes. I understand you've been given no
artillery.

FEISAL
That is so.

BENTLEY
You're handicapped.

FEISAL
It restricts us to small things.

BENTLEY
It's intended to.

FEISAL
Do you know General Allenby?

BENTLEY
Watch out for Allenby. He's a 'slim
customer'.

FEISAL
Excuse me?

BENTLEY
A clever man.

FEISAL
'Slim customer'. Very good. I will
certainly watch out for him. You're being
very sympathetic, Mr Bentley.

BENTLEY
Your Highness, we Americans were once a
colonial people and we naturally feel
sympathetic to any people, anywhere, who
are struggling for their freedom.

FEISAL
Very gratifying.

BENTLEY
Also, my interests are the same as yours.
You want your story told: I badly want a
story to tell.

FEISAL
Ah, now you are 'talking turkey', are you
not?

BENTLEY
Ha! Ha!

FEISAL
Well, Mr Bentley, I will give you a guide
and a letter, and before I leave
here...Ah, which must be presently, I
will have some facts and figures put on
paper for you. You know, of course, that
we are destroying the Turkish railways?

BENTLEY
I do, sir. Major Lawrence is in charge of
all this, is he?

FEISAL
My army is made up of tribes. The tribes
are led by the tribal leaders.

FEISAL
Well, your people do think very highly of
Major Lawrence, though.

FEISAL
Oh, yes. And rightly. In this country, Mr
Bentley, the man who gives victory in
battle is prized beyond every other man.
One figure I can give you from my head
because it never leaves my head. Since
starting this campaign four months ago,
we have lost thirty-seven wounded, one
hundred and fifty-six dead. You remark
that this proportion between our dead and
wounded.

BENTLEY
Yeah. Four times as many.

FEISAL
That's because those too badly wounded to
bring away we ourselves kill. We leave no
wounded for the Turks.

BENTLEY
You mean...

FEISAL
I mean we leave no wounded for the Turks.
In their eyes we are not soldiers, but
rebels, and rebels wounded or whole are
not protected by the Geneva Code and are
treated harshly.

BENTLEY
How harshly?

FEISAL
More harshly than I hope you can imagine.

BENTLEY
I see.

FEISAL
Our own prisoners, Mr Bentley, are taken
care of until the British can relieve us
of them according to the Code. I should
like you to notice that.

BENTLEY
Yes, sir. Is that the influence of Major
Lawrence?

FEISAL
Why should you suppose so?

BENTLEY
Well, it's just I heard in Cairo that
Major Lawrence has a horror of bloodshed.

FEISAL
That is exactly so. with Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion: with me it is merely
good manners. You may judge which motive
is the more reliable. And now, perhaps...

BENTLEY
Oh, sure. Sure. Thank you, sir. Do you
think you'd be able to manage the letter?

FEISAL
I'll do everything I have said, Mr
Bentley, if you will tell me truly the
nature of your interest in my people and
Major Lawrence.

BENTLEY
It's very simple, sir. I'm looking for a
hero.

FEISAL
Indeed? You do not seem a romantic man.

BENTLEY
Oh, no. But certain influential men back
home believe that the time has come for
America to lend her weight to the
patriotic struggle against Germany...and
Turkey. Now, I've been sent to find
material which will show our people that
his war is...

FEISAL
Enjoyable?

BENTLEY
Hardly that, sir. But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.

FEISAL
You are looking for a figure who will
draw your country towards war.

BENTLEY
Alright. Yes.

FEISAL
Aurens is your man.


LAWRENCE
Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Come on, men!

AUDAR
Aurens!

LAWRENCE
Oh, good God!

BENTLEY
Jimeny! Never seen a man killed with a
sword before.

LAWRENCE
Why don't you take a picture?

BENTLEY
Wish I had.

AUDAR
How is it with thee, Aurens? No! Am I in
this?

LAWRENCE
Did you take his picture?

BENTLEY
Yeah.

AUDAR
You are using up your nine lives very
quickly.

BENTLEY
Charming company you keep.

LAWRENCE
Auda? he's a bit old fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue. He
thinks you're a kind of thief.

BENTLEY
Is it alright if I take your picture?

LAWRENCE
All right.

BENTLEY
OK. Just walk.

CROWD
Aurens! Aurens!

BENTLEY
Major Lawrence? Yes, sir, that's my baby.


BRIGHTON
This looting has got to stop.

ALI
It is customary.

BRIGHTON
It's theft, and theft makes thieves.

ALI
I would not say that to Auda. It is their
payment, Colonel.

BRIGHTON
Payment!

ALI
Truly, are not British soldiers paid?

BRIGHTON
They don't go home when they're paid.

ALI
They are not free to.

BRIGHTON
Well, there's another lot you've seen the
last of.

LAWRENCE
They'll come back.

BRIGHTON
He says they'll come back. Will they?

ALI
Not this year, Aurens.

BRIGHTON
Look, Lawrence. How many men do you think
you'll have left? Two hundred?

LAWRENCE
Less.

BRIGHTON
Well, then.

LAWRENCE
I said they'll come back.

BRIGHTON
You badly hurt?

LAWRENCE
Not hurt at all. Didn't you know? They
can only kill me with a golden bullet.


ALI
It is for children. I have set myself to
learn again.

BENTLEY
What are you learning from this?

ALI
Politics.

BENTLEY
You gonna be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?

ALI
I will tell you that when I have a
country.

BENTLEY
Ha! Ha!...

ALI
Did I answer well?

BENTLEY
You answered without saying anything.
That's politics. You learn quickly.

ALI
I have a good teacher.

BENTLEY
Yeah. Yeah.
How's your hurt?

LAWRENCE
Fine.

BENTLEY
Before I return to the flesh-pots, which
I shall be very glad to do, may I put two
questions to you? Straight?

LAWRENCE
I'd be interested to hear you put a
question straight, Mr Bentley.

BENTLEY
One: What, in your opinion, do these
people hope to gain from this war?

LAWRENCE
They hope to gain their freedom. Freedom.

BENTLEY
They hope to gain their freedom. There's
one born every minute.

LAWRENCE
They're going to get it, Mr Bentley. I'm
going to give it to them. The second
question?

BENTLEY
Oh. Well, I was going to ask...eh; what
is it, Major Lawrence, that attracts you
personally to the desert?

LAWRENCE
It's clean.

BENTLEY
Well, now. That's a very illuminating
answer. May I take one farewell picture?

AUDAR
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it. One
clock for two lamps.

BRIGHTON
A fair bargain.

AUDAR
I robbed him. I must find something
honourable.

BRIGHTON
Honourable?

AUDAR
Yes, the year is running out, Brighton. I
must find something honourable.


AUDAR
Now, you may blow up my train.

BRIGHTON
And what will you do now?

AUDAR
Oh, now I go home. They will carry my
toys. They will carry my toys, too, do
you see?

BRIGHTON
Major Lawrence will campaign this winter,
but you've got what you wanted so you're
going home. Is that it?

AUDAR
Of course! When Aurens has got what he
wants, he will go home. When you have got
what you want, you will go home.

BRIGHTON
Oh, no, I shan't, Auda.

AUDAR
Then you are a fool.

BRIGHTON
Maybe. I am not a deserter.

AUDAR
Give thanks to God, Brighton, that when
he made you a fool, he gave you a fool's
face.

BRIGHTON
You are an impudent rascal!

AUDAR
I must go, Aurens, before I soil myself
with a fool's blood.

BRIGHTON
It's like talking to a brick wall. So,
what'll you do now? What can you do?

LAWRENCE
I'll go north. That's what Allenby wants,
isn't it?

BRIGHTON
Allenby wanted the Arab army behind
Dar'a.

LAWRENCE
Then that's where I'll take it.

LAWRENCE
Tell Allenby to hurry up; that we'll be
in Dar'a before he's in Jerusalem, won't
we?


LAWRENCE
Train! Ferraj.

FERRAJ
Ya! Aurens.
Bedouin   Aii!

LAWRENCE
Hide yourself, my friend.     Detonator.
Alright, fetch another.

FERRAJ
Pardon, Aurens, I put it in...

LAWRENCE
There's plenty of time; fetch another!
Ferraj? Ferraj!

ALI
What happened?

LAWRENCE
Detonator. A detonator.

BEDOUIN
He cannot ride, Aurens. Look.

ALI
If they take him alive, you know what
they will do to him.

FERRAJ
Daud will be angry with you.

LAWRENCE
Salute him for me.


ALI
What will you do now?

LAWRENCE
Go north.

ALI
With twenty?

LAWRENCE
What would you recommend me to do, Ali?
What would you recommend?


BRIGHTON
Well, he hasn't one-tenth so many men,
sir.

ALLENBY
He's lied, in fact.

BRIGHTON
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have done
anything he hasn't done.

ALLENBY
Then there is an Arab north army?

BRIGHTON
No, sir, he has lied about that.

ALLENBY
Any idea why?

BRIGHTON
It's his army, I suppose.

ALLENBY
It's Prince Feisal's army. Do you think
he's gone native, Harry?

BRIGHTON
No. He would if he could, I think. Not my
line of country this, sir.

ALLENBY
Oh, it doesn't matter; I'm just curious.
What matters is I believed it. The Turks
believe it. They're offering twenty
thousand pounds for him.

BRIGHTON
Good Heavens!

ALLENBY
No. Shouldn't say he'd long to live,
would you?

BRIGHTON
Well, whatever else, sir, he's a brave
man.

ALLENBY
Oh, surely, surely. If he's still going
north with fifty men, he doesn't lack
'guts'. I wonder if they'd offer that
much for me. What about next year? Will
they still come back?

BRIGHTON
I wouldn't be surprised. They think he's
a kind of prophet.

ALLENBY
They do or he does?


ALI
Now, may I speak?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

ALI
Aurens. One more failure, and you will
find yourself alone. I do not include
myself.

LAWRENCE
I do not include the others.

ALI
So, say they love you: the more reason to
be thrifty with them. give them something
to do that can be done. But you? No, no,
they must move mountains for you: they
must walk on water.

LAWRENCE
That's right. That's right! Who are you
to know what can be done. If we'd done
what you thought could be done, we'd be
back in Yenbo now, and nowhere. Whatever
I ask them to do, can be done, that's
all. They know that if you don't. Do you
think I'm just anybody, Ali? Do you?
My friends. Who will walk on water with
me? Who will come with me into Dar'a?

BEDOUIN
Dar'a is garrisoned. Will you take twenty
against two thousand?

LAWRENCE
I'll go by myself if I have to.

BEDOUIN
Why?

LAWRENCE
Because I told the English generals the
Arab revolt will be in Dar'a when they
would be in Jerusalem.

BEDOUIN
Or perhaps you are here for the English
generals.

LAWRENCE
Who says this?

ALI
Rumour.

BEDOUIN
That is not an argument.

LAWRENCE
No argument. This afternoon, I will take
the Arab revolt into Dar'a while the
Arabs argue.

BEDOUIN
Aurens! Can you pass for an Arab in an
Arab town?

LAWRENCE
Yes, if one of you would lend me some
dirty clothes.

Dar'a

ALI
This is madness! What are you looking
for?

LAWRENCE
Some way to announce myself.

ALI
Be patient with him, God.

ALI
Do you not see how they look at you?
Come!

LAWRENCE
Please, Ali. I am invisible.

TURK
Halt!

LAWRENCE
Walk on.

TURK
Halt!

LAWRENCE
Walk on.

TURK
You! And You!

BEY
You.      You have blue eyes? I say you
have blue eyes.

LAWRENCE
Yes, efendi.

BEY
Are you Sicasian?

LAWRENCE
Yes, efendi.

BEY
How old are you?

LAWRENCE
Twenty-seven, efendi. I think.

BEY
You look older. You have had a lot of
experience. It's an interesting face. I'm
surrounded by cattle. He wouldn't know an
interesting face from a sow's belly. I
have been in Dar'a now for three and a
half years. If they'd posted me to the
dark side of the moon, I could not be
more isolated. You haven't the least idea
of what I'm talking about, have you?

LAWRENCE
No, efendi.

BEY
Have you? No. That would be too lucky.
Where did you get that?

LAWRENCE
Oh, eh, it's old, efendi.

BEY
No, no. This is recent. You are a
deserter.

LAWRENCE
No, efendi.

BEY
Yes, you're a deserter, but from which
army? Not that it matters at all. A man
cannot be always in uniform. Your skin is
very fair.      Beat him.


ALI
Sleep. Sleep!       Eat. Eat! You have a
body like other men. Good. Then sleep.


ALI
Better?

LAWRENCE
Much better. You were right.

ALI
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

LAWRENCE
Oh, I've learned alright. I'm going, Ali.

ALI
Why?

LAWRENCE
Why? Heavens!

ALI
Why?

LAWRENCE
I've come to the end of myself, I
suppose.

ALI
And the end of the Arab revolt?

LAWRENCE
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali. I'm not
even Arab.

ALI
A man can be whatever he wants, you said.

LAWRENCE
I'm sorry. I thought it was, too.

ALI
You proved it.

LAWRENCE
Look, Ali. Look! That's me. What colour
is it? That's me! And there's nothing I
can do about it.

ALI
A man can do whatever he wants, you said.

LAWRENCE
He can, but he can't want what he wants.
This is the stuff that decides what he
wants. You may as well know, I would have
told them anything; I would have told
them who I am; I would have told them
where you were; I tried to.

ALI
So would any man.

LAWRENCE
Well, any man is what I am and I'm going
back to Allenby to ask him for a job that
any man can do.

ALI
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

LAWRENCE
I'll make easy stages.

ALI
You!

LAWRENCE
Oh, yes. Easy stages. Look, Ali, I think
I see a way of being just ordinarily
happy. Can I take this?

ALI
It is not clean.

LAWRENCE
No, but it's warm.

ALI
And these? Having led them here! Have you
no care for them?

ALI
You'll lead them. They're yours. Trust
your own people and let me go back to
mine.


SOLDIER
I say, don't forget those form fives.

SOLDIER
All right!

LAWRENCE
Hey? Mind if I join you?

OFFICER
Oh. Honoured, sir.

LAWRENCE
Good to be back.

OFFICER
We heard you were, sir. What's doing out
there?

LAWRENCE
Where? Oh, Arabia.

OFFICER
Eh, yes, sir.

LAWRENCE
Nothing much. Wrong time of year. What's
doing here?

OFFICER
We're settling in alright, sir.     We've
built a squash court.

LAWRENCE
Jolly good. Well, I have to go up there.
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

OFFICER
Bloody wogs!

LAWRENCE
Yes, probably. Jolly good about the
squash court.

OFFICER
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

LAWRENCE
Morning.

MP
Oh, morning, sir.

LAWRENCE
Good to be back.

MP
I'll believe you, sir.

LAWRENCE
No, really, it is.       Hello.

BRIGHTON
Morning. You're to go right in.

FEISAL
Aurens, or is it Major Lawrence?

LAWRENCE
Sir.

FEISAL
Ah. Ai. Well, General, I will leave you.
Major Lawrence, doubtless, has reports to
make about my people and their weakness,
and the need to keep them weak in the
British interest...and the French
interest too, of course. We must not
forget the French now...

ALLENBY
I've told you, sir, no such treaty
exists.

FEISAL
Yes, General, you have lied most bravely,
but not convincingly. I know this treaty
does exist.

LAWRENCE
Treaty, sir?

FEISAL
He does it better than you, General, but
then, of course, he is almost an Arab.

DRYDEN
You really don't know?

ALLENBY
Then what the devil's this?

LAWRENCE
It's my request for release from Arabia,
sir.

ALLENBY
For what reason? Are you sure you haven't
heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

LAWRENCE
No. I can guess

ALLENBY
Don't guess! Tell him!

DRYDEN
Well, now. Mr Sykes is and English civil
servant. Monsieur Picot is a French civil
servant. Mr Sykes and Monsieur Picot met
and they agreed that after the war,
France and England would share the
Turkish Empire, including Arabia. They
signed an agreement, not a treaty, sir.
An agreement to that effect.

LAWRENCE
There may be honour among thieves, but
there's none in politicians.

DRYDEN
And let's no have displays of
indignation. You may not have known, but
you certainly had suspicions. If we've
told lies, you've told half-lies and a
man who tells lies, like me, merely hides
the truth, but a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

LAWRENCE
The truth is I'm an ordinary man. You
might have told me that, Dryden, and I
want an ordinary job, sir. That's my
reason for resigning. It's personal.

ALLENBY
Personal?

LAWRENCE
Yes, sir.

ALLENBY
Personal? You're a serving officer in the
field, and as it happens, a damned
important one. Personal? Are you mad?

LAWRENCE
No, and if you don't mind, I'd rather not
go mad. That's my reason, too.

ALLENBY
Look, Lawrence. I'm making my big push on
Damascus the sixteenth of next month and
you are part of it. Can you understand
that? You're an important part of the big
push.

LAWRENCE
I don't want to be part of your big push!

ALLENBY
What about your Arab friends? What about
them?

LAWRENCE
I have no Arab friends! I don't want Arab
friends!

ALLENBY
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

LAWRENCE
I've told you. I just want my ration of
common humanity.

DRYDEN
Lawrence?

LAWRENCE
Yes?

DRYDEN
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

ALLENBY
Oh, that's quite all right, thank you, Mr
Dryden.

DRYDEN
Thank you, sir.

ALLENBY
Look. Why don't we...there's blood on
your back. Do you want a doctor?

LAWRENCE
No.

ALLENBY
Tell me what happened.


BENTLEY
So, what goes on in there?

DRYDEN
Nothing.

BENTLEY
Oh, come on!

DRYDEN
No, really. Nothing at all.

BENTLEY
Is the man in trouble?

DRYDEN
I expect so. We all have troubles. Life's
a vale of troubles.

BENTLEY
Just let me know if the man's in trouble;
I've got an interest in that man; I've
got a claim!

DRYDEN
What claim?

BENTLEY
You've read my stuff. I've made that boy
a hero. When the war's over, that boy can
be anything he wants.

DRYDEN
Yes. Well, at the moment he wants to be
somebody else. Will you kindly allow me
to pass?

BENTLEY
Walk away, Dryden. Walk away. Always
walking away, aren't you?

DRYDEN
Well, I'll tell you. It's a little clash
of temperament that's going on in there,
inevitably. One of them's half-mad, and
the other, wholly unscrupulous.


ALLENBY
I believe your name will be a household
word when you'll have to go to the War
Museum to find who Allenby was. You're
the most extraordinary man I've ever met.

LAWRENCE
Leave me alone!

ALLENBY
What?

LAWRENCE
Leave me alone!

ALLENBY
Well, that's a feeble thing to say.

LAWRENCE
I know I'm not ordinary.

ALLENBY
That's not what I'm saying.

LAWRENCE
All right! I'm extraordinary. What of it?

ALLENBY
Not many people have a destiny, Lawrence.
It's a terrible thing for a man to funk
it if he has.

LAWRENCE
Are you speaking from experience?

ALLENBY
No.

LAWRENCE
You're guessing, then. Suppose you're
wrong.

ALLENBY
Why suppose that? We both know I'm right.

LAWRENCE
Yes...

ALLENBY
...After all...

LAWRENCE
I said, 'Yes'. The sixteenth?

ALLENBY
Can you do it? I'll give you a lot of
money.

LAWRENCE
Artillery?

ALLENBY
I can't.

LAWRENCE
They won't be coming for money; not the
best of them. They's be coming for
Damascus, which I'm going to give them.

ALLENBY
That's all I want.

LAWRENCE
All you want is someone holding down the
Turkish right, but I'm going to give them
Damascus. We'll get there before you do,
and when we've got it, we'll keep it. You
can tell the politicians to burn their
bit of paper, now.

ALLENBY
Fair enough.

LAWRENCE
Fair. What's 'fair' got to do with it?
It's going to happen. I shall want quite
a lot of money.

ALLENBY
All there is.

LAWRENCE
Not that much. The best of them won't
come for money; they'll come for me.


AUDA
No pictures! You take no pictures!

BENTLEY
It's not for you, sheika, it's for Major
Lawrence. He doesn't mind having his
picture taken. He doesn't mind at all.

AUDA
Well, there's only one Aurens.

BENTLEY
Have you met Major Lawrence since he's
come back, sherif?

ALI
Yes.

BENTLEY
Changed, hasn't he?

ALI
No!

BENTLEY
Oh, I'd say he had. Different man, I'd
say. What did that Turkish general do to
him  in Dar'a?

ALI
He was the same man after Dar'a. The same
man. Humbled. What did the English
general do to him in Jerusalem?

BENTLEY
Search me? Ask Aurens.

ALI
I did.

BENTLEY
What did he say?

ALI
He laughed. He told me to gather the
Harif here. He offered me money.

BENTLEY
Did you take it?

ALI
No. But many did.     What is this?

LAWRENCE
This is my bodyguard.

ALI
There's not a man there without a price
on his head.

LAWRENCE
There's a price on my head, too.

ALI
But these are murderers. You know the
sheiks will hang these men.

LAWRENCE
These men are mine.

ALI
Aurens. These things know nothing of the
Arab revolt. You! You son of a leper.

GUARD
Sherif?

ALI
Where do we ride?

GUARD
Damascus, sherif.

ALI
Aye, but for what?

GUARD
Sherif? For Aurens.

ALI
You have bought these things!

LAWRENCE
I bought half the men here, Ali.

ALI
That is different. These are not ordinary
men!

LAWRENCE
I don't want ordinary men!     Damascus!!

AUDAR
Aurens!


ALLENBY
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's gone
through Masseriel and Dar'a. Very good,
by the way. very good indeed. Now your
turn.

CHARLEY
Well, sir, if the enemy's retreating in
any kind of order, which we'd better
assume,...

ALLENBY
Certainly.

CHARLEY
...he can't be further than this Malad
place. In which case I can have him
within range by, eh,  o-nine hundred
hours tomorrow.

ALLENBY
Splendid! Philip.

PHILIP
Well, these are the last infantry
supports going up now, sir, but Malad
could have the Fusiliers there by
Wednesday, sir.

ALLENBY
That'll do for now. The guns are what
matter. Any questions?

OFFICER
This Arab army on the right, sir. What
does it consist of?

BRIGHTON
Irregular cavalry, sir. About two
thousand.

OFFICER
Where are they now?

BENTLEY
(We) Can only know that by being with
them, sir.

ALLENBY
Then get with them, Harry. I want to
know.

BRIGHTON
Yes, sir.

ALLENBY
Pound them, Charley! Pound them!


ALI
God help the men who lie under that!

LAWRENCE
They're Turks.

ALI
God help them!


BRIGHTON
Well, he's got the bit between his teeth
alright.

ALLENBY
Cocky?

BRIGHTON
More than cocky, sir. He's got the bit
between his teeth. All right. I tell you,
sir, I think he'll get to Damascus before
we do unless...

ALLENBY
Unless?

BENTLEY
Well, there's a Turkish column in front
of him. Out of Masriel.

ALLENBY
What do the Turks have in Masriel? I
wonder where they are now.



GUARD
No prisoners.

ALI
Damascus, Aurens.     Aurens. Not this.
Go round. Damascus, Aurens! Damascus!

GUARD
No prisoners.

ALI
Aurens?

AUDAR
This was Talal's village.

LAWRENCE
No prisoners! No prisoners!

ALI
God. God! God!!     Aurens! Enough!
Enough! Make them stop!     Aurens!

BENTLEY
Major! Major Lawrence! Jesus wept! Jesus
wept!

ALI
Does it surprise you, Mr Bentley? Surely,
you know the Arabs are a barbarous
people. Barbarous and cruel. Who but
they! Who but they!

BENTLEY
Oh, you rotten man. Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture for the rotten
bloody newspapers.


BEDOUIN
These were cut last night, Aurens, in
Damascus. Damascus!

LAWRENCE
Take them to Sherif Ali. Tell him. Remind
him. Is Allenby in Damascus?

BEDOUIN
Near.

LAWRENCE
Tell Sherif Ali that.

BEDOUIN
They are not ripe, ha, ha.


SOLDIER
General salute! Present arms! Hold Arms!

BRIGHTON
Lawrence is behind it, sir. Lawrence. The
whole town has passed onto the Arab flag.

ALLENBY
When?

BRIGHTON
A day and a night, sir. They've been here
a day and a night. They've occupied the
town, sir. They've done it. He's set up
his own headquarters in the town hall.

ALLENBY
What else besides the town hall?

BRIGHTON
The telephone exchange, post office,
power house, hospital, fire station,
everything, sir. They call themselves the
Arab National Council and they're in the
town hall.

ALLENBY
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry. What do
you think we should do about it?

BRIGHTON
Well, get them out of it, sir, quick
time.

ALLENBY
How about that, Dryden?

DRYDEN
Not unless you want a full-scale rising
on your hands, sir.

BRIGHTON
Well, what, then?

DRYDEN
When will Prince Feisal be in Damascus?

ALLENBY
By special train in two days' time.

DRYDEN
Two days.

ALLENBY
Two days is what you asked me for. I
can't keep him out any longer. Isn't it
enough?

DRYDEN
Yes, ample. I should think.

BRIGHTON
Look, sir, we can't just do nothing.

ALLENBY
Why not? It's usually best.

ALLENBY
Get us something to drink, Tracy.
Tracy     Yes, sir.

ALLENBY
And Tracy, all troops to remain quartered
until further notice.

TRACY
Yes, sir. Does that apply to technical
units, sir?

ALLENBY
Technical Units particularly.

TRACY
Yes, sir.

BRIGHTON
Medicals, too, sir?

ALLENBY
I'm afraid so, Harry. Medicals too.


LAWRENCE
We, here, are neither Harif, nor Howetat,
nor any other tribe, but Arabs at the
Arab Council, acting for Prince Feisal.

AUDA
He insulted me.

LAWRENCE
Sherif Ali said that the telephones were
in the care of the Howetat, and that the
telephones had ceased to work, and this
is true, Auda.

AUDA
They will not work because they are given
no electricity. The electricity is in the
care of the Harif.

LAWRENCE
If you answer there'll be bloodshed.

ALI
You speak to me of bloodshed? I ask
pardon of Auda Bute.

AUDA
Humbly? Humbly! Harif!

ALI
Yes! Humbly!

AUDA
This is a new trick.

LAWRENCE
Why is there no electricity?

ALI
I have been to that electrical house,
Aurens. There are three large machines.

VOICE FROM THE BALCONY
He means 'generators'!

ALI
So, one of them is burned. They are of an
incredible size, but helpless.

AUDA
It is so of all machines. Let them burn!
What need of telephones?

LAWRENCE
The need is absolute.

ALI
Then, we need the English engineers.

LAWRENCE
No! Take English engineers and you take
English government. Take...

SOLIDER
Fire has broken out.

ALI
Where?

SOLIDER
In the Gensebe district.

ALI
It is not a district that matters.

LAWRENCE
It will spread.

ALI
Then, in God's name, use the fire
brigade!

SOLIDER
We have tried, Aurens, but there is force
in the water.

LAWRENCE
Then, you must carry it.

ALI
The Urala do not carry water.

AUDA
What else are they good for?

LAWRENCE
We will hear petitions this afternoon.
This afternoon!


ALLENBY
I'm going to take this up after the war.

BRIGHTON
Surely, we should do something, sir.

ALLENBY
It's an old man's sport.

DRYDEN
Are you an old man, sir?

ALLENBY
Hmm.

BRIGHTON
Well, all I can say is, sir, it's a heavy
responsibility. Sorry, sir.

ALLENBY
Maybe, it's the bulb.

DRYDEN
No, sir. It's the power. They're leaving,
sir.

ALLENBY
That's it, then. Marvellous-looking
beggars, aren't they?


AUDA
Leave this, Aurens. Come with me!

LAWRENCE
Come where?

AUDA
Back! I know your heart. What is it? Is
it this? I tell you; this is nothing. Is
it the blood? The desert has dried up
more blood than you could think of.

LAWRENCE
I pray that I may never see the desert
again. Hear me, God!

AUDA
You will come. There is only the desert
for you.

LAWRENCE
What about you, Ali?

ALI
No. I shall stay here and learn politics.

LAWRENCE
That's a very low occupation.

ALI
I had no thought of it when I met you.
You tried very hard to give us Damascus.

LAWRENCE
It's what I came for. And that would be
something.

ALI
Yes. Much.

AUDAR
He is your friend?

ALI
Take your hand away!

AUDA
You love him.

ALI
No, I fear him.

AUDAR
Then, why do you weep?

ALI
I fear him who love him? Or must he fear
himself or hate himself. Take your hand
away!  Howitat!

AUDA
Oh, so you are not yet entirely
politician.

ALI
Not yet.

AUDA
Well, these are new tricks and I am an
old dog. And Allah be thanked. I'll tell
thee what, though; being an Arab will be
thornier than you suppose, Harif!


DOCTOR
In all my years as a medical officer I've
never seen anything like it.

ALLENBY
It comes within the jurisdiction of the
Arab Council.

DOCTOR
I'm sorry, sir, under the circumstances I
think I must take over immediately.

ALLENBY
Under any circumstance at all, you must
obey your orders.

DOCTOR
No, sir, I will not.

ALLENBY
Control yourself. Now, go over to the
Town Hall and see what they say.


LAWRENCE
We did what we could in the civic
hospitals.

DOCTOR
But you forgot the Turkish military
hospital.

LAWRENCE
Yes.

DOCTOR
It has six hundred beds. There are about
two thousand Turkish wounded in it. all
of whom are the responsibility of your
precious Arab Council.

LAWRENCE
What's it like?


OFFICER
This is outrageous! Outrageous!
Outrageous!! You filthy little wog!


FEISAL
My friend, Aurens, if I may call him
that. My friend, Aurens. How many men
will claim the right to use that phrase?
How proudly! He longs for the greenness
of his native land; he pines for the
gothic cottages of, eh, Surrey? Is it
not? Already, in imagination he catches
trout and engages in all the activities
of the English gentleman.

ALLENBY
That's me you're describing, sir, not
Colonel Lawrence. You're promoted
Colonel.

LAWRENCE
Yes? What for?

FEISAL
Take the honour, Colonel. Be a little
kind.

ALLENBY
As a Colonel, you'll have a cabin to
yourself on the boat home.

LAWRENCE
Then, thank you.

ALLENBY
Well, then, God speed.

FEISAL
There's nothing further here for a
warrior. We drive bargains. Old men's
work. Young men make wars and the virtues
of war are the virtues of young men;
courage and hope for the future. Then,
old men make the peace. And the vices of
peace are the vices of old men; mistrust
and caution. It must be so. What I owe
you is beyond evaluation. The power-
house, the telephone exchange - these I
concede; the pumping plant I must retain.

ALLENBY
If you retain the pumping-plant, there'll
be no water, sir.

FEISAL
I shall be glad of any technical
assistance.

ALLENBY
In fairness then, you must bring down
your flag.

FEISAL
I shall not bring down my flag, and if
your men attempt it, my men will resist
it.

ALLENBY
Have you any men, sir?

FEISAL
Enough for that. It's the kind of thing
that makes a very ugly incident. I'm sure
you're government does not wish to appear
at the peace conference in the light of
an aggressor.

SOLDIER
I say! It's Lawrence, isn't it? Well, may
I shake you're hand, sir? Just want to be
able to say I'd done it, sir.

LAWRENCE
Haven't we met before?

SOLDIER
Don't think so, sir. Oh, no, sir. I
should have remembered that.


FEISAL
It is widely known the Arab council took
power in my name.

ALLENBY
They have no power, sir. It's illusory.

FEISAL
Illusions can be very powerful;
particularly when they take this form.
The world is delighted at the picture of
Damascus liberated by the Arab army.

ALLENBY
Led, may I remind you, sir, by a British
serving officer.

FEISAL
Ah, yes. But then Aurens is a sword with
two edges. We are equally glad to be rid
of him. Are we not?

ALLENBY
I thought I was a hard man, sir.

FEISAL
You are merely a general. I must be a
king.

BRIGHTON
Excuse me, sir.

ALLENBY
Well?

DRYDEN
Well. It seems we're to have a British
waterworks with an Arab flag on it. Do
you think it was worth it?

ALLENBY
Not my business. Thank God I'm a soldier!

DRYDEN
Yes, sir. So you keep saying.

FEISAL
You, I suspect, are chief architect of
this compromise. What do you think?

DRYDEN
Me? Your Highness? On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.


SOLDIER
Well, sir. Going 'ome.

LAWRENCE
Hmm?

SOLDIER
'Ome, sir.

I got a bottle, I got a cup
I got ice, so what's up
Walk in the club wearing superstar clothes
Feeling like money cause I collect dough
Moe, miney, meenie, inny
Where's that Patrone and Henny
Ass eater

[Verse 1]
I been sipping on cabonney that shits so strong
Like Paris Hilton, gotta carry me home
So full, so far gone
Forgot where I parked, and lost my iPhone
Still looking good and pretty, bad bitch in every city
Rocks, diamonds, I got plenty
Ice for the cup, now pour the Henny
Escorted in the club, I brought the whole team
Ain't no guest, but it's a rockstar thing
Everybody looking of course it's the queen
They admiring the crown, and the ten carat ring
I'm known for pimping these rappers
I should get an Oscar award for my acting
When they actually think that I'm feeling em
That's when I take they money, and I'm killing em

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Watch me get ghost in the phantom
Something like a pimp like David Banner
I crooked letter, crooked letter, I crooked letta
Crooked letta I humpback humpback
I, am so off the chain
Buying bottles ain't a thing
Plus I'm gonna make it rain
So much money think she's insane
You a seven digit nigga if you holla at a broad
With a seven digit figga you should come in by the bar
I'm talking buying bottles, Cavalli Vodka
I'm wet and hot like lava
I'm switching four lanes in the Range
Hanging out the roof talking money ain't a thing
Coming all out my shirt on champaign
Damn lil Miss Trina off the chain

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
I splurge, I spend
Grab a pearl grand ten
I'm so stinky, stinky rich
My damn dogg drive a Benz
Powder blue, diamond shoes
Shining suits, Liberace boo
Stunting on you, like boo who you
I'm an icon ya bitch I though you knew
I only drop bombs, haters be like uh-uh
Girl who she think she is, I'm is what you want is
Girl I don't want your man but I'll take your man
Yo man and his friend they both my fans
You don't understand Misdemeanor ain't playing
When we go out to eat I got your man paying",Trina,David Cook,2008,[42],1
317,Billie Jean,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Do think twice

She told my baby that's a threat
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
Eyes would like mine
Gonna dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

LAWRENCE OF ARABIA




BRIGHTON
He was the most extraordinary man I ever
knew.

VICAR
Did you know him well?

BRIGHTON
I knew him.

VICAR
Well, 'nil nais ibonam', but did he
really deserve a place in here?

REPORTER
Lord Allenby, could you give me a few
words about Colonel Lawrence?

ALLENBY
What, more words? The revolt in the
desert played a decisive part in the
Middle-Eastern Campaign.

REPORTER
Yes, sir. But about Colonel Lawrence
himself?

ALLENBY
No, I didn't know him well, you know.

REPORTER
Eh, Mr Bentley. You must know as much
about Colonel Lawrence as anybody does.

BENTLEY
Yes. It was my privilege to know him, and
to make him known to the world. He was a
poet, a scholar, and a mighty warrior.

REPORTER
Thank you.

BENTLEY
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

MAN
You, sir. Who are you?

BENTLEY
My name is Jackson Bentley.

MAN
Well, whoever you are, I overheard your
last remark and I take the gravest
possible exception. He was a very great
man.

BENTLEY
Did you know him?

MAN
No, sir. I can't claim to have known him.
I once had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

MURRAY
Knew him? No, I never knew him. He had
some minor function on my staff in Cairo.

(Cairo)


LAWRENCE
Michael George Hartley. This is a nasty,
dark little room.

HARTLEY
That's right.

LAWRENCE
We are not happy in it.

HARTLEY
I am. It's better than a nasty, dark
little trench.

LAWRENCE
Then, you're a big noble fellow.

HARTLEY
That's right.

LAWRENCE
Ah! Here is William Potter with my
newspaper.

POTTER
Here you are, Tosh!

LAWRENCE
Thanks. Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

POTTER
Ta. Is it there?

LAWRENCE
Of course. Headlines, but I bet it isn't
mentioned in The Times. ""Bedouin tribes
attack Turkish stronghold"", and I bet
that no one in this whole headquarters
even knows it happened, or cared if it
did. Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

MESSENGER
Sir. Mr Lawrence?

LAWRENCE
Yes?

FLIMSEY
Flimsey, sir.

LAWRENCE
Thank you.

HARTLEY
You'll do that once too often; it's only
flesh and blood!

LAWRENCE
Michael George Hartley, you're a
philosopher.

HARTLEY
And you're balmy!

POTTER
Ow! It damn well hurts.

LAWRENCE
Certainly, it hurts!

POTTER
Well, what's the trick then?

LAWRENCE
The trick, William Potter, is not minding
that it hurts.

LAWRENCE
Oh, by the way. If Captain Gibbon should
inquire for me, tell him I've gone for a
chat with the General.

POTTER
He's balmy!

HARTLEY
He's all right.


FREDDY
Lawrence!

LAWRENCE
Yes?

FREDDY
You're supposed to be... Do you usually
wear your cap in the mess?

LAWRENCE
Oh, yes.

FREDDY
You're supposed to be on duty, aren't
you? Where are you going?

LAWRENCE
Mustn't talk shop, Freddy. Not in the
mess. Matter of fact I'm going for a
'powwow' with the General.

FREDDY
I'm not asking as a superior; I'm asking
as the secretary of this mess. We don't
want chaps in here who should be on duty.

ORDERLY
Where are you going, please?

FREDDY
I must say! Lawrence!

LAWRENCE
Sorry!

FREDDY
You're a clown, Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
Ah well, we can't all be lion-tamers...
Sorry!

MURRAY
It's an intrigue, Dryden, and I do not
propose to let an over-wheeling,
finicking, crass lieutenant thumb his
nose at his general officer commanding
and get away with it.

DRYDEN
He doesn't sound as though he'd be any
great loss, sir.

MURRAY
Now, don't try that, Dryden. There's a
principle involved.

DRYDEN
There is, indeed. He's of no use here in
Cairo; he might be in Arabia. He knows
his stuff, sir.

MURRAY
Knows the books, you mean. I've already
sent out Colonel Brighton, who's a
soldier, and if Brighton thinks we should
send them some small arms, then we will.
What more do you want?

DRYDEN
There would be no question of Lieutenant
Lawrence giving military advice, sir.

MURRAY
By God, I should hope not!

DRYDEN
It's just that the Arab Bureau would like
its own man on the spot, sir, to eh...

MURRAY
To what?

DRYDEN
...to make our own appraisal of the
situation.

MURRAY
I may as well tell you it's my considered
opinion, and that of my staff, that any
time spent on the Bedouin will be time
wasted. They're a nation of sheep-
stealers.

DRYDEN
They did attack Medina.

MURRAY
Well, the Turks made mincemeat of them.

DRYDEN
We don't know that, sir.

MURRAY
We know they didn't take it. A storm in a
tea-cup, Dryden; a side-show. Do you want
my own opinion? This whole theatre of
operations is a side-show. The real war's
being fought against the Germans, not the
Turks, and not here but on the Western
Front, in the trenches. Your Bedouin
army, or whatever it calls itself, would
be a side-show of a side-show.

DRYDEN
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

MURRAY
Does the Arab Bureau want a 'big thing'
in Arabia? If they rise against the
Turks, does the Bureau think they're
going to sit down quietly under us when
they're asked until this war's over?

DRYDEN
The Bureau thinks the job at the moment,
sir, is to win the war.

MURRAY
Don't tell me my duties, Dryden!

OFFSCREEN
Lawrence, sir.

MURRAY
Send him in!

LAWRENCE
Good morning, sir.

MURRAY
Salute! If you're insubordinate of me,
Lawrence, I shall put you under arrest.

LAWRENCE
It's my manner, sir.

MURRAY
Your what?

LAWRENCE
My manner, sir. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't really.

MURRAY
No, I can't make out whether you're
bloody bad-mannered, or just half-witted.

LAWRENCE
I have the same problem, sir.

MURRAY
Shut up!

LAWRENCE
Yes, sir.

MURRAY
Now, the Arab Bureau seem to think you
would be of some use to them in Arabia.
Why? I can't imagine! You don't seem able
to perform your present duties properly.

LAWRENCE
I cannot fiddle, but I can make a great
state from a little city.

MURRAY
What!

LAWRENCE
Themistocles, sir. A Greek philosopher.

MURRAY
I know you've been well educated,
Lawrence. It says so in your dossier.
You're the kind of creature I can't
stand, Lawrence, but I suppose I could be
wrong. All right, Dryden, you can have
him for six weeks. Who knows? Might even
make a man of him. Come in. Yes? What is
it, Hallon?

HALLON
Navy signal, sir. the convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

MURRAY
Is that certain?

HALLON
Yes, sir. There doesn't seem to be any
artillery, sir.

MURRAY
But there must be artillery!

DRYDEN
Sir, this is something of an expedition.
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs, and then get back. He
can't do that in six weeks.

MURRAY
Two months, then.

DRYDEN
Three.

MURRAY
All right. Three. Now, will you let me do
some work, Mr Dryden.

DRYDEN
Thank you, sir.

LAWRENCE
I'd like to say, sir, that I am grateful
for this...

MURRAY
Shut up and get out!

LAWRENCE
Sir!

MURRAY
How can I fight a bloody war without
bloody artillery!

LAWRENCE
How did you do it. sir?

DRYDEN
You might better ask why I bothered to.

LAWRENCE
Because I'm the man for the job.

DRYDEN
I just wonder about that

LAWRENCE
Of course I'm the man for the job. What
is the job, by the way?

DRYDEN
Find Prince Feisal.

LAWRENCE
Good. And when I've found him?

DRYDEN
Find out what kind of man he is; find out
what his intentions are. I don't mean his
immediate intentions. That's of Colonel
Brighton's business, not yours. I mean,
his intentions in Arabia altogether.

LAWRENCE
Oh! That's new. Where are they now?

DRYDEN
Anywhere within three hundred miles of
Medina. They're Hasami Bedouins. They can
cross sixty miles of desert in a day.

LAWRENCE
Oh, thanks, Dryden. This is going to be
fun.

DRYDEN
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature get
fun of the desert: Bedouins and gods, and
you're neither. Take it from me; for
ordinary men, it's a burning, fiery
furnace.

LAWRENCE
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

DRYDEN
It is recognised that you have a funny
sense of fun.


TAFAS
Here, you may drink. One cup.

LAWRENCE
You do not drink?

TAFAS
No.

LAWRENCE
I'll drink when you do.

TAFAS
I am Bedu.


TAFAS
Truly, now, you are a British Officer?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

TAFAS
From Cairo?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

TAFAS
You did not ride from Cairo?

LAWRENCE
No. Thank Heavens. It's nine hundred
miles; I came by boat.

TAFAS
And before? From Britain?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

TAFAS
Truly?

LAWRENCE
From Oxfordshire.

TAFAS
Is that a desert country?

LAWRENCE
No; a fat country; fat people.

TAFAS
You are not fat?

LAWRENCE
No. I'm different... Here, take it.

TAFAS
First, I take you to Lord Feisal, then
you give it to me.

LAWRENCE
Take it now.

TAFAS
Bedu food.

LAWRENCE
Good.

TAFAS
More...Bedu!

LAWRENCE
Where?

TAFAS
From here to Lord Feisal's camp is Harif
country.

LAWRENCE
Yes, I know.

TAFAS
I am not Harif.

LAWRENCE
No. Hasimi of the Beni Salim.

TAFAS
Put the right foot in tight. Lock it with
your left foot. Then, when you're ready
to go, hit her on the shoulder and say,
'Hut, hut, hut!'

LAWRENCE
Hut, hut, hut!

TAFAS
Ah, today will be difficult, but tomorrow
good riding...  I think we reach Mastura
Well tomorrow. Yes? And from Mastura Well
to Lord Feisal's camp one day more. Now!

At the Harif Well

TAFAS
Good?

LAWRENCE
It's all right.

TAFAS
This is a Harif well. The Harif are a
dirty people.

LAWRENCE
Turks?

TAFAS
Bedu!

LAWRENCE
Who is he?... Tafas!

ALI
He's dead.

LAWRENCE
Yes. Why?

ALI
This is my well.

LAWRENCE
I have drunk from it.

ALI
You are welcome.

LAWRENCE
He was my friend.

ALI
That!

LAWRENCE
Yes. That.

ALI
This pistol yours?

LAWRENCE
No, his.

ALI
His?

LAWRENCE
Mine.

ALI
Then I will use it. Your friend was a
Hasami of the Beni Salim.

LAWRENCE
I know.

ALI
I am Ali of El Karish.

LAWRENCE
I've heard of you.

ALI
So, what was a Hasami doing here?

LAWRENCE
He was taking me to help Prince Feisal.

ALI
You have been sent from Cairo.

LAWRENCE
Yes.

ALI
I have been in Cairo for my schooling. I
can both read and write. My Lord Feisal
already has an Englishman.

LAWRENCE
Yes.

ALI
What is your name?

LAWRENCE
My name is for my friends. None of my
friends is a murderer.

ALI
You are angry, English. He was nothing.
The well is everything. The Hasami may
not drink at our wells. He knew that.
Salaam. Hut, hut, hut.

LAWRENCE
Sherif Ali. So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe, so long will they be
a little people; a silly people; greedy,
barbarous, and cruel, as you are.

ALI
Come. I will take you to Feisal.

LAWRENCE
I do not want your company, Sherif.

ALI
Wadi Safra is another day from here. You
will not find it, and not finding it, you
will die.

LAWRENCE
I will find it with this.

ALI
Good army compass. How if I take it?

LAWRENCE
Then you would be a thief.

ALI
Have you no fear, English?

LAWRENCE
My fear is my concern.

ALI
Truly. God be with you, English.


LAWRENCE
As I walk along the Bois Bou-long,
With an independent air,
You can here the girls declare,
'He must be a millionaire,
You can rum-ti-tum-ti-tum-ti-tum,
Ti-tuddely-tun-ti-tun-ti-tun,
I'm the man who broke the bank at
Monte Carlo.

BRIGHTON
Hey! You!...  I've been waiting for you.

LAWRENCE
Did you know I was coming?

BRIGHTON
I knew someone was coming; Feisal told
me.

LAWRENCE
How did he know?

BRIGHTON
Not much happens within fifty miles of
Feisal that Feisal doesn't know, I'll
give him that. No escort?

LAWRENCE
My guide was killed at the Matsra well.

BRIGHTON
Turks?

LAWRENCE
No. An Arab.

BRIGHTON
Bloody savages!

LAWRENCE
This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?

BRIGHTON
Yes, they're over there; now, just a
minute. What's your name and who sent
you?

LAWRENCE
Lawrence. I've been seconded to the Arab
Bureau.

BRIGHTON
Oh. and what are you to do for the Arab
Bureau?

LAWRENCE
Well, it's rather vague, sir. I'm to
appreciate the situation.

BRIGHTON
Well, that won't be difficult. The
situation's bloody awful. The morale, if
ever they had any, which I doubt, the
Turks knocked out of them in front of
Medina with howitzers. They're fading
away by dozens every night. What I want
to say to you is this; that wherever you
are and whoever you're with, you're a
British serving officer, and here's an
order; when we get into that camp you're
to keep your mouth shut. Do you
understand what I'm saying?

LAWRENCE
Yes, sir. I understand what you're
saying.

BRIGHTON
You'll make your appreciation and get
back to...Oh my God; not again!... I've
told him; God knows I've told him. 'Move
south', I've said, 'You're still in
range'. They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do.


FEISAL
Stand and fight! Stand and fight! Fire
back at them!...  Who are you?

BRIGHTON
Lieutenant Lawrence, sir. Seconded to the
Arab Bureau. This is a bloody mess, sir,
we'll have to move south.

FEISAL
Yes, yes, Colonel; fifty miles south. You
were right and I was wrong. We must take
some thought for the wounded.

BRIGHTON
Well, we can take care of them at Yenbo,
sir.

FEISAL
If they get to Yenbo.

BRIGHTON
Well, they can hardly come with us, sir.

FEISAL
No, they must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant, eh..

LAWRENCE
Lawrence.

FEISAL
You understand, Lieutenant Lawrence, my
people are unused to explosives and
machines. First the guns, and now this.


DAUD
Cigarette?

LAWRENCE
I'm sorry.

SOLDIER
Eh?

DAUD
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

SOLDIER
Hump off!

DAUD
Please, Your Excellency. Just one for
two?

BRIGHTON
Hold it, Jenkins! Jenkins! Jenk...!
Jenkins!

MAJID
'Aurens?

LAWRENCE
'Aurens!

MAJID
'Aurens, you have no servant.

LAWRENCE
I don't need a servant.

DAUD
No? We can do everything. Light fires;
cook food; wash clothes.

FERRAJ
Yes, everything.

LAWRENCE
I don't doubt it.

DAUD
It will be very nice for you...

LAWRENCE
I can't afford it.


SILIAM
Recite, then, as much of the Koran as may
be easy to you. God knoweth that there be
some among you sick while others travel
through the Earth in quest for the
bounties of God; others do battle in his
cause; recite, therefore, as much as may
be easy and observe the prayers; this
will be best and richest in the
recompense. Seek ye the forgiveness of
God; verily, God is forgiving, merciful.

FEISAL
Greetings, Ali.

ALI
My lord.

BRIGHTON
Sherif Ali.

FEISAL
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met Sherif
Ali, I think.

LAWRENCE
Yes, my lord.

FEISAL
And now, Siliam, the brightness.

SILIAM
By the noon-day brightness, by the light
when it darkeneth; thy Lord hath not
forsaken thee; neither hath he been
displeased...

FEISAL
...and surely the future will be better
for thee than the past...

LAWRENCE
...And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee and thou be satisfied.

FEISAL
So...? Yes, Colonel?

BRIGHTON
I want a decision, sir.

FEISAL
You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

BRIGHTON
Well, you're not doing much good here,
sir. I'm sorry to rub it in, sir, but we
can't supply you here.

FEISAL
You could supply us through Aqaba.

BRIGHTON
Aqaba! Well, if you can get hold of
Aqaba, sir, of course we can supply you,
but you can't.

FEISAL
You could.

BRIGHTON
You mean the Navy? The Turks have twelve-
inch guns at Aqaba, sir; can you imagine
what that means?

FEISAL
Yes, I can imagine.

BRIGHTON
Well, put that out of your mind, sir. The
Navy's got other things to do.

FEISAL
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

BRIGHTON
The one essential sector of this front is
and must be the Canal. You can see that,
sir, surely.

FEISAL
I see that the Canal is an essential
British interest; it is of little
consequence to us.

BRIGHTON
I must ask you not to speak like that,
sir. British and Arab interests are one
and the same.

FEISAL
Possibly.

ALI
Ha! Ha!

BRIGHTON
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.
Fall back on Yenbo and we will give you
equipment; give you arms, advice,
training, everything!

FEISAL
Guns?

BRIGHTON
A modern rifle for every man.

FEISAL
No, guns! Artillery! Guns like the
Turkish guns at Medina.

ALI
Yes. Give us guns and keep the training.

BRIGHTON
Your men need training far more then
guns, sir.

ALI
The English will teach the Bedu to fight?

BRIGHTON
We will teach them, Sherif Ali, to fight
a modern, mechanised army.

FEISAL
Yes, Lieutenant? What do you think about
Yenbo?

LAWRENCE
I think it is far from Damascus.

BRIGHTON
We'll have you in Damascus and never
fear.

FEISAL
Have you been in Damascus, Mr Lawrence?

LAWRENCE
Yes, my lord.

FEISAL
It is beautiful, is it not?

LAWRENCE
Very.

BRIGHTON
That'll do, Lawrence. Dreaming won't get
you to Damascus, sir, but discipline
will. Look, sir, Great Britain is a small
country; it's much smaller than yours; a
small population compared with some; it's
small but it's great, and why?

ALI
Because it has guns!

BRIGHTON
Because it has discipline!

FEISAL
Because it has a navy; because of this,
the English go where they please and
strike where they please and this makes
them great.

LAWRENCE
Right.

BRIGHTON
Mr Lawrence, that will do! Lieutenant
Lawrence, sir, is not your military
adviser.

FEISAL
But I would like to hear his opinion.

BRIGHTON
Damn it, Lawrence! Who do you take your
orders from?

SILIAM
From Lord Feisal in Feisal's tent.

ALI
Old fool! Why turn from him to him; they
are master and man!

LAWRENCE
My lord, I think... I think your book is
right. The desert is an ocean in which no
oar is dipped and on this ocean the Bedu
go where they please and strike where
they please. This is the way the Bedu
have always fought. You're famed
throughout the world for fighting in this
way and this is the way you should fight
now!

BRIGHTON
Well, I don't know.

LAWRENCE
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong. Fall
back on Yenbo, sir, and the Arab Rising
become's one poor unit in the British
Army.

FEISAL
What is this to you?

BRIGHTON
Lawrence, do you know you're a traitor?

FEISAL
No, no, Colonel, eh... he is a young man
and young men are passionate, but they
must say their say, but wiser people must
decide, I know you are right.

BRIGHTON
Very well, sir, once we move; the sooner
the better, you'll lose another fifty men
tonight.

FEISAL
You tread heavily, but you speak the
truth. I will give you my answer
tomorrow, now it is late... Colonel
Brighton means to put my men under
European officers, does he not?

LAWRENCE
In effect, my lord, yes.

FEISAL
And I must do it because the Turks have
European guns, but I fear to do it; upon
my soul, I do. The English have a great
hunger for desolate places. I fear they
hunger for Arabia

FEISAL
Then you must deny it to them.

FEISAL
You are an Englishman. Are you not loyal
to England?

LAWRENCE
To England and to other things.

FEISAL
To England and Arabia, both? And is that
possible? I think you are another of
these desert-loving English. Doughty. Stanhope. Gordon of
Khartoum. No Arab loves the desert. We
love water and green trees. There's
nothing in the desert. No man needs
nothing. Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with? Because we
are little people; a silly people;
greedy, and barbarous, and cruel. Do you
know, Lieutenant, in the Arab city of
C¢rdoba were two miles of public lighting
in the streets when London was a village?

LAWRENCE
Yes, you were great.

FEISAL
Nine centuries ago.

LAWRENCE
Time to be great again, my lord.

FEISAL
Which is why my father made this war upon
the Turks. My father, Mr Lawrence, not
the English. But my father is old and
I...I long for the vanished gardens of
Cordoba. However, before the gardens must
come the fighting. To be great again, it
seems that we need the English, or...

LAWRENCE
...Or?

FEISAL
What no man can provide, Mr Lawrence. We
need a miracle.


LAWRENCE
Aqaba! Aqaba...from the land!

ALI
You are mad! To come to Aqaba by land we
should have to cross the Nefud Desert.

LAWRENCE
That's right.

ALI
The Nefud cannot be crossed.

LAWRENCE
I'll cross it if you will.

ALI
You! It takes more than a compass,
Englishman. The Nefud is the worst place
God created.

LAWRENCE
I can't answer for the place, only for
myself. Fifty men?

ALI
Fifty! Against Aqaba?

LAWRENCE
If fifty men came out of the Nefud, they
would be fifty men other men might join.
The Howitat are there, I hear.

ALI
The Howitat are brigands; they will sell
themselves to anyone.

LAWRENCE
Good fighters, though.

ALI
Good? Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

LAWRENCE
They face the sea, Sherif Ali, and cannot
be turned round. From the landward side
there are no guns at Aqaba.

ALI
With good reason. It cannot be approached
from the landward side!

LAWRENCE
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.
Aqaba is over there. It's only a matter
of going.

ALI
You are mad!


FEISAL
And where are you going, lieutenant, with
fifty of my men?

LAWRENCE
To work your miracle.

FEISAL
Blasphemy is a bad beginning for such a
journey.

LAWRENCE
Who told you?

FEISAL
Ali did. Why not you?

LAWRENCE
You are falling back on Yenbo, sir?

ALI
Yes. Yes, I must. But I will spare these
to you. Did Ali break confidence to tell
me?

LAWRENCE
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance, my
lord.

FEISAL
Yet, you did not tell Colonel Brighton.

LAWRENCE
No. But since you do know, we can claim
to ride in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

FEISAL
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence, you may claim
it, but in whose name do you ride?


GASIM
Sherif! I caught them. They had tracked
us. They were here. I caught them.

ALI
Why are you here? Boy!

DOUD
To serve lord Aurens, Sherif.

GASIM
This is true, Aurens. They do wish it.

ALI
You have been tracking us. You were told
to stay.

DOUD
No, Sherif. Our camel strayed; we
followed her.

FERRAJ
She led us here to be lord Aurens'
servants. It is the Will of Allah.

ALI
Blasphemy!

LAWRENCE
Don't do that!

GASIM
No, no! Aurens. These are not servants.
These are outcasts. Parentless!

ALI
Be warned! They are not suitable.

LAWRENCE
They sound very suitable. You can ride
with the baggage.

ALI
These are not servants. These are
worshippers!

FERRAJ
Aurens?

LAWRENCE
Hm?

FERRAJ
One shilling...every week.

GASIM
That is fair.

FERRAJ
Each.

GASIM
NO! That is too much!

LAWRENCE
Alright.

GASIM
They will be lucky for you. Allah favours
the compassionate.


ALI
There is the railway...and that is the
desert. From here until the other side;
no water but what we carry: for the
camels; no water at all. If the camels
die, we die. And in twenty days they will
start to die.

LAWRENCE
There's no time to waste, then, is there?


LAWRENCE
I was thinking.

ALI
You were drifting.

LAWRENCE
Yes. It will not happen again.

ALI
Be warned! You were drifting.

LAWRENCE
It will not happen again!


ALI
That water is wasted. From now on we must
travel by night and rest while it is too
hot to travel. A few hours each day.

LAWRENCE
Why don't we start now?

ALI
No. We will rest now. Three hours.

LAWRENCE
Fine. I'll wake you.


LAWRENCE
Do we rest here?

ALI
There is no rest, now, short of water,
Aurens. On the other side of that.

LAWRENCE
And how much of that is there?

ALI
I'm not sure, but however much it must be
crossed before tomorrow's sun gets up.
This is the Sun's Anvil.


LAWRENCE
Have we done it?

SILIAM
No! But we're off the Anvil.

LAWRENCE
Thank God for that, anyway!

SILIAM
Yes. Thank Him! Aurens, I do not think
you know how you have tempted him.

LAWRENCE
I know. We've done it.

ALI
God willing.

LAWRENCE
When do we reach the wells?

ALI
God willing, midday.

LAWRENCE
Then we've done it.

SILIAM
Thank Him, Aurens. Thank Him.

DOUD
Aurens!

ALI
Gasim's!

LAWRENCE
What's happened to him?

ALI
God knows!

LAWRENCE
Why don't you stop?

ALI
For what? He will be dead by midday!

LAWRENCE
We must go back.

ALI
What for? To die with Gasim? In one hour
comes the sun. In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!

LAWRENCE
I can! Take the boy!

ALI
If you go back, you kill yourself, is
all! Gasim you have killed already.

LAWRENCE
Get out of my way!

ALI
Gasim's time is come, Aurens. It is
written.

LAWRENCE
Nothing is written!

ALI
Go back, then! What did you bring us here
for with your blasphemous conceit! Hey?
English blasphemer! Aqaba? Was it Aqaba?
You will not be at Aqaba, English! Go
back, blasphemer, but you will not be at
Aqaba!

LAWRENCE
I shall be at Aqaba; that is written...in
here.

ALI
English!!! English!!!


LAWRENCE
Nothing is written.

GASIM
Aurens?

GASIM
Aurens?

ALI
El Aurens?

LAWRENCE
Ferraj. Wash!


ALI
Ferraj. El Aurens, truly for some men
nothing is written unless they write it.

LAWRENCE
Not 'El' Aurens; just Aurens.

ALI
El Aurens is better

LAWRENCE
True.

ALI
Your father, too, just Mr Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

ALI
Is that a lord?

LAWRENCE
A kind of lord.

ALI
And when he dies, you too will be a lord.

LAWRENCE
No.

ALI
Ah, you have an elder brother.

LAWRENCE
No.

ALI
But, then? I do not understand this. Your
father's name is Chapman...

LAWRENCE
Ali, he didn't marry my mother.

ALI
I see.

LAWRENCE
I'm sorry.

ALI
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

LAWRENCE
Yes. I suppose I am.

ALI
El Aurens is best.

LAWRENCE
Alright. I'll settle for 'El Aurens'.


ALI
They are the robes of a Sherif of the
Beni Wadji.

LAWRENCE
Very fine. A great honour.

ONLOOKER
The honour is to us. Salaam, Sherif.

LAWRENCE
Is it permitted?

ALI
Surely.

LAWRENCE
Salaam.

CROWD
Salaam.

SILIAM
He for whom nothing is written may write
himself a                 , salaam.

ALI
They are good for riding. Try!


AUDAR
What are you doing, Englishman?

LAWRENCE
As you see. Are you alone?

AUDAR
Almost. Are you with that party of dogs
who are drinking at my well?

LAWRENCE
Yours?

AUDAR
I am Audar Abu Tayi.

LAWRENCE
I've heard of another man of that name.

AUDAR
Other? What other?

LAWRENCE
The Audar I'd heard of wouldn't need
someone's help to look after his wells.

AUDAR
Ah. He must be a great hero.

LAWRENCE
He is. He wouldn't refuse water to men
coming out of the great Nefud Desert.

AUDAR
Now, would he not? Hm. No, that must be
some other man. Here is my help.  Son,
what fashion is this?

SON
Harif, father.

AUDAR
What manner of Harif?

SON
A Beni Wadji Sherif.

AUDAR
And is he Harif?

SON
No, father. English!

AUDAR
Son! They are stealing our water; tell
them we're coming. Tell them!... Empty
that!

ALI
Do not!!

AUDAR
It is Audar of the Howitat who speaks.

ALI
It is Ali of the Harif who answers.

AUDAR
Harif? Ali, does your father still steal?

ALI
No. Does Audar take me for one of his own
bastards?

AUDAR
No, there is no resemblance. Alas, you
resemble your father.

ALI
Audar flatters me.

AUDAR
You're easily flattered. I knew your
father well.

ALI
Did you know your own?

LAWRENCE
Auda! We are fifty, you are two. How if
we shot you down?

AUDAR
Why, then you have a blood feud with the
Howitat. Do you desire it?

LAWRENCE
Not the generals in Cairo, nor the Sultan
himself desire that. Call off your men.

AUDAR
No, no, boy. This honours the unworthy.
I've only just begun to teach him.

LAWRENCE
And what are you teaching him today?
Howitat hospitality?

AUDAR
Be not clever with me, English! Who is
he?

LAWRENCE
A friend of Prince Feisal's.

AUDAR
Oh. So, you desire my hospitality.

LAWRENCE
Yes.

AUDAR
Is he your tongue?

ALI
We do desire it.

AUDAR
Ugh. Then, it is given, if you will take
it. I am at my summer camp; a poor place.
Well, to me it seems a poor place. Some
men find it marvellous. Tomorrow, maybe,
I will allow the Turks to buy you,
friends of Feisal. But, dine with me.
Dine with Auda, English; dine with the
Howitat, Harif. It is my pleasure that
you dine with me in Wadi Ram.

In Auda's tent

AUDAR
This thing you work against Aqaba, what
profit do you hope from it?

ALI
We work it for Feisal of Mecca. The Harif
do not work for profit.

AUDAR
Well, if a man was meant to be a servant,
Ali, he could find worse masters than
Feisal, but I...I cannot serve.

LAWRENCE
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

AUDAR
Yes, it is my pleasure.

LAWRENCE
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

AUDAR
No? For the English, then?

LAWRENCE
For the Arabs.

AUDAR
The Arabs. The Howitat, Ajili, Rala, Beni
Saha; these I know, I have even heard of
the Harif, but the Arabs! What tribe is
that?

LAWRENCE
They're a tribe of slaves; they serve the
Turks.

AUDAR
Well, they are nothing to me. My tribe is
the Howitat...

ALI
Who work only for profit.

AUDAR
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

LAWRENCE
And Auda's pleasure is to serve the
Turks.

AUDAR
Serve. I serve?

LAWRENCE
It is the servant who takes money.

AUDAR
I am Audar Abu Tayi! Does Audar serve?

CROWD
No!

AUDAR
Does Audar Abu Tayi serve?

CROWD
No!! Ha! Ha! Ha!

AUDAR
I carry twenty-three great wounds, all
got in battle. Seventy-five men have I
killed with my own hands in battle. I
scatter, I burn my enemies tents. I take
away their flocks and herds. The Turks
pay me a golden treasure. Yet, I am poor,
because I  am a river to my people! Is
that service?

LAWRENCE
No.

SILIAM
And yet now it seems Audar has grown old
and lost his taste for fighting.

AUDAR
It is well you say it in my tent, thou
old tulip!

ALI
Yet, this is a tulip that the Turks could
not buy.

AUDAR
Why should they wish to? Now! I will tell
you what they pay me, and you will tell
me if this is a servant's wages. They pay
me, month by month, one hundred golden
guineas.

LAWRENCE
One hundred and fifty, Auda.

AUDAR
Who told you that?

LAWRENCE
I have long ears.

AUDAR
And a long tongue between them.

LAWRENCE
A hundred; a hundred and fifty; what
matters? It's a trifle...a trifle which
they take from a great box they have...

ALI
In Aqaba.

AUDAR
In Aqaba!

LAWRENCE
Where else?

AUDAR
You trouble me like women.

LAWRENCE
Friends, we have been foolish. Audar will
not come to Aqaba.

AUDAR
No.

LAWRENCE
For money.

AUDAR
No.

LAWRENCE
For Feisal?

AUDAR
No.

LAWRENCE
Nor to drive away the Turks. He will come
because it is his pleasure.

AUDAR
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.


AUDAR
Make God your agent! Aqaba!

CROWD
Aqaba!

AUDAR
God be with you.


ALI
Yes, Aqaba. Tomorrow, we will go and get
it.

LAWRENCE
Do you think we shall?

ALI
Yes. If you're right about the guns.


AUDAR
He killed: he dies.

ALI
This is the end of Aqaba.

SILIAM
One of our men murdered one of Auda's
men.

LAWRENCE
Why?

SILIAM
Theft? Blood-feud? It makes no matter
why.

LAWRENCE
Ali!

ALI
It is an ancient wound.

LAWRENCE
I didn't come here to watch a tribal
bloodbath.

AUDAR
It is the law, Aurens.

LAWRENCE
The Law says the man must die.

AUDAR
Hm!

LAWRENCE
It he dies, would that content the
Howitat?

AUDAR
Yes.

LAWRENCE
Sherif Ali. If none of lord Auda's men
harms any of yours, will that content the
Harif?

ALI
Yes.

LAWRENCE
Then, I will execute the Law. I have no
tribe and no one is offended. Gasim! Did
you do it?

AUDAR
Well. Aurens. What ails the Englishman?

ALI
That man he killed was the man he brought
out of the Nefud.

AUDAR
Ah, it was written, then. Better to have
left him.

ALI
It was execution, Aurens: no shame in
that. Besides, it was necessary. You gave
life and you took it. The writing is
still yours.

On the beach at Aqaba

ALI
The miracle is accomplished. Garlands for
the conqueror. Tribute for the prince;
flowers for the man.

LAWRENCE
I'm none of those things, Ali.

ALI
What, then?

LAWRENCE
Don't know. Thanks. My God I love this
country. What!

AUDAR
No gold in Aqaba!

MAN
I've found it!

LAWRENCE
That's a pity. Ali. You get a message
down the coast to Yenbo. Tell Feisal to
find boats...any boats, and bring the
Arab army here to Aqaba quickly.

ALI
And you?

LAWRENCE
I'm going to tell the generals in Cairo.
Yes, cross Sinai. Come on!

ALI
Sinai!?

LAWRENCE
Yes!

ALI
With these?

LAWRENCE
They'll be alright with me. Look, Ali. If
any of your Bedouin arrived in Cairo and
said, 'We've taken Aqaba. the generals
would laugh.

ALI
I see. In Cairo you will put off these
funny clothes. You will wear trousers and
tell stories of our quaintness and
barbarity, and then, they will believe
you.

LAWRENCE
You're an ignorant man.

AUDAR
Paper! Paper! There is no gold in Aqaba.
No gold! No great box!

LAWRENCE
Did Audar come to Aqaba for gold?

AUDAR
For my pleasure as you said, but gold is
honourable, and Aurens promised gold.
Aurens lied.

LAWRENCE
See, Auda. The Crown of England promises
to pay five thousand golden guineas
to Audar Abu Tayi, signed in His
Majesty's absence, by...me. In ten days,
I'll be back with the gold. With gold,
with guns, ...with everything.

AUDAR
Ten days. You'll cross Sinai?

LAWRENCE
Why not? Moses did.

AUDAR
And you will take the children?

LAWRENCE
Moses did!

AUDAR
Moses was a prophet and beloved of God.
He said there was gold here: he lied. He
is not perfect.


FERRAJ
Lord, can we not rest?

LAWRENCE
I told you, 'No rest till they know I
hold Aqaba'. Have you two slept in beds?
Ferraj? Doud? With sheets. Tomorrow the
finest sheets in the finest room in the
finest hotel in Cairo, I promise.

MAJID
Then it shall be so, lord.

LAWRENCE
Look! a pillar of fire.

DOUD
No, lord. Dust.


LAWRENCE
My compass! No matter. If we ride west,
we must strike the Canal...


LAWRENCE
Come on!


DOUD
Aurens!! Aurens!!

FERRAJ
Aurens!

LAWRENCE
Ferraj! Ferraj! Don't! Don't! Don't!


FERRAJ
Aurens? Why do you walk? But why, lord?
Aurens! But why, lord? There's room for
both. It serves no purpose...
Aurens! Look!      Aurens!

LAWRENCE
It's all right, Ferraj. It's all right.

FERRAJ
Hey!

MOTORCYCLIST
Who are you? Who are you?

Cairo

FERRAJ
Doud!

SOLDIER
We're here, sir.  You taking him in
there, sir?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

SOLDIER
Here! Here! You! And where the hell do
you think you're going to, Mustafa?

LAWRENCE
Eh, we're thirsty.

SOLDIER
Mr Lawrence, is it?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

SOLDIER
Are you going to the officer's bar, sir?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

SOLDIER
You can't take him in there, sir.

OFFICER
What do you think you look like?

BAR MAN
No, no, you mustn't! Not another! Go
effendi! Go! Get out! You must get out!
Get out!

LAWRENCE
We want two large glasses of lemonade!

BAR MAN
This is a bar for British Officers.

LAWRENCE
That's alright; we're not particular

FREDDY
Lawrence! Are you off your head?

LAWRENCE
No. Oddly enough, I'm not.

OFFICER
Now, look here, Lawrence, just clear out
of here, will you?

CROWD
Go on, Lawrence, clear off! Get that boy
out of here!

OFFICER
Pogo! We'll have this one out, anyway.

CROWD
Get out! Get that wog out of here! Yes,
clear off! Go on, get the little wog out!

BRIGHTON
What's going on?

OFFICER
It's Lawrence, sir.

LAWRENCE
Lemonade with ice.

BRIGHTON
Well, explain yourself.

LAWRENCE
We've taken Aqaba.

BRIGHTON
Taken Aqaba? Who has?

LAWRENCE
We have. Our side in this war have. The
wogs have. We have. He likes your
lemonade.

BRIGHTON
You mean the Turks have gone?

LAWRENCE
No, they're still there, but they've no
boots. Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners; the entire garrison. No,
that's not true. We killed some; too many
really. I'll manage it better next time.
There's been a lot of killing, one way or
another. Cross my heart and hope to die,
it's all perfectly true.

BRIGHTON
It isn't possible.

LAWRENCE
Yes, it is. I did it.

BRIGHTON
You'd better talk to Allenby.

LAWRENCE
General Allenby?

BRIGHTON
Yes, He's in command now Murray's gone.

LAWRENCE
Well, that's a step in the right
direction. First I want a room, with a
bed, with sheets.

BRIGHTON
Yes, yes, of course.

LAWRENCE
It's for him.

BRIGHTON
Right! You want a bed yourself, don't
you?

LAWRENCE
See Allenby first, though. Will he see
me?

BRIGHTON
I think so.

LAWRENCE
Do that then. I'd better shave

BRIGHTON
Yes, you had. You'd better get into some
trousers too.


ALLENBY
Undisciplined...unpunctual...untidy...sev
eral languages...knowledge of
music...literature...knowledge
of...knowledge of...you're an interesting
man, there's no doubt about it. Who told
you to take Aqaba?

LAWRENCE
Nobody.

ALLENBY
Sir.

LAWRENCE
Sir.

ALLENBY
Then, why did you?

LAWRENCE
Aqaba's important.

ALLENBY
Why is it important?

LAWRENCE
It's the Turkish route to the Canal.

ALLENBY
Not any more. They're coming through
Bethsheda.

LAWRENCE
I know, but we've gone forward to Gaza.

ALLENBY
So?

LAWRENCE
So that left Aqaba behind your right.

ALLENBY
True.

LAWRENCE
And it will be further behind your right
when you go for Jerusalem.

ALLENBY
Am I going for Jerusalem?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

ALLENBY
Very well. Aqaba behind my right.

LAWRENCE
It threatened El Herish and Gaza.

ALLENBY
Anything else?

LAWRENCE
Yes. Aqaba's linked with Medina.

ALLENBY
Do you think we should shift them out of
Medina now?

LAWRENCE
No. I think you should leave them there.

ALLENBY
You acted without orders, you know?

LAWRENCE
Shouldn't officers use their initiative
at all times?

ALLENBY
Not really. It's awfully dangerous,
Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
Yes. I know.

ALLENBY
Already?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

ALLENBY
I'm promoting you major.

LAWRENCE
I don't think that's a very good idea.

ALLENBY
I didn't ask you; I want you to go
back...and carry on the good work.

LAWRENCE
No, thank you, sir.

ALLENBY
Why not?

LAWRENCE
Well, I...eh, let me see...I killed two
people. I mean two Arabs; one was a boy.
that was... yesterday! I led him into
quicksand. The other was a man; that was
before Aqaba, anyway. I had to execute
him with my pistol. There was something
about it I didn't like.

ALLENBY
Well, naturally...

LAWRENCE
No, something else...

ALLENBY
I see, well, that's all right. We'll give
you a warning.

LAWRENCE
No. Something else.

ALLENBY
What then?

LAWRENCE
I enjoyed it.

ALLENBY
Rubbish! Rubbish! You know that you're
tired. What do you mean by coming here
dressed like that? Amateur theatricals?

LAWRENCE
Oh, yes. Entirely.

ALLENBY
Let me see that hat-thing, or whatever it
is. Fascinating gear they wear. How do
you think I would look in this hat,
Harry?

BRIGHTON
Damn ridiculous, sir.

ALLENBY
Here, you keep it.

LAWRENCE
What I'm trying to say is I don't think
I'm fit for it.

ALLENBY
Really!? What do you think, Dryden?

DRYDEN
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said it
couldn't be done.

ALLENBY
Brighton?

LAWRENCE
I know what he thinks.

BRIGHTON
I think you should recommend a
decoration, sir. I don't think it matters
what his motives were; 'twas a brilliant
bit of soldiering.

ALLENBY
Mr Perkins!

PERKINS
Sah!

ALLENBY
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

PERKINS
Sah!

ALLENBY
You've heard about this, Mr Perkins.

PERKINS
Yes, sir.

ALLENBY
What do you think about it?

PERKINS
Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done, sir.

ALLENBY
Thank you, Mr Perkins.

PERKINS
Sah!

ALLENBY
Come on, then.

LAWRENCE
You're a clever man, sir.

ALLENBY
No, but I know a good thing when I see
one. That's fair, surely.  Look here,
lad. If I'm going to break through to
Jerusalem, I must concentrate not
discipline...

LAWRENCE
Guns.

ALLENBY
Do you know of better?...

ALLENBY
I fight like Clausewitz, you fight like Saxe.

LAWRENCE
We shall do very well, indeed, sir.


ALLENBY
Easy, gentlemen, please. Will you give us
something to drink? Waiter    Of course,
sir.

ALLENBY
I'm here at the invitation of Major
Lawrence. Tracy. Shall we go outside?
So, you'll hold down the Turkish desert
army.

LAWRENCE
Yes.

ALLENBY
With a thousand Arabs?

LAWRENCE
A thousand Arabs means a thousand knives,
delivered anywhere, day or night...means
a thousand camels; that means a thousand
packs of high explosive and a thousand
crack rifles. We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round. I'll
smash his railways, and while he's
mending them I'll smash them somewhere
else. In thirteen weeks I can have Arabia
in chaos.

ALLENBY
You are going back then?

LAWRENCE
Yes, of course I'm going back.

ALLENBY
Well, if we can see it, so can the Turk.
If he finds he's using four divisions to
fend off a handful of bandits, he'll
withdraw.

LAWRENCE
He daren't withdraw. Arabia's part of his
empire: if he gets out now, he knows
he'll never get back again.

BRIGHTON
I wonder who will.

LAWRENCE
No one will. Arabia's for the Arabs now.
That's what I've told them, anyway.
That's what they think: that's why
they're fighting.

ALLENBY
Oh, surely.

LAWRENCE
They've only one suspicion, if we'll let
them drive the Turks out and then move in
ourselves. I've told them that that's
false: that we've no ambitions in Arabia,
have we?

ALLENBY
I'm not a politician, thank God. have we
any ambition in Arabia, Dryden?

DRYDEN
Difficult question, sir.

LAWRENCE
I want to know, sir, if I can tell them
in your name that we have no ambitions in
Arabia.

ALLENBY
Certainly.

LAWRENCE
Two thousand small arms is not enough: I
need five.

ALLENBY
Right.

LAWRENCE
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns: they
don't like paper.

ALLENBY
Right.

LAWRENCE
Instructors for the Lewis guns.

ALLENBY
Right.

LAWRENCE
More money.

ALLENBY
How much more?

LAWRENCE
Twenty-five thousand now: a lot more
later.

ALLENBY
Dryden?

DRYDEN
It can be done, sir.

LAWRENCE
A couple of armoured cars.

ALLENBY
Right.

LAWRENCE
Field artillery.

ALLENBY
Right. I'm going to give you every
blessed thing I can, Major Lawrence,
because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations and thank you. Thank you
for your hospitality, gentlemen.

CROWD
Congratulations.

DRYDEN
Are you really going to give them
artillery, sir?

BRIGHTON
I was wondering that, sir. It might be
deuced difficult to get it back again.

DRYDEN
Give them artillery and you've made them
independent.

ALLENBY
Then, I can't give them artillery, can I?

DRYDEN
For you to say, sir.

ALLENBY
No, it's not. I've got orders to obey,
thank God. Not like that poor devil. He's
riding the whirlwind.

DRYDEN
Let's hope we're not.


BENTLEY
Excuse me, friend. Who do these bags
belong to?

SILIAM
To Prince Feisal.

BENTLEY
You're not Prince Feisal, by any chance.

SILIAM
No.

BENTLEY
You know him, though.

SILIAM
He is my master. I am his servant.

BENTLEY
Em. Can you read?  The Chicago Courier is
my own particular paper, but my work is
syndicated throughout America.

FEISAL
I understood so from your letter, Mr
Bentley.   Now?

BENTLEY
Where can I find Major Lawrence?

FEISAL
Is that what you've come for?

BENTLEY
Not all together, sir, no.

FEISAL
Well, Mr Bentley, you will find Major
Lawrence with my army.

BENTLEY
Well, that's what I meant, sir. Where can
I find your army?

FEISAL
I don't know. Last week they were near El
Hira.

BENTLEY
Gira!

FEISAL
Oh, yes. I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

BENTLEY
I've never tried.

FEISAL
Take a mule. Avoid Malal. The Turks are
there.

BENTLEY
In Malal, now? They move fast.

FEISAL
They do, but not so fast as we do, you
will find.

FEISAL
Myself? I am going to Cairo, as you know.

BENTLEY
Yes.

FEISAL
There is work for me there of a different
kind.

BENTLEY
Yes. I understand you've been given no
artillery.

FEISAL
That is so.

BENTLEY
You're handicapped.

FEISAL
It restricts us to small things.

BENTLEY
It's intended to.

FEISAL
Do you know General Allenby?

BENTLEY
Watch out for Allenby. He's a 'slim
customer'.

FEISAL
Excuse me?

BENTLEY
A clever man.

FEISAL
'Slim customer'. Very good. I will
certainly watch out for him. You're being
very sympathetic, Mr Bentley.

BENTLEY
Your Highness, we Americans were once a
colonial people and we naturally feel
sympathetic to any people, anywhere, who
are struggling for their freedom.

FEISAL
Very gratifying.

BENTLEY
Also, my interests are the same as yours.
You want your story told: I badly want a
story to tell.

FEISAL
Ah, now you are 'talking turkey', are you
not?

BENTLEY
Ha! Ha!

FEISAL
Well, Mr Bentley, I will give you a guide
and a letter, and before I leave
here...Ah, which must be presently, I
will have some facts and figures put on
paper for you. You know, of course, that
we are destroying the Turkish railways?

BENTLEY
I do, sir. Major Lawrence is in charge of
all this, is he?

FEISAL
My army is made up of tribes. The tribes
are led by the tribal leaders.

FEISAL
Well, your people do think very highly of
Major Lawrence, though.

FEISAL
Oh, yes. And rightly. In this country, Mr
Bentley, the man who gives victory in
battle is prized beyond every other man.
One figure I can give you from my head
because it never leaves my head. Since
starting this campaign four months ago,
we have lost thirty-seven wounded, one
hundred and fifty-six dead. You remark
that this proportion between our dead and
wounded.

BENTLEY
Yeah. Four times as many.

FEISAL
That's because those too badly wounded to
bring away we ourselves kill. We leave no
wounded for the Turks.

BENTLEY
You mean...

FEISAL
I mean we leave no wounded for the Turks.
In their eyes we are not soldiers, but
rebels, and rebels wounded or whole are
not protected by the Geneva Code and are
treated harshly.

BENTLEY
How harshly?

FEISAL
More harshly than I hope you can imagine.

BENTLEY
I see.

FEISAL
Our own prisoners, Mr Bentley, are taken
care of until the British can relieve us
of them according to the Code. I should
like you to notice that.

BENTLEY
Yes, sir. Is that the influence of Major
Lawrence?

FEISAL
Why should you suppose so?

BENTLEY
Well, it's just I heard in Cairo that
Major Lawrence has a horror of bloodshed.

FEISAL
That is exactly so. with Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion: with me it is merely
good manners. You may judge which motive
is the more reliable. And now, perhaps...

BENTLEY
Oh, sure. Sure. Thank you, sir. Do you
think you'd be able to manage the letter?

FEISAL
I'll do everything I have said, Mr
Bentley, if you will tell me truly the
nature of your interest in my people and
Major Lawrence.

BENTLEY
It's very simple, sir. I'm looking for a
hero.

FEISAL
Indeed? You do not seem a romantic man.

BENTLEY
Oh, no. But certain influential men back
home believe that the time has come for
America to lend her weight to the
patriotic struggle against Germany...and
Turkey. Now, I've been sent to find
material which will show our people that
his war is...

FEISAL
Enjoyable?

BENTLEY
Hardly that, sir. But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.

FEISAL
You are looking for a figure who will
draw your country towards war.

BENTLEY
Alright. Yes.

FEISAL
Aurens is your man.


LAWRENCE
Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Come on, men!

AUDAR
Aurens!

LAWRENCE
Oh, good God!

BENTLEY
Jimeny! Never seen a man killed with a
sword before.

LAWRENCE
Why don't you take a picture?

BENTLEY
Wish I had.

AUDAR
How is it with thee, Aurens? No! Am I in
this?

LAWRENCE
Did you take his picture?

BENTLEY
Yeah.

AUDAR
You are using up your nine lives very
quickly.

BENTLEY
Charming company you keep.

LAWRENCE
Auda? he's a bit old fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue. He
thinks you're a kind of thief.

BENTLEY
Is it alright if I take your picture?

LAWRENCE
All right.

BENTLEY
OK. Just walk.

CROWD
Aurens! Aurens!

BENTLEY
Major Lawrence? Yes, sir, that's my baby.


BRIGHTON
This looting has got to stop.

ALI
It is customary.

BRIGHTON
It's theft, and theft makes thieves.

ALI
I would not say that to Auda. It is their
payment, Colonel.

BRIGHTON
Payment!

ALI
Truly, are not British soldiers paid?

BRIGHTON
They don't go home when they're paid.

ALI
They are not free to.

BRIGHTON
Well, there's another lot you've seen the
last of.

LAWRENCE
They'll come back.

BRIGHTON
He says they'll come back. Will they?

ALI
Not this year, Aurens.

BRIGHTON
Look, Lawrence. How many men do you think
you'll have left? Two hundred?

LAWRENCE
Less.

BRIGHTON
Well, then.

LAWRENCE
I said they'll come back.

BRIGHTON
You badly hurt?

LAWRENCE
Not hurt at all. Didn't you know? They
can only kill me with a golden bullet.


ALI
It is for children. I have set myself to
learn again.

BENTLEY
What are you learning from this?

ALI
Politics.

BENTLEY
You gonna be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?

ALI
I will tell you that when I have a
country.

BENTLEY
Ha! Ha!...

ALI
Did I answer well?

BENTLEY
You answered without saying anything.
That's politics. You learn quickly.

ALI
I have a good teacher.

BENTLEY
Yeah. Yeah.
How's your hurt?

LAWRENCE
Fine.

BENTLEY
Before I return to the flesh-pots, which
I shall be very glad to do, may I put two
questions to you? Straight?

LAWRENCE
I'd be interested to hear you put a
question straight, Mr Bentley.

BENTLEY
One: What, in your opinion, do these
people hope to gain from this war?

LAWRENCE
They hope to gain their freedom. Freedom.

BENTLEY
They hope to gain their freedom. There's
one born every minute.

LAWRENCE
They're going to get it, Mr Bentley. I'm
going to give it to them. The second
question?

BENTLEY
Oh. Well, I was going to ask...eh; what
is it, Major Lawrence, that attracts you
personally to the desert?

LAWRENCE
It's clean.

BENTLEY
Well, now. That's a very illuminating
answer. May I take one farewell picture?

AUDAR
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it. One
clock for two lamps.

BRIGHTON
A fair bargain.

AUDAR
I robbed him. I must find something
honourable.

BRIGHTON
Honourable?

AUDAR
Yes, the year is running out, Brighton. I
must find something honourable.


AUDAR
Now, you may blow up my train.

BRIGHTON
And what will you do now?

AUDAR
Oh, now I go home. They will carry my
toys. They will carry my toys, too, do
you see?

BRIGHTON
Major Lawrence will campaign this winter,
but you've got what you wanted so you're
going home. Is that it?

AUDAR
Of course! When Aurens has got what he
wants, he will go home. When you have got
what you want, you will go home.

BRIGHTON
Oh, no, I shan't, Auda.

AUDAR
Then you are a fool.

BRIGHTON
Maybe. I am not a deserter.

AUDAR
Give thanks to God, Brighton, that when
he made you a fool, he gave you a fool's
face.

BRIGHTON
You are an impudent rascal!

AUDAR
I must go, Aurens, before I soil myself
with a fool's blood.

BRIGHTON
It's like talking to a brick wall. So,
what'll you do now? What can you do?

LAWRENCE
I'll go north. That's what Allenby wants,
isn't it?

BRIGHTON
Allenby wanted the Arab army behind
Dar'a.

LAWRENCE
Then that's where I'll take it.

LAWRENCE
Tell Allenby to hurry up; that we'll be
in Dar'a before he's in Jerusalem, won't
we?


LAWRENCE
Train! Ferraj.

FERRAJ
Ya! Aurens.
Bedouin   Aii!

LAWRENCE
Hide yourself, my friend.     Detonator.
Alright, fetch another.

FERRAJ
Pardon, Aurens, I put it in...

LAWRENCE
There's plenty of time; fetch another!
Ferraj? Ferraj!

ALI
What happened?

LAWRENCE
Detonator. A detonator.

BEDOUIN
He cannot ride, Aurens. Look.

ALI
If they take him alive, you know what
they will do to him.

FERRAJ
Daud will be angry with you.

LAWRENCE
Salute him for me.


ALI
What will you do now?

LAWRENCE
Go north.

ALI
With twenty?

LAWRENCE
What would you recommend me to do, Ali?
What would you recommend?


BRIGHTON
Well, he hasn't one-tenth so many men,
sir.

ALLENBY
He's lied, in fact.

BRIGHTON
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have done
anything he hasn't done.

ALLENBY
Then there is an Arab north army?

BRIGHTON
No, sir, he has lied about that.

ALLENBY
Any idea why?

BRIGHTON
It's his army, I suppose.

ALLENBY
It's Prince Feisal's army. Do you think
he's gone native, Harry?

BRIGHTON
No. He would if he could, I think. Not my
line of country this, sir.

ALLENBY
Oh, it doesn't matter; I'm just curious.
What matters is I believed it. The Turks
believe it. They're offering twenty
thousand pounds for him.

BRIGHTON
Good Heavens!

ALLENBY
No. Shouldn't say he'd long to live,
would you?

BRIGHTON
Well, whatever else, sir, he's a brave
man.

ALLENBY
Oh, surely, surely. If he's still going
north with fifty men, he doesn't lack
'guts'. I wonder if they'd offer that
much for me. What about next year? Will
they still come back?

BRIGHTON
I wouldn't be surprised. They think he's
a kind of prophet.

ALLENBY
They do or he does?


ALI
Now, may I speak?

LAWRENCE
Yes.

ALI
Aurens. One more failure, and you will
find yourself alone. I do not include
myself.

LAWRENCE
I do not include the others.

ALI
So, say they love you: the more reason to
be thrifty with them. give them something
to do that can be done. But you? No, no,
they must move mountains for you: they
must walk on water.

LAWRENCE
That's right. That's right! Who are you
to know what can be done. If we'd done
what you thought could be done, we'd be
back in Yenbo now, and nowhere. Whatever
I ask them to do, can be done, that's
all. They know that if you don't. Do you
think I'm just anybody, Ali? Do you?
My friends. Who will walk on water with
me? Who will come with me into Dar'a?

BEDOUIN
Dar'a is garrisoned. Will you take twenty
against two thousand?

LAWRENCE
I'll go by myself if I have to.

BEDOUIN
Why?

LAWRENCE
Because I told the English generals the
Arab revolt will be in Dar'a when they
would be in Jerusalem.

BEDOUIN
Or perhaps you are here for the English
generals.

LAWRENCE
Who says this?

ALI
Rumour.

BEDOUIN
That is not an argument.

LAWRENCE
No argument. This afternoon, I will take
the Arab revolt into Dar'a while the
Arabs argue.

BEDOUIN
Aurens! Can you pass for an Arab in an
Arab town?

LAWRENCE
Yes, if one of you would lend me some
dirty clothes.

Dar'a

ALI
This is madness! What are you looking
for?

LAWRENCE
Some way to announce myself.

ALI
Be patient with him, God.

ALI
Do you not see how they look at you?
Come!

LAWRENCE
Please, Ali. I am invisible.

TURK
Halt!

LAWRENCE
Walk on.

TURK
Halt!

LAWRENCE
Walk on.

TURK
You! And You!

BEY
You.      You have blue eyes? I say you
have blue eyes.

LAWRENCE
Yes, efendi.

BEY
Are you Sicasian?

LAWRENCE
Yes, efendi.

BEY
How old are you?

LAWRENCE
Twenty-seven, efendi. I think.

BEY
You look older. You have had a lot of
experience. It's an interesting face. I'm
surrounded by cattle. He wouldn't know an
interesting face from a sow's belly. I
have been in Dar'a now for three and a
half years. If they'd posted me to the
dark side of the moon, I could not be
more isolated. You haven't the least idea
of what I'm talking about, have you?

LAWRENCE
No, efendi.

BEY
Have you? No. That would be too lucky.
Where did you get that?

LAWRENCE
Oh, eh, it's old, efendi.

BEY
No, no. This is recent. You are a
deserter.

LAWRENCE
No, efendi.

BEY
Yes, you're a deserter, but from which
army? Not that it matters at all. A man
cannot be always in uniform. Your skin is
very fair.      Beat him.


ALI
Sleep. Sleep!       Eat. Eat! You have a
body like other men. Good. Then sleep.


ALI
Better?

LAWRENCE
Much better. You were right.

ALI
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

LAWRENCE
Oh, I've learned alright. I'm going, Ali.

ALI
Why?

LAWRENCE
Why? Heavens!

ALI
Why?

LAWRENCE
I've come to the end of myself, I
suppose.

ALI
And the end of the Arab revolt?

LAWRENCE
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali. I'm not
even Arab.

ALI
A man can be whatever he wants, you said.

LAWRENCE
I'm sorry. I thought it was, too.

ALI
You proved it.

LAWRENCE
Look, Ali. Look! That's me. What colour
is it? That's me! And there's nothing I
can do about it.

ALI
A man can do whatever he wants, you said.

LAWRENCE
He can, but he can't want what he wants.
This is the stuff that decides what he
wants. You may as well know, I would have
told them anything; I would have told
them who I am; I would have told them
where you were; I tried to.

ALI
So would any man.

LAWRENCE
Well, any man is what I am and I'm going
back to Allenby to ask him for a job that
any man can do.

ALI
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

LAWRENCE
I'll make easy stages.

ALI
You!

LAWRENCE
Oh, yes. Easy stages. Look, Ali, I think
I see a way of being just ordinarily
happy. Can I take this?

ALI
It is not clean.

LAWRENCE
No, but it's warm.

ALI
And these? Having led them here! Have you
no care for them?

ALI
You'll lead them. They're yours. Trust
your own people and let me go back to
mine.


SOLDIER
I say, don't forget those form fives.

SOLDIER
All right!

LAWRENCE
Hey? Mind if I join you?

OFFICER
Oh. Honoured, sir.

LAWRENCE
Good to be back.

OFFICER
We heard you were, sir. What's doing out
there?

LAWRENCE
Where? Oh, Arabia.

OFFICER
Eh, yes, sir.

LAWRENCE
Nothing much. Wrong time of year. What's
doing here?

OFFICER
We're settling in alright, sir.     We've
built a squash court.

LAWRENCE
Jolly good. Well, I have to go up there.
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

OFFICER
Bloody wogs!

LAWRENCE
Yes, probably. Jolly good about the
squash court.

OFFICER
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

LAWRENCE
Morning.

MP
Oh, morning, sir.

LAWRENCE
Good to be back.

MP
I'll believe you, sir.

LAWRENCE
No, really, it is.       Hello.

BRIGHTON
Morning. You're to go right in.

FEISAL
Aurens, or is it Major Lawrence?

LAWRENCE
Sir.

FEISAL
Ah. Ai. Well, General, I will leave you.
Major Lawrence, doubtless, has reports to
make about my people and their weakness,
and the need to keep them weak in the
British interest...and the French
interest too, of course. We must not
forget the French now...

ALLENBY
I've told you, sir, no such treaty
exists.

FEISAL
Yes, General, you have lied most bravely,
but not convincingly. I know this treaty
does exist.

LAWRENCE
Treaty, sir?

FEISAL
He does it better than you, General, but
then, of course, he is almost an Arab.

DRYDEN
You really don't know?

ALLENBY
Then what the devil's this?

LAWRENCE
It's my request for release from Arabia,
sir.

ALLENBY
For what reason? Are you sure you haven't
heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

LAWRENCE
No. I can guess

ALLENBY
Don't guess! Tell him!

DRYDEN
Well, now. Mr Sykes is and English civil
servant. Monsieur Picot is a French civil
servant. Mr Sykes and Monsieur Picot met
and they agreed that after the war,
France and England would share the
Turkish Empire, including Arabia. They
signed an agreement, not a treaty, sir.
An agreement to that effect.

LAWRENCE
There may be honour among thieves, but
there's none in politicians.

DRYDEN
And let's no have displays of
indignation. You may not have known, but
you certainly had suspicions. If we've
told lies, you've told half-lies and a
man who tells lies, like me, merely hides
the truth, but a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

LAWRENCE
The truth is I'm an ordinary man. You
might have told me that, Dryden, and I
want an ordinary job, sir. That's my
reason for resigning. It's personal.

ALLENBY
Personal?

LAWRENCE
Yes, sir.

ALLENBY
Personal? You're a serving officer in the
field, and as it happens, a damned
important one. Personal? Are you mad?

LAWRENCE
No, and if you don't mind, I'd rather not
go mad. That's my reason, too.

ALLENBY
Look, Lawrence. I'm making my big push on
Damascus the sixteenth of next month and
you are part of it. Can you understand
that? You're an important part of the big
push.

LAWRENCE
I don't want to be part of your big push!

ALLENBY
What about your Arab friends? What about
them?

LAWRENCE
I have no Arab friends! I don't want Arab
friends!

ALLENBY
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

LAWRENCE
I've told you. I just want my ration of
common humanity.

DRYDEN
Lawrence?

LAWRENCE
Yes?

DRYDEN
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

ALLENBY
Oh, that's quite all right, thank you, Mr
Dryden.

DRYDEN
Thank you, sir.

ALLENBY
Look. Why don't we...there's blood on
your back. Do you want a doctor?

LAWRENCE
No.

ALLENBY
Tell me what happened.


BENTLEY
So, what goes on in there?

DRYDEN
Nothing.

BENTLEY
Oh, come on!

DRYDEN
No, really. Nothing at all.

BENTLEY
Is the man in trouble?

DRYDEN
I expect so. We all have troubles. Life's
a vale of troubles.

BENTLEY
Just let me know if the man's in trouble;
I've got an interest in that man; I've
got a claim!

DRYDEN
What claim?

BENTLEY
You've read my stuff. I've made that boy
a hero. When the war's over, that boy can
be anything he wants.

DRYDEN
Yes. Well, at the moment he wants to be
somebody else. Will you kindly allow me
to pass?

BENTLEY
Walk away, Dryden. Walk away. Always
walking away, aren't you?

DRYDEN
Well, I'll tell you. It's a little clash
of temperament that's going on in there,
inevitably. One of them's half-mad, and
the other, wholly unscrupulous.


ALLENBY
I believe your name will be a household
word when you'll have to go to the War
Museum to find who Allenby was. You're
the most extraordinary man I've ever met.

LAWRENCE
Leave me alone!

ALLENBY
What?

LAWRENCE
Leave me alone!

ALLENBY
Well, that's a feeble thing to say.

LAWRENCE
I know I'm not ordinary.

ALLENBY
That's not what I'm saying.

LAWRENCE
All right! I'm extraordinary. What of it?

ALLENBY
Not many people have a destiny, Lawrence.
It's a terrible thing for a man to funk
it if he has.

LAWRENCE
Are you speaking from experience?

ALLENBY
No.

LAWRENCE
You're guessing, then. Suppose you're
wrong.

ALLENBY
Why suppose that? We both know I'm right.

LAWRENCE
Yes...

ALLENBY
...After all...

LAWRENCE
I said, 'Yes'. The sixteenth?

ALLENBY
Can you do it? I'll give you a lot of
money.

LAWRENCE
Artillery?

ALLENBY
I can't.

LAWRENCE
They won't be coming for money; not the
best of them. They's be coming for
Damascus, which I'm going to give them.

ALLENBY
That's all I want.

LAWRENCE
All you want is someone holding down the
Turkish right, but I'm going to give them
Damascus. We'll get there before you do,
and when we've got it, we'll keep it. You
can tell the politicians to burn their
bit of paper, now.

ALLENBY
Fair enough.

LAWRENCE
Fair. What's 'fair' got to do with it?
It's going to happen. I shall want quite
a lot of money.

ALLENBY
All there is.

LAWRENCE
Not that much. The best of them won't
come for money; they'll come for me.


AUDA
No pictures! You take no pictures!

BENTLEY
It's not for you, sheika, it's for Major
Lawrence. He doesn't mind having his
picture taken. He doesn't mind at all.

AUDA
Well, there's only one Aurens.

BENTLEY
Have you met Major Lawrence since he's
come back, sherif?

ALI
Yes.

BENTLEY
Changed, hasn't he?

ALI
No!

BENTLEY
Oh, I'd say he had. Different man, I'd
say. What did that Turkish general do to
him  in Dar'a?

ALI
He was the same man after Dar'a. The same
man. Humbled. What did the English
general do to him in Jerusalem?

BENTLEY
Search me? Ask Aurens.

ALI
I did.

BENTLEY
What did he say?

ALI
He laughed. He told me to gather the
Harif here. He offered me money.

BENTLEY
Did you take it?

ALI
No. But many did.     What is this?

LAWRENCE
This is my bodyguard.

ALI
There's not a man there without a price
on his head.

LAWRENCE
There's a price on my head, too.

ALI
But these are murderers. You know the
sheiks will hang these men.

LAWRENCE
These men are mine.

ALI
Aurens. These things know nothing of the
Arab revolt. You! You son of a leper.

GUARD
Sherif?

ALI
Where do we ride?

GUARD
Damascus, sherif.

ALI
Aye, but for what?

GUARD
Sherif? For Aurens.

ALI
You have bought these things!

LAWRENCE
I bought half the men here, Ali.

ALI
That is different. These are not ordinary
men!

LAWRENCE
I don't want ordinary men!     Damascus!!

AUDAR
Aurens!


ALLENBY
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's gone
through Masseriel and Dar'a. Very good,
by the way. very good indeed. Now your
turn.

CHARLEY
Well, sir, if the enemy's retreating in
any kind of order, which we'd better
assume,...

ALLENBY
Certainly.

CHARLEY
...he can't be further than this Malad
place. In which case I can have him
within range by, eh,  o-nine hundred
hours tomorrow.

ALLENBY
Splendid! Philip.

PHILIP
Well, these are the last infantry
supports going up now, sir, but Malad
could have the Fusiliers there by
Wednesday, sir.

ALLENBY
That'll do for now. The guns are what
matter. Any questions?

OFFICER
This Arab army on the right, sir. What
does it consist of?

BRIGHTON
Irregular cavalry, sir. About two
thousand.

OFFICER
Where are they now?

BENTLEY
(We) Can only know that by being with
them, sir.

ALLENBY
Then get with them, Harry. I want to
know.

BRIGHTON
Yes, sir.

ALLENBY
Pound them, Charley! Pound them!


ALI
God help the men who lie under that!

LAWRENCE
They're Turks.

ALI
God help them!


BRIGHTON
Well, he's got the bit between his teeth
alright.

ALLENBY
Cocky?

BRIGHTON
More than cocky, sir. He's got the bit
between his teeth. All right. I tell you,
sir, I think he'll get to Damascus before
we do unless...

ALLENBY
Unless?

BENTLEY
Well, there's a Turkish column in front
of him. Out of Masriel.

ALLENBY
What do the Turks have in Masriel? I
wonder where they are now.



GUARD
No prisoners.

ALI
Damascus, Aurens.     Aurens. Not this.
Go round. Damascus, Aurens! Damascus!

GUARD
No prisoners.

ALI
Aurens?

AUDAR
This was Talal's village.

LAWRENCE
No prisoners! No prisoners!

ALI
God. God! God!!     Aurens! Enough!
Enough! Make them stop!     Aurens!

BENTLEY
Major! Major Lawrence! Jesus wept! Jesus
wept!

ALI
Does it surprise you, Mr Bentley? Surely,
you know the Arabs are a barbarous
people. Barbarous and cruel. Who but
they! Who but they!

BENTLEY
Oh, you rotten man. Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture for the rotten
bloody newspapers.


BEDOUIN
These were cut last night, Aurens, in
Damascus. Damascus!

LAWRENCE
Take them to Sherif Ali. Tell him. Remind
him. Is Allenby in Damascus?

BEDOUIN
Near.

LAWRENCE
Tell Sherif Ali that.

BEDOUIN
They are not ripe, ha, ha.


SOLDIER
General salute! Present arms! Hold Arms!

BRIGHTON
Lawrence is behind it, sir. Lawrence. The
whole town has passed onto the Arab flag.

ALLENBY
When?

BRIGHTON
A day and a night, sir. They've been here
a day and a night. They've occupied the
town, sir. They've done it. He's set up
his own headquarters in the town hall.

ALLENBY
What else besides the town hall?

BRIGHTON
The telephone exchange, post office,
power house, hospital, fire station,
everything, sir. They call themselves the
Arab National Council and they're in the
town hall.

ALLENBY
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry. What do
you think we should do about it?

BRIGHTON
Well, get them out of it, sir, quick
time.

ALLENBY
How about that, Dryden?

DRYDEN
Not unless you want a full-scale rising
on your hands, sir.

BRIGHTON
Well, what, then?

DRYDEN
When will Prince Feisal be in Damascus?

ALLENBY
By special train in two days' time.

DRYDEN
Two days.

ALLENBY
Two days is what you asked me for. I
can't keep him out any longer. Isn't it
enough?

DRYDEN
Yes, ample. I should think.

BRIGHTON
Look, sir, we can't just do nothing.

ALLENBY
Why not? It's usually best.

ALLENBY
Get us something to drink, Tracy.
Tracy     Yes, sir.

ALLENBY
And Tracy, all troops to remain quartered
until further notice.

TRACY
Yes, sir. Does that apply to technical
units, sir?

ALLENBY
Technical Units particularly.

TRACY
Yes, sir.

BRIGHTON
Medicals, too, sir?

ALLENBY
I'm afraid so, Harry. Medicals too.


LAWRENCE
We, here, are neither Harif, nor Howetat,
nor any other tribe, but Arabs at the
Arab Council, acting for Prince Feisal.

AUDA
He insulted me.

LAWRENCE
Sherif Ali said that the telephones were
in the care of the Howetat, and that the
telephones had ceased to work, and this
is true, Auda.

AUDA
They will not work because they are given
no electricity. The electricity is in the
care of the Harif.

LAWRENCE
If you answer there'll be bloodshed.

ALI
You speak to me of bloodshed? I ask
pardon of Auda Bute.

AUDA
Humbly? Humbly! Harif!

ALI
Yes! Humbly!

AUDA
This is a new trick.

LAWRENCE
Why is there no electricity?

ALI
I have been to that electrical house,
Aurens. There are three large machines.

VOICE FROM THE BALCONY
He means 'generators'!

ALI
So, one of them is burned. They are of an
incredible size, but helpless.

AUDA
It is so of all machines. Let them burn!
What need of telephones?

LAWRENCE
The need is absolute.

ALI
Then, we need the English engineers.

LAWRENCE
No! Take English engineers and you take
English government. Take...

SOLIDER
Fire has broken out.

ALI
Where?

SOLIDER
In the Gensebe district.

ALI
It is not a district that matters.

LAWRENCE
It will spread.

ALI
Then, in God's name, use the fire
brigade!

SOLIDER
We have tried, Aurens, but there is force
in the water.

LAWRENCE
Then, you must carry it.

ALI
The Urala do not carry water.

AUDA
What else are they good for?

LAWRENCE
We will hear petitions this afternoon.
This afternoon!


ALLENBY
I'm going to take this up after the war.

BRIGHTON
Surely, we should do something, sir.

ALLENBY
It's an old man's sport.

DRYDEN
Are you an old man, sir?

ALLENBY
Hmm.

BRIGHTON
Well, all I can say is, sir, it's a heavy
responsibility. Sorry, sir.

ALLENBY
Maybe, it's the bulb.

DRYDEN
No, sir. It's the power. They're leaving,
sir.

ALLENBY
That's it, then. Marvellous-looking
beggars, aren't they?


AUDA
Leave this, Aurens. Come with me!

LAWRENCE
Come where?

AUDA
Back! I know your heart. What is it? Is
it this? I tell you; this is nothing. Is
it the blood? The desert has dried up
more blood than you could think of.

LAWRENCE
I pray that I may never see the desert
again. Hear me, God!

AUDA
You will come. There is only the desert
for you.

LAWRENCE
What about you, Ali?

ALI
No. I shall stay here and learn politics.

LAWRENCE
That's a very low occupation.

ALI
I had no thought of it when I met you.
You tried very hard to give us Damascus.

LAWRENCE
It's what I came for. And that would be
something.

ALI
Yes. Much.

AUDAR
He is your friend?

ALI
Take your hand away!

AUDA
You love him.

ALI
No, I fear him.

AUDAR
Then, why do you weep?

ALI
I fear him who love him? Or must he fear
himself or hate himself. Take your hand
away!  Howitat!

AUDA
Oh, so you are not yet entirely
politician.

ALI
Not yet.

AUDA
Well, these are new tricks and I am an
old dog. And Allah be thanked. I'll tell
thee what, though; being an Arab will be
thornier than you suppose, Harif!


DOCTOR
In all my years as a medical officer I've
never seen anything like it.

ALLENBY
It comes within the jurisdiction of the
Arab Council.

DOCTOR
I'm sorry, sir, under the circumstances I
think I must take over immediately.

ALLENBY
Under any circumstance at all, you must
obey your orders.

DOCTOR
No, sir, I will not.

ALLENBY
Control yourself. Now, go over to the
Town Hall and see what they say.


LAWRENCE
We did what we could in the civic
hospitals.

DOCTOR
But you forgot the Turkish military
hospital.

LAWRENCE
Yes.

DOCTOR
It has six hundred beds. There are about
two thousand Turkish wounded in it. all
of whom are the responsibility of your
precious Arab Council.

LAWRENCE
What's it like?


OFFICER
This is outrageous! Outrageous!
Outrageous!! You filthy little wog!


FEISAL
My friend, Aurens, if I may call him
that. My friend, Aurens. How many men
will claim the right to use that phrase?
How proudly! He longs for the greenness
of his native land; he pines for the
gothic cottages of, eh, Surrey? Is it
not? Already, in imagination he catches
trout and engages in all the activities
of the English gentleman.

ALLENBY
That's me you're describing, sir, not
Colonel Lawrence. You're promoted
Colonel.

LAWRENCE
Yes? What for?

FEISAL
Take the honour, Colonel. Be a little
kind.

ALLENBY
As a Colonel, you'll have a cabin to
yourself on the boat home.

LAWRENCE
Then, thank you.

ALLENBY
Well, then, God speed.

FEISAL
There's nothing further here for a
warrior. We drive bargains. Old men's
work. Young men make wars and the virtues
of war are the virtues of young men;
courage and hope for the future. Then,
old men make the peace. And the vices of
peace are the vices of old men; mistrust
and caution. It must be so. What I owe
you is beyond evaluation. The power-
house, the telephone exchange - these I
concede; the pumping plant I must retain.

ALLENBY
If you retain the pumping-plant, there'll
be no water, sir.

FEISAL
I shall be glad of any technical
assistance.

ALLENBY
In fairness then, you must bring down
your flag.

FEISAL
I shall not bring down my flag, and if
your men attempt it, my men will resist
it.

ALLENBY
Have you any men, sir?

FEISAL
Enough for that. It's the kind of thing
that makes a very ugly incident. I'm sure
you're government does not wish to appear
at the peace conference in the light of
an aggressor.

SOLDIER
I say! It's Lawrence, isn't it? Well, may
I shake you're hand, sir? Just want to be
able to say I'd done it, sir.

LAWRENCE
Haven't we met before?

SOLDIER
Don't think so, sir. Oh, no, sir. I
should have remembered that.


FEISAL
It is widely known the Arab council took
power in my name.

ALLENBY
They have no power, sir. It's illusory.

FEISAL
Illusions can be very powerful;
particularly when they take this form.
The world is delighted at the picture of
Damascus liberated by the Arab army.

ALLENBY
Led, may I remind you, sir, by a British
serving officer.

FEISAL
Ah, yes. But then Aurens is a sword with
two edges. We are equally glad to be rid
of him. Are we not?

ALLENBY
I thought I was a hard man, sir.

FEISAL
You are merely a general. I must be a
king.

BRIGHTON
Excuse me, sir.

ALLENBY
Well?

DRYDEN
Well. It seems we're to have a British
waterworks with an Arab flag on it. Do
you think it was worth it?

ALLENBY
Not my business. Thank God I'm a soldier!

DRYDEN
Yes, sir. So you keep saying.

FEISAL
You, I suspect, are chief architect of
this compromise. What do you think?

DRYDEN
Me? Your Highness? On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.


SOLDIER
Well, sir. Going 'ome.

LAWRENCE
Hmm?

SOLDIER
'Ome, sir.

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?",David Cook,David Cook,2008,[92],1
323,Hollywood's Not America,"[Verse 1]
Born Helena Jane
With a restless soul
She moved west to California
Became a centerfold
But once you change your name
Well the pieces fall
Now she hardly recognizes
Herself at all

[Chorus]
And there's never any rain
When you want it
A hollow little game
And you've won it
Looking for a thrill
But you've done it all

So long
Put your blue jeans back on, girl
Go home
Remember, Hollywood's not America[2x]
Oh Yeah!

[Verse 2]
And everybody here's
From somewhere else
You can make a million dollars
Well, you might lose yourself
And you can take the heat
Will your heart grow cold?
They say acting's just pretending
But even that gets old

[Chorus]
And there's never any rain
When you want it
A hollow little game
And you've won it
Looking for a thrill
But you've done it all

So long

Go home
Remember, Hollywood's not America [2x]

[Verse 3]

What you doing
I know that you
You can be
You can be anything want to be

324,I'm Alive,"[Intro]
We Gonna Make It
(we gon make it y’all)
Ah nah, we’re gonna make it (ah huh yeah)

[Verse 1]
A ménage a Trois would be if I did a song with Nicki
And life would be fancy if I went out with Iggy
Fantasized about Alicia for years, then she got married
I grew up on Whitney, Mary, Mariah Carey
Halle Berry broke my heart when I heard she got married
Was in my early 20s struggling to make money
While stick-up kids loading guns to take it from me
I drove responsibly, could’ve end up a crash dummy
Dreams are expensive when you ain't got no money
Mama always showed it but hardly said she love me
A pretty black woman with love she used to hug me
The GODS gave their blessing, growing up was a lesson
And chicks fell in love with my unique way of dressing
Top of my class, I ain't the one to be testing
Pour liquor on the graves of the dead, while they resting
The captain of my ship, I'm the reason why I made it
Doing deliveries for Pops, I can say that I hate it
But still I did it, a bigger man I admit it
It toughen me up, while the street was roughen me up
My whole world ended song by David Ruffin was stuff
Growing up in Jamaica Queens, it was rough
I had brawls on the Ave, thank God I ain't get stabbed
Or shot in the head, God bless the dead
‘Cause I know, it could’ve been me instead

[Chorus]
We’re Gonna Make It
(we gon make it y’all)
Oh nah, we’re gonna make it
(we gon make it y’all)
Oh yeah
We’re Gonna Make It
(we gon make it y’all)
Oh no no, we’re gonna make it
(ah huh ah huh)

[Verse 2]
And looking back now I'm grateful to still be alive
And in good health, ain't give a fuck what I had to drive
Just as long as I got to my destination safely
Street niggas raised me, I know how being in a cage be
I knew I was Black on a continent with Whites
So, everything was black and white like colors on my dice
And growing up in the ghetto, where you hardly hear hello
A Moor in Venice, a modern-day Othello
My girl at the time was Keisha, a black goddess
Then ‘Toya told to me soften up, I was the hardest
But way before then, I had dreams of being an artist
When I heard Kool G Rap mention Donald Goines
The way how he rapped was fast like Jesse Owens
Had clothes on layaway for months, we were owing
Cookies Department Store, some clothes needed sewing
A single parent, and an immigrant, it's apparent
I was blessed with a God parent, ain't hard of hearing
So, I paid heed to what she was saying (uh huh)
Mama made miracles and spent her whole nights praying
That we live to see tomorrow, after supper we was up for
Hours watching TV, then I was introduced to
The streets way of living, mad friends went to prison
And others went to college, I earned hard-knock knowledge
Experience is the best teacher, nice to meet ya
And how you gonna love a nigga that beats ya
Ya low self-esteem need to go Ma
And to appreciate life drama needs to occur
Little girl, you remind me of Afeni Shakur
When Grandma died, I broke down and started to weep
Just like I did when Sal got murdered in the streets
I was young, thuggin’, reality I was buggin’
You couldn't tell me nothin’, I believed I was somethin’
The sound of my siblings snoring, it was morning
And Keisha had a big ole butt, I was yawning
Reminiscing on the past ya heard (ah huh)
I was a tad-bit conceited… smashin’ birds
What is life though, if you ain't free?
My crew rolling out with surf boards on the roof of their cars
And what do we do, we do it for the love of the GODS
Hail Mary in my darkest hours, got Noah powers
Within the ark, I was protected from bullet showers
(Zangba)

[Chorus]
We’re Gonna Make It
(we gon make it y’all)
Oh nah, we’re gonna make it
(we gon make it y’all)
Oh yeah
We’re Gonna Make It
(we gon make it y’all)
Oh no no, we’re gonna make it",Zangba,David Cook,2008,[99],1

I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feeling like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place

And I feel awkward as I should

Since I thought you and me
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home

[Verse 1]
Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed

[Chorus]
And now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl

Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it, he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her
The coach said, ""Hey, son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?""
And Daddy said, ""You'll lose your free ride to college
Boy, you better tell her goodbye""

But now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American

And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, ""Be honest, tell me what you want""
And he said, ""Honey, you oughta know

You hold me right here right now

Never have you seen in your lifetime
A more divine southern rapper with a swag like mine
Facin' all kinda time, but smile like I'm fine
Brag with such passion and shine without tryin'
Believe me, pain's a small thang to a giant
I was born without a dime, out the gutter, I climbed
Spoke my mind and didn't stutter one time
Ali say, ""Even the greatest gotta suffer sometime""
So I huff and puff, rhymes, lyrics so sick wit it
Set the standard in Atlanta, how to get-get-get it
So you up-and-coming rappers wanna diss, just kill it
I'm officially the realest, point blank, period
Whether I still live in the hood or just visit
Whatever you can do in the hood, I done did it
That's why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still his city long as TIP livin', nigga

You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm sure to be in jail until 2027
Rather see me in the cell instead of this new McLaren
God will take you through Hell just to get you to Heaven
So even though it's heavy, the load I will carry
Grin and still bear it, win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Life can change your directions, even when you ain't planned it
All you can do is handle, worst thing you can do is panic
Use it to your advantage, avoid insanity, manage to conquer
Every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning illogical, losing's still far from optional, and
Yeah, they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But when life throw punches, block and counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside mi casa too long, I did a song
To make it known that the King lives on, pimpin'

[Verse 3]
Even in solitude, there's still no hotter dude
I show you how to do what you do, you ain't gotta clue
All you do is follow dude, sound like a lotta dudes
I'll weather whatever storm, make it out without a bruise
I understand why, now, with my hands tied
They take shots, cause if I'm out there it's a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served, nigga, no shit
Guess it was understood, for me, it was over-with
But I don't quit, if you ain't noticed yet
They couldn't wait to say, ""Goodnight, shawty""
So they could try to rhyme, act and look like shawty
Go get a beat from Toomp and make a hook like shawty
Before ya know it I'm back, what it look like, shawty?
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here
Yeah, and I hope the picture painted clear
If your heart filled with faith, then you can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin'?
Easy, let go and let God deal with it

And a small town Southern man

Fell in love with a small town woman
And they married up and settled down

First there came four pretty daughters
For this small town Southern man
Then a few years later came another

Seven people living all together
In a house built with his own hands
Little words with love and understanding

And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman

He said his greatest contribution

Callous hands told the story

I guess you could say I'm one of those girls
Who's always been with one of those guys
You know the type
Like right now, he sleeps while I write
But it's better than crying

From loving a man who always makes it clear

But not tonight
Cause come the morning light, oh

344,We Made It,"[Intro: Chester Bennington]
Together we made it
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
See, a nigga survived the worst, but my life is glorious
Better know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness
Now call a nigga Morpheus
As force securin' the win, better believe I'm so notorious
You know that I've been 'bout my bread
Even though we rappin' now
And yes, we used to live on the strip
Even though a nigga higher level trappin' now
Superceded every one of my little struggles and
Failure has never ever been an option (trust)
A nigga paper long like rush hour traffic
And I'm about to take the hood shoppin'; get it!

[Hook: Chester Bennington + (Busta Rhymes)]
Together we made it (you see we did it, niggas!)
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
(C'mon!) Forever we waited (ha ha!)
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road (to the riches)
On the road (to the ghetto)
On the road (from the projects to this bangin' instrumental)
On the road (ride with me!)
On the road (we come to get it)
On the road (yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
When it all got started we were steadily just gettin' rejected
It seemed like nothin' we could do would ever get us respected
At best we were stressed
At the worst they probably said we're pathetic
Had all the pieces to that puzzle, just the way to connect it
I was fightin' through every rhyme, tightenin' up every line
Never restin' the question if I was out of my mind
It finally came time to do it or let it die
So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride
Sing it, yeah!

[Hook: Chester Bennington + (Busta Rhymes)]
Together we made it (you see we did it, niggas!)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Look, in case you misunderstand exactly what I'm buildin'
Shit that I can leave for my children's children's children's children
Now on my wake-up I smile to see how far I've come
Fightin' for sales on a strip to I gained the hustle from
From nights in jail on a bench usin' my muscles, son
To countin' money like Dre and Jimmy and Russell was
But now I live when I dream, you see we finally did it
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you get it
Sing it!

348,Laughed Until We Cried,"[Verse 1]
Goin' through my closet the other day
I found an old yearbook, flipped right to the page
Of that senior trip
Down there on that Panama strip
We all started yellin' when we smelled the beach
Couldn't wait to try our fake IDs
We only had a few days
And a whole lot of memories to make

[Chorus]
Oh, man, we were livin'
Didn't waste one minute
We talked and drank and danced and said goodbye
We laughed until we cried

[Verse 2]
This past year my family
Was sittin' cross-legged 'round the Christmas tree
Listenin' to granddad
We all knew it'd probably be his last
He was crackin' jokes and we were takin' turns
Tellin' stories 'bout fishin' or lessons learned
Out on the porch with him
We all felt like kids again

[Chorus]
Oh, man, we were livin
Sittin' there reminiscin'
We sang and talked and traveled back in time
We laughed until we cried

[Bridge]
It's like the best days under the sun
Every emotion rolled into one
A little of this, a little of that
Kinda happy, kinda sad

[Verse 3]
Just the other night the baby was cryin'
So I got out of bed rocked her awhile
And I held her tight
And I told her it would be all right
And my mind went back to a few years ago
When we tried so long, we almost gave up hope
And I remember you
Comin' in and tellin me the news

[Outro]
Oh, man, we were livin'
Goin' crazy in the kitchen
We danced and screamed and held each other tight

And I'm trying to pretend

I owned alone this memory
Maybe I should awake instead
But I'm on my way to go back inside my head

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and try to hide
But wake when these dreams collide

[Verse 2]
So I’ll put this on repeat
And I'll make up what comes next
Now I lay here daydreaming on your chest

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and try to hide
But wake when these dreams collide

But it all breaks down
If I keep on wasting all my time
All alone in my head
Wish I never thought about it in the end

Yeah! Ugh! a fresh cool young Lu'
Trying to cash his microphone check, 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype, but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung? You?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You! The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you—you come too
And then it hit me—standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung ""Blue""

Down through the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid and (Pyoom!)
Out through China, nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)
Now, that's important to say
'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade...-uh
We want it to braid
Meaning, we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his cage...-uh
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Ugh)
They want everything back (Back) that they've paid

So, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&Ms are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased
And then, they all take the stage and start performing for me

A little head in the truck
If her tongue game good, I'ma let her come up
When the sun goes down, I'll be back in the town
Stash box down, put the magnum down

Waitin on it like... three, two, one - yeah right now

When we leave this club, I'm take you were I live
Do me before I get her

Baby girl got a thang for me

Told shawty don't do it, but she already did it
I'm all on her back, when she move like that
You can find me where every she at, Like that

If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I've been looking for

I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed

Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again

How many really know what love is?
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it?
That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
And you're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I've been looking for

When gun shots just watch us,run quickly

From your lips and back up to your eyes
My hands on your hips when we grind
I'm fantasizin' 'bout what I'm gon' do to you
Got me fiendin' for her love, can't lie
Man, you should see how she got me
Spendin' all this time with her
And I couldn't leave her if I wanted to
Her love turns men into fools
Tell me what a man is to do

Whenever we up in this bed
And my fingers all in your hair
I wonder if you feel me watchin' you
'Cause I can't go a night without your lovin'
And got me lookin' at this phone
Every time it rings, I hope it's you, girl
Got me bracin' for your love
And I've fallen for you, I can't lie
I just wanna be with you
And, yes, she got me there, I said it
Somebody call the paramedics

These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last

These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man

He must have let us all out to play
And turned his back
And all God’s children
Crept out the back door
And its hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging onto hope
When there is no hope to speak of

This is the year of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year

These are the days of the guilty man
The television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there
Is over here
So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much
But I’ll take my chances cause God stopped keeping score
And you’ll cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
‘Cause he has no children
To come back for

365,Shout To The Lord,"                                        PART I

                                  The Early Marx

                     Marx on the History of His Opinions

   This is the preface to Marx's book A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, first published in 1859 - The passage setting forth the materialist conception of history-one of the few general statements of the theory that Marx gave in his middle and later years-is the locus classicus of historical materialism. But the preface is also important as an account by Marx himself of the formative period of Marxism. As such it forms an ap­propriate introduction to the writings of 1837-1846 gathered here in Part I. The ""criticism of post-Hegelian philosophy"" which he mentions in the third-to-last paragraph is a reference to his work. The German Ideology, written jointly with Engels.

* * * I am omitting a general introduction which I had jotted down because on closer reflection any anticipation of results still to be proved appears to me to be disturbing, and the reader who on the whole desires to follow me must be resolved to ascend from the particular to the general. A few indications concerning the course of my own politico-economic studies may, on the other hand, appear in place here. I was taking up law, which discipline, however, I only pursued as a subordinate subject along with philosophy and history. In the year 1842-44, as editor of the Rheinische Zeitung1, I experienced for the first time the embarrassment of having to take part in discussions on so-called material interests. The proceedings of the Rhenish Landtag on thefts of wood and parcelling of landed property, the official polemic which Herr von Schaper, then Oberprasident of the Rhine Province, opened against the Rheinische Zeitung on the conditions of the Moselle peasantry, and finally debates on free trade and protective tariffs provided the first occasions 'for occupying myself with economic questions. On the other hand, at that time when the good will "" to go further"" greatly outweighed knowledge of the subject, a philosophically weakly tinged echo of French socialism and communism made itself audible in the Rheinische Zeitung. I declared myself against this amateurism, but frankly confessed at the same time in a controversy with the  Allgemeine Augsburger Zeitung2 that my previous studies did not permit me even to venture any judgement on the content of the French tendencies. Instead, I eagerly seized on the illusion of the managers of the Rheinische Zeitung, who thought that by a weaker attitude on the part of the paper they could secure a remission of the death sentence passed upon it, to withdraw from the public stage into the study.

   The first work which I undertook for a solution of the doubts which assailed me was a critical review of the Hegelian philosophy of right, a work the introduction to which appeared in 1844 in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher3 published in Paris. My investigation led to the result that legal relations as well as forms of state are to be grasped neither from themselves nor from the so-called general development of the human mind, but rather have their roots in the material conditions of life, the sum total of which Hegel, following the example of the Englishmen and Frenchmen of the eighteenth century, combines under the name of ""civil society,"" that, however, the anatomy of civil society is to be sought in political economy. The investigation of the latter, which I began in Paris, I continued in Brussels, whither I had emigrated in consequence of an expulsion order of M. Guizot. The general result at which I arrived and which, once won, served as a guiding thread for my studies, can be briefly formulated as follows: In the social production of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will, relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material productive forces. The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production, or-what is but a legal expression for the same thing-with the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an epoch of social revolution with the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed. In considering such transformations a distinction should always be made between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, aesthetic or philosophic-in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as our opinion of an individual is not based on what he thinks of himself, so can we not judge of such a period of transformation by its own consciousness; on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained rather from the contradictions of material life, from the existing conflict between the social productive forces and the relations of production. No social order ever perishes before all the productive forces for which there is room in it have developed; and new, higher relations of production never appear before the material conditions of their existence have matured in the womb of the old society itself. Therefore mankind always sets itself only such tasks as it can solve; since, looking at the matter more closely, it will always be found that the task itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution already exist or are at least in the process of formation. In broad outlines Asiatic, ancient, feudal, and modem bourgeois modes of production can be designated as progressive epochs in the economic formation of society. The bourgeois relations of production ar,e the last antagonistic form of the social process of production-antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonism, but of one arising from the social conditions of life of the individuals; at the same time the productive forces developing in the womb of bourgeois society create the material conditions for the solution of that antagonism. This social formation brings, therefore, the prehistory of human society to a close.

   Frederick Engels, with whom, since the appearance of his brilliant sketch on the criticism of the economic categories ( in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher), I maintained a constant exchange of ideas by correspondence, had by another road (compare his The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844) arrived at the same result as I, and when in the spring of 1845 he also settled in Brussels, we resolved to work out in common the opposition of our view to the ideological view of German philosophy, in fact, to settle accounts with our erstwhile philosophical conscience. The resolve was carried out in the form of a criticism of post-Hegelian philosophy. The manuscript, two large octavo volumes, had long reached its place of publication in Westphalia when we received the news that altered circumstances did not allow of its being printed. We abandoned the manuscript to the gnawing criticism of the mice all the more willingly as we had achieved our main purpose-self-clarification. Of the scattered works in which we put our views before the public at that time, now from one aspect, now from another, I will mention only the Manifesto of the Communist Party, jointly written by Engels and myself, and Discours sur le libre échange published by me. The decisive points of our view were first scientifically, although only polemically, indicated in my work published in 1847 and directed against Proudhon : Misere de la Philosophie, etc. A dissertation written in German on Wage Labour, in which I put together my lectures on this subject delivered in the Brussels German Workers' Society, was interrupted, while being printed, by the February Revolution and my consequent forcible removal from Belgium.

   The editing of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung in 1848 and 1849, and the subsequent events, interrupted my economic studies which could only be resumed in the year 1850 in London. The enormous material for the history of political economy which is accumulated in the British Museum, the favourable vantage point afforded by London for the observation of bourgeois society, and finally the new stage of development upon which the latter appeared to have entered with the discovery of gold in California and Australia, determined me to begin afresh from the very beginning and to work through the new material critically. These studies led partly of themselves into apparently quite remote subjects on which I had to dwell for a shorter or longer period. Especially, however, was the time at my disposal curtailed by the imperative necessity of earning my living. My contributions, during eight years now, to the first English-American newspaper, the New York Tribune, compelled an extraordinary scattering of my studies, since I occupy myself with newspaper correspondence proper only in exceptional cases. However, articles on striking economic events in England and on the Continent constituted so considerable a part of my contributions that I was compelled to make myself familiar with practical details which lie outside the sphere of the actual science of political economy.

   This sketch of the course of my studies in the sphere of political economy is intended only to show that my views, however they may be judged and however little they coincide with the interested prejudices of the ruling classes, are the results of conscientious investigation lasting many years. But at the entrance to science, as at the entrance to hell, the demand must be posted:

                    Ogni vilta convien che qui sia morta.4

                                 Discovering Hegel

                                  KARL MARX

   On November 10, 1837, soon after becoming a student at the University of Berlin, Marx wrote a long letter to his father. It shows that at nineteen he had formed two relationships of great importance: a personal one with Jenny von Westphalen of Trier and an intellectual one with the late philosopher Hegel. The love of Jenny led to marriage, the spell of Hegel to Marxism.

Dear Father,

   There are moments in one's life which are like frontier posts marking the completion of a period but at the same time clearly indicating a new direction.
* * *

   After my arrival in Berlin, I broke off all hitherto existing connections, made visits rarely and unwillingly, and tried to immerse myself in science and art.

   In accordance with my state of mind at the time, lyrical poetry was bound to be my first subject, at l east the most pleasant and immediate one. But owing to my attitude and whole previous development it was purely idealistic. My heaven, my art, became a world beyond, as remote as my love. Everything real became hazy and what is hazy has no definite outlines . All the poems of the first three volumes I sent to Jenny are marked by attacks on our times, diffuse and inchoate expressions of feeling, nothing natural, everything built out of moonshine, complete opposition between what is and what ought to be, rhetorical reflections instead of poetic thoughts, but perhaps also a certain warmth of feeling and striving for poetic fire.
* * *

   Poetry, however, could be and had to be only an accompaniment; I had to study law and above all felt the urge to wrestle with philosophy.
* * *

   From the idealism which, by the way, I had compared and nourished with the idealism of Kant and Fichte, I arrived at the point of seeking the idea in reality itself. If previously the gods had dwelt above the earth, now they became its centre.

   I had read fragments of Hegel's philosophy, the grotesque craggy melody of which did not appeal to me. Once more I wanted to dive into the sea, but with the definite intention of establishing that the nature of the mind is just as necessary, concrete and firmly based as the nature of the body . My aim was no longer to practise tricks of swordsmanship, but to bring genuine pearls into the light of day.

   I wrote a dialogue of about 24 pages: ""Cleanthes, or the Starting Point and Necessary Continuation of Philosophy."" Here art and science, which had become completely divorced from each other, were to some extent united, and like a vigorous traveller I set a bout the task itself, a philosophical-dialectical account of divinity, as it manifests itself as the idea-in-itself, as religion, as nature, and as history. My last proposition was the beginning of the Hegelian system.
* * *

   For some days my vexation made me quite incapable of thinking; I ran about madly in the garden by the dirty water of the Spree, which ""washes souls and dilutes the tea .""l I even joined my landlord in a hunting excursion, rushed off to Berlin and wanted to embrace every street-corner loafer.

                                             * * *

    Owning to being upset over Jenny's illness and my vain, fruitless intellectual labours, and as the result of nagging annoyance at having had to make an idol of a view that I hated, I became ill, as I have already written to you, dear Father. When I got better I burnt all the poems and outlines of stories, etc., imagining that I could give them up completely, of which so far at any rate I have not given any proofs to the contrary.

    While I was ill I got to know Hegel from beginning to end, together with most of his disciples. Through a n umber of meetings with friends in Stralow I came across a Doctors' Club,2 which includes some university lecturers and my most intimate Berlin friend, Dr. Rutenberg. In controversy h ere, many conflicting views were expressed, and I became ever more firmly bound to the modern world philosophy from which I had thought to escape.
* * *

                                           * * *

                                                                           Your ever loving son,

                                                                                                 Karl


   Please, dear father, excuse my illegible handwriting and bad style; it is almost 4 o'clock, the candle has burnt itself out, and my eyes are dim; a real unrest has taken possession of me, I shall not be able to calm the turbulent spectres until I am with you who are dear to me.

   Please give greetings from me to my sweet, wonderful Jenny. I have read her letter twelve times already, and always discover new delights in it. It is in every respect, including that of style, the most beautiful letter I can imagine being written by a woman.


                                   To Make the World Philosophical

                                                KARL MARX

Marx's doctoral dissertation, ""The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophies of Nature,"" written between 1839 and 1841, is chiefly of interest for the following excerpts arguing that after a great world philosophy-Aristotle's in antiquity and Hegel's now-the system's disciples feel an imperious urge to make the world ""philosophical."" What this would mean Marx hinted in the dissertation's foreword, where he saluted Prometheus' revolt against the gods as a proclamation of ""human self-consciousness as the highest divinity."" To transform the world in the image of Hegelian philosophy would mean to make of man in existential reality the divinity that, as Marx saw it, Hegel had a1ready made him in thought. ""

   The last two paragraphs of the selection are taken from Marx's preparatory material for the dissertation, ""Notebooks on Epicurean Philosophy.""

                                               * * *

   Also in relation to Hegel it is mere ignorance on the part of his pupils, when they explain one or the other determination of his system by his desire for accommodation and the like, hence, in one word, explain it in terms of morality. They forget that only a short time ago they were enthusiastic about all his idiosyncrasies [Einseitigkeiten] , as can be clearly demonstrated from their writings.

   If they were really so affected by the ready-made science they acquired that they gave themselves up to it in naive uncritical trust, then how unscrupulous is their attempt to reproach the Master for a hidden intention behind his insight! The Master, to whom the science was not something received, but something in the process of becoming, to whose uttermost periphery his own intellectual heart's blood was pulsating! On the contrary, they rendered themselves suspect of not having been serious before. And now they oppose their own former condition, and ascribe it to Hegel, forgetting however that his relation to his system was immediate, substantial, while theirs is only a reflected one.

                                           * * *

   It is a psychological law that the theoretical mind, once liberated in itself, turns into practical energy, and, leaving the shadowy empire of Amenthes as will, turns itself against the reality of the world existing without it. ( From a philosophical point of view, however, it is important to specify these aspects better, since from the specific manner of this turn we can reason back towards the immanent determination and the universal historic character of a philosophy. We see here, as it were, its curriculum vitae 1 narrowed down to its subjective point.) But the  practice of philosophy is itself theoretical. It's the critique that measures the individual existence by the essence, the particular reality by the Idea. But this immediate realization of philosophy is in its deepest essence afflicted with con­ tradictions, and this its essence takes form in the appearance and imprints its seal upon it.

   When philosophy turns itself as will against the world of appearance, then the system is lowered to an abstract totality, that is, it has become one aspect of the world which opposes another one. Its relationship to the world is that of reflection. Inspired by the urge to realise itself, it enters into tension against the other. The inner self-contentment and completeness has been broken. What was inner light has become consuming flame turning outwards. The result is that as the world becomes philosophical, philosophy also becomes worldly, that its realisation is also its loss, that what it struggles against on the outside is its own inner deficiency, that in the very struggle it falls precisely into those defects which it fights as defects in the opposite camp, and that it can only overcome these defects by falling into them. That which opposes it and that which it fights is always the same as itself, only with factors inverted.

   This is the one side, when we consider this matter purely objec­ tively as immediate realisation of philosophy. However, it has also a subjective; aspect, which is merely another form of it. This is the relationship of the philosophical system which is realised to its intel-­ lectual carriers, to the individual self-consciousnesses in which its progress appears. This relationship results in what confronts the world in the realisation of philosophy itself, namely, in the fact that these individual self-consciousnesses always carry a double-edged demand, one edge turned against the world, the other against philosophy itself. Indeed, what in the thing itself appears as a relationship inverted in itself, appears in these self-consciousnesses as a double one, a demand and an action contradicting each other.

   Their liberation of the world from the philosophy that held them in fetters as a particular system. * * *

                                             * * *

   As in the history of philosophy there are nodal points which raise philosophy in itself to concretion, apprehend abstract principles in a totality, and thus break off the rectilinear process, so also there are moments when philosophy turns its eyes to the external world, and no longer apprehends it, but, as a practical person, weaves, as it were, intrigues with the world, emerges from the transparent kingdom of Amenthes and throws itself on the breast of the worldly Siren. That is the carnival of philosophy, whether it disguises itself as a dog like the Cynic, in priestly vestments like the Alexandrian, or in fragrant spring array like the Epicurean. It is essential that philosophy should then wear character masks. As Deucalion, according to the legend, cast stones behind him in creating human beings, so philosophy casts its regard behind it (the bones of its mother are luminous eyes) when its heart is set on creating a world; but as Prometheus, having stolen fire from heaven, begins to build houses and to settle upon the earth, so philosophy, expanded to be the whole world, turns against the world of appearance. The same now with the philosophy of Hegel.

   While philosophy has sealed itself off to form a consummate, total world, the determination of this totality is conditioned by the general development of philosophy, just as that development is the condition of the form in which philosophy turns into a practical relationship towards reality; thus the totality of the world in general is divided within itself, and this division is carried to the extreme, for spiritual existence has been freed, has been enriched to universality, the heart-beat has become in itself the differentiation in the concrete form which is the whole organism. The division of the world is total only when its aspects are totalities. The world confronting a philosophy total in itself is therefore a world torn apart. This philosophy's activity therefore also appears torn apart and contradictory; its objective universality is turned back into the subjective forms of individual consciousness in which it has life. But one must not let oneself be misled by this storm which follows a great philosophy, a world philosophy. Ordinary harps play under any fingers, Aeolian harps only when struck by the storm.

                                    For a Ruthless Criticism

                                      Of  Everything Existing

                                     KARL MARX

   The watchword of the young Karl Marx, as of his Young Hegelian associates generally, was Kritik-criticism. In this early article, printed in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher in 1844 in the form of a letter to Arnold Ruge, Marx elaborated the idea of criticism into a program of this journal, of which he and Ruge were editors. His future strictures on utopian socialist plans, in the Communist Manifesto and other later writings, were prefigured in the dismissal here of the communist utopias of writers like Etienne Cabet as a ""dogmatic abstraction."" The Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher (German-French Annals) came out in Paris in February, 1844, in the German language. Only one double issue of the journal was published.

     The translation was made by Dr. Ronald Rogowski for this edition.

                                                                        M. to R.

                                                                         Kreuznach

                                                                        September, 1843

    I am delighted that you are resolved and turn your thoughts from backward glances at the past toward a new undertaking. In Paris, then, the old university of philosophy (absit omen!) and the new capital of the new world. What is necessary will arrange itself. I do not doubt, therefore, that all obstacles-whose importance I do not fail to recognize-will be removed.

    The undertaking may succeed, however, or not; in any case I will be in Paris at the end of this month, since the air here makes one servile and I see no room at all in Germany for free activity.

   In Germany, everything is being forcibly repressed, a true anarchy of the spirit has burst out, stupidity itself reigns supreme, and Zurich obeys commands from Berlin; hence it becomes ever clearer that a new' gathering point must be sought for the really thinking and independent minds. I am convinced that our plan would meet a real need, and real needs must surely also be able to find real fulfillment. I therefore have no doubts about the enterprise if only we undertake it seriously.

   The inner difficulties seem to be almost greater than the external obstacles. For even if there is no doubt about the ""whence;"" all the more confusion reigns about the ""whither."" Apart from the general anarchy which has erupted among the reformers, each is compelled to confess to himself that he has no clear conception of what the future should be. That, however, is just the advantage of the new trend: that we do not attempt dogmatically to prefigure the future, but want to find the new world only through criticism of the old. Up to now the philosophers had the solution of all riddles lying in their lectern, and the stupid uninitiated world had only to open its jaws to let the roast partridges of absolute science fly into its mouth. Now philosophy has become worldly, and the most incontrovertible evidence of this is that the philosophical consciousness has been drawn, not only externally but also internally, into the stress of battle. But if the designing of the future and the proclamation of ready-made solutions for all time is not our affair, then we realize all the more clearly what we have to accomplish in the present-I am speaking of a ruthless criticism of everything existing, ruthless in two senses : The criticism must not be afraid of its own conclusions, nor of conflict with the powers that be.

   I am therefore not in favor of setting up any dogmatic flag. On the contrary, we must try to help the dogmatics to clarify to themselves the meaning of their own positions. Thus communism, to be specific, is a dogmatic abstraction. I do not have in mind here some imaginary, possible communism, but actually existing communism in the form preached by Cabet, Dezamy,1 Weitling,2 etc. This communism is only a special manifestation of the humanistic principle which is still infected by its opposite-private being. Elimina­tion of private property is therefore by no means identical with this communism, and it is not accidental but quite inevitable that communism has seen other socialist teachings arise in opposition to it, such as the teachings of Fourier, Proudhon, etc., because it is itself only a special, one-sided realization of the socialist principle.

    And the socialist principle itself represents, on the whole, only one side, affecting the reality of the true human essence. We have to concern ourselves just as much with the other side, the theoretical existence of man, in other words to make religion, science, etc., the objects of our criticism. Moreover, we want to have an effect on our contemporaries, and specifically on our German contemporaries. The question is, how is this to be approached? Two circumstances cannot be denied. First, religion, and second, politics, arouse predominant interest in contemporary Germany. We must take these two subjects, however they are, for a starting-point, and not set up against them some ready-made system such as the Voyage en Icarie.3  Reason has always existed, only not always in reasonable form .

   The critic can therefore start out by taking any form of theoretical and practical consciousness and develop from the unique forms of existing reality the true reality as its norm and final goal. Now so far as real life is concerned, precisely the political state in all its modern forms contains, even where it is not yet consciously imbued with socialist demands, the demands of reason. Nor does the state stop at that. The state everywhere presupposes that reason has been realized. But in just this way it everywhere comes into contradiction between its ideal mission and its real preconditions.

    çµOut of this conflict of the political state with itself, therefore, one can develop social truth. Just as religion is the catalogue of the theoretical struggles of mankind, so the political state is the catalogue of its practical struggles. The political state thus expresses, within the confines of its form sub specie rei publicae,4 all social struggles, needs, truths. Thus it is not at all beneath the hauteur des principles to make the most specific political question-e.g., the difference between the corporative5 and the representative system-the object of criticism. For this question only expresses in a political way the difference between the rule of man and the rule of private property. The critic therefore not only can but must go into these political questions (which the crass kind of socialists consider beneath anyone's dignity) . By showing the superiority of the representative system over the corporative system, the critic affects the practical interests of a large party. By elevating the representative system from its political form to its general form and by bringing out the true significance underlying this system, the critic at the same time forces this party to go beyond its own confines, since its victory is at the same time its loss.

   Nothing prevents us, then, from tying our criticism to the criticism of politics and to a definite party position in politics, and hence from identifying our criticism with real struggles. Then we shall confront the world not as doctrinaires with a new principle: ""Here is the truth, bow down before it!"" We develop new principles to the world out of its own principles. We do not say to the world: ""Stop fighting; your struggle is of no account. We want to shout the true slogan of the struggle at you."" We only show the world what it is fighting for, and consciousness is something that the world must acquire, like it or not.

   The reform of consciousness consists only in enabling the world to clarify its consciousness, in waking it from its dream about itself, in explaining to it the meaning of its own actions. Our whole task can consist only in putting religious and political questions into self-conscious human form-as is also the case in Feuerbach's criticism of religion.

   Our motto must therefore be: Reform of consciousness not through dogmas, but through analyzing the mystical consciousness, the consciousness which is unclear to itself, whether it appears in religious or political form. Then it will transpire that the world has long been dreaming of something that it can acquire if only it becomes conscious of it. It will transpire that it is not a matter of drawing a great dividing line between past and future, but of carrying out the thoughts of the past. And finally, it will transpire that mankind begins no new work, but consciously accomplishes its old work.

   So, we can express the trend of our journal in one word: the work of our time to clarify to itself (critical philosophy) the meaning of its own struggle and its own desires. This is work for the world and for us. It can only be the work of joint forces. It is a matter of confession, no more. To have its sins forgiven mankind has only to declare them to be what they really are.

   In line with his program of effecting ""a ruthless criticism of everything existing,"" Marx during 1843 took up the criticism of politics, He set a bout this by working on a commentary on Hegel's treatise on the state, * To the Hegelian political philosophy (which he called, following Feuerbach, ""speculative philosophy"") he applied the method of ""transformational criticism"" that Feuerbach had applied to the Hegelian philosophy of religion,* * *

   Although the work was left incomplete and unpublished, it was, as Marx later said (see p. 4, above), a milestone on his road to historical materialism: it led him to the view that instead of the state being the basis of ""civil society,"" as Hegel held, civil or bourgeois society is the basis of the state.

   Despite its incompleteness-the extant part of the commentary starts with paragraph 261 of Hegel's treatise and deals only with selected further sections up to paragraph 308-this work remains of interest as Marx's most extensive single piece of purely political writing, although his standpoint at the time of writing was no more than proto-Marxist.

                              The State and Civil Society1

                                              * * *

 The idea is made the subject and the actual relation of family and civil society to the state is conceived as its internal imaginary activity. Family and civil society are the premises of the state; they are the genuinely active elements, but in speculative philosophy things are inverted. When the idea is made the subject, however, the real subjects, namely, civil society, family, ""circumstances, caprice, etc.,"" become unreal objective elements of the idea with a changed significance.

                                             * * *

 Rationally interpreted, Hegel's propositions would mean only this : The family and civil society are parts of the state. The material of the state is distributed amongst them ""by circumstances, cap­ rice and the individual's own choice of vocation."" The citizens of the state are members of families and members of civil society.

   ""The actual idea, mind, divides itself into the two ideal spheres of its concept, family and civil society, that is, its finite phase""-­ hence, the division of the state into family and civil society is ideal, i.e., necessary as part of the essence of the state. Family and civil society are actual components of the state, actual spiritual existences of the will; they are modes of existence of the state. Family and civil society constitute themselves as the state. They are the driving force. According to Hegel, they are, on the contrary, produced by the actual idea. It is not the course of their own life which unites them in the state; on the contrary, it is the idea which in the course of its life has separated them off from itself. Indeed, they are the finiteness of this idea. They owe their presence to another mind than their own. They are entities determined by a third party, not self-determined entities. Accordingly, they are also defined as ""finiteness,"" as the ""actual idea's"" own finiteness. The purpose of their being is not this being itself; rather, the idea separates these presuppositions off from itself ""so as to emerge from their ideality as explicitly infinite actual mind."" That is to say, there can be no political state without the natural basis of the family and the artificial basis of civil society; they are for it a conditio sine qua non. But the condition is postulated as the conditioned, the determinant as the determined, the producing factor as the product of its product. The actual idea only degrades itself into the ""finiteness"" of the family and civil society so as by transcending them to enjoy and bring forth its infinity. ""Accordingly"" (in order to achieve its purpose), it ""assigns to these spheres the material of this, its finite actuality"" (this? which? these spheres are indeed its ""finite actuality,"" its ""material"" ), ""individuals as a multitude"" (""the individuals, the multitude"" are here the material of the state; ""the state consists of them""; this composition of the state is here expressed as an act of the idea, as an ""allocation"" which it undertakes with its own material The fact is that the state issues from the multitude in their existence as members of families and as members of civil society. Speculative philosophy expresses this fact as the idea's deed, not as the idea of the multitude, but as the deed of a subjective idea different from the fact itself), ""in such a way that with regard to the individual this assignment"" (previously the discussion was only about the assignment of individuals to the spheres of the family and civil society) ""appears mediated by circumstances, caprice, etc."" Empirical actuality is thus accepted as it is. It is also expressed as rational, but it is not rational on account of its own reason, but because the empirical fact in its empirical existence has a different significance from it itself. The fact which is taken as a point of departure is not conceived as such, but as a mystical result. The actual becomes a phenomenon, but the idea has no other content than this phenomenon. Nor has the idea any other purpose than the logical one of being ""explicitly infinite actual mind."" The entire mystery of the philosophy of law and of Hegel's philosophy as a whole is set out in this paragraph.

                                               * * *

   If Hegel had set out from real subjects as the bases of the state he would not have found it necessary to transform the state in a mystical fashion into a subject. ""In its truth, however,"" says Hegel, ""subjectivity exists only as subject, personality only as person."" This too is a piece of mystification. Subjectivity is a characteristic of the subject, personality a characteristic of the person. Instead of conceiving them as predicates of their subjects. Hegel gives the predicates an independent existence and subsequently transforms them in a mystical fashion into their subjects.

   The existence of predicates is the subject, so that the subject is the existence of subjectivity, etc.; Hegel transforms the predicates, the objects, into independent entities, but divorced from their actual independence, their subject. Subsequently the actual subject appears as a result, whereas one must start from the actual subject and look at its objectification. The mystical substance, therefore, becomes the actual subject, and the real subject appears as something else, as an element of the mystical substance. Precisely because Hegel starts from the predicates of the general description instead of from the real ens (lnr0XEtltn'ov, subject), and since, nevertheless, there has to be a bearer of these qualities, the mystical idea becomes this bearer. The dualism consists in the fact that Hegel does not look upon the general as being the actual nature of the actual finite, i.e., of what exists and is determinate, or upon the actual ens as the true subject of the infinite.

                                       Sovereignty

   So in this case sovereignty, the essential feature of the state, is treated to begin with as an independent entity, is objectified. Then, of course, this objective entity has to become a subject again. This subject then appears, however, as a self-incarnation of sovereignty; whereas sovereignty is nothing but the objectifed mind of the subjects of the state.

                                               * * *

   As if the actual state were not the people. The state is an abstraction. The people alone is what is concrete. And it is remarkable that Hegel, who without hesitation attributes a living quality such as sovereignty to the abstraction, attributes it only with hesitation and reservations to something concrete. ""The usual sense, however, in which men have recently begun to speak of the sovereignty of the people is in opposition to the sovereignty existing in the monarch. In this antithesis the sovereignty of the people is one of those confused notions which are rooted in the wild idea of the people.""

   The ""confused notions"" and the ""wild idea"" are here exclusively Hegel's. To be sure, if sovereignty exists in the monarch, then it is foolish to speak of an antithetical sovereignty in the people; for it is implied in the concept of sovereignty that sovereignty can­ not have a double existence, still less one which is contradictory. However:

   1) This is just the question: Is not that sovereignty which is claimed by the monarch an illusion? Sovereignty of the monarch or sovereignty of the people-that is the question.

   2) One can also speak of a sovereignty of the people in opposi tion to the sovereignty existing in the monarch. But then it is not a question of one and the same sovereignty which has arisen on two sides, but two entirely contradictory concepts of sovereignty, the one a sovereignty such as can come to exist in a monarch, the other such as can come to exist only in a people. It is the same with the question: ""Is God sovereign, or is man?"" One of the two is an untruth, even if an existing untruth.

   ""Taken without its monarch and the articulation of the whole which is necessarily and directly associated with the monarch, the people .is that formless mass which is no longer a state. It no longer possesses any of the atrributes which are to be found only in an internally organized whole-sovereignty, government, courts of law, the administration, estates of the realm, etc. With the appearance in a nation of such factors, which relate to organisation, to the life of the state, a people ceases to be that indeterminate abstraction, which, as a purely general notion, is called the nation."" All this is a tautology. If a people has a monarch and the structure that neces- sarily and directly goes with a monarch, i.e., if it is structured as a monarchy, then indeed, taken out of this structure, it is a formless mass and a purely general notion. ""If by sovereignty of the people is understood a republican form of government and, more specifically, democracy...then...there can be no further discussion of such a notion in face of the developed idea."" That is indeed right, if one has only ""such a notion"" and not a ""developed idea"" of democracy.

                                        Democracy

   Democracy is the truth of monarchy; monarchy is not the truth of democracy. Monarchy is necessarily democracy inconsistent with itself; the monarchical element is not an inconsistency in democracy. Monarchy cannot be understood in its own terms; democracy can. In democracy none of the elements attains a significance other than what is proper to it. Each is in actual fact only an element of the whole demos [people]. In monarchy one part determines the character of the whole. The entire constitution has to adapt itself to this fixed point. Democracy is the genus Constitution. Monarchy is one species, and a poor one at that. Democracy is content and form. Monarchy is supposed to be only a form, but it falsifies the content.

   In monarchy the whole, the people, is subsumed under one of its particular modes of being, the political constitution. In democracy the constitution itself appears only as one determination, that is, the self-determination of the people. In monarchy we have the people of the constitution; in democracy the constitution of the people. Democracy is the solved riddle of all constitutions. Here, not merely implicitly and in essence but existing in reality, the con-­ stitution is constantly brought back to its actual basis, the actual human being, the actual people, and established as the people's own work. The constitution appears as what it is, a free product of man. It could be said that in a certain respect this applies also to consti-­ tutional monarchy; but the specific distinguishing feature of democracy is that here the constitution as such forms only one element in the life of the people-that it is not the political constitution by itself which forms the state.

   Hegel starts from the state and makes man the subjectified state; democracy starts from man and makes the state objectified man. Just as it is not religion which creates man but man who creates religion, so it is not the constitution which creates the people but the people which creates the constitution. In a certain respect the relation of democracy to all other forms of state is like the relation of Christianity to all other religions. Christianity is the religion INSERT TEXT,2the essence of religion-deified man as a particular religion. Similarly, democracy is the essence of all state constitutions-social-­ ised man as a particular state constitution. Democracy stands to the other constitutions as the genus stands to its species; except that here the genus itself appears as an existent, and therefore as one particular species over against the others whose existence does not correspond to their essence. To democracy all other forms of state stand as its Old Testament. Man does not exist for the law but the law for man-it is a human manifestation; whereas in the other forms of state man is a legal manifestation. That is the fundamental distinction of democracy.

   All other state forms are definite, distinct, particular forms of state. In democracy the formal principle is at the same time the material principle. Only democracy, therefore, is the true unity of the general and the particular. In monarchy, for example, and in the republic as a merely particular form of state, political man has his particular mode of being alongside unpolitical man, man as a private individual. Property, contract, marriage, civil society, all appear here (as Hegel shows quite correctly with regard to these abstract state forms, but he thinks that he is expounding the idea of the state) as particular modes of existence alongside the political state, as the content to which the political state is related as organising form; properly speaking, the relation of the political state to this content is merely that of reason, inherently without content, which defines and delimits, which now affirms and now denies. In democracy the political state, which stands alongside this content and distinguishes itself from it, is itself merely a particular content and particular form of existence of the people. In monarchy, for example, this particular, the political constitution, has the significance of the general that dominates and determines everything particular. In democracy the state as particular is merely particular; as general, it is the truly general, i .e., not something determinate in distinction from the other content. The French have recently interpreted this as meaning that in true democracy the political state is annihilated. This is correct insofar as the political state qua political state, as constitution, no longer passes for the whole.

   In all states other than democratic ones the state, the law, the constitution is what rules, without really ruling-i.e., without materially permeating the content of the remaining, non-political spheres. In democracy the constitution, the law, the state itself, insofar as it is a political constitution, is only the self-determination of the people, and a particular content of the people.

    Incidentally, it goes without saying that all forms of state have democracy for their truth and that they are therefore untrue insofar as they are not democracy.

                   Politics: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern

   In the states of antiquity the political state makes up the content of the state to the exclusion of the other spheres. The modern state is a compromise between the political and the unpolitical state.

   In democracy the abstract state has ceased to be the dominant factor. The struggle between monarchy and republic is itself still a struggle within the abstract state. The political republic is democracy within the abstract state form. The abstract state form of democracy is therefore the republic; but here it ceases to be the merely political constitution.

   Property, etc., in short, the entire content of the law and the state, is the same in North America as in Prussia, with few modifications. The republic there is thus a mere state form, as is the monarchy here. The content of the state lies outside these constitutions. Hegel is right, therefore, when he says: The political state is the constitution, i.e., the material state is not political. What obtains here is merely an external identity, a determination of changing forms. Of the various elements of national life, the one most difficult to evolve was the political state, the constitution. It developed as universal reason over against the other spheres, as ulterior to them. The historical task then consisted in its [the constitution's] reassertion, but the particular spheres do not realise that their private nature coincides with the other-worldly nature of the constitution or of the political state, and that the other-worldly existence of the political state is nothing but the affirmation of their own estrangement. Up till now the political constitution has been the religious sphere, the religion of national life, the heaven of its gener­- ality over against the earthy existence of its actuality. The political sphere has been the only state sphere in the state, the only sphere in which the content as well as the form has been species-content, the truly general; but in such a way that at the same time, because this sphere has confronted the others, its content has also become formal and particular. Political life in the modern sense is the scho-­ lasticism of national life. Monarchy is the perfect expression of this estrangement. The republic is the negation of this estrangement within its own sphere. It is obvious that the political constitution as such is brought into being only where the private spheres have won an independent existence. Where trade and landed property are not free and have not yet become independent, the political constitution too does not yet exist. The Middle Ages were the democracy of unfreedom.

   The abstraction of the state as such belongs only to modern times, because the abstraction of private life belongs only to modern times. The abstraction of the political state is a modern product.

   In the Middle Ages there were serfs, feudal estates, merchant and trade guilds, corporations of scholars, etc.: that is to say, in the Middle Ages property, trade, society, man are political; the material content of the state is given by its form; every private sphere has a political character or is a political sphere; that is, politics is a characteristic of the private spheres too. In the Middle Ages the political constitution is the constitution of private property, but only because the constitution of private property is a political constitution. In the Middle Ages the life of the nation and the life of the state are identical. Man is the actual principle of the state-but unfree man. It is thus the democracy of unfreedom-estrangement carried to completion. The abstract reflected antithesis belongs only to the modern world. The Middle Ages are the period of actual dualism; modern times, one of abstract dualism.

   ""We have already noted the stage at which the division of constitutions into democracy, aristocracy and monarchy has been made­ the standpoint, that is, of that unity which is still substantial, which still remains within itself, and has not yet come to its process of infmite differentiation and inner deepening,: at that stage, the element of the final self-determining resolution of the will does not emerge explicitly into its own proper actuality as an immanent factor in the state."" In the spontaneously evolved monarchy, democracy and aristocracy there is as yet no political constitution as distinct from the actual, material state or the other content of the life of the nation. The political state does not yet appear as the form of the material state. Either, as in Greece, the  res publica 3 is the real private affair of the citizens, their real content, and the private individual is a slave; the political state, qua political state, being the true and only content of the life and will of the citizens; or, as in an Asiatic despotism, the political state is nothing but the personal caprice of a single individual; or the political state, like the material state, is a slave. What distinguishes the modern state from these states characterized by the substantial unity between people and state is not, as Hegel would have it, that the various elements of the constitution have been developed into particular actuality, but that the constitution itself has been developed into a particular actuality alongside the actual life of the people­- that the political state has become the constitution of the rest of the state.

                                         * * *

                                  Bureaucracy

   The ""state formalism"" which bureaucracy is, is the ""state as formalism""; and it is as a formalism of this kind that Hegel has described bureaucracy. Since this ""state formalism"" constitutes itself as an actual power and itself becomes its own material content, it goes without saying that the ""bureaucracy"" is a web of practical illusions, or the ""illusion of the state."" The bureaucratic spirit is a jesuitical, theological spirit through and through. The bureaucrats are the jesuits and theologians of the state. The bureaucracy is la republique pretre.

   Since by its very nature the bureaucracy is the ""state as formalism,"" it is this also as regards its purpose. The actual purpose of the state therefore appears to the bureaucracy as an objective hostile to the state. The spirit of the bureaucracy is the ""formal state spirit."" The bureaucracy therefore turns the ""formal state spirit"" or the actual spiritless ness of the state into a categorical imperative. The bureaucracy takes itself to be the ultimate purpose of the state. Because the bureaucracy turns its ""formal"" objectives into its content, it comes into conflict everywhere with ""real"" objectives. It is therefore obliged to pass off the form for the content and the content for the form. State objectives are transformed into objectives of the department, and department objectives into objectives of the state. The bureaucracy is a circle from which no one can escape. Its hierarchy is a hierarchy of knowledge. The top entrusts the under­ standing of detail to the lower levels, whilst the lower levels credit the top with understanding of the general, and so all are mutually deceived.

   The bureaucracy is the imaginary state alongside the real state­ the spiritualism of the state. Each thing has therefore a double meaning, a real and a bureaucratic meaning, just as knowledge (and also the will) is both real and bureaucratic. The really existing, however, is treated in the light of its bureaucratic nature, its other­ worldly, spiritual essence. The bureaucracy has the state, the spiritual essence of society, in its possession, as its private property. The general spirit of the bureaucracy is the secret, the mystery, preserved within itself by the hierarchy and against the outside world by being a closed corporation. Avowed political spirit, as also political­mindedness, therefore appear to the bureaucracy as treason against its mystery. Hence, authority is the basis of its knowledge, and the deification of authority is its conviction. Within the bureaucracy itself, however, spiritualism becomes crass materialism, the materialism of passive obedience, of faith in authority, of the mechanism of fixed and formalistic behaviour, and of fixed principles, views and traditions. In the case of the individual bureaucrat, the state objec­ tive turns into his private objective, into a after higher posts, the making of a career. In the first place, he looks on actual, life as something material, for the spirit of this life has its distinctly separate existence in the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy must therefore proceed to make life as material as possible. Secondly, actual life is material for the bureaucrat himself, i .e., so far as it becomes an object of bureaucratic manipulation; for his spirit is prescribed for him, his aim lies beyond him, and his existence is the existence of the department. The state only continues to exist as various fixed bureaucratic minds, bound together in subordination and passive obedience. Actual knowledge seems devoid of content, just as actual life seems dead; for this imaginary knowledge and this imaginary life are taken for the real thing. The bureaucrat must therefore deal with the actual state jesuitically, whether this jesuitry is conscious or unconscious. However, once its antithesis is knowledge, this jesuitry is like wise bound to achieve self-consciousness and then become deliberate jesuitry.

   Whilst the bureaucracy is on the one hand this crass materialism, it manifests its crass spiritualism in the fact that it wants to do everything, i.e., by making the will the causa prima. For it is purely an active form of existence and receives its content from without and can prove its existence, therefore, only by shaping and restricting this content. For the bureaucrat the world is a mere object to be manipulated by him.

   When Hegel calls the executive the objective aspect of the sovereignty dwelling in the monarch, that is right in the same sense in which the Catholic Church was the real presence of the sovereignty, substance and spirit of the Holy Trinity. In the bureaucracy the identity of state interest and particular private aim is established in such a way that the state interest becomes a particular private aim over against other private aims.

   The abolition of the bureaucracy is only possible by the general interest actually-and not, as with Hegel, merely in thought, in abstraction-becoming the particular interest, which in turn is onlv possible as a result of the particular actually becoming the general interest. Hegel starts from an unreal antithesis and therefore achieves only an imaginary identity which is in truth again a contra- dictory identity. The bureaucracy is just such an identity.

                                On the Jewish Question

                                        KARL MARX

   In this essay, written in the autumn of 1843 and published in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher, Marx pursued his critical aims through a review of two studies on the Jewish question by another Young Hegelian, Bruno Bauer. The criticism of politics is developed in the first part, leading to the conclusion that human emancipation requires the ending of the division between man as an egoistic being in ""civil society"" and man as abstract citizen in the state. In the second part, Marx proceeds to the criticism of economics or commerce, which he equates with ""Judaism."" His concluding call for ""the emancipation of society from Judaism"" (which has been seen on occasion as a manifesto of anti-Semitism) is in fact a call for the emancipation of society from what he here calls ""huckstering,"" or from what he was subsequently to call ""capitalism."" This, however, is not to deny that Marx, although he himself was of Jewish origin, harbored antiJewish attitudes, nor is it to deny that such attitudes found expression in this essay.

                             1. Bruno Bauer, Die Judenfrage1

   The German Jews seek emancipation. What kind of emancipation do they want? Civic, political emancipation.

   Bruno Bauer replies to them: In Germany no one is politically emancipated. We ourselves are not free. How then could we liberate you? You Jews are egoists if you demand for yourselves, as Jews, a special emancipation. You should work, as Germans, for the political emancipation of Germany, and as men, for the emancipation of mankind. You should feel the particular kind of oppression and shame which you suffer, not as an exception to the rule but rather as a confirmation of the rule.

   Or do the Jews want to be placed on a footing of equality with the Christian subjects? If they recognize the Christian state as legally established they also recognize the regime of general enslavement. Why should their particular yoke be irksome when they accept the general yoke? Why should the German be interested in the liberation of the Jew, if the Jew is not interested in the liberation of the German?

   The Christian state recognizes nothing but privileges. The Jew himself, in this state, has the privilege of being a Jew. As a Jew he possesses rights which the Christians do not have. Why does he want rights which he does not have but which the Christians enjoy?

   In demanding his emancipation from the Christian state he asks the Christian state to abandon its religious prejudice. But does he, the Jew, give up his religious prejudice? Has he then the right to insist that someone else should forswear his religion?

   The Christian state, by its very nature, is incapable of emancipating the Jew. But, adds Bauer, the Jew, by his very nature, cannot be emancipated. As long as the state remains Christian, and as long as the Jew remains a Jew, they are equally incapable, the one of conferring emancipation, the other of receiving it.

   With respect to the Jews the Christian state can only adopt the attitude of a Christian state. That is, it can permit the Jew, as a matter of privilege, to isolate himself from its other subjects; but it must then allow the pressures of all the other spheres of society to bear upon the Jew, and all the more heavily since he is in religious opposition to the dominant religion. But the Jew likewise can only adopt a Jewish attitude, i.e. that of a foreigner, towards the state, since he opposes his illusory nationality to actual nationality, his illusory law to actual law. He considers it his right to separate himself from the rest of humanity; as a matter of principle he takes no part in the historical movement and looks to a future which has nothing in common with the future of mankind as a whole. He regards himself as a member of the Jewish people, and the Jewish people as the chosen people.

   On what grounds, then, do you Jews demand emancipation? On account of your religion? But it is the mortal enemy of the state religion. As citizens? But there are no citizens in Germany. As men? But you are not men any more than are those to whom you appeal.

    Bauer, after criticizing earlier approaches and solutions, formulates the question of Jewish emancipation in a new way. What, he asks, is the nature of the Jew who is to be emancipated, and the nature of the Christian state which is to emancipate him? He replies by a critique of the Jewish religion, analyses the religious opposition between Judaism and Christianity, explains the essence of the Christian state; and does all this with dash, clarity, wit and profundity, in a style which is as precise as it is pithy and vigorous.

   How then does Bauer resolve the Jewish question? What is the result? To formulate a question is to resolve it. The critical study of the Jewish question is the answer to the Jewish question. Here it is in brief : we have to emancipate ourselves before we can emancipate others.

   The most stubborn form of the opposition between Jew and Christian is the religious opposition. How is an opposition resolved? By making it impossible. And how is religious opposition made impossible? By abolishing religion. As soon as Jew and Christian come to see in their respective religions nothing more than stages in the development of the human mind-snake skins which have been cast off by history, and man as the snake who clothed himself in them-they will no longer find themselves in religious opposition, but in a purely critical, scientific and human relationship. Science will then constitute their unity. But scientific oppositions are resolved by science itself.

   The German Jew, in particular, suffers from the general lack of political freedom and the pronounced Christianity of the state. But in Bauer's sense the Jewish question has a general significance, independent of the specifically German conditions. It is the question of the relations between religion and the state, of the contradiction between religious prejudice and political emancipation. Emancipation from religion is posited as a condition, both for the Jew who wants political emancipation, and for the state which should emancipate him and itself be emancipated.

   ""Very well, it may be said ( and the Jew himself says it) but the Jew should not be emancipated because he is a Jew, because he has such an excellent and universal moral creed; the Jew should take second place to the citizen, and he will be a citizen although he is and desires to remain a Jew. In other words, he is and remains a Jew, even though he is a citizen and as such lives in a universal human condition; his restricted Jewish nature always finally triumphs over his human and political obligations. The bias persists even though it is overcome by general principles. But if it persists, it would be truer to say that it overcomes all the rest."" ""It is only in a sophistical and superficial sense that the Jew could remain a Jew in political life. Consequently, if he wanted to remain a Jew, this would mean that the superficial became the essential and thus triumphed. In other words, his life in the state would be only a semblance, or a momentary exception to the essential and normal. ""2

   Let us see also how Bauer establishes the role of the state. ""France,"" he says, ""has provided us recently,3 in connexion with the Jewish question ( and for that matter all other political questions ), with the spectacle of a life which is free but which revokes its freedom by law and so declares it to be merely an appearance; and which, on the other hand, denies its free laws by its acts.""4

   ""In France, universal liberty is not yet established by law, nor is the Jewish question as yet resolved, because legal liberty, i .e. the equality of all citizens, is restricted in actual life, which is still dominated and fragmented by religious privileges, and because the lack of liberty in actual life influences law in its turn and obliges it to sanction the division of citizens who are by nature free into oppressors and oppressed.""5

   When, therefore, would the Jewish question be resolved in France?

   ""The Jew would really have ceased to be Jewish, for example, if he did not allow his religions code to prevent his fulfilment of his duties towards the state and his fellow citizens; if he attended and took part in the public business of the Chamber of Deputies on the sabbath. It would be necessary, further, to abolish all religious privliege, including the monopoly of a privileged church. If, thereafter, some or many or even the overwhelming majority felt obliged to fulfil their religious duties, such practices should be left to them as an absolutely private matter.""6 ""There is no longer any religion when there is no longer a privileged religion. Take away from religion its power to excommunicate and it will no longer exist.""7 ""Mr. Martin du Nord has seen, in the suggestion to omit any mention of Sunday in the law, a proposal to declare that Christianity has ceased to exist. With equal right ( and the right is well founded ) the declaration that the law of the sabbath is no longer binding upon the Jew would amount to proclaiming the end of Judaism.""8

   Thus Bauer demands, on the one hand, that the Jew should renounce Judaism, and in general that man should renounce religion, in order to be emancipated as a citizen. On the other hand, he considers, and this follows logically, that the political abolition of religion is the abolition of all religion. The state whic presupposes religion is not yet a true or actual state. ""Clearly, the religious idea gives some assurances to the state. But to what state? To what kind of state?""9

   At this point we see that the Jewish question is considered only from one aspect.

   It was by no means sufficient to ask : who should emancipate? who should be emancipated? The critic should ask a third question: what kind of emancipation is involved? What are the essential conditions of the emancipation which is demanded? The criticism of political emancipation itself was only the final criticism of the Jewish question and its genuine resolution into the ""general question of the age.""

   Bauer, since he does not formulate the problem at this level, falls into contradictions. He establishes conditions which are not based upon the nature of political emancipation. He raises questions which are irrelevant to his problem, and he resolves problems which leave his question unanswered. When Bauer says of the opponents of Jewish emancipation that ""Their error was simply to assume that the Christian state was the only true one, and not to subject it to the same criticism as Judaism,""1 we see his own error in the fact that he subjects only the ""Christian state,"" and not the ""state as such"" to criticism, that he does not examine the relation between political emancipation and human emancipation, and that he, therefore, poses conditions which are only explicable by his lack of critical sense in confusing political emancipation and universal human emancipation. Bauer asks the Jews : Have you, from your standpoint, the right to demand political emancipation?.We ask the converse question: from the standpoint of political emancipation can the Jew be required to abolish Judaism, or man be asked to abolish religion?

   The Jewish question presents itself differently according to the state in which the Jew resides. In Germany, where there is no political state, no state as such, the Jewish question is purely theological. The Jew finds himself in religious opposition to the state, which proclaims Christianity as its foundation. This state is a theologian ex professo. Criticism here is criticism of theology; a double-edged criticism, of Christian and of Jewish theology. And so we move always in the domain of theology, however critically we may move therein.

   In France, which is a constitutional state, the Jewish question is a question of constitutionalism, of the incompleteness of political emancipation. Since the semblance of a state religion is maintained here, if only in the insignificant and self-contradictory formula of a religion of the majority, the relation of the Jews to the state also retains a semblance of religious, theological opposition.

   It is only in the free states of North America, or at least in some of them, that the Jewish question loses its theological significance and becomes a truly secular question. Only where the state exists in its completely developed form can the relation of the Jew, and of the religious man in general, to the political state appear in a pure form, with its own characteristics. The criticism of this relation ceases to be theological criticism when the state ceases to maintain a theological attitude towards religion, that is, when it adopts the attitude of a state, i .e. a political attitude. Criticism then becomes criticism of the political state. And at this point, where the question ceases to be theological, Bauer's criticism ceases to be critical.

   ""There is not, in the United States, either a state religion or a religion declared to be that of a majority, or a predominance of one religion over another. The state remains aloof from all religions.""2 There are even some states in North America in which ""the constitution does not impose any religious belief or practice as a condition of political rights.""3 And yet, ""no one in the United States believes that a man without religion can be an honest man.""4 And North America is pre-eminently the country of religiosity, as Beaumont,""5 Tocqueville6 and the Englishman, Hami1ton,7 assure us in unison. However, the states of North America only serve as an example. The question is : what is the relation between complete political emancipation and religion? If we find in the country which has attained full political emancipation, that religion not only continues to exist but is fresh and vigorous, this is proof that the existence of religion is not at all opposed to the perfection of the state. But since the existence of religion is the existence of a defect, the source of this defect must be sought in the nature of the state itself. Religion no longer appears as the basis, but as the manifestation of secular narrowness. That is why we explain the religious constraints upon the free citizens by the secular constraints upon them. We do not claim that they must transcend their religious narrowness in order to get rid of their secular limitations. We claim that they will transcend their religious narrowness once they have overcome their secular limitations. We do not turn secular questions into theological questions; we turn theological questions into secular ones. History has for long enough been resolved into superstition; but we now resolve superstition into history. The question of the relation between political emancipation and religion becomes for us a question of the relation between political emancipation and human emancipation. We criticize the religious failings of the political state by criticizing the political state in its secular form, disregarding its religious failings. We express in human terms the contradiction between the state and a particular religion, for example Judaism, by showing the contradiction between the state and particular secular elements, between the state and religion in general and between the state and its general presuppositions.

   The political emancipation of the Jew or the Christian-of the religious man in general-is the emancipation of the state from Judaism, Christianity, and religion in general. The state emancipates itself from religion in its own particular way, in the mode which corresponds to its nature, by emancipating itself from the state religion; that is to say, by giving recognition to no religion and affirming itself purely and simply as a state. To be politically emancipated from religion is not to be finally and completely emancipated from religion, because political emancipation is not the final and absolute form of human emancipation.

   The limits of political emancipation appear at once in the fact that the state can liberate itself from a constraint without man himself being really liberated; that a state may be a free state with-­ out man himself being a free man. Bauer himself tacitly admits this when he makes political emancipation depend upon the following condition.

   ""It would be necessary, moreover, to abolish all religious privileges, including the monopoly of a privileged church. If some people, or even the immense majority, still felt obliged to fulfil- their religious duties, this practice should be left to them as a completely private matter."" Thus the state may have emancipated itself from religion, even though the immense majority of people continue to be religious . And the immense majority do not cease to be religious by virtue of being religious in private.

   The attitude of the state, especially the free state, towards religion is only the attitude towards religion of the individuals who compose the state. It follows that man frees himself from a constraint in a political way, through the state, when he transcends his limitations, in contradiction with himself, and in an abstract, narrow and partial way. Furthermore, by emancipating himself politically, man emancipates himself in a devious way, through an intermediary, however necessary this intermediary may be. Finally, even when he proclaims himself an atheist through the intermediary of the state, that is, when he declares the state to be an atheist, he is still engrossed in religion, because he only recognizes himself as an atheist in a roundabout way, through an intermediary. Religion is simply the recognition of man in a roundabout fashion; that is, through an intermediary. The state is the intermediary between man and human liberty. Just as Christ is the intermediary to whom man attributes all his own divinity and all his religious bonds, so the state is the intermediary to which man confides all his nondivinity and all his human freedom.

   The political elevation of man above religion shares the weaknesses and merits of all such political measures . For example, the state as a state abolishes private property (i .e. man decrees by political means the abolition of private property) when it abolishes the property qualification for electors and representatives, as has been done in many of the North American States. Hamilton interprets this phenomenon quite correctly from the political standpoint : The masses have gained a victory over property owners and financial wealth.8 Is not private property ideally abolished when the non- owner comes to legislate for the owner of property? The property qualification is the last political form in which private property is recognized.

   But the political suppression of private property not only does not abolish private property; it actually presupposes its existence. The state abolishes, after its fashion, the distinctions established by birth, social rank, education, occupation, when it decrees that birth, social rank, education, occupation are non-political distinctions; when it proclaims, without regard to these distinctions, that every member of society is an equal partner in popular sovereignty, and treats all the elements which compose the real life of the nation from the standpoint of the state. But the state, none the less, allows private property, education, occupation, to act after their own fashion, namely as private property, education, occupation, and to manifest their particular nature. Far from abolishing these effective differences, it only exists so far as they are presupposed; it is conscious of being a political state and it manifests its universality only in opposition to these elements. Hegel, therefore, defines the relation of the political state to religion quite correctly when he says: ""In order for the state to come in to existence as the selfknowing ethical actuality of spirit, it is essential that it should be distinct from the forms of authority and of faith. But this distinction emerges only in so far as divisions occur within the ecclesiastical sphere itself. It is only in this way that the state, above the particular churches, has attained to the universality of thought-its formal principle-and is bringing this universality into existence.""9 To be sure! Only in this manner, above the particular elements, can the state constitute itself as universality.

   The perfected political state is, by its nature, the species-life l of man as opposed to his material life. All the presuppositions of this egoistic life continue to exist in civil society outside the political sphere, as qualities of civil society. Where the political state has attained to its full development, man leads, not only in thought, in consciousness, but in reality, in life, a double existence-celestial and terrestrial. He lives in the political community, where he regards himself as a communal being, and in civil society where he acts simply as a private individual, treats other men as means, degrades himself to the role of a mere means, and becomes the plaything of alien powers . The political state, in relation to civil society, is just as spiritual as is heaven in relation to earth. It stands in the same opposition to civil society, and overcomes it in the same manner as religion overcomes the narrowness of the profane world; i .e. it has always to acknowledge it again, re-establish it, and allow itself to be dominated by it. Man, in his most intimate reality, in civil society, is a profane being. Here, where he appears both to himself and to others as a real individual he is an illusory phenomenon. In the state, on the contrary, where he is regarded as a species-being,2 man is the imaginary member of an imaginary sovereignty, divested of his real, individual life, and infused with an unreal universality.

   The conflict in which the individual, as the professor of a particular religion, finds himself involved with his own quality of citizenship and with other men as members of the community, may be resolved into the secular schism between the political state and civil society. For man as a bourgeois 3 ""life in the state is only an appearance or a fleeting exception to the normal and essential."" It is true that the bourgeois, like the Jew, participates in political life only in a sophistical way, just as the citoyen4 is a Jew or a bourgeois only in a sophistical way. But this sophistry is not personal. It is the sophistry of the political state itself. The difference between the religious man and the citizen is the same as that between the shopkeeper and the citizens, between the day-labourer and the citizen, between the landed proprietor and the citizen, between the living individual and the citizen. The contradiction in which the religious man finds himself with the political man, is the same contradiction in which the bourgeois finds himself with the citizen, and the member of civil society with his political lion's skin.

   This secular opposition, to which the Jewish question reduces itself-the relation between the political state and its presuppositions, whether the latter are material elements such as private property, etc., or spiritual elements such as culture or religion, the conflict between the general interest and private interest, the schism between the political state and civil society-these profane contradictions, Bauer leaves intact, while he directs his polemic against their religious expression. ""It is precisely this basis-that is, the needs which assure the existence of civil society and guarantee its necessity -which exposes its existence to continual danger, maintains an element of uncertainty in civil society, produces this continually changing compound of wealth and poverty, of prosperity and distress, and above all generates change.""5 Compare the whole section entitled ""Civil society,""6 which follows closely the distinctive features of Hegel's philosophy of right. Civil society, in its opposition to this political state, is recognized as necessary because the political state is recognized as necessary.

   Political emancipation certainly represents a great progress. It is not, indeed, the final form of human emancipation, but it is the final form of human emancipation within the framework of the prevailing social order. It goes without saying that we are speaking here of real, practical emancipation.

   Man emancipates himself politically from religion by expelling it from the sphere of public law to that of private law. Religion is no longer the spirit of the state, in which man behaves, albeit in a specific and limited way and in a particular sphere, as a species-being, in community with other men. It has become the spirit of civil society, of the sphere of egoism and of the bellum omnium contraomnes. It is no longer the essence of community, but the essence of differentiation. It has become what it was at the beginning, an expression of the fact that man is separated from the community, from himself and from other men. It is now only the abstract avowal of an individual folly, a private whim or caprice. The infinite fragmentation of religion in North America, for example; already gives it the external form of a strictly private affair. It has been relegated among the numerous private interests and exiled from the life of the community as such. But one should have no illusions about the scope of political emancipation. The division of man into the public person and the private person, the displacement of religion from the state to civil society-all this is not a stage in political emancipation but its consummation. Thus political emancipation does not abolish, and does not even strive to abolish, man's real religiosity.

   The decomposition of man into Jew and citizen, Protestant and citizen, religious man and citizen, is not a deception practiced against the political system nor yet an evasion of political emancipation. It is political emancipation itself, the political mode of emancipation from religion. Certainly, in periods when the political state as such comes violently to birth in civil society, and when men strive to liberate themselves through political emancipation, the state can, and must, proceed to abolish and destroy religion; but only in the same way as it proceeds to abolish private property, by declaring a maximum, by confiscation, or by progressive taxation, or in the same way as it proceeds to abolish life, by the guillotine. At those times when the state is most aware of itself, political life seeks to stifle its own prerequisites-civil society and its elements-and to establish itself as the genuine and harmonious species-life of man. But it can only achieve this end by setting itself in violent contradiction with its own conditions of existence, by declaring a permanent revolution. Thus the political drama ends necessarily with the restoration of religion, of private property, of all the elements of civil society, just as war ends with the conclusion of peace.

   In fact, the perfected Christian state is not the so-called Christian state which acknowledges Christianity as its basis, as the state religion, and thus adopts an exclusive attitude towards other religions; it is, rather, the atheistic state, the democratic state, the state which relegates religion among the other elements of civil society. The state which is still theological, which still professes officially the Christian creed, and which has not yet dared to declare itself a state, has not yet succeeded in expressing in a human and secular form, in its political reality, the human basis of which Christianity is the transcendental expression. The so-called Christian state is simply a non-state; since it is not Christianity as a religion, but only the human core of the Christian religion which can realize itself in truly human creations.

   The so-called Christian state is the Christian negation of the state, but not at all the political realization of Christianity. The state which professes Christianity as a religion does not yet profess it in a political form, because it still has a religious attitude towards religion. In other words, such a state is not the genuine realization of the human basis of religion, because it still accepts the unreal, imaginary form of this human core. The so-called Christian state is an imperfect state, for which the Christian religion serves as the supplement and sanctification of its imperfection. Thus religion becomes necessarily one of its means; and so it is the hypocritical state. There is a great difference between saying: (i) that the perfect state, owing to a deficiency in the general nature of the state, counts religion as one of its prerequisites, or ( ii) that the imperfect state, owing to a deficiency in its particular existence as an imperfect state, declares that religion is its basis. In the latter, religion becomes imperfect politics. In the former, the imperfection even of perfected politics is revealed in religion. The so-called Christian state needs the Christian religion in order to complete itself as a state. The democratic state, the real state, does not need religion for its political consummation. On the contrary, it can dispense with religion, because in this case the human core of religion is realized in a profane manner. The so-called Christian state, on the other hand, has a political attitude towards religion, and a religious attitude towards politics. It reduces political institutions and religion equally to mere appearances.

   In order to make this contradiction clearer we shall examine Bauer's model of the Christian state, a model which is derived from his study of the German-Christian state.

   ""Quite recently,"" says Bauer, ""in order to demonstrate the impossibility or the non-existence of a Christian state, those pas-­ sages in the Bible have been frequently quoted with which the state does not conform and cannot conform unless it wishes to dissolve itself entirely.""

   ""But the question is not so easily settled. What do these Biblical passages demand? Supernatural renunciation, submission to the authority of revelation, turning away from the state, the abolition of profane conditions. But the Christian state proclaims and accomplishes all these things. It has assimilated the spirit of the Bible, and if it does not reproduce it exactly in the terms which the Bible uses, that is simply because it expresses this spirit in political forms, in forms which are borrowed from the political system of this world but which, in the religious rebirth which they are obliged to undergo, are reduced to simple appearances. Man turns away from the state and by this means realizes and completes the political institutions .""7

   Bauer continues by showing that the members of a Christian state no longer constitute a nation with a will of its own. The nation has its true existence in the leader to whom it is subjected; but this leader is, by his origin and nature, alien to it since he has been imposed by God without the people having any part in the matter. The laws of such a nation are not its own work, but are direct revelations . The supreme leader, in his relations with the real nation, the masses, requires privileged intermediaries; and the nation itself disintegrates into a multitude of distinct spheres which are formed and determined by chance, are differentiated from each other by their interests and their specific passions and prejudices, and acquire as a privilege the permission to isolate themselves from each other, etc.8

   But Bauer himself says : ""Politics, if it is to be nothing more than religion, should not be politics; any more than the scouring of pans, if it is treated as a religious matter, should be regarded as ordinary housekeeping.""9 But in the German-Christian state religion is an ""economic matter"" just as ""economic matters"" are religion. In the German-Christian state the power of religion is the religion of power.

   The separation of the ""spirit of the Bible"" from the ""letter of the Bible"" is an irreligious act. The state which expresses the Bible in the letter of politics, or in any letter other than that of the Holy Ghost, commits sacrilege, if not in the eyes of men at least in the eyes of its own religion. The state which acknowledges the Bible as its charter and Christianity as its supreme rule must be assessed according to the words of the Bible; for even the language of the Bible is sacred. Such a state, as well as the human rubbish upon which it is based, finds itself involved in a painful contradiction, which is insoluble from the standpoint of religious consciousness, when it is referred to those words of the Bible ""with which it does not conform and cannot conform unless it wishes to dissolve itself entirely."" And why does it not wish to dissolve itself entirely? The state itself cannot answer either itself or others. In its own consciousness the official Christian state is an ""ought"" whose realization is imposible. It cannot affirm the reality of its own existence without lying to itself, and so it remains always in its own eyes an object of doubt, an uncertain and problematic object. Criticism is, therefore, entirely within its rights in forcing the state, which supports itself upon the Bible, into a total disorder of thought in which it no longer knows whether it is illusion or reality; and  in which the infamy of its profane ends ( for which religion serves as a cloak) enter into an insoluble conflict with the probity of its religious consciousness ( for which religion appears as the goal of the world ). Such a state can only escape its inner torment by becoming the myrmidon of the Catholic Church. In the face of this Church, which asserts that secular power is entirely subordinate to its commands, the state is powerless; powerless the secular power which claims to be the rule of the religious spirit.

   What prevails in the so-called Christian state is not man but alienation. The only man who counts-the King-is specifically differentiated from other men and is still a religious being associated directly with heaven and with God. The relations which exist here are relations still based upon faith. The religious spirit is still not really secularized.

   But the religious spirit cannot be really secularized. For what is it but the non-secular form of a stage in the development of the human spirit? The religious spirit can only be realized if the stage of development of the human spirit which it expresses in religious form, manifests and constitutes itself in its secular form. This is what happens in the democratic state. The basis of this state is not Christianity but the human basis of Christianity. Religion remains the ideal, non-secular consciousness of its members, because it is the ideal form of the stage of human development which has been attained.

   The members of the political state are religious because of the dualism between individual life and species-life, between the life of civil society and political life. They are religious in the sense that man treats political life, which is remote from his own individual existence, as if it were his true life; and in the sense that religion is here the spirit of civil society, and expresses the separation and withdrawal of man from man. Political democracy is Christian in the sense that man, not merely one man but every man, is there considered a sovereign being, a supreme being; but it is uneducated, unsocial man, man just as he is in his fortuitous existence, man as he has been corrupted, lost to himself, alienated, subjected to the rule of inhuman conditions and elements, by the whole organization of our society-in short man who is not yet a real species-being. Creations of fantasy, dreams, the postulates of Christianity, the sovereignty of man-but of man as an alien being distinguished from the real man-all these become, in democracy, the tangible and present reality, secular maxims.

   In the perfected democracy, the religious and theological consciousness appears to itself all the more religious and theological in that it is apparently without any political significance or terrestrial aims, is an affair of the heart withdrawn from the world, an expression of the limitations of reason, a product of arbitrariness and fantasy, a veritable life in the beyond. Christianity here attains the practical expression of its universal religious significance, because the most varied views are brought together in the form of Christianity, and still more because Christianity does not ask that anyone should profess Christianity, but simply that he should have some kind of religion (see Beaumont, op. cit.) . The religious consciousness runs riot in a wealth of contradictions and diversity.

   We have shown, therefore, that political emancipation from religion leaves religion in existence, although this is no longer a privileged religion. The contradiction in which the adherent of a particular religion finds himself in relation to his citizenship is only one aspect of the universal secular contradiction between the political state and  civil society. The consummation of the Christian state is a state which acknowledges itself simply as a state and ignores the religion of its members. The emancipation of the state from religion is not the emancipation of the real man from religion.

   We do not say to the Jews, therefore, as does Bauer: you cannot be emancipated politically without emancipating yourselves completely from Judaism. We say rather: it is because you can be emancipated politically, without renouncing Judaism completely and absolutely, that political emancipation itself is not human emancipation. If you want to be politically emancipated, without emancipating yourselves humanly, the inadequacy and the contradiction is not entirely in yourselves but in the nature and the category of political emancipation. If you are preoccupied with this category you share the general prejudice. Just as the state evangelizes when, although it is a state, it adopts a Christian attitude towards the Jews, the Jew acts politically when, though a Jew, he demands civil rights.

   But if a man, though a Jew, can be emancipated politically and acquire civil rights, can he claim and acquire what are called the rights of man? Bauer denies it. ""The question is whether the Jew as such, that is, the Jew who himself avows that he is constrained by his true nature to live eternally separate from men, is able to acquire and to concede to others the universal rights of man.""

   ""The idea of the rights of man was only discovered in the Christian world, in the last century. It is not an innate idea; on the contrary, 'it is acquired in a struggle against the historical traditions in which man has been educated up to the present time. The rights of man are not, therefore, a gift of nature, nor a legacy from past history, but the reward of a struggle against the accident of birth and against the privileges which history has hitherto transmitted from generation to generation. They are the results of culture, and only he can possess them who has merited and earned them.""

   ""But can the Jew really take possession of them? As long as he remains Jewish the limited nature which makes him a Jew must prevail over the human nature which should associate him, as a man, with other men; and it will isolate him from everyone who is not a Jew. He declares, by this separation, that the particular nature which makes him Jewish is his true and supreme nature, before which human nature has to efface itself.""

   ""Similarly, the Christian as such cannot grant the rights of man.""1

   According to Bauer man has to sacrifice the ""privilege of faith"" in order to acquire the general rights of man. Let us consider for a moment the so-called rights of man; let us examine them in their most authentic form, that which they have among those who discovered them, the North Americans and the French! These rights of man are, in part, political rights, which can only be exercised if one is a member of a community. Their content is participation in the community life, in the political life of the community, the life of the state. They fall in the category of political liberty, of civil rights, which as we have seen do not at all presuppose the consistent and positive abolition of religion; nor consequently, of Judaism. It remains to consider the other part, namely the rights of man as distinct from the rights of the citizen.

   Among them is to be found the freedom of conscience, the right to practise a chosen religion. The privilege of faith is expressly recognized, either as a right of man or as a consequence of a right of man, namely liberty. Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, 1791, Article 10: ""No one is to be disturbed on account of his opinions, even religious opinions."" There is guaranteed, as one of the rights of man, ""the liberty of every man to practise the religion to which he adheres.""

   The Declaration of the Rights of Man, etc. 1793, enumerates among the rights of man (Article 7 ) : ""The liberty of religious observance."" Moreover, it is even stated, with respect to the right to express ideas and opinions, to hold meetings, to practise a religion, that: ""The necessity of enunciating these rights presupposes either the existence or the recent memory of despotism."" Compare the Constitution of 1795, Section XII, Article 354.

   Constitution of Pennsylvania, Article 9, 3: ""All men have received from nature the imprescriptible right to worship the Almighty according to the dictates of their conscience, and no one can be legally compelled to follow, establish or support against his will any religion or religious ministry. No human authority can, in any circumstances, intervene in a matter of conscience or control the forces of the soul.""

   Constitution of New Hampshire, Articles 5 and 6: ""Among these natural rights some are by nature inalienable since nothing can replace them. The rights of conscience are among them.""2

   The incompatibility between religion and the rights of man is so little manifest in the concept of the rights of man that the right to be religious, in one's own fashion, and to practise one's own particular religion, is expressly included among the rights of man. The privilege of faith is a universal right of man.

   A distinction is made between the rights of man and the rights of the citizen. Who is this man distinct from the citizen? No one but the member of civil society. Why is the member of civil society called ""man,"" simply man, and why are his rights called the ""rights of man""? How is this fact to be explained? By the relation between the political state and civil society, and by the nature of political emancipation.

   Let us notice first of all that the so-called rights of man, as distinct from the rights of the citizen, are simply the rights of a member of civil society, that is, of egoistic man, of man separated from other men and from the community. The most radical constitution, that of 1 793, says : Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen: Article 2. ""These righ ts, etc. ( the natural and imprescriptible rights ) are : equality, liberty,security, property.

   What constitutes liberty?

   Article 6. ""Liberty is the power which man has to do everything which does not harm the rights of others . ""

   Liberty is, therefore, the right to do everything which does not harm others. The limits within which each individual can act with­ out harming others are determined by law, just as the boundary between two fields is marked by a stake. It is a question of the liberty of man regarded as an isolated monad, withdrawn into himself. Why, according to Bauer, is the Jew not fitted to acquire the rights of man? ""As long as he remains Jewish the limited nature which makes him a Jew must prevail over the human nature which should associate him, as a man, with other men; and it will isolate him from everyone who is not a Jew."" But liberty as a right of man is not founded upon the relations between man and man, but rather upon the separation. of man from man. It is the right of such separation. The right of the circumscribed individual, withdrawn into himself.

   The practical application of the right of liberty is the right of private property. What constitutes the right of private property?

   Article 16 ( Constitution of 1793 ) ""The right of property is that which belongs to every citizen of enjoying and disposing as he will of his goods and revenues, of the fruits of his work and industry . ""

   The right of property is, therefore, the right to enjoy one's fortune and to dispose of it as one will; without regard for other men and independently of society. It is the right of self-interest. This individual liberty, and its application, form the basis of civil society. It leads every man to see in other men, not the realization, but rather the limitation of his own liberty. It declares above all the right ""to enjoy and to dispose as one will, one's goods and revenues, the fruits of one's work and industry.""

   There remain the other rights of man, equality and security.

   The term ""equality"" has here no political significance. It is only the equal right to liberty as defined above; namely that every man is equally regarded as a self-sufficient monad. The Constitution of 1795, defines the concept of liberty in this sense.

   Article 5 ( Constitution of 1 795 ) ' ""Equality consists in the fact that the law is the same for all, whether it protects or punishes .""

   And security?

   Article 8 (Constitution of 1793) ""Security consists in the protection afforded by society to each of its members for the preservation of his person, his rights, and his property.""

   Security is the supreme social concept of civil society; the concept of the police. The whole society exists only in order to guarantee for each of its members the preservation of his person, his rights and his property. It is in this sense that Hegel calls civil society ""the state of need and of reason.""

   The concept of security is not enough to raise civil society above its egoism. Security is, rather, the assurance of its egoism.

   None of the supposed rights of man, therefore, go beyond the egoistic man, man as he is, as a member of civil society; that is, an individual separated from the community, withdrawn into himself, wholly preoccupied with his private interest and acting in accordance with his private caprice. Man is far from being considered, in the rights of man, as a species-being; on the contrary, species-life itself-society-appears as a system which is external to the individual and as a limitation of his original independence. The only bond between men is natural necessity, need and private interest, the presentation of their property and their egoistic persons.

   It is difficult enough to understand that a nation which has just begun to liberate itself, to tear down all the barriers between different sections of the people and to establish a political community, should solemnly proclaim (Declaration of 1791) the rights of the egoistic man, separated from his fellow men and from the community, and should renew this proclamation at a moment when only the most heroic devotion can save the nation ( and is, therefore, urgently called for ), and when the sacrifice of all the interests of civil society is in question and egoism should be punished as a crime. (Declaration of the Rights of Man, etc. 1793 ). The matter becomes still more incomprehensible when we observe that the political liberators reduce citizenship, the political community, to a mere means for preserving these so-called rights of man; and consequently, that the citizen is declared to be the servant of egoistic ""man,"" that the sphere in which man functions as a species-being is degraded to a level below the sphere where he functions as a partial being, and finally that it is man as a bourgeois and not man as a citizen who is considered the true and authentic man.

   ""The end of every political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man."" ( Declaration of the Rights of Man, etc. 1791, Article 2.) ""Government is instituted in order to guarantee man's enjoyment of his natural and imprescriptible rights."" (Declaration, etc. 1793, Article 1 .) Thus, even in the period of its youthful enthusiasm, which is raised to fever pitch by the force of circumstances, political life declares itself to be only a means, whose end is the life of civil society. It is true that its revo­ lutionary practice is in flagrant contradiction with its theory. While, for instance, security is declared to be one of the rights of man, the violation of the privacy of correspondence is openly considered. W,hile the ""unlimited freedom of the Press"" ( Constitution of 1793, Article 122 ) , as a corollary of the right of individual liberty, is guaranteed, the freedom of the Press is completely destroyed, since ""the freedom of the Press should not be permitted when it endangers public liberty.""3 This amounts to saying: the right to liberty ceases to be a right as soon as it comes into conflict with political life, whereas in theory political life is no more than the guarantee of the rights of man-the rights of the individual man-and should, therefore, be suspended as soon as it comes into contradiction with its end, these rights of man. But practice is only the exception, while theory is the rule. Even if one decided to regard revolutionary practice as the correct expression of this rela­ tion, the problem would remain as to why it is that in the minds of political liberators the relation is inverted, so that the end appears as the means and the means as the end? This optical illusion of their consciousness would always remain a problem, though a psy­ chological and theoretical one.

   But the problem is easily solved.

   Political emancipation is at the same time the dissolution of the old society, upon which the sovereign power, the alienated political life of the people, rests. Political revolution is a revolution of civil society. What was the nature of the old society? It can be characterized in one word: feudalism. The old civil society had a directly political character; that is, the elements of civil life such as property, the family, and types of occupation had been raised, in the form of lordship, caste and guilds, to elements of political life. They determined, in this form, the relation of the individual to the state as a whole; that is, his political situation, or in other words, his separation and exclusion from the other elements of society. For this organization of national life did not constitute property and labour as social elements; it rather succeeded in separating them from the body of the state, and made them distinct societies within society. Nevertheless, at least in the feudal sense, the vital func­ tions and conditions of civil society remained political. They excluded the individual from the body of the state, and trans­ formed the particular relation which existed between his corpora- tion and the state into a general relation between the individual and social life, j ust as they transformed his specific civil activity and situation into a general activity and situation. As a result of this organization, the state as a whole and its consciousness, will and activity-the general political power-also necessarily appeared as the private affair of a ruler and his servants, separated from the people.

   The political revolution which overthrew this power of the ruler, which made state affairs the affairs of the people, and the political state a matter of general concern, i.e. a real state, necessarily shattered everything-estates, corporations, guilds, privileges-which expressed the separation of the people from community life. The political revolution therefore abolished the political character of civil society. It dissolved civil society into its basic elements, on the one hand individuals, and on the other hand the material and cultural elements which formed the life experience and the civil situation of these individuals. It set free the political spirit which had, so to speak, been dissolved, fragmented and lost in the various culs-de-sac of feudal society; it reassembled these scattered frag­ ments, liberated the political spirit from its connexion with civil life and made of it the community sphere, the general concern of the people, in principle independent of these particular elements of civil life. A specific activity and situation in life no longer had any but an individual significance. They no longer constituted the general relation between the individual and the state as a whole. Public affairs as such became the general affair of each individual, and political functions became general functions.

   But the consummation of the idealism of the state was at the same time the consummation of the materialism of civil society. The bonds which had restrained the egoistic spirit of civil society were removed along with the political yoke. Political emancipation was at the same time an emancipation of civil society from politics and from even the semblance of a general content.

   Feudal society was dissolved into its basic element, man; but into egoistic man who was its real foundation.

   Man in this aspect, the member of civil society, is now the foundation and presupposition of the political state. He is recognized as such in the rights of man.

   But the liberty of egoistic man, and the recognition of this liberty, is rather the recognition of the frenzied movement of the cul-­ tural and material elements which form the content of his life.

   Thus man was not liberated from religion; he received religious liberty. He was not liberated from property; he received the liberty to own property. He was not liberated from the egoism of business; he received the liberty to engage in business.

   The formation of the political state, and the dissolution of civil society into independent individuals whose relations are regulated by law, as the relations between men in the corporations and guilds were regulated by privilege, are accomplished by one and the same act. Man as a member of civil society-non-political man­necessarily appears as the natural man. The rights of man appear as natural rights because conscious activity is concentrated upon political action. Egoistic man is the passive, given result of the dissolution of society, an object of direct apprehension and consequently a natural object. The political revolution dissolves civil society into its elements without revolutionizing these elements themselves or subjecting them to criticism. This revolution regards civil society, the sphere of human needs, labour, private interests and civil law, as the basis of its own existence, as a self-subsistent precondition, and thus as its natural basis. Finally, man as a member of civil society is identified with authentic man, man as distinct from citizen, because he is man in his sensuous, individual and immediate existence, whereas political man is only abstract, artificial man, man as an allegorical, moral person. Thus man as he really is, is seen only in the form of egoistic man, and man in his true nature only in the form of the abstract citizen.

   The abstract notion of political man is well formulated by Rousseau: ""Whoever dares undertake to establish a people's institutions must feel himself capable of changing, as it were, human nature itself, of transforming each individual who, in isolation, is a complete but solitary whole, into a part of something greater than himself, from which in a sense, he derives his life and his being; [of changing man's nature in order to strengthen it;] of substituting a limited and moral existence for the physical and independent life [with which all of us are endowed by nature]. His task, in short, is to take from a man his own powers, and to give him in exchange alien powers which he can only employ with the help of other men.""4

   Every emancipation is a restoration of the human world and of human relationships to man himself.

   Political emancipation is a reduction of man, on the one hand to a member of civil society, an independent and egoistic individual, and on the other hand, to a citizen, to a moral person.

   Human emancipation will only be complete when the real, individual man has absorbed into himself the abstract citizen; when as an individual man, in his everyday life, in his work, and in his relationships, he has become a species-being; and when he has recognized and organized his own powers (forces propres) as social powers so that he no longer separates this social power from himself as political power.

            2. Bruno Bauer, ""Die Fahigkeit der heutigen

                  Juden und Christen frei zu werden""5

   It is in this form that Bauer studies the relation between the Jewish and Christian religions, and also their relation with modern criticism. This latter relation is their relation with ""the capacity to become free.""

   He reaches this conclusion: ""The Christian has only to raise himself one degree, to rise above his religion, in order to abolish religion in general,"" and thus to become free; but ""the Jew, on the contrary, has to break not only with his Jewish nature, but also with the process towards the consummation of his religion, a proc-­ ess which has remained alien to him.""6

   Thus Bauer here transforms the question of Jewish emancipation into a purely religious question. The theological doubt about whether the Jew or the Christian has the better chance of attaining salvation is reproduced here in the more enlightened form : which of the two is more capable of emancipation? It is indeed no longer asked: which makes free-Judaism or Christianity? On the contrary, it is now asked: which makes free-the negation of Judaism or the negation of Christianity?

   ""If they wish to become free the Jews should not embrace Christianity as such, but Christianity in dissolution, religion in dissolution; that is to say, the Enlightenment, criticism, and its outcome, a free humanity.""7

   It is still a matter, therefore, of the Jews professing some kind of faith; no longer Christianity as such, but Christianity in dissolution.

   Bauer asks the Jews to break with the essence of the Christian religion, but this demand does not follow, as he himself admits, from the development of the Jewish nature.

   From the moment when Bauer, at the end of his Judenfrage, saw in Judaism only a crude religious criticism of Christianity, and; therefore, attributed to it only a religious significance, it was to b.e expected that he would transform the emancipation of the Jews into a philosophico-theological act.

   Bauer regards the ideal and abstract essence of the Jew-his religion-as the whole of his nature. He, therefore, concludes rightly that ""The Jew contributes nothing to mankind when he disregards his own limited law,"" when he renounces all his Judaism.8

   The relation between Jews and Christians thus becomes the following: the only interest which the emancipation of the Jew presents for the Christian is a general human and theoretical interest. Judaism is a phenomenon which offends the religious eye of the Christian. As soon as the Christian's eye ceases to be religious the phenomenon ceases to offend it. The emancipation of the Jew is not in itself, therefore, a task which falls to the Christian to per- form.

   The Jew, on the other hand, if he wants to emancipate himself has to undertake, besides his own work, the work of the Christian-the ""criticism of the gospels,"" of the ""life of Jesus,"" etc.9 ""It is for them to arrange matters; they will decide their own destiny. But history does not allow itself to be mocked.""l

   We will attempt to escape from the theological formulation of the question. For us, the question concerning the capacity of thc Jew for emancipation is transformed into another question: what specific social element is it necessary to overcome in order to abolish Judaism? For the capacity of the present-day Jew to emancipate himself expresses the relation of Judaism to the emancipation of the contemporary world. The relation results necessarily from the particular situation of Judaism in the present enslaved world.

   Let us consider the real Jew: not the sabbath Jew, whom Bauer considers, but the everyday Jew.

   Let us not seek the secret of the Jew in his religion, but let us seek the secret of the religion in the real Jew.

   What is the profane basis of Judaism? Practical need, self­ interest. What is the worldly cult of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly god? Money.

   Very well: then in emancipating itself from huckstering and money, and thus from real and practical Judaism, our age would emancipate itself.

   An organization of society which would abolish the preconditions and thus the very possibility of huckstering, would make the Jew impossible. His religious consciousness would evaporate like some insipid vapour in the real, life-giving air of society. On the other hand, when the Jew recognizes his practical nature as invalid and endeavours to abolish it, he begins to deviate from his former path of development, works for general human emancipation and turns against the supreme practical expression of human self­ estrangement.

   We discern in Judaism, therefore, a universal antisocial element of the present time, whose historical development, zealously aided in its harmful aspects by the Jews, has now attained its culminating point, a point at which it must necessarily begin to disintegrate. In the final analysis, the emancipation of the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from Judaism.

   The Jew has already emancipated himself in a Jewish fashion.

   ""The Jew, who is merely tolerated in Vienna for example, determines the fate of the whole Empire by his financial power. The Jew, who may be entirely without rights in the smallest German state, decides the destiny of Europe. While the corporations and guilds exclude the Jew, or at least look on him with disfavour, the audacity of industry mocks the obstinacy of medieval institutions.""2

   This is not an isolated instance. The Jew has emancipated him­ self in a Jewish manner, not only by acquiring the power of money, but also because money has become, through him and also apart from him, a world power, while the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations. The Jews have emancipated themselves in so far as the Christians have become Jews.

   Thus, for example, Captain Hamilton reports that the devout and politically free inhabitant of New England is a kind of Laocoon who makes not the least effort to escape from the serpents which are crushing him. Mammon is his idol which he adores not only with his lips but with the whole force of his body and mind. In his view the world is no more than a Stock Exchange, and he is convinced that he has no other destiny here below than to become richer than his neighbour. Trade has seized upon all his thoughts, and he has no other recreation than to exchange objects. When he travels he carries, so to speak, his goods and h is counter on his back and talks only of interest and profit. If he loses sight of his own business for an instant it is only in order to pry into the business of his competitors.3

   In North America, indeed, the effective domination of the Christian world by Judaism has come to be manifested in a common and unambiguous form; the preaching of the Gospel itself, Christian preaching, has become an article of commerce, and the bankrupt trader in the church behaves like the prosperous clergyman in business. ""This man whom you see at the head of a respectable congregation began as a trader; his business having failed he has become a minister. This other began as a priest, but as soon as he had accumulated some money he abandoned the priesthood for trade. In the eyes of many people the religious ministry is a veritable industrial career. ""4

   According to Bauer, it is ""a hypocritical situation when, in theory, the Jew is deprived of political rights, while in practice he wields tremendous power and exercises on a wholesale scale the political influence which is denied him in minor matters .""5

   The contradiction which exists between the effective political power of the Jew and his political rights, is the contradiction between politics and the power of money in general. Politics is in principle superior to the power of money, but in practice it has become its bondsman.

   Judaism has maintained itself alongside Christianity, not only because it constituted the religious criticism of Christianity and embodied the doubt concerning the religious origins of Christianity, but equally because the practical Jewish spirit-Judaism or commerce6-has perpetuated itself in Christian society and has even attained its highest development there. The Jew, who occupies a distinctive place in civil society, only manifests in a distinctive way the Judaism of civil society.

   Judaism has been preserved, not in spite of history, but by history.

   It is from its own entrails that civil society ceaselessly engenders the Jew.

   What was, in itself, the basis of the Jewish religion? Practical need, egoism.

   The monotheism of the Jews is, therefore, in reality, a polytheism of the numerous needs of man, a polytheism which makes even the lavatory an object of divine regulation. Practical need, egoism, is the principle of civil society, and is revealed as such in its pure form as soon as civil society has fully engendered the political state. The god of practical need and self-interest is money.

   Money is the jealous god of Israel, beside which no other god may exist. Money abases all the gods of mankind and changes them into commodities. Money is the universal and self-sufficient value of all things. It has, therefore, deprived the whole world, both the human world and nature, of their own proper value. Money is the alienated essence of man's work and existence; this essence dominates him and he worships it.

   The god of the Jews has been secularized and has become the god of this world. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange.

   The mode of perceiving nature, under the rule of private property and money, is a real contempt for, and a practical degradation of nature, which does indeed exist in the Jewish religion but only as a creature of the imagination.

   It is in this sense that Thomas Munzer declares it intolerable ""that every creature should be transformed into property-the fishes in the water, the birds of the air, the plants of the earth: the creature too should become free.""7

   That which is contained in an abstract form in the Jewish reli­ gion-contempt for theory, for art, for history, and for man as an end in himself-is the real, conscious standpoint and the virtue of the man of money. Even the species-relation itself, the relation between man and woman, becomes an object of commerce. Woman is bartered away.

   The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the trader, and above all of the financier.

   The law, without basis or reason, of the Jew, is only the religious caricature of morality and right in general, without basis or reason; the purely formal rites with which the world of self-interest encircles itself.

   Here again the supreme condition of man is his legal status, his relationship to laws which are valid for him, not because they are the laws of his own will and nature, but because they are dominant and any infraction of them will be avenged.

   Jewish Jesuitism, the same practical Jesuitism which Bauer dis­ covers in the Talmud, is the relationship of the world of self­ interest to the laws which govern this world, laws which the world devotes its principal arts to circumventing.

   Indeed, the operation of this world within its framework of laws is impossible without the continual supersession of law.    Judaism could not develop further as a religion, in a theoretical form, because the world view of practical need is, by its very nature, circumscribed, and the delineation of its characteristics soon completed.

   The religion of practical need could not, by its very nature, find its consummation in theory, but only in practice, just because prac­ tice is its truth.

   Judaism could not create a new world. It could only bring the new creations and conditions af the world within its own sphere of activity, because practical need, the spirit of which is self-interest, is always passive, cannot expand at will, but finds itself extended as a result of the continued development of society.

   Judaism attains its apogee with the perfection of civil society; but civil society only reaches perfection in the Christian world. Only under the sway of Christianity, which objectifies all national, natural, moral and theoretical relationships, could civil society separate itself completely from the life of the state, sever all the species­ bonds of man, establish egoism and selfish need in their place, and dissolve the human world into a world of atomistic, antagonistic individuals.

   Christianity issued from Judaism. It has now been re-absorbed into Judaism.

   From the beginning, the Christian was the theorizing Jew; consequently, the Jew is the practical Christian. And the practical Christian has become a Jew again.

   It was only in appearance that Christianity overcame real Judaism. It was too refinedtheoretical fashion, the alienation of man from himself and from nature.

   It was only then that Judaism could attain universal domination and could turn alienated man and alienated nature into alienable, saleable objects, in thrall to egoistic need and huckstering.

   Objectification is the practice of alienation. Just as man, so long as he is engrossed in religion, can only objectify his essence by an alien and fantastic being; so under the sway of egoistic need, he can only affirm himself and produce objects in practice by subordinating his products and his own activity to the domination of an alien entity, and by attributing to them the significance of an alien entity, namely money.

   In its perfected. practice the spiritual egoism of Christianity nec­ essarily becomes the material egoism of the Jew, celestial need is transmuted into terrestrial need, subjectivism into self-interest. The tenacity of the Jew is to be explained, not by his religion, but rather by the human basis of his religion-practical need and egoism.

   It is because the essence of the Jew was universally realized and secularized in civil society, that civil society could not convince the Jew of the unreality of his religious essence, which is precisely the ideal representation of practical need. It is not only, therdore, in the Pentateuch and the Talmud, but also in contemporary society, that we find the essence of the present-day Jew; not as an abstract essence, but as one which is supremely empirical, not only as a limitation of the Jew, but as the Jewish narrowness of society.

   As soon as society succeeds in abolishing the empirical essence of Judaism-huckstering and its conditions-the Jew becomes impossible, because his consciousness no longer has an object. The subjective basis of Judaism-practical need-assumes a human form, and the conflict between the inaividual, sensuous existence of man and his species-existence, is abolished.

   The social emancipation of the Jew is the emancipation of society from Judaism.

                        Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's

                           Philosophy of Right: Introduction

                                         KARL MARX

   Written at the close of 1843 and published in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbuche in 1844, this essay is a consummate expression of the radical mind. It proclaims the need for a ""radical revolution"" as the way to man's self-realization. Germany is taken as the focal point of this revolution, and the proletariat-the concept of which makes its first appearance in Marx's writings here-as its class vehicle. In August 1844 Marx sent a copy of the essay to Ludwig Feuerbach along with a long letter expressing love and respect for that thinker, whose writing had provided, he wrote, a ""philosophical foundation for socialism"" by bringing the idea of the human species from ""the heaven of abstraction to the real earth."" Feuerbach's influence, along with that of Hegel, is clearly visible in the essay.

   For Germany, the cristicism of religion has been largely completed; and the criticism of religion is the premise of all criticism.

   The profane existence of error is compromised once its celestial oratio pro aris et focis has been refuted. Man, who has found in the fantastic reality of heaven, where he sought a supernatural being, only his own reflection, will no longer be tempted to find only the semblance of himself-a non-human being-where he seeks and must seek his true reality.

   The basis of irreligious criticism is this: man makes religion; religion does not make man. Religion is indeed man's self­ consciousness and self-awareness so long as he has not found him­ self or has lost himself again. But man is not an abstract being, squatting outside the world. Man is the human world, the state. This state, this society, produce religion which is an inverted world consciousness, because they are an inverted world. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopedic com­ pendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d'honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, its general basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human being inasmuch as the human being possesses no true reality. The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly a struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion.

   Religious suffering is at the same time an expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the sentiment of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.

   The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of men, is a demand for their real happiness. The call to abandon their illusions about their condition is a call to abandon a condition which requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, the embryonic criticism of this vale of tears of which religion is the I halo.

   Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers from the chain, not in order that man shall bear the chain without caprice or consolation but so that he shall cast off the chain and pluck the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man so that he will think, act and fashion his reality as a man who has lost his illusions and regained his reason; so that he will revolve about himself as his true sun. Religion is only the illusory sun about which man revolves so long as he does not revolve about himself.

   It is the task of history, therefore, once the other-world of truth has vanished, to establish the truth of this world. The immediate task of philosophy, which is in the service of history, is to unmask human self-alienation in its secular form now that it has been unmasked in its sacred form. Thus the criticism of heaven is trans-­ formed into the criticism of earth, the criticism of religion into the criticism of law and the criticism of theology into the criticism of politics.

   The following exposition1-which is a contribution to this undertaking-does not deal directly with the original but with a copy, the German philosophy of the state and of right, for the simple reason that it deals with Germany.

   If one were to begin with the status quo itself in Germany, even in the most appropriate way, i .e. negatively, the result would still be an anachronism. Even the negation of our political present is already a dusty fact in the historical lumber room of modern nations. I may negate powdered wigs, but I am still left with unpowdered wigs. If I negate the German situation of 1843 I have, according to French chronology, hardly reached the year 1789, and still less the vital centre of the present day.

   German history, indeed, prides itself upon a development which no other nation had previously accomplished, or will ever imitate in the historical sphere. We have shared in the restorations of modern nations without ever sharing in their revolutions . We have been restored, first because other nations have dared to make revolutions, and secondly because other nations have suffered counter­ revolutions; in the first case because our masters were afraid, and in the second case because they were not afraid. Led by our shep­ herds, we have only once kept company with liberty and that was on the day of its internment.

   A school of thought, which justifies the infamy of today by that of yesterday, which regards every cry from the serf under the knout as a cry of rebellion once the knout has become time-honoured, ancestral and historical, a school for which history shows only its a posteriori as the God of Israel did for his servant Moses-the Historical school of law2-might be supposed to have invented German history, if it were not in fact itself an invention of German history, A Shylock, but a servile Shylock, it swears upon its bond, its historical, Christian-Germanic bond, for every pound of flesh cut from the heart of the people.

   On the other hand, good-natured enthusiasts, German chauvinists by temperament and enlightened liberals by reflection, seek our history of liberty beyond our history, in the primeval Teutonic forests. But how does the history of our liberty differ from the history of the wild boar's liberty, if it is only to be found in the forests? And as the proverb has it: what is shouted into the forest, the forest echoes back. So peace upon the primeval Teutonic forests!

   But war upon the state of affairs in Germany! By all means ! This state of affairs is beneath the level of history, beneath all criticism; nevertheless it remains an object of criticism just as the criminal who is beneath h umanity remains an object of the executioner. In its struggle against this state of affairs criticism is not a passion of the head, but the head of passion. It is not a lancet but a weapon. Its object is an enemy which it aims not to refute but to destroy. For the spirit of this state of affairs has already been refuted. It is not, in itself, an object worthy of our thought; it is an existence as contemptible as it is despised. Criticism itself has no need of any further elucidation of this object, for it has already understood it. Criticism is no longer an end in itself, but simply a means; indignation is its essential mode of feeling, and denunciation its principal task.

   It is a matter of depicting the stifling pressure which the different social spheres exert upon other, the universal but passive ill-humour, the complacent but self-deluding narrowness of spirit; all this incorporated in a system of government which lives by conserving this paltriness, and is itself paltriness in government.

     What a spectacle! Society is infinitely divided into the most diverse races, which confront each other with their petty antipathies, bad conscience and coarse mediocrity; and which, precisely because of their ambiguous and mistrustful situation, are treated without exception, though in different ways, as merely tolerated existences by their masters. And they are forced to recognize and acknowledge this fact of being dominated, governed and possessed, as a concession from heaven! On the other side are the rulers themselves, whose greatness is in inverse proportion to their number.

     The criticism which deals with this subject-matter is criticism in a hand-to-hand fight; and in such a fight it is of no interest to know whether the adversary is of the same rank, is noble or interesting-all that matters is to strike him. It is a question of denying the Germans an instant of illusion or resignation. The burden must be made still more irksome by awakening a consciousness of it, and shame must be made more shameful still by rendering it public. Every sphere of German society must be depicted as the partie Honteuse of German society; and these petrified social conditions must be made to dance by singing their own melody to them. The nation must be taught to be terrified of itself, in order to give it courage. In this way an imperious need of the German nation will be satisfied, and the needs of nations are themselves the final causes of their satisfaction.

   Even for the modern nations this struggle against the limited character of the German status quo does not lack interest; for the German status quo is the open consummation of the ancient régime, and the ancien régime is the hidden defect of the modern state.The struggle against the political present of the Germans is a struggle against the past of the modern nations, who are still continually importuned by the reminiscences of this past. It is instructive for the modern nations to see the ancien régime, which has played a tragic part in their history, play a comic part as a German ghost. The ancien régime had a tragic history, so long as it was the established power in the world while liberty was a personal fancy; in short, so long as it believed and had to believe in its own validity. So long as the ancien régime, as an existing world order, struggled against a new world which was just coming into existence, there was on its side a historical error but no personal error. Its decline was, therefore, tragic.

     The present German regime, on the other hand, which is an anachronism, a flagrant contradiction of universally accepted axioms-the nullity of the ancien régime revealed to the whole world-only imagines that it believes in itself and asks the world to share its illusion. If it believed in its own nature would it attempt to hide it beneath the semblance of an alien nature and look for its salvation in hypocrisy and sophistry? The modern ancien régime is the comedian of a world order whose real heroes are dead. History is thorough, and it goes through many stages when it conducts an ancient formation to its grave. The last stage of a world-historical formation is comedy. The Greek gods, already once mortally wounded in Aeschylus' tragedy Prometheus Bound, had to endure a second death, a comic death, in Lucian's dialogues. Why should history proceed in this way? So that mankind shall separate itself gladly from its past. We claim this joyful historical destiny for the political powers of Germany.

     But as soon as criticism concerns itself with modern social and political reality, and thus arrives at genuine human problems, it must either go outside the German status quo or approach its object indirectly. For example, the relation of industry, of the world of wealth in general, to the political world is a major prob­lem of modern times. In what form does this problem begin to preoccupy the Germans? In the form of protective tariffs, the system of prohibition, the national economy. German chauvinism has passed from men to matter, so that one fine day our knights of cotton and heroes of iron found themselves metamorphosed into patriots. The sovereignty of monopoly within the country has begun to be recognized since sovereignty vis-á-vis foreign countries was attributed to it. In Germany, therefore, a beginning is made with what came as the conclusion •in France and England. The old, rotten order against which these nations revolt in their theories, and which they bear only as chains are borne, is hailed in Germany as the dawn of a glorious future which as yet hardly dares to move from a cunning3 theory to a ruthless practice. While in France and England the problem is put in the form : political economy or the rule of society over wealth; in Germany it is put in the form : national economy or the rule of private property over nationality. Thus, in England and France it is a question of abolishing monop-oly, which has developed to its final consequences; while in Ger­many it is a question of proceeding to the final consequences of monopoly. There it is a question of the solution; here, only a ques­tion of the collision. We can see very well from this example how modem problems are presented in Germany; the example shows that our history, like a raw recruit, has so far only had to do extra drill on old and hackneyed historical matters.

     If the whole of German development were at the level of German political development, a German could have no greater part in contemporary problems than can a Russian. If the individual is not restricted by the limitations of his country, still less is the nation liberated by the liberation of one indivdual. The fact that a Scythian was one of the Greek philosophers>sup>4 did not enable the Scythians to advance a single step towards Greek culture.

     Fortunately, we Germans are not Scythians .

       Just as the nations of the ancient world lived their pre-history in the imagination, in mythology, so we Germans have lived our post-history in thought, in philosophy. We are the philosophical contemporaries of the present day without being its historical contemporaries. German philosophy is the ideal prolongation of German history.When, therefore, we criticize, instead of the oeuvres incompletes of our real history, the oeuvres posthumes of our ideal history-philosophy, our criticism stands at the centre of the problems of which the present age says : that is the question. That which constitutes, for the advanced nations, a practical break With modern political conditions, is in Germany where these condi­tions do not yet exist, virtually a critical break with their philosophical reflection.

     The German philosophy of right and of the state is the only German history which is al pari with the official modern times. The German nation is obliged, therefore, to connect its dream history with its present conditions, and to subject to criticism not only these existing conditions but also their abstract continuation. Its future cannot be restricted either to the direct negation of its real juridical and political circumstances, or to the direct realization of its ideal juridical and political circumstances. The direct negation of its real circumstances already exists in its ideal circumstances, while it has almost outlived the realization of its ideal circumstances in the contemplation of neighbouring nations. It is with good reason, therefore, that the practical political party in Germany demands the negation of philosophy. Its error does not consist in formulating this demand, but in limiting itself to a demand which it does not, and cannot, make effective. It supposes that it can achieve this negation by turning its back on philosophy, lookingelsewhere, and murmuring a few trite and ill-humoured phrases. Because of its narrow outlook it does not take account of philosophy as part of German reality, and even regards philosophy as beneath the level of German practical life and its theories. You demand as a point of departure real germs of life, but you forget that the real germ of life of the German nation has so far sprouted only in its cranium. In short, you cannot abolish philosophy without realizing it.

     The same error was committed, but in the opposite direction, by the theoretical party which originated in philosophy.

     In the present struggle, this party saw only the critical struggle of philosophy against the German world. It did not consider that previous philosophy itself belongs to this world and is its complement, even if only an ideal complement. Critical as regards its counterpart, it was not self-critical. It took as its point of departure the presuppositions of philosophy; and either accepted the conclusions which philosophy had reached or else presented as direct philosophical demands and conclusions, demands and conclusions drawn from elsewhere. But these latter-assuming their legitimacy-can only be achieved by the negation of previous philosophy, that is, philosophy as philosophy. We shall provide later a more compre­hensive account of this party. Its principal defect may be summarized as follows : it believed that it could realize philosophy without abolishing it.

     The criticism of the German philosophy of right and of the state  which was given its most logical, profound and complete expression by Hegel, is at once the critical analysis of the modern state and of the reality connected with it, and the definitive negation of all the past forms of consciousness in German jurisprudence and politics, whose most distinguished and most general expression, raised to the level of a science, is precisely the speculative philosophy of right. If it was only Germany which could produce the speculative philosophy of right-this extravagant and abstract thought about the modern state, the reality of which remains in the beyond ( even if this beyond is only across the Rhine ) -the German representative of the modern state, on the contrary, which leaves out of account the real man was itself only possible because, and to the extent that, the modern state itself  leaves the real man out of account or only satisfies the whole man in an illusory way. In politics, the Ger­mans have thought what other nations have done. Germany has been their theoretical consciousness. The abstraction and presumption of its philosophy was in step with the partial and stunted char­acter of their reality. If, therefore, the status quo of the German political system expresses the consummation of the ancien régime, the thorn in the flesh of the modern state, the status quo of German political science expresses the imperfection of the modern state itself, the degeneracy of its flesh.

     As the determined adversary of the previous form of German political consciousness, the criticism of the speculative philosophy of right does not remain within its own sphere, but leads on to tasks which can only be solved by means of practical activity.

     The question then arises: can Germany attain a practical activity a la hauteur des principles; that is to say, a revolution which will raise it not only to the official level of the modern nations, but to the human level which will be the immediate future of those nations.

     It is clear that the arm of criticism cannot replace the criticism of arms. Material force can only be overthrown by material force; but theory itself becomes a material force when it has seized the masses. Theory is capable of seizing the masses when it demon-strates ad hominem, and it demonstrates ad hominem as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to grasp things by the root. But for man the root is man himself. What proves beyond doubt the radicalism of German theory, and thus its practical energy, is that it begins from the resolute positive abolition of religion. The criti­cism of religion ends with the doctrine that man is the supreme being for man. It ends, therefore, with the categorical imperative to overthrow all those conditions in which man is an abased, enslaved, abandoned, contemptible being-conditions which can hardly be better described than in the exclamation of a Frenchman on the occasion of a proposed tax upon dogs : ""'Wretched dogs! They want to treat you like men!""

     Even from the historical standpoint theoretical emancipation has a specific practical importance for Germany. In fact Germany's revolutionary past is theoretical-it is the Reformation. In that period the revolution originated in the brain of a monk, today in the brain of the philosopher.

     Luther, without question, overcame servitude through devotion but only by substituting servitude through conviction. He shattered the faith in authority by restoring the authority of faith. He transformed the priests into laymen by turning laymen into priests . He liberated man from external religiosity by making religiosity the innermost essence of man. He liberated the body from its chains because he fettered the heart with chains.

     But if Protestantism was not the solution it did at least pose the problem correctly. It was no longer a question, thereafter, of the layman's struggle against the priest outside himself, but of his struggle against his own internal priest, against his own priestly nature. And if the Protestant metamorphosis of German laymen into priests emancipated the lay popes-the princes together withtheir clergy, the privileged and the philistines-the philosophical metamorphosis of the priestly Germans into men will emancipate the people. But just as emancipation will not be confined to princes, so the secularization of property will not be limited to the confiscation of church property, which was practised especially by hypocritical Prussia. At that time, the Peasant War, the most radical event in German history, came to grief because of theology.

     Today, when theology itself has come to grief, the most unfree phenomenon in German history-our status quo-will be shattered by philosophy. On the eve of the Reformation official Germany was the most abject servant of Rome. On the eve of its revolution Germany is the abject servant of those who are far inferior to Rome; of Prussia and Austria, of petty squires and philistines.

     But a radical revolution in Germany seems to encounter a major difficulty.

     Revolutions need a passive element, a material basis. Theory is only realized in a people so far as it fulfils the needs of the people. Will there correspond to the monstrous discrepancy between the demands of German thought and the answers of German reality a similar discrepancy between civil society and the state, and within civil society itself? Will theoretical needs be directly practical needs? It is not enough that thought should seek to realize itself; reality must also strive towards thought.

     But Germany has not passed through the intermediate stage of political emancipation at the same time as the modern nations. It has not yet attflined in practice those stages which it has transcended in theory. How could Germany, in salta mortale, surmount not only its own barriers but also those of the modern nations, that is, those barriers which it must in reality experience and strive for as an emancipation from its own real barriers? A radical revolution can only be a revolution of radical needs, for which the conditions and breeding ground appear to be lacking.

     But if Germany accompanied the development of the modern nations only through the abstract activity of thought, without taking an active part in the real struggles of this development, it has also experienced the pains of this development without sharing in its pleasures and partial satisfactions. The abstract activity on one side has its counterpart in the abstract suffering on the other. And one fine day Germany will find itself at the level of the European decadence, before ever having attained the level of European emancipation. It will be comparable to a fetishist who is sickening from the diseases of Christianity.

     If the German governments are examined it will be found that the circumstances of the time, the situation of Germany, the outlook of German culture, and lastly their own fortunate instinct, all drive them to combine the civilized deficiencies of the modern political world (whose advantages we do not enjoy) with the barbarous deficiencies of the ancien régime (which we enjoy in full measure); so that Germany must participate more and more, if not in the reason at least in the unreason of those political systems which transcend its status quo. Is there, for example, any country in the whole world which shares with such naivete as so-called constitutional Germany all the illusions of the constitutional régime without sharing its realities? And was it not, of necessity, a German government which had the idea of combining the torments of cen­sorship with the torments of the French September laws5 which presuppose the liberty of the Press? Just as the gods of all the nations were to be found in the Roman Pantheon, so there will be found in the Holy Roman German Empire an the sins of all the forms of State. That this eclecticism will attain an unprecedented degree is assured in particular by the politico-aesthetic gourmandise of a German king who proposes to play all the roles of royalty feudal or bureaucratic, absolute or constitutional, autocratic or democratic-if not in the person of the people at least in his own person, and if not for the people, at least for himself Germany, as the deficiency of present-day politics constituted into a system, will not be able to demolish the specific German barriers without demolishing the general barriers of present-day politics.

     It is not radical revolution,universal human emancipation, which is a Utopian dream for Germany, but rather a partial, merely political revolution which leaves the pillars of the building standing. What is the basis of a partial, merely political revolution? Simply this: a section of civil society emancipates itself and attains universal domination; a determinate class undertakes, from its particular situation, a general emancipation of society. This class emancipates society as a whole, but only on condition that the whole of society is in the same situation as this class; for example, that it possesses or can easily acquire money or culture.

     No class in civil society can play this part unless it can arouse, in itself and in the masses, a moment of enthusiasm in which it associates and mingles with society at large, identifies itself with it, and is felt and recognized as the general representative of this society. Its aims and interests must genuinely be the aims and interests of society itself, of which it becomes in reality the social head and heart. It is only in the name of general interests that a particular class can claim general supremacy. In order to attain this liberating position, and the political direction of all spheres of society, revolutionary energy and consciousness of its own power do not suffice. For a popular revolution and the emancipation of a particular class of civil society to coincide, for one class to represent the whole of society, another class must concentrate in itself all the evils of society, a particular class must embody and represent a general obstacle and limitation. A particular social sphere must be regarded as the notorious crime of the whole society, so that emancipation from this sphere appears as a general emancipation. For one class to be the liberating class par excellence, it is necessary that another class should be openly the oppressing class. The negative significance of the French nobility and clergy produced the positive significance of the bourgeoisie, the class which stood next to them and opposed them.

      But in Germany every class lacks the logic, insight, courage and clarity which would make it a negative representative of society. Moreover, there is also lacking in every class the generosity of spirit which identifies itself, if only for a moment, with the popular mind; that genius which pushes material force to political power, that revolutionary daring which throws at its adversary the defiant phrase: I am nothing and I should be everything. The essence of German morality and honour, in classes as in individuals, is a modest egoism which displays, and allows others to display, its own narrowness. The relation between the different spheres of German society is, therefore, not dramatic, but epic. Each of these spheres begins to be aware of itself and to establish itself beside the others, not from the moment when it is oppressed, but from the moment that circumstances, without any action of its own, have created a new sphere which it can in turn oppress. Even the moral sentiment of the German middle class  has no other basis than the consciousness of being the representative of the narrow and limited mediocrity of all the other classes. It is not only the German kings, therefore, who ascend their thrones mal a propos. Each sphere of civil society suffers a defeat before gaining the victory; it erects its own barrier before having destroyed the barrier which opposes it; it displays the narrowness of its views before having displayed their generosity, and thus every opportunity of playing an important role has passed before it properly existed, and each class, at the very moment when it begins its struggle against the class above it, remains involved in a struggle against the class beneath. For this reason, the princes are in conflict with the monarch, the bureaucracy with the nobility, the bourgeoisie with all of them, while the proletariat is already beginning its struggle with the bourgeoisie. The middle class hardly dares to conceive the idea of emancipation from its own point of view before• the development of social conditions, and the progress of political theory, show that this point of view is already antiquated, or at least disputable.

     In France it is enough to be something in order to desire to be everything. In Germany no one has the right to be anything without first renouncing everything. In France partial emancipation is a basis for complete emancipation. In Germany complete emancipation is a conditio sine qua non for any partial emancipation. In France it is the reality, in Germany the impossibility, of a progressive emancipation which must give birth to complete liberty. In France every class of the population is politically idealistic and con­siders itself first of all, not as a particular class, but as the representative of the general needs of society. The role of liberator can, therefore, pass successively in a dramatic movement to different classes in the population, until it finally reaches the class which achieves social freedom; no longer assuming certain conditions external to man, which are none the less created by human society, but organizing all the conditions of human life on the basis of social freedom. In Germany, on the contrary, where practical life is as little intellectual as intellectual life is practical, no class of civil society feels the need for, or the ability to achieve, a general eman­cipation, until it is forced to it by its immediate situation, by materia necessity and by its fetters themselves.

     Where is there, then, a real possibility of emancipation in Germany?

     This is our reply. A class must be formed which has radical chains, a class in civil society which is not a class of civil society, a class which is the dissolution of all classes, a sphere of society which has a universal character because its sufferings are universal, and which does not claim a particular redress because the wrong which is done to it is not a particular wrong but wrong in general. There must be formed a sphere of society which claims no tradi­tional status but only a human status, a sphere which is not opposed to particular consequences but is totally opposed to the assumptions of the German political system; a sphere, finally, which cannot emancipate itself without emancipating itself from all the other spheres of society, without, therefore, emancipating all these other spheres, which is, in short, a total loss of humanity and which can only redeem itself by a total redemption of humanity. This dissolution of society, as a particular class, is the proletariat.

     The proletariat is only beginning to form itself in Germany, as a result of the industrial movement. For what constitutes the proletariat is not naturally existing poverty, but poverty artificially produced, is not the mass of people mechanically oppressed by the weight of society, but the mass resulting from the disintegration of society and above all from the disintegration of the middle class. Needless to say, however, the numbers of the proletariat are also increased by the victims of natural poverty and of Christian-Germanic serfdom.

     When the proletariat announces the dissolution of the existing social order, it only declares the secret of its own existence, for it is the effective dissolution of this order. When the proletariat demands the negation of private property it only lays down as a principle for society what society has already made a principle for the proletariat, and what the latter already involuntarily embodies as the negative result of society. Thus the proletarian has the same right, in relation to the new world which is coming into being, as the German king  has in relation to the existing world when he calls the people his people or a horse his horse. In calling the people his private property the king simply declares that the owner of private property is king.

     Just as philosophy finds its material weapons in the proletariat, so the proletariat finds its intellectual weapons in philosophy. And once the lightning of thought has penetrated deeply into this virgin soil of the people, the Germans will emancipate themselves and become men.

     Let us sum up these results. The emancipation of Germany is only possible in practice if one adopts the point of view of that theory according to which man is the highest being for man. Germany will not be able to emancipate itself from the Middle ages unless it emancipates itself at the same time from the partial victories over the Middle Ages. In Germany no type of enslavement can be abolished unless all enslavement is destroyed. Germany, which likes to get to the bottom of things, can only make a revolution which upsets the whole order of things. The emancipation of Germany will be an emancipation of man. Philosophy is the head of this emancipation and the proletariat is its heart. Philosophy can only be realized by the abolition 6 of the proletariat, and the proletariat can only be abolished by the realization of philosophy.

     When all the inner conditions ripen, the day of German resurrection will be proclaimed by the crowing of the Gallic cock.7

                                       Economic and Philosophic
                                           Manuscripts of 1844
                                                  KARL MARX

      Soon after moving to Paris in November, 1843, Marx applied himself to the criticism of political economy-the new phase of his critical program foreshadowed in his two essays in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher. Between April and August of 1844 he produced the rough draft of what, judging by his preface, Was to have been a book. He did not finish it for publication, however, and it lay unpublished for more than eighty years. The surviving parts, comprising four manuscripts, were given the name shown above. An incomplete version in Russian translation was published in Moscow in 1927. The first full edition in German, prepared by D. Riazanov of the Marx•Engels Institute in Moscow, was published in Berlin in 1932, in Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Historisch-kritische Gesamtausgabe.

      The fundamentals of the Marxist interpretation of history are to be found in the 1844 manuscripts, including the notion of the proletarian revolution and future communism as the goal of the historical process. The theory is set forth, however, in terms of philosophical concepts drawn by Marx from Hegel and Feuerbach, most notably the concept of man's ""self-alienation"" or ""self-estrangement."" History, particularly under modern capitalism, is seen as a story of man's alienation in his life as producer, and communism is presented as the final transcendence of alienation via a revolution against private property. Because the 1844 manuscripts show us Marxism at the moment of its genesis in Marx's mind and because they help to clarify both the relation of Marxism to earlier German philosophy and its ethical significance, their publication has profoundly affected schoolarship on Marx and Marxism in our time.

      A part of the manuscripts consists largely of excerpts from writings of the political economists on such topics as wages of labor, profit of capital, and rent of land. The material reprinted here, comprising the extant portions in which Marx expounds his own position, consists of the preface and the sections entitled ""Estranged Labour,"" ""Private Property and Communism,"" ""The Meaning of Human Requirements,"" ""The Power of Money in Bourgeois Society,"" and ""Critique of the Hegelian Dialectic and Philosophy as a Whole.""

      A number of passages in the manuscripts have been crossed out, apparently by Marx. There is no reason to think that the passages crossed out had ceased to represent what Marx thought. He may well have been guided by editorial considerations in working over the draft of a manuscript originally intended for publication.*

                                                Preface

      I have already given notice in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher of the critique of jurisprudence and political science in the form of a critique of the Hegelian Philosophy of Right. In the course of elaboration for publication, the intermingling of criticism directed only against speculation with criticism of the various subjects themselves proved utterly unsuitable, hampering the development of the argument and rendering comprehension difficult. Moreover the wealth and diversity of the subjects to be treated, could have been compressed into one work only in a purely aphoristic style; whilst an aphoristic presentation of this kind, for its part, would have given the impression of arbitrary systematizing. I shall therefore issue the critique of law, ethics, politics, etc., in a series of distinct, independent pamphlets, and at the end try in a special work to present them again as a connected whole showing the interrelationship of the separate parts, and finally, shall make a critique of the speculative elaboration of that material. For this reason it will be found that the interconnection between political economy and the state, law, ethics, civil life, etc., is touched on in the present work only to the extent to which political economy itself ex professo1 touches on these subjects.

      It is hardly necessary to assure the reader conversant with political economy that my results have been won by means of a wholly empirical analysis based on a conscientious critical study of political economy.

      [Whereas the uninformed reviewer who ""tries to hide his complete ignorance and intellectual poverty by hurling the ""utopian phrase"" at the positive critic's head, or again such phrases as ""pure, resolute, utterly critical criticism,"" the ""not merely legal but social-utterly social-society,"" the ""compact, massy mass,"" the ""oratorical orators of the massy mass,""2 this reviewer has yet to fur"" nish the first proof that besides his theological family-affairs he has anything to contribute to a discussion of worldly matters.

      It goes without saying that besides the French and English Socialists I have made use of German socialist works as well. The only original German works of substance in this science, however-other than Weitling's writings-are the essays by Hess published in Einundzwanzig Bogen,4 and Engels Umrisse ZlL einer Kritik der Nationalokonomie5 in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher where, likewise, I indicated in a very general way the basic elements of this work.

      [Besides being indebted to these authors who have given critical attention to political economy, positive criticism as a whole-and therefore also German positive criticism of political economy¬owes its true foundation to the discoveries of Feuerbach, against whose Philosophie der Zukunft6 and Thesen zur Reform der Philosophie7 in the Anecdotis,8 despite the tacit use that is made of them, the petty envy of some and the veritable wrath of others seem to have instigated a regular conspiracy of silence.]

     It is only with Feuerbach that positive, humanistic and naturalistic criticism begins. The less noise they make, the more certain, profound, widespread and enduring is the effect of Feuerbach's writings, the only writings since Hegel's Phanomenologie and Logik to contain a real theoretical revolution.

     In contrast to the critical theologians9 of our day, I have deemed the concluding chapter of the present work-the settling of accounts with Hegelian dialectic and Hegelian philosophy as a whole-to be absolutely necessary, a task not yet performed. This lack of thoroughness is not accidental, since even the critical theologian remains a theologian. Hence, either he had to start from certain presuppositions of. philosophy accepted as authoritative; or if in the process of criticism and as a result of other people's discoveries doubts about these philosophical presuppositions have arisen in him, he abandons them without vindication and in a cowardly fashion, abstracts from them showing his servile dependence on these presuppositions and his resentment at this dependence merely in a negative, unconscious and sophistical manner.

      [In this connection the critical theologian is either forever repeating assurances about the purity of his own criticism, or tries to make it seem as though all that was left for criticism to deal with now was some other immature form of criticism outside itself-say eighteenth-century criticism-and the backwardness of the masses, in order to divert the observer's attention as well as his own from the necessary task of settling accounts between criticism and its point of origin-Hegelian dialectic and German philosophy as a whole-from this necessary raising of modern criticism above its own limitation and crudity. Eventually, however, whenever discoveries (such as Feuerbach's) are made about the nature of his own philosophic presuppositions, the critical theologian partly makes it appear as if he were the one who had accomplished this, producing that appearance by taking the results of these discoveries and, without being able to develop them, hurling them in the form of catch-phrases at writers still caught in the confines of philosophy; partly he even manages to acquire a sense of his own superiority to such discoveries by covertly asserting in a veiled, malicious and sceptical fashion elements of the Hegelian dialectic which he still finds lacking in the criticism of that dialectic (which have not yet been critically served up to him for his use) against such criticism-not having tried to bring such elements into their proper relation or having been capable of doing so, asserting, say, the category of mediating proof against the category of positive, selforiginating truth, etc., in a way peculiar to Hegelian dialectic. For to the theological critic it seems quite natural that everything has to be done by philosophy, so that he can chatter away about purity, resoluteness, and utterly critical criticism; and he fancies himself the true conqueror of philosophy whenever he happens to feel some ""moment"" in Hegel1 to be lacking in Feuerbach-for however much he practises the spiritual idolatry of ""self-consciousness"" and ""mind"" the theological critic does not get beyond feeling to consciousness.] 2

     On close inspection theological criticism-genuinely progressive though it was at the inception of the movement-is seen in the final analysis to be nothing but the culmination and consequence of the old philosophical, and especially the Hegelian, transcendentalism, twisted into a theological caricature. This interesting example of the justice in history, which now assigns to theology, ever philosophy's spot of infection, the further role of portraying in itself the negative dissolution of philosophy-i.e., the process of its decay-this historical nemesis I shall demonstrate on another occasion.

      [How far, on the other hand, Feuerbach's discoveries about the nature of philosophy required still, for their proof at least, a critical settling of accounts with philosophical dialectic will be seen from my exposition itself.]

                                              Estranged Labour3

      We have proceeded from the premises of political economy. We have accepted its language and its laws. We presupposed private property, the separation of labour, capital and land, and of wages, profit of capital and rent of land-likewise division of labour, competition, the concept of exchange-value, etc. On the basis of political economy itself, in its own words, we have shown that the worker sinks to the level of a commodity and becomes indeed the  most wretched of commodities; that the wretchedness of the worker is in inverse proportion to the power and magnitude of his production; that the necessary result of competition is the accumu¬lation of capital in a few hands, and thus the restoration of monopoly in a more terrible form; that finally the distinction between capitalist and land-rentier, like that between the tiller of the soil and the factory-worker, disappears and that the whole of society must I fall apart into the two classes-the property-owners and the propertyless workers.

     Political economy proceeds from the fact of private property, but it does not explain it to us. It expresses in general, abstract formulae the material process through which private property actually passes, and these formulae it then takes for laws. It does not comprehend these laws-i.e., it does not demonstrate how they arise from the very nature of private property. Political economy does not disclose the source of the division between labour and capital, and between capital and land. When, for example, it defines the relationship of wages to profit, it takes the interest of the capitalists to be the ultimate cause; i.e., it takes for granted what it is supposed to evolve. Similarly, competition comes in everywhere. It is explained from external circumstances. As to how far these external and apparently fortuitous circumstances are but the expression of a necessary course of development, political economy teaches us nothing. We have seen how, to it, exchange itself appears to be afortuitous fact. The only wheels which political economy sets in  motion are avarice and the war amongst the avaricious competition.

     Precisely because political economy does not grasp the connections within the movement, it was possible to counterpose, for instance, the doctrine of competition to the doctrine of monopoly, the doctrine of craft-liberty to the doctrine of the corporation, the doctrine of the division of landed property to the doctrine of the big estate-for competition, craft-liberty and the division of landed property were explained and comprehended only as fortuitous, premeditated and violent consequences of monopoly, the corporation; and feudal property, not as their necessary, inevitable and natural consequences.

      Now, therefore, we have to grasp the essential connection between private property, avarice, and the separation of labour, capital and landed property; between exchange and competition, value and the devaluation of men, monopoly and competition, etc.; the connection between this whole estrangement and the money system.

     Do not let us go back to a fictitious primordial condition as the political economist does, when he tries to explain. Such a primor dial condition explains nothing. He merely pushes the question away into a grey nebulous distance. He assumes in the form of fact, of an event, what he is supposed to deduce-namely, the necessary relationship between two things-between, for example, division of labour and exchange. Theology in the same way explains the origin of evil by the fall of man: that is, it assumes as a fact, in historical form, what has to be explained.

     We proceed from an actual economic fact.

     The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces, the more his production increases in power and range. The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates. With the increasing value of the world of things proceeds in direct proportion the devaluation of the world of men. Labour produces not only commodities; it produces itself and the worker as a commodity-and does so in the proportion in which it produces commodities generally.

     This fact expresses merely that the object which labour produces-labour's product-confronts it as something alien, as a power independent of the producer. The product of labour is labour which has been congealed in an object, which has become material: it is the objectification of labour. Labour's realization is its objectification. In the conditions dealt with by political economy this realization of labour appears as loss of reality for the workers; objectification as loss of the object and object-bondage; appropriation as estrangement, as alienation.4

     So much does labour's realization appear as loss of reality that the worker loses reality to the point of starving to death. So much does objectification appear as loss of the object that the worker is robbed of the objects most necessary not only for his life but for his work. Indeed, labour itself becomes an object which he can get hold of only with the greatest effort and with the most irregular interruptions. So much does the appropriation of the object appear as estrangement that the more objects the worker produces the fewer can he possess and the more he falls under the dominion of his product, capital.

     All these consequences are contained in the definition that the worker is related to the product of his labour as to an alien object. For on this premise it is clear that the more the worker spends himself, the more powerful the alien objective world becomes which he creates over-against himself, the poorer he himself-his inner world-becomes, the less belongs to him as his own. It is the same in religion. The more man puts into God, the less he retains in himself. The worker puts his life into the object; but now his life no longer belongs to him but to the object. Hence, the greater this activity, the greater is the worker's lack of objects. Whatever the product of his labour is, he is not. Therefore the greater this product, the less is he himself. The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labour becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power of its own confronting him; it means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien.

     Let us now look more closely at the objectification, at the production of the worker; and therein at the estrangement, the loss of the object, his product.

     The worker can create nothing without nature, without the sensuous external world. It is the material on which his labor is manifested, in which it is active, from which and by means of which it produces.

     But just as nature provides labor with the means of life in the sense that labour cannot live without objects on which to operate, on the other hand, it also provides the means of life in the more restricted sense-i.e., the means for the physical subsistence of the worker himself.

     Thus the more the worker by his labour appropriates the external world, sensuous nature, the more he deprives himself of means of life in the double respect: first, that the sensuous external world more and more ceases to be an object belonging to his labour-to be his labour's means of life; and secondly, that it more and more ceases to be means of life in the immediate sense, means for the physical subsistence of the worker.

     Thus in this double respect the worker becomes a slave of his object, first, in that he receives an object of labour, i.e., in that he receives work; and secondly, in that he receives means of subsistence. Therefore, it enables him to exist, first, as a worker; and, second, as a physical subject. The extremity of this bondage is that it is only as a worker that he continues to maintain himself as a physical subject, and that it is only as a physical subject that he is a worker.

      (The laws of political economy express the estrangement of the worker in his object thus: the more the worker produces, the less he has to consume; the more values he creates, the more valueless, the more unworthy he becomes; the better formed his product, the more deformed becomes the worker; the more civilized his object, the more barbarous becomes the worker; the mightier labour becomes, the more powerless becomes the worker; the more ingenious labour becomes, the duller becomes the worker and the more he becomes nature's bondsman.)

     Political economy conceals the estrangement inherent in the nature of labour by not considering the direct relationship between the worker (labour) and production. It is true that labour produces for the rich wonderful things-but for the worker it produces privation. It produces palaces-but for the worker, hovels. It produces beauty-but for the worker, deformity. It replaces labour by machines-but some of the workers it throws back to a barbarous type of labour, and the other workers it turns into machines. It produces intelligence-but for the worker idiocy, cretinism.

     The direct relationship of labour to its produce is the relationship of the worker to the objects of his production. The relationship of the man of means to the objects of production and to production itself is only a consequence of this first relationship-mid confirms it. We shall consider this other aspect later.

     When we ask, then, what is the essential relationship of labour we are asking about the relationship of the worker to production.

     Till now we have been considering the estrangement, the alienation of the worker only in one of its aspects, i.e., the worker's relationship to the products of his labour. But the estrangement is manifested not only in the result but in the act of production¬within the producing activity itself. How would the worker come to face the product of his activity as a stranger, were it not that in the very act of production he was estranging himself from himself? The product is after all but the summary of the activity of production.

If then the product of labour is alienation, production itself must be active alienation, the alienation of activity, the activity of alienation. In the estrangement of the object of labour is merely summarized the estrangement, the alienation, in the activity of labour itself.

      What, then, constitutes the alienation of labour?

      First, the fact that labour is external to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his essential being; that in his work, therefore, he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He is at home when he is not working, and when he is working he is not at home. His labour is therefore not voluntary, but coerced; it is forced labour. It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need; it is merely a means to satisfy needs external to it. Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, labour is shunned like the plague. External labour, labour in which man alienates himself, is a labour of self-sacrifice, of mortification. Lastly, the external character of labour for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else's, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another. Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination, of the human brain and the human heart, operates independently of the individual-that is, operates on him as an alien, divine or diabolical activity-in the same way the worker's activity is not his spontaneous activity. It belongs to another; it is the loss of his self.

    As a result. therefore, man (the worker) no longer feels himself to be freely active in any but his animal functions-eating, drinking, procreating, or at most in his dwelling and in dressing-up, etc.; and in his human functions he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal. What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal.

    Certainly eating, drinking, procreating, etc., are also genuinely human functions. But in the abstraction which separates them from the sphere of all other human activity and turns them into sole and ultimate ends, they are animal.

      We have considered the act of estranging practical human activity, labour, in two of its aspects. (1) The relation of the worker to the product of labour as an alien object exercising power over him. This relation is at the same time the relation to the sensuous external world, to the objects of nature as an alien world antagonistically opposed to him. (2) The relation of labour to the act of production within the labour process. This relation is the relation of theworker to his own activity as an alien activity not belonging to him; it is activity as suffering, strength as weakness, begetting as emasculating, the worker's own physical and mental energy, his personal life or what is life other than activity-as an activity which is turned against him, neither depends on nor belongs to him. Here we have self-estrangement, as we had previously the estrangement of the thing.

     We have yet a third aspect of estranged labour to deduce from the two already considered.

     Man is a species being, not only because in practice and in theory he adopts the species as his object (his own as well as those of other things), but-and this is only another way of expressing it-but also because he treats himself as the actual, living species; because he treats himself as a universal and therefore a free being.

     The life of the species, both in man and in animals, consists physically in the fact that man (like the animal) lives on inorganic nature; and the more universal man is compared with an animal, the more universal is the sphere of inorganic nature on which he lives. Just as plants, animals, stones, the air, light, etc., constitute a part of human consciousness in the realm of theory, partly as objects of natural science, partly as objects of art-his spiritual inorganic nature, spiritual nourishment which he must first prepare to make it palatable and digestible-so too in the realm of practice they constitute a part of human life and human activity. Physically man lives only on these products of nature, whether they appear in the form of food, heating, clothes, a dwelling, or whatever it may be. The universality of man is in practice manifested precisely in the universality which makes all nature his inorganic body-both inasmuch as nature is (1) his direct means of life, and (2) the material, the object, and the instrument of his life-activity. Nature is man's inorganic body-nature, that is, in so far as it is not itself the human body. Man lives on nature-means that nature is his body, with which he must remain in continuous intercourse if he is not to die. That man's physical and spiritual life is linked to nature means simply that nature is linked to itself, for man is a part of nature.

     In estranging from man (1) nature, and (2) himself, his own active functions, his life-activity, estranged labour estranges the species from man. It turns for him the life of the species into a means of individual life. First it estranges the life of the species and individual life, and secondly it makes individual life in its abstract form the purpose of the life of the species, likewise in its abstract and estranged form.

     For in the first place labour, life-activity, productive life itself, appears to man merely as a means of satisfying a need-the need to maintain the physical existence. Yet the productive life is the life of the species. It is life-engendering life. The whole character of a species-its species character-is contained in the character of its life-activity; and free, conscious activity is man's species character. Life itself appears only as a means to life.

      The animal is immediately identical with its life-activity. It does not distinguish itself from it. It is its life-activity. Man makes his life-activity itself the object of his will and of his consciousness. He has conscious life-activity. It is not a determination with which he directly merges. Conscious life-activity directly distinguishes man from animal life-activity. It is just because of this that he is a species being. Or it is only because he is a species being that he is a Conscious Being, i.e., that his own life is an object for him. Only because of that is his activity free activity. Estranged labour reverses this relationship, so that it is just because man is a conscious being that he makes his life-activity, his essential being, a mere means to his existence.

     In creating an objective world by his practical activity, in working-up inorganic nature, man proves himself a conscious species being, i.e., as a being that treats the species as its own essential being, or that treats itself as a species being. Admittedly animals also produce. They build themselves nests, dwellings, like the bees, beavers, ants, etc. But an animal only produces what it immediately needs for itself or its young. It produces one-sidedly, whilst man produces universally. It produces. only under the dominion of immediate physical need, whilst man produces even when he is free from physical need and only truly produces in freedom therefrom. An animal produces only itself, whilst man reproduces the whole of nature. An animal's product belongs immediately to its physical body, whilst man freely confronts his product. An animal forms things in accordance with the standard and the need of the species to which it belongs, whilst man knows how to produce in accordance with the standard of every species, and knows how to apply everywhere the inherent standard to the object. Man therefore also forms things in accordance with the laws of beauty.

     It is just in the working-up of the objective world, therefore, that man first really proves himself to be a species being. This production is his active species life. Through and because of this production, nature appears as his work and his reality. The object of la bour is, therefore, the objectification of man's species life: for he duplicates himself not only, as in consciousness, intellectually, but also actively, in reality, and therefore he contemplates himself in a world that he has created. In tearing away from man the object of his production, therefore, estranged labour tears from him his species life, his real species objectivity, and transforms his advantage over animals into the disadvantage that his inorganic body, nature, is taken from him.

     Similarly, in degrading spontaneous activity, free activity, to a means, estranged labour makes man's species life a means to his physical existence.

     The consciousness which man has of his species is thus transformed by estrangement in such a way that the species life becomes for him a means.

     Estranged labour turns thus:

      (3) Man's species being, both nature and his spiritual species property, into a being alien to him, into a means to his individual existence. It estranges man's own body from him, as it does external nature and his spiritual essence, his human being.

      (4) An immediate consequence of the fact that man is estranged from the product of his labour, from his life-activity, from his species being is the estrangement of man from man. If a man is confronted by himself, he is confronted by the other man. ""What applies to a man's relation to his work, to the product of his labour and to himself, also holds of a man's relation to the other man, and to the other man's labour and object of labour.

     In fact, the proposition that man's species nature is estranged from him means that one man is estranged from the other, as each of them is from man's essential nature.5

     The estrangement of man, and in fact every relationship in which man stands to himself, is first realized and expressed in the relationship in which a man stands to other men.

     Hence within the relationship of estranged labour each man views the other in accordance with the standard and the position in which he finds himself as a worker.

     We took our departure from a fact of political economy-the estrangement of the worker and his production. We have formulated the concept of this fact-estranged, alienated labour. We have analysed this concept-hence analysing merely a fact of political economy.

      Let us now see, further, how in real life the concept of estranged, alienated labour must express and present itself. If the product of labour is alien to me, if it confronts me as an alien power, to whom, then, does it belong?

     If my own activity does not belong to me, if it is an alien, a coerced activity, to whom, then, does it belong?

     To a being other than me.

     Who is this being?

     The gods? To be sure, in the earliest times the principal production (for example, the building of temples, etc., in Egypt, India and Mexico) appears to be in the service of the gods, and the product belongs to the gods. However, the gods on their own were never the lords of labour. No more was nature. And what a contradiction it would be if, the more man subjugated nature by his labour and the more the miracles of the gods were rendered superfluous by the miracles of industry, the more man were to renounce the joy of production and the enjoyment of the produce in favour of these powers.

     The alien being, to whom labour and the produce of labour belongs, in whose service labour is done and for whose benefit the produce of labour is provided, can only be man himself.

     If the product of labour does not belong to the worker, if it confronts him as an alien power, this can only be because it belongs to some other man than the worker. If the worker's activity is a torment to him, to another it must be delight and his life's joy. Not the gods, not nature, but only man himself can be this alien power over man.

     We must bear in mind the above-stated proposition that man's relation to himself only becomes objective and real for him through his relation to the other man. Thus, if the product of his labour, his labour objectified, is for him an alien, hostile, powerful object independent of him, then his position towards it is such that someone else is master of this object, someone who is alien, hostile, powerful, and independent of him. If his own activity is to him an unfree activity, then he is treating it as activity performed in the service, under the dominion, the coercion and the yoke of another man.

      Every self-estrangement of man from himself and from nature appears in the relation in which he places himself and nature to men other than and differentiated from himself. For this reason religious self-estrangement necessarily appears in the relationship of the layman to the priest, or again to a mediator, etc., since we are here dealing with the intellectual world. In the real practical world self-estrangement can only become manifest through 'the real practical relationship to other men. The medium through which estrangement takes place is itself practical. Thus through estranged labour man not only engenders his relationship to the object and to the act of production as to powers that are alien and hostile to him; he also engenders the relationship in which other men stand to his production and to his product, and the relationship in which he stands to these other men. Just as he begets his own production as the, loss of his reality, as his punishment; just as he begets his own product as a loss, as a product not belonging to him; so he begets the dominion of the one who does not produce over production and over the product. Just as he estranges from himself his own activity, so he confers to the stranger activity which is not his own.

     Till now we have only considered this relationship from the standpoint of the worker and later we shall be considering it also from the standpoint of the non-worker.

     Through estranged, alienated labour, then, the worker produces the relationship to this labour of a man alien to labour and standing outside it. The relationship of the worker to labour engenders the relation to it of the capitalist, or whatever one chooses to call the master of labour. Private property is thus the product, the result, the necessary consequence, of alienated labour, of the external relation of the worker to nature and to himself.

     Private property thus results by analysis from the concept of alienated labour-i.e., of alienated man, of estranged labour, of estranged life, of. estranged man.

     True, it is as a result of the movement of private property  that we have obtained the concept of alienated labour (of alienated life) from political economy. But on analysis of this concept it becomes clear that though private property appears to be the source, the cause of alienated labour, it is really its consequence, just as the gods in the beginning are not the cause but the effect of man's intellectual confusion. Later this relationship becomes reciprocal.

     Only at the very culmination of the development of private property does this, its secret, re-emerge, namely, that on the one hand it is the product of alienated labour, and that secondly it is the means by which labour alienates itself, the realization of this alienation.

     This exposition immediately sheds light on various hitherto unsolved conflicts.

      (1) Political economy starts from labour as the real soul of production; yet to labour it gives nothing, and to private property everything. From this contradiction Proudhon has concluded in favour of labour and against private property. We understand, however, that this apparent contradiction is the contradiction of estranged labour with itself, and that political economy has merely formulated the laws of estranged labour.

     We also understand, therefore, that wages and private property are identical: where the product, the object of labour pays for labour itself, the wage is but a necessary consequence of labour's estrangement, for after all in the wage of labour, labour does not appear as an end in itself but as the servant of the wage. We shall develop this point later, and meanwhile will only deduce some conclusions.

     A forcing-up of wages (disregarding all other difficulties, including the fact that it would only be by force, too, that the higher wages, being an anomaly, could be maintained) would therefore be nothing but better payment for the slave, and would not conquer either for the worker or for labour their human status and dignity.

     Indeed, even the equality of wages demanded by Proudhon only transforms the relationship of the present-day worker to his labour into the relationship of all men to labour. Society is then conceived as an abstract capitalist.

     Wages are a direct consequence of estranged labour, and estranged labour is the direct cause of private property. The downfall of the one aspect must therefore mean the downfall of the other.

      (2) From the relationship of estranged labour to private property it further follows that the emancipation of society from private property, etc., from servitude, is expressed in the political form of the emancipation of the workers; not that their emancipation alone was at stake but because the emancipation of the workers contains universal human emancipation-and it contains this, because the whole of human servitude is involved in the relation of the worker to production, and every relation of servitude is but a modification and consequence of this relation.

     Just as we have found the concept of private property from the concept of estranged, alienated labour by analysis, in the same way every category of political economy can be evolved with the help of these two factors; and we shall find again in each category, e.g., trade, competition, capital, money, only a definite and developed expression of the first foundations.

     Before considering this configuration, however, let us try to solve two problems.

      (1) To define the general nature of private property, as it has arisen as a result of estranged labour, in its relation to truly human, social property.

      (2) We have accepted the estrangement of labour, its alienation, as a fact, and we have analysed this fact. How, we now ask, does man come to alienate, to estrange, his labour? How is this estrangement rooted in the nature of human development? We have already gone a long way to the solution of this problem by transforming the question as to the origin of private property into the question as to the relation of alienated labour to the course of humanity's development. For when one speaks of private property, one thinks of being concerned with something external to man. When one speaks of labour, one is directly concerned with man himself. This new formulation of the question already contains its solution.

      As to (1): The general nature of private property and its relation to truly human property.

      Alienated labour has resolved itself for us into two elements which mutually condition one another, or which are but different expressions of one and the same relationship. Appropriation appears as estrangement, as alienation; and alienation appears as appropriation, estrangement as true enfranchisement.

      We have considered the one side-alienated labour in relation to the worker himself, i.e., the relation of alienated labour to itself. The property-relation of the non-worker to the worker and to labour we have found as the product, the necessary outcome of this relation of alienated labour. Private property, as the material, summary expression of alienated labour, embraces both relations-the relation of the worker to work, to the product of his labour and to the non-worker, and the relation of the non-worker to the worker and to the product of his labor.

      Having seen that in relation to the worker who appropriates nature by means of his labour, this appropriation appears as estrangement, his own spontaneous activity as activity for another and as activity of another, vitality as a sacrifice of life, production of the object as loss of the object to an alien power, to an alien person-we shall now consider the relation to the worker, to labour and its object of this person who is alien to labour and the worker.

      First it has to be noticed, that everything which appears in the worker as an activity of alienation, of estrangement, appears in the non-wor ker as a state of alienation, of estrangement.
      Secondly, that the worker's real, practical attitude in production and to the product (as a state of mind ) appears in the non-worker confronting him as a theoretical attitude.

      Thirdly, the non-worker does everything against the worker which the worker does against himself; but he does not do against himself what he does against the worker.

      Let us look more closely at these three relations.6

                                 Private Property and Communism

      Re. p. XXXIX. The antithesis of propertylessness and property so long as it is not comprehended as the antithesis of labour and capital, still remains an antithesis of indifference, not grasped in its active connection, its internal relation-an antithesis not yet grasped as a contradiction. It can find expression in this first form even without the advanced development of private property ( as in ancient Rome, Turkey, etc.). It does not yet appear as having been established by private property itself. But labour, the subjective essence of private property as exclusion of property, and capital, objective labour as exclusion of labour, constitute private property as its developed state of contradiction-hence a dynamic relationship moving inexorably to its resolution.

     Re. the same page. The transcendence of self-estrangement follows the same course as self-estrangement. Private property is first considered only in its objective aspect-but nevertheless with labour as its essence. Its form of existence is therefore capital, which is to be annulled ""as such"" (Proudhon). Or a particular form of labour-labour levelled down, parcelled, and therefore unfree-is conceived as the source of private property's perniciousness and of its existence in estrangement from men; for instance, Fourier, who, like the physiocrats, also conceived agricultural labour to be at least the exemplary type, whilst Saint-Simon declares in contrast that industrial labour as such is the essence, and now also aspires to the exclusive rule of the industrialists and the improvement of the workers condition. Finally, communism is the positive expression of annulled private property-at first as universal private property. By embracing this relation as a whole, communism is:

      (1) In its first form only a generalization and consummation of this relationship. It shows itself as such in a two fold form: on the one hand, the dominion of material property bulks so large that it wants to destroy everything which is not capable of being possessed by all as private property. It wants to abstract by force from talent, etc. For it the sole purpose of life and existence is direct, physical possession. The category of labourer is not done away with, but extended to all men. The relationship of private property persists as the relationship of the community to the world of things. Finally, this movement of counter posing universal private property to private property finds expression in the bestial form of counter posing to marriage (certainly a form of exclusive private property) the contmunity of women, in which a woman becomes a piece of communal and common property. It may be said that this idea of the community of women gives away the secret of this as yet completely crude and thoughtless communism. Just as the woman passes from marriage to general prostitution,7 so the entire world of wealth (that is, of man's objective substance) passes from the relationship of exclusive marriage with the owner of private property to a state of universal prostitution with the community. In negating the personality of man in every sphere, this type of communism is really nothing but the logical expression of private property, which is this negation. General envy constituting itself as a power is the disguise in which avarice re-establishes itself and satisfies itself, only in another way. The thoughts of every piece of private property-inherent in each piece as such-are at least turned against all wealthier private property in the form of envy and the urge to reduce to a common level, so that this envy and urge even constitute the essence of competition. The crude communism is only the consummation of this envy and of this levelling-down proceeding from the preconceived minimum. It has a definite, limited standard. How little this annulment of private property is really an appropriation is in fact proved by the abstract negation of the entire world of culture and civilization, the regression to the unnatural simplicity of the poor and undemanding man who has not only failed to go beyond private property, but has not yet even attained to it.

     The community is only a community of labour, and an equality of wages paid out by the communal capital-the community as the universal capitalist. Both sides of the relationship are raised to an imagined- universality-labour as a state in which every person is put, and capital as the acknowledged universality and power of the community.

     In the approach to woman as the spoil and handmaid of communal lust is expressed the infinite degradation in which man exists for himself, for the secret of this approach has its unambiguous, decisive, plain and undisguised expression in the relation of man to woman and in the manner in which the direct and natural procreative relationship is conceived. The direct, natural, and necessary relation of person to person is the relation of man to woman. In this natural relationship of the sexes man's relation to nature is immediately his relation to man, just as his relation to man is immediately his relation to nature-his own natural function. In this relationship, therefore, is sensuously manifested, reduced to an observable fact, the extent to which the human essence has become nature to man, or to which nature has to him become the human essence of man. From this relationship one can therefore judge man's whole level of development. It follows from the character of this relationship how much man as a species being, as man, has come to be himself and to comprehend himself; the relation of man to woman is the most natural relation of human being to human being. It therefore reveals the extent to which man's natural behaviour has become human, or the extent to which the human essence in him has become a natural essence-the extent to which his human nature has come to be nature to him. In this relationship is revealed, too, the extent to which man's need has hecome a human need; the extent to which, therefore, the other person as a person has become for him a need-the extent to which he in his individual existence is at the same time a social being. The first positive annulment of private property-crude communism-is thus merely one form in which the vileness of private property, which wants to set itself up as the positive community, comes to the surface.

      (2) Communism (a) of a political nature still-democratic or despotic; (b) with the annulment of the state, yet still incomplete, and being still affected by private property (i.e., by the estrangement of man). In both forms communism already knows itself to be re-integration or return of man to himself, the transcendence of human self-estrangement; but since it has not yet grasped the positive essence of private property, and just as little the human nature of need, it remains captive to it and infected by it. It has, indeed, grasped its concept, but not its essence.

      (3) Communism as the positive transcendence of private property, or human self-estrangement, and therefore as the real appropriation of the human essence by and for man; communism therefore as the complete return of man to himself as a social (i.e., human) being-a return become conscious, and accomplished within the entire wealth of previous development. This communism, as fully-developed naturalism, equals humanism, and as fully-developed humanism equals naturalism; it is the genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature and between man and man-the true resolution of the strife between existence and essence, between objectification and self-confirmation, between freedom and necessity, between the individual and the species. Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution.

     The entire movement of history is, therefore, both its actual act of genesis (the birth act of its empirical existence) and also for its thinking consciousness the comprehended and known process of its coming-to-be. That other, still immature communism, meanwhile, seeks an historical proof for itself-a proof in the realm of the existent-amongst disconnected historical phenomena opposed to private property, tearing single phases from the historical process and focussing attention on them as proofs of its historical pedigree (a horse ridden hard especially by Cabet, Villegardelle, etc.). By so doing it simply makes clear that by far the greater part of this proc¬ess contradicts its claims, and that, if it has once been, precisely its being in the past refutes its pretension to being essential.

     That the entire revolutionary movement necessarily finds both its empirical and its theoretical basis in the movement of private property-in that of the economy, to be precise-is easy to see.

     This material, immediately sensuous private property is the material sensuous expression of estranged human life. Its movement production and consumption-is the sensuous revelation of the movement of all production hitherto-i.e., the realization or the reality of man. Religion, family, state, law, morality, science, art, etc., are only particular modes of production, and fall under its general law. The positive transcendence of private property as the appropriation of human life is, therefore, the positive transcendence of all estrangement-that is to say, the return of man from religion, family, state, etc., to this human, i.e., social made of existence. Religious estrangement as such occurs only in the realm of consciousness, of man's inner life, but economic estrangement is that of real life; its transcendence therefore embraces bath aspects. It is evident that the initial stage of the movement amongst the various peoples depends an whether the true and for them authentic life of the people manifests itself more in consciousness or in the external world-is mare ideal or real. Communism begins from the outset (Owen) with atheism; but atheism is at first far from being communism; indeed, it is still mostly an abstraction.

     The philanthropy of atheism is therefore at first only philosophical, abstract, philanthropy, and that of communism is at once real and directly bent an action.

     We have seen haw an the premise of positively annulled private property man produces man-himself and the other man; haw the object, being the direct embodiment of his individuality, is simultaneously his awn existence far the other man, the existence of the other man, and that existence far him. Likewise, however, bath the material of labour and man as the subject, are the paint of departure as well as the result of the movement (and precisely in this fact, that they must constitute the point of departure, lies the historical necessity of private property). Thus the social character is the general character of the whale movement: just as society itself produces man as man, So is society produced by him. Activity and consumption, bath in their content and in their mode of existence, are social: social activity and social consumption; the human essence of nature first exists only far social man; for only here does nature exist far him as a bond with man-as his existence for the other and the other's existence for him-as the life-element of the human world; only here does nature exist as the foundation of his own human existence. Only here has what is to him his natural existence became his human existence, and nature became man for him. Thus society is the consummated oneness in substance of man and nature-the true resurrection of nature-the naturalism of man and the humanism of nature bath brought to fulfilment.

     Social activity and social consumption exist by no means only in the farm of same directly communal activity and directly communal consumption, although communal activity and communal consumption-i.e., activity and consumption which are manifested and directly confirmed in real association with other men-will occur wherever such a direct expression of sociality stems from the true character of the activity's content and is adequate to the nature of consumption.

     But again when I am active scientifically, etc.,-when I am engaged in activity which I can seldom perform in direct community with others-then I am social, because I am active as a man. Not only is the material of my activity given to me as a social product (as is even the language in which the thinker is active): my own, existence is social activity, and therefore that which I make of myself, I make of myself for society and with the consciousness of myself as a social being.

     My general consciousness is only the theoretical shape of that of which the living shape is the real community, the social fabric, although at the present day general consciousness is an abstraction from real life and as such antagonistically confronts it. Consequently, too, the activity of my general consciousness, as an activity, is my theoretical existence as a social being.

     What is to be avoided above all is the re-establishing of ""Society"" as an abstraction vis-à-vis the individual. The individual is the social being. His life, even if it may not appear in the direct form of a communal life carried out together with others-is therefore an expression and confirmation of social life. Man's individual and species life are not different, however much-and this is inevitable-the mode of existence of the individual is a more particular, or more general mode of the life of the species, or the life of the species is a more particular or more general individual life.

     In his consciousness of species man confirms his real social life and simply repeats his real existence in thought, just as conversely the being of the species confirms itself in species-consciousness and is for itself in its generality as a thinking being.

     Man, much as he may therefore be a particular individual (and it is precisely his particularity which makes him an individual, and a real individual social being) , is just as much the totality-the ideal totality-the subjective existence of thought and experienced society present for itself; just as he exists also in the real world as the awareness and the real enjoyment of social existence, and as a totality of human life-activity.

     Thinking and being are thus no doubt distinct, but at the same time they are in unity with each other.

     Death seems to be a harsh victory of the species over the definite individual and to contradict their unity. But the determinate individual is only a determinate species being, and as such mortal.

      (4) Just as private property is only the sensuous expression of the fact that man becomes objective for himself and at the same time becomes to himself a strange and inhuman object; just as it expresses the fact that the assertion of his life is the alienation of his life, that his realization is his loss of reality, is an alien reality: conversely, the positive transcendence of private property-i.e., the sensuous appropriation for and by man of the human essence and of human life, of objective man, of human achievements-is not to be conceived merely in the sense of direct, one-sided gratification-merely in the sense of possessing, of having. Man appropriates his total essence in a total manner, that is to say, as a whole man. Each of his human relations to the world-seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling, thinking, being aware, sensing, wanting, acting, loving-in short, all the organs of his individual being, like those organs which are directly social in their form, are in their objective orientation or in their orientation to the object, the appropriation of that object, the appropriation of the human world; their orientation to the object is the manifestation of the human world;8 it is human efficaciousness and human suffering, for suffering, apprehended humanly, is an enjoyment of self in man.

     Private property has made us so stupid and one-sided that an object is only ours when we have it-when it exists for us as capital, or when it is directly possessed, eaten, drunk, worn, inhabited, etc.,-in short, when it is used by us. Although private property itself again conceives all these direct realizations of possession as means of life, and the life which they serve as means is the life of private property-labour and conversion into capital.

     In place of all these physical and mental senses there has therefore come the sheer estrangement of all these senses-the sense of having. The human being had to be reduced to this absolute poverty in order that he might yield his inner wealth to the outer world. ( On the category of ""having,"" see Hess in the Twenty-One Sheets. )

     The transcendence of private property is therefore the complete emancipation of all human senses and attributes; but it is this emancipation precisely because these senses and attributes have become, subjectively and objectively, human. The eye has become a human eye, just as its object has become a social, human object-an object emanating from man for man. The senses have therefore become directly in their practice theoreticians. They relate themselves to the thing for the sake of the thing, but the thing itself is an objective human relation to itself and to man,9and vice versa. Need or enjoyment have consequently lost their egotistical nature, and nature has lost its mere utility by use becoming human use.

     In the same way, the senses and enjoyments of other men have become my own appropriation. Besides these direct organs, therefore, social organs develop in the form of society; thus, for instance, activity in direct association with others, etc., has become an organ for expressing my own life, and a mode of appropriating human life.

     It is obvious that the human eye gratifies itself in a way different from the crude, non•human eye; the human ear different from the crude ear, etc.

     To recapitulate; man is not lost in his object only when the object becomes for him a human object or objective man. This is possible only when the object becomes for him a social object, he himself for himself a social being, just as society becomes a being for him in this object.

     On the one hand, therefore, it is only when the objective world becomes everywhere for man in society the world of man's essential powers1-human reality, and for that reason the reality of his own essential powers-that all objects become for him the objectification of himself, become objects which confirm and realize his individuality, become his objects: that is, man himself becomes the object. The manner in which they become his depends on the nature of the objects and on the nature of the essential power corresponding to it; for it is precisely the determinateness of this relationship which shapes the particular, real mode of affirmation. To the eye an object comes to be other than it is to the ear, and the object of the eye is another object than the object of the ear. The peculiarity of each essential power is precisely its peculiar essence, and therefore also the peculiar mode of its objectification, of its objectively actual living being. Thus man is affirmed in the objective world not only in the act of thinking, but with all his senses.

     On the other hand, looking at this in its subjective aspect: just as music alone awakens in man the sense of music, and just as the most beautiful music has no sense for the unmusical ear-is no object for it, because my object can only be the confirmation of one of my essential powers and can therefore only be so for me as my essential power is present for itself as a subjective capacity, because the sense of an object for me goes only so far as my senses go (has only sense for a sense corresponding to that object) -for this reason the senses of the social man are other senses than those of the non-social man. Only through the objectively unfolded richness of man's essential being is the richness of subjective human sensibility (a musical ear, an eye for beauty of form-in short, senses capable of human gratifications, senses confirming themselves as essential powers of man ) either cultivated or brought into being. For not only the five senses but also the so-called mental senses-the practical senses (will, love, etc. )-in a word, human sense-the humanness of the senses-comes to be by virtue of its object, by virtue of humanized nature. The forming of the five senses is a labour of the entire history of the world down to the present.

     The sense caught up in crude practical need has only a restricted sense. For the starving man, it is not the human form of food that exists, but only its abstract being as food; •it could just as well be there in its crudest form, and it would be impossible to say wherein this feeding-activity differs from that of animals. The care-burdened man in need has no sense for the finest play; the dealer in minerals sees only the mercantile value but not the beauty and the unique nature of the mineral: he has no mineralogical sense. Thus, the objectification of the human essence both in its theoretical and practical aspects is required to make man's sense human, as well as to create the human sense corresponding to the entire wealth of human and natural substance.

     Just as resulting from the movement of private property, of its wealth as well as its poverty-or of its material and spiritual wealth and poverty-the budding society finds to hand all the material for this development: so established society produces man in this entire richness of his being-produces the rich man profoundly endowed with all the senses-as its enduring reality.

     It will be seen how subjectivism and objectivism, spiritualism and materialism, activity and suffering, only lose their antithetical character, and thus their existence, as such antitheses in the social condition; it will be seen how the resolution of the theoretical antitheses is only possible  way, by virtue of the practical energy of men . Their resolution is therefore by no means merely, a problem of knowledge, but a real problem of life, which philosophy could not solve precisely because it conceived this problem as merely a theoretical one.

     It will be seen how the history of industry and the established objective existence of industry are the open book of man's essential powers, the exposure to the senses of human psychology. Hitherto this was not conceived in its inseparable connection with man's essential being, but only in an external relation of utility, because, moving in the realm of estrangement, people could only think man's general mode of being-religion or history in its abstract general character as politics, art, literature, etc.,-to be the realityof man's essential powers and man's species-activity. We have before us the objectified essential powers of man in the form of sensuous, alien, useful objects, in the form of estrangement, displayed in ordinary material industry (which can be conceived as a part of that general movement, just as that movement can be conceived as a particular part of industry, since all human activity hitherto has been labour-that is, industry-activity estranged from itself).

     A psychology for which this, the part of history most contemporary and accessible to sense, remains a closed book, cannot become a genuine, comprehensive and real science. What indeed are we to think of a science which airily abstracts from this large part of human labour and which fails to feel its own incompleteness, while such a wealth of human endeavour unfolded before it means nothing more to it than, perhaps, what can be expressed in one word-""need, "" ""vulgar need""?

     The natural sciences have developed an enormous activity and have accumulated a constantly growing mass of material. Philosophy, however, has remained just as alien to them as they remain to philosophy. Their momentary unity was only a chimerical illusion. The will was there, but the means were lacking. Even historiography pays regard to natural science only occasionally, as a factor of enlightenment and utility arising from individual great discoveries. But natural science has invaded and transformed human life all the more practically through the medium of industry; and has prepared human emancipation, however directly and much it had to consummate dehumanization. Industry is the actual, historical relation of nature, and therefore of natural science, to man. If, therefore, industry is conceived as the exoteric revelation of man's essential powers, we also gain an understanding of the human essence of nature or the natural essence of man. In consequence, natural science will lose its abstractly material-or rather, its idealistictendency, and will become the basis of human science, as it has already become the basis of actual human life, albeit in an estranged form. One basis for life and another basis for science is a priori a lie. The nature which comes to be in human history-the genesis of human society-is man's real nature; hence nature as it comes to be through industry, even though in an estranged form, is true anthropological nature.

     Sense-perception ( see Feuerbach) must be the basis of all science. Only when it proceeds from sense-perception in the twofold form both of sensuous consciousness and of sensuous need-that is, only when science proceeds from nature-is it true science. All history is the preparation for ""man"" to become the object of sensuous consciousness, and for the needs of ""man as man"" to become [natural, sensuous] needs. History itself is a real part of natural history-of nature's coming to be man. Natural science will in time subsume under itself the science of man, just as the science of man will subsume under itself natural science: there will be one science.

     Man is the immediate object of natural science: for immediate, sensuous nature for man is, immediately, human sensuousness (the expressions are identical ) -presented immediately in the form of the other man sensuously present for him. For his own sensuousness first exists as human sensuousness for himself through the other man. But nature is the immediate object of the science of man: the first object of man-man-is nature, sensuousness; and the particular human sensuous essential powers can only find their self-knowledge in the science of the natural world in general, since they can find their objective realization in natural objects only. The element of thought itself-the element of thought's living expression-language-is of a sensuous nature. The social reality of nature, and human natural science, or the natural science about man, are identical terms.

     It will be seen how in place of the wealth and poverty of political economy come the rich human being and rich human need. The rich human being is simultaneously the human being in need of a totality of human life activities-the man in whom his own realization exists as an inner necessity, as need. Not only wealth, but likewise the poverty of man-given socialism-receives in equal measure a human and therefore social significance. Poverty is the passive bond which causes the human being to experience the need of the- greatest wealth-the other human being. The dominion of the objective being in me, the sensuous outburst of my essential activity, is emotion, which thus becomes here the activity of my being.

      (5) A being only considers himself independent when he stands on his own feet; and he only stands on his own feet when he owes his existence to himself. A man who lives by the grace of another regards himself as a dependent being. But I live completely by the grace of another if owe him not only the sustenance of my life, but if he has, moreover, created my life-if he is the source of my life; and if it is not of my own creation, my life has necessarily a source of this kind outside it. The Creation is therefore an idea very difficult to dislodge from popular consciousness. The self¬mediated being of nature and of man is incomprehensible to it, because it contradicts everything palpable in practical life.

     The creation of the earth has received a mighty blow from geogen -i.e., from the science which presents the formation of the earth, the coming-to-be of the earth, as a process, as self-generation. Generatio aequivoca2 is the only practical refutation of the theory of creation.

     Now it is certainly easy to say to the single individual what Aristotle has already said. You have been begotten by your father and your mother; therefore in you the mating of two human beings-a species-act of human beings-has produced the human being. You see, therefore, that even physically, man owes his existence to man. Therefore you must not only keep sight of the one aspect-the infinite progression which leads you further to enquire: ""Who begot my father? Who his grandfather?"", etc. You must also hold on to the circular movement sensuously perceptible in that progression, by which man repeats himself in procreation, thus always remaining the subject. You will reply, however: I grant you this circular movement; now grant me the progression which drives me even further until I ask: Who begot the first man, and nature as a whole? I can only answer you: Your question is itself a product of abstraction. Ask yourself how you arrived at that question. Ask yourself whether your question is not posed from a standpoint to which I cannot reply, because it is a perverse one. Ask yourself whether that progression as such exists for a reasonable mind. When you ask about the creation of nature and man, you are abstracting, in so doing, from man and nature. You postulate them as non-existent, and yet you want me to prove them to you as existing. Now I say to you: Give up your abstraction and you will also give up your question. Or if you want to hold on to your abstraction, then be consistent, and if you think of man and nature as non-existent, then think of yourself as non-existent, for you too are surely nature and man. Don't think, don't ask me, for as soon as you think and. ask, your abstraction from the existence of nature and man has no meaning. Or are you such an egoist that you postulate everything as nothing, and yet want yourself to be?

     You can reply: I do not want to postulate the nothingness of nature. I ask you about its genesis, just as I ask the anatomist about the formation of bones, etc.

     But since for the socialist man the entire so-called history of the world  is nothing but the begetting of man through human labour, nothing but the coming-to-be of nature for man, he has the visible, irrefutable proof of his birth through himself, of his process of coming-to-be. Since the real existence of man and nature has become practical, sensuous and perceptible-since man has become for man as the being of nature, and nature for man as the being of man-the question about an alien being , about a being above nature and man-a question which implies the admission of the inessentiality of nature and of man-has become impossible in practice. Atheism, as the denial of this inessentiality, has no longer any meaning, for atheism is a negation of God, and postulates the existence of man through this negation; but socialism as socialism no longer stands in any need of such a mediation. It proceeds from the practically and theoretically sensuous consciousness of man and of nature as the essence. Socialism is man's positive self-consciousness no longer mediated through the annulment of religion, just as real life is man's positive reality, no longer mediated through the annulment of private property, through communism. Communism is the position as the negation of the negation, and is hence the actual phase necessary for the next stage of historical development in the process of human emancipation and recovery. Communism is the necessary pattern and the dynamic principle of the immediate future, but communism as such is not the goal of human development-the structure of human society.

                              The Meaning of Human Requirements

      We have seen what significance, given socialism, the wealth of human needs has, and what significance, therefore, both a new mode of production and a new object of production have: a new manifestation of the forces of human nature and a new enrichment of human nature.3 Under private property their significance is reversed: every person speculates on creating a new need in another, so as to drive him to a fresh sacrifice, to place him in a new depend¬ence and to seduce him into a new mode of gratification and therefore economic ruin. Each tries to establish over the other an alien power, so as thereby to find satisfaction .of his own selfish need. The increase in the quantity of objects is accompanied by an extension of the realm of the alien powers to which man is subjected, and every new product represents a new potency of mutual swindling and mutual plundering. Man becomes ever poorer as man; his need for money becomes ever greater if he wants to overpower hostile being; and the power of his money declines exactly in inverse proportion to the increase in the volume of production: that is, his neediness grows as the power of money increases.

     The need for money is therefore the true need produced by the modern economic system, and it is the only need which the latter produces. The quantity of money becomes to an ever greater degree its sole effective attribute: just as it reduces everything to its abstract form, so it reduces itself in the course of its own movement to something merely quantitative. Excess and intemperance come to be its true norm. Subjectively, this is even partly manifested in that the extension of products and needs falls into contriving and ever¬calculating subservience to inhuman, refined, unnatural and imaginary appetites.Private property does not know how to change crudeneed into human need. Its idealism is fantasy, caprice and whim; and no eunuch flatters his despot more basely or uses more despicable means to stimulate his dulled capacity for pleasure in order to sneak a favour for himself than does the industrial eunuch-the producer-in order to sneak for himself a few pennies-in order to charm the golden birds out of the pockets of his Christianly beloved neighbours. He puts himself at the service of the other's most depraved fancies, plays the pimp between him and his need, excites in him morbid appetites, lies in wait for each of his weaknesses-all so that he can then demand the cash for this service of love. (Every product is a bait with which to seduce away the other's very being, his money; every real and possible need is a weakness which will lead the fly to the gluepot. General exploitation of communal human nature, just as every imperfection in man, is a bond with heaven-an avenue giving the priest access to his heart; every need is an opportunity to approach one's neighbour under the guise of the utmost amiability and to say to him: Dear friend, I give you what you need, but you know the conditio sine qua non; you know the ink in which you have to sign yourself over to me; in providing for your pleasure, I fleece you.)

     And partly, this estrangement manifests itself in that it produces refinement of needs and of their means on the one hand, and a bestial barbarization, a complete, unrefined, abstract simplicity of need, on the other; or rather in that it merely resurrects itself in its opposite. Even the need for fresh air ceases for the worker. Man returns to living in a cave, which is now, however, contaminated with the mephitic breath of plague given off by civilization, and which he continues to occupy only precariously, it being for him a n alien habitation which can be withdrawn from him any day-a place from which, if he does not pay, he can be thrown out any day. For this mortuary he has to pay. A dwelling in the light, which Prometheus in Aeschylus designated as one of the greatest boons, by means of which he made the savage into a human being, ceases to exist for the worker. Light, air, etc.-the simplest animal cleanliness-ceases to be a need for man. Dirt-this stagnation and putrefaction of man-the sewage of civilization (speaking quite literally) -comes to be the element of life for him. Utter, unnatural neglect, putre¬fied nature, comes to be his life-element. None of his senses exist any longer, and not only in his human fashion, but in an inhuman fashion, and therefore not even in an animal fashion. The crudest modes (and instruments) of human labour are coming back: the tread mill of the Roman slaves, for instance, is the means of production, the means of existence, of many English workers. It is not only that man has no human needs-even his animal needs are ceasing to exist. The Irishman no longer knows any need now but the need to eat, and indeed only the need to eat potatoes-and scabby potatoes at that, the worst kind of potatoes. But in each of their industrial towns England and France have already a little Ireland. The savage and the animal have at least the need to hunt, to roam, etc.-the need of companionship. Machine labour is simplified in order to make a worker out of the human being still in the making, the completely immature human being, the child-whilst the worker has become a neglected child. The machine accommodates itself to the weakess of the human being in order to make the weak human being into a machine.

     How the multiplication of needs and of the means of their satisfaction breeds the absence of needs and of means is demonstrated by the political economist (and the capitalist: it should be noted that it is always empirical business men we are talking about when we refer to political economists-their scientific confession and mode of being). This he shows:

      (1) By reducing the worker's need to the barest and most miserable level of physical subsistence, and by reducing his activity to the most abstract mechanical movement. Hence, he says: Man has no other need either of activity or of enjoyment. For he calls even this life human life and existence.

      (2) By counting the lowest possible level of life (existence) as the standard, indeed as the general standard-general because it is applicable to the mass of men. He changes the worker into an insensible being lacking all needs, just as he changes his activity into a pure abstraction from all activity. To him, therefore, every luxury of the worker seems to be reprehensible, and everything that goes beyond the most abstract need-be it in the realm of passive enjoyment, or a manifestation of activity-seems to him a luxury. Political economy, this science of wealth, is therefore simultaneously the science of denial, of want, of thrift, of saving-and it actually reaches the point where it spares man the need of either fresh air or physical exercise. This science of marvellous industry is simultaneously the science of asceticism, and its true ideal is the ascetic but extortionate miser and the ascetic but productive slave. Its moral ideal is the worker who takes part of his wages to the savings-bank, and it has even found ready-made an abject art in which to clothe this its pet idea: they have presented it, bathed in sentimentality, on the stage. Thus political economy-despite its worldly and wanton appearance-is a true moral science, the most moral of all the sciences. Self-denial, the denial of life and of all human needs, is its cardinal doctrine. The less you eat, drink and read books; the less you go to the theatre, the dance, hall, the public¬house; the less you think, love, theorize, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save-the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor dust will devour-your capital. The less you are, the more you have; the less you express your own life, the greater is your alienated life-the greater is the store of your estranged being. Everything which the political economist takes from you in life and in humanity, he replaces for you in money and in wealth; and all the things which you cannot do, your money can do. It can eat and drink, go to the dance hall and the theatre; it can travel, it can appropriate art, learning, the treasures of the past, political power -all this it can appropriate for you-it can buy all this for you: it is the true endowment. Yet being all this, it is inclined to do nothing but create itself, buy itself; for everything else is after all its servant. And when I have the master I have the servant and do not need his servant. All passions and all activity must therefore be submerged in avarice. The worker may only have enough for him to want to live, and may only want to live in order to have [enough].

     Of course a controversy now arises in the field of political economy. The one side (Lauderdale, Malthus, etc.) recommends luxury and execrates thrift. The other (Say, Ricardo, etc.) recommends thrift and execrates luxury. But the former admits that it wants luxury in order to produce labour (i.e., absolute thrift); and the latter admits that it recommends thrift in order to produce wealth (i.e., luxury). The Lauderdale-Malthus school has the romantic notion that avarice alone ought not to determine the consumption of the rich, and it contradicts its own laws in advancing extravagance as a direct means of enrichment. Against it, therefore, the other side very earnestly and circumstantially proves that I do not increase but reduce my possessions by being extravagant. The Say¬Ricardo school, however, is hypocritical in not admitting that it is precisely whim and caprice which determine production. It forgets the ""refined needs""; it forgets that there would be no production without consumption; it forgets that as a result of competition production can only become more extensive and luxurious. It forgets that it is use that determines a thing's value, and that fashion determines use. It wishes to see only ""useful things"" produced, but it forgets that production of too many useful things produces too large a useless population. Both sides forget that extravagance and thrift, luxury and privation, wealth and poverty are equal.

     And you must not only stint the immediate "",ratification of your senses, as by stinting yourself of food, etc.: you must also spare yourself all sharing of general interest, all sympathy, all trust, etc.; if you want to be economical, if you do not want to be ruined by illusions.

     You must make everything that is yours saleable, i.e., useful. If I ask the political economist: Do I obey economic laws if I extract money by offering my body for sale, by surrendering it to another's lust? (The factory workers in France call the prostitution of their wives and daughters the xth working hour, which is literally correct. ) -Or am I not acting in keeping with political economy if I sell my friend to the Moroccans? ( And the direct sale of men in the form of a trade in conscripts, etc., takes place in all civilized countries.) -Then the political economist replies to me: You do not transgress my laws; but see what Cousin Ethics and Cousin Religion have to say about it. My political economic ethics and religion have nothing to reproach you with, but- But whom am I now to believe, political economy or ethics? The ethics of political economy is acquisition, work, thrift, sobriety-but political economy promises to satisfy my needs. The political economy of ethics is the opulence of a good conscience, of virtue, etc.; but how can I live virtuously if I do not live? And how can I have a good conscience if I am not conscious of anything? It stems from the very nature of estrangement that each sphere applies to me a different and opposite yard¬stick-ethics one and political economy another; for each is a specific estrangement of man and focuses attention on a particular round of estranged essential activity, and each stands in an estranged relation to the other. Thus M. Michel Chevalier reproaches Ricardo with having abstracted from ethics. But Ricardo is allowing political economy to speak its own language, and if it does not speak ethically, this is not Ricardo's fault. M. Chevalier abstracts from political economy in so far as he moralizes, but he really and necessarily abstracts from ethics in so far as he practises political economy. The reference of political economy to ethics, if it is other than an arbitrary, contingent and therefore unfounded and unscientific reference, if it is not being put up as a sham but is meant to be essential, can only be the reference of the laws of polit¬ical economy to ethics. If there is no such connection, or if the contrary is rather the case, can Ricardo help it? Besides, the opposition between political economy and ethics is only a sham opposition and just as much no opposition as it is an opposition. All that happens is that political economy expresses moral laws in its own way.

     Needlessness as the principle of political economy is most brilliantly shown in its theory of population. There are too many people. Even the existence of men is a pure luxury; and if the worker is ""ethical,"" he will be sparing in procreation. ( Mill suggests public acclaim for those who prove themselves continent in their sexual relations, and public rebuke for those who sin against such barrenness of marriage.... Is not this the ethics, the teaching of asceticism?) The production of people appears in the form of public misery.

     The meaning which production has in relation to the rich is seen revealed in the meaning which it has for the poor. At the top themanifestation is always refined, veiled, ambiguous-a sham; lower, it is rough, straightforward, frank-the real thing. The worker's crude need is a far greater source of gain than the refined need of the rich. The cellar-dwellings in London bring more to those who let them than do the palaces; that is to say, with reference to the landlord they constitute greater wealth, and thus (to speak the language of political economy) greater social wealth.

     Industry speculates on the refinement of needs, but it speculates just as much on their crudeness, but on their artificially produced crudeness, whose true enjoyment, therefore, is self-stupefaction¬this seeming satisfaction of need-this civilization contained within the crude barbarism of need; the English gin-shops are therefore the symbolical embodiments of private property. Their luxury reveals the true relation of industrial luxury and wealth to man. They are therefore rightly the only Sunday pleasures of the people, dealt with at least mildly by the English police.

     We have already seen how the political economist establishes the unity of labour and capital in a variety of ways:- (1) Capital is accumulated labour. (2) The purpose of capital within production -partly, reproduction of capital with profit, partly, capital as raw material ( material of labour) , and partly, as itself a working instrument (the machine is capital directly equated with labour)-is productive labour. (3) The worker is a capital. (4) Wages belong to costs of capital. (5) In relation to the worker, labour is the reprod¬uction of his life-capital. (6) In relation to the capitalist, labour is an aspect of his capital's activity.

     Finally, (7) the political economist postulates the original unity of capital and labour in the form of the unity of the capitalist and the worker; this is the original state of paradise. The way in which these two aspects in the form of two persons leap at each other's throats is for the political economist a contingent event, and hence only to be explained by reference to external factors. (See Mill.) 4

      The nations which are still dazzled by the sensuous splendour of precious metals, and are therefore still fetish-worshippers of metal money, are -not yet fully developed money-nations.-Contrast of France and England. The extent to which the solution of theoreti¬cal riddles is the task of practice and effected through practice, just as true practice is the condition of a real and positive theory, is shown, for example, in fetishism. The sensuous consciousness of the fetish-worshipper is different from that of the Greek, because his sensuous existence is still different. The abstract enmity between sense and spirit is necessary so long as the human feeling for nature, the human sense of nature, and therefore also the natural sense of man, are not yet produced by man's own labour.

     Equality is nothing but a translation of the German ""Ich=Ich"" into the French, i.e., political form. Equality as the groundwork of communism is its political justification, and it is the same as when the German justifies it by conceiving man as universal self-consciousness. Naturally, the transcendence of the estrangement always proceeds from that form of the estrangement which is the dominant power: in Germany, self-consciousness; in France, equality, because politics; in England, real, material, practical need taking only itself as its standard. It is from this standpoint that Proudhon is to be criticized and appreciated.

     If we characterize communism itself because of its character as negation of the negation, as the appropriation of the human essence which mediates itself with itself through the negation of private property-as being not yet the true, self-originating position but rather a position originating from private property, [ ... ]5

     Since in that case8 the real estrangement of the life of man remains, and remains all the more, the more one is conscious of it as such, it may be accomplished solely by putting communism into operation.

     In order to abolish the idea of private property, the idea of communism is completely sufficient. It takes actual communist action to abolish actual private property. History will come to it; and this movement, which in theory we already know to be a self-transcending movement, will constitute in actual fact a very severe and protracted process. But we must regard it as a real advance to have gained beforehand a consciousness of the limited character as well as of the goal of this historical movement-and a consciousness which reaches out beyond it.

     When communist workmen associate with one another, theory, propaganda, etc., is their first end. But at the same time, as a result of this association, they acquire a new need-the need for society -and what appears as a means becomes an end. You can observe this practical process in its most splendid results whenever you see French socialist workers together. Such things as smoking, drinking, eating, etc., are no longer means of contact or means that bring together. Company, association, and conversation, which again has society as its end, are enough for them; the brotherhood of man isno mere phrase with them, but a fact of life, and the nobility of man shines upon us from their work-h ardened bodies .

     When political economy claims that demand and supply always balance each other, it immediately forgets that according to its own claim ( theory of population ) the supply of people always exceeds the demand, and that, therefore, in the essential result of the whole production process-the existence of man-the disparity between demand and supply gets its most striking expression.

     The extent to which money, which appears as a means, constitutes true power and the sale end-the extent to which in general that means which gives me substance, which gives me possession of the objective substance of others, is an end in itself-can be clearly seen from the facts that landed p roperty wherever land is the source of life, and horse and sword wherever these are the true means of life, are also acknowledged as the true political powers in life. In the middle ages a social class is emancipated as soon as it is allowed to carry the sword. Amongst nomadic peoples it is the horse which makes me a free man and a participant in the life of the community.

     We have said above that man is regressing to the cave dwelling etc.-but that he is regressing to it in an estranged, malignant form. The savage in his cave-a natural element which freely offers itself for his use and protection-feels h imself no more a stranger, or rather feels himself to be just as much at home as a fish in water. But the cellar-dwelling of the poor man is a hostile dwelling, ""an alien, restraining power which only gives itself up to him in so far as he gives up to it his blood and sweat""-a dwelling which he cannot look upon as his own home where he might at last exclaim, "" Here I am at home,"" but where instead he finds himself in someone else's house, in the house of a stranger who daily lies in wait for him and throws him out if he does not pay his rent. Similarly, he is also aware of the contrast in quality between his dwelling and a human dwelling-a residence in that other world, the heaven of wealth.

     Estrangement is manifested not only in the fact that my means of life belong to someone else, that my desire is the inaccessible possession of another, but also in the fact that everything is in itself something different from itself-that my activity is something else and that, finally ( and this applies also to the capitalist ) , all is under the sway of inhuman power. There is a form of inactive, extrava-gant wealth given over wholly to pleasure, the enjoyer of which on the one hand behaves as a mere ephemeral individual frantically spending himself to no purpose knows the slave-labour of others (human sweat and blood) as the p rey of his cupidity, and therefore knows man himself, and hence also his own self, as a sacrificed and empty being. With such wealth the contempt of man makes its appearance, partly as arrogance and as the throwing-away of whatcan give sustenance to a hundred human lives, and partly as the infamous illusion that his own unbridled extravagance and ceaseless, unproductive consumption is the condition of the other's labour and therefore of his subsistence. He knows the realization of the essential powers of man only as the realization of his own excesses, his whims and capricious, bizarre notions. This wealth which, on the other hand, again knows wealth as a mere means, as something that is good for nothing but to be annihilated and which is therefore at once slave and master, at once generous and mean, capricious, preumptuous, conceited, refined, cultured and witty-this wealth has not yet experienced wealth as an utterly alien power  over itself: it sees in it, rather, only its own power, and not wealth but gratification [is its]7final aim and end.

                                                      * * *

     Society, as it appears to the political economist, is civil society, in which every individual is a totality of needs and only exists for the other person, as the other exists for him, in so far as each becomes a means for the other. The political economist reduces everything ( just as does politics in its Rights of Man) to man, i.e., to the individual whom he strips of all determinateness so as to class him as capitalist or worker.
     The division of labour is the expression in political economy of the social character of labour within the estrangement. Or, since labour is only an expression of human activity within alienation, of the living of life as the alienating of life, the division of labour, too, is therefore nothing else but the estranged, alienated positing of human activity as a real activity of the species or as activity of man as a species being.

     As for the essence of the division of labour-and of course the division of labour had to be conceived as a major driving force in the production of wealth as soon as labour was recognized as the essence of private property-i.e., about the estranged and alienated form of human activity as an activity of the species-the political economists are very unclear and self-contradictory about it.

                                                      * * *

                                The Power of Money in Bourgeois Society

      If man's feelings, passions, etc., are not merely anthropological phenomena in the [narrower] 8 sense, but truly ontological affirmations o-f essential being ( of nature ) , and if they are only really affirmed because their object exists for them as an object of sense, then it is clear:

      (1) That they have by no means merely one mode of affirma¬tion, but rather that the distinctive character of their existence, of their life, is constituted by the distinctive mode of their affirmation. In what manner the object exists for them, is the characteristic mode of their gratification.

      (2) Whenever the sensuous affirmation is the direct annulment of the object in its independent form (as in eating, drinking, working up of the object, etc. ), this is the affirmation of the object.

      (3) In so far as man, and hence also his feeling, etc., are human, the affirmation of the object by another is likewise his own enjoyment.

      (4) Only through developed industry-i.e., through the medium of private property-does the ontological essence cif human passion come to be both in its totality and in its humanity; the science of man is therefore itself a product of man's establishment of himself by practical activity.

      (5) The meaning of private property-liberated from its estrangement-is the existence of essential objects for man, both as objects of enjoyment and as objects of activity.

      By possessing the property of buying everything, by possessing the property of appropriating all objects, money is thus the object of eminent possession. The universality of its property is the omnipotence of its being. It therefore functions as the almighty being. Money is the pimp between man's need and the object, between his life and his means of life. But that which mediates my life for me, also mediates the existence of other people for me. For me it is the other person.

                   ""What, man! confound it, hands and feet
                  And head and backside, all are yours !
                   And what we take while life is sweet,
                  Is that to be declared not ours?
                       Six stallions, say, I can afford,
                       Is not their strength my property?
                       I tear along, a sporting lord,
                        As if their legs belonged to me.""
                                      ( Mephistopheles, in Faust) 9
Shakespeare in Timon of Athens:
             "" Gold? Yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, Gods,
             I am no idle votarist! . . . Thus much of this will
                       make black white, foul fair,
             Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
            ... Why, this
             Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
             Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:
             This yellow slave
             Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed;
             Make the hoar l eprosy adored, place thieves
             And give them title, knee and approbation
             With senators on the bench: This is it
             That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;
             She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
             Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices
             To the April day again....Damned earth,
             Thou common whore of mankind, that putt'st odds
             Among the rout of nations.""1
And also later :
             ""O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
             Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
             Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
             Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,
             Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
             That lies on Dian's lap! Thou visible God!
             That solder'st close impossibilities,
             And mak'st them kiss! That speak'st with every tongue,
             To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!
             Think thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
             Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
            May have the world in empire!""2

     Shakespeare excellently depicts the real nature of money. To understand him, let us begin, first of all, by expounding the passage from Goethe.

     That which is for me through the medium of money-that for which I can pay (i.e., which money can buy ) -that am I, the possessor of the money. The extent of the power of money is the extent of my power. Money's properties a re my properties and essential powers-the properties and powers of its possessor. Thus, what I am and am capable of is by no means determined by my individuality. I am ugly, but I can buy for myself the most beautiful of women. Therefore I am not ugly, for the effect of ugliness-its deterrent power-is nullified by money. I,  in my character as an, individual, am lame, but money furnishes me with twentyfour feet . Therefore I am not lame. I am bad, dishonest, unscrupulous, stupid; but money is honoured, and therefore so is its possessor. Money is the supreme good, therefore its possessor is good. Money, besides, saves me the trouble of being dishonest: I am therefore presumed honest. I am stupid, but money is the real  mind of all things and how then should its possessor be stupid? Besides, he can buy talented people for himself, and is he who has power over the talented not more talented than the talented? Do not I, who thanks to money am capable of all that the human heart longs for, possess all human capacities? Does not my money therefore transform all my incapacities into their contrary?

     If money is the bond binding me to human life, binding society to me, binding me and nature and man, is not money the bond of all bonds? Can it not dissolve and bind all ties? Is it not, therefore, the universal agent of divorce? It is the true agent of divorce as well as the true binding agent-the [universal]3galvano-chemical power of Society.

     Shakespeare stresses especially two properties of money: (1) It is the visible divinity-the transformation of all human and natural properties into their contraries, the universal confounding and overturning of things : it makes brothers of impossibilities. (2) It is the common whore, the common pimp of people and nations.

     The overturning and confounding of all human and natural qualities, the fraternization of impossibilities-the divine power of money-lies in its character as men's estranged, alienating and self-disposing species-nature. Money is the alienated ability of mankind.

     That which I am unable to do as a man, and of which therefore all my individual essential powers are incapable, I am able to do by means of money. Money thus turns each of these powers into something which in itself it is not-turns it, that is, into its contrary.

     If I long for a particular dish or want to take the mail-coach because I am not strong enough to go by foot, money fetches me the dish and the mail-coach: that is, it converts my wishes from something in the realm of imagination, translates them from their meditated, imagined or willed existence into their sensuous, actual existence-from imagination to life, from imagined being into real being. In effecting this mediation, money is the truly creative power.

     No doubt demand also exists for him who has no money, but his demand is a mere thing of the imagination without effect or existence for me, for a third party, for the others, and which therefore remains for me unreal and objectless. The difference between effective demand based on money and ineffective demand based on my need, my passion, my wish, etc., is the difference between being and thinking, between the imagined which exists merely within me and the imagined as it is for me outside me as a real object.

     If I have no money for travel, I have no need-that is, no real and self-realizing need-to travel. If I have the vocation for studybut no money for it, I have no vocation for study-that is, no effective, no true vocation. On the other hand, if I have really no vocation for study but have the will and the money for it, I have an effective vocation for it. Being the external, common medium and faculty for turning an image into reality and reality into a mere image (a faculty not springing from man as man or from human society as society), money transforms the real essential powers of man and nature into what are m erely abstract conceits and therefore imperfections-into tormenting chimeras-just as it transforms real imperfections and chimeras-essential powers which are really impotent, which exist only in the imagination of the individual-into real powers and faculties.

     In the light of this characteristic alone, money is thus the general overturning of individualities which turns them into their contrary and adds contradictory attributes to their attributes .

     Money, then, appears as this overturning power both against the individual and against the bonds of society, etc., which claim to be essences in themselves . It transforms fidelity into infidelity, love into hate, hate into l ove, virtue into vice, vice into virtue, servant into master, master into servant, idiocy into intelligence and intelligence into idiocy.

     Since money, as the existing and active concept of value, confounds and exchanges all things, it is the general confounding and compounding of all things-the world upside-dawn-the confounding and compounding of all natural and human qualities.

     He who can buy bravery is brave, though a coward. As money is not exchanged for any one specific quality, for any one specific thing, or for any particular human essential power, but for the entire objective world of man and nature, from the standpoint of its possessor it therefore serves to exchange every property for every other, even contradictory, property and object: it is the fraternization of impossibilities. It makes contradictions embrace.

     Assume man to be man and his relationship to the world to be a human one: then you can exchange love only for love, trust for trust, etc. If you want to enjoy art, you must be an artistically¬cultivated person; if you want to exercise influence over other people, you m ust be a person with a stimulating and encouraging effect on other people. Every one of your relations to man and to nature must be a specific expression, corresponding to the object of your will, of your real individual life. If you love without evoking love in return-that is, if your loving as loving does not produce reciprocal love; if through a living expression of yourself as a loving person you do not make yourself a loved person, then your love is impotent-a misfortune.

                            Critique of the Hegelian Dialectic and Philosophy
                                                      as a Whole

      (6) This is perhaps the place at which, by way of explaining and justifying the ideas here presented, we might offer some considerations in regard to the Hegelian dialectic generally and especially its exposition in the Phenomenology and Logic, and also, lastly, the relation to it of the modern critical movement.

      So powerful was modern German criticism's preoccupation with the past-so completely was it possessed in its development by its subject-matter-that there prevailed a completely uncritical attitude to the method of criticizing, together with a complete lack of awareness about the seemingly formal, but really vital question: how do we now stand as regards the Hegelian dialectic? This lack of awareness about the relationship of modern criticism to the Hegelian philosophy as a whole and especially to the Hegelian dialectic has been so great that critics like Strauss and Bruno Bauer still remain wholly within the confines of the Hegelian Logic; the former completely so and the latter at least implicitly so in his Synoptics4 (where, in opposition to Strauss, he replaces the substance of ""abstract nature"" by the ""self-consciousness"" of abstract man) and even in Christianity Discovered.5 Thus in Christianity Discovered, for example, you get:

            ""As though in positing the world, self-consciousness posits that
      which is different from itself, and in what it posits it posits itself,
      because it in turn annuls the difference between what it has
      posited and itself, inasmuch as it itself has being only in the
      positing and the movement.-How then can it not have its pur-
      pose in this movement?"" etc.; or again: ""They"" ( the French mate-
      rialists ) ""have not yet been able to see that it is only as the
      movement of self-consciousness that the movement of the uni-
      verse has actually come to be for itself, and achieved unity with
      itself.""

      Such expressions do not even show any verbal divergence from the HegelIan approach, but on the contrary, repeat it word for word .

      How little consciousness there was in relation to the Hegelian dialectic dunng the act of criticism ( Bauer, The Synoptics), and how  little little this consciousness came into being even after the act of material criticism is proved by Bauer when, in his The Good of Freedom,6 he dismisses the brash question put by Herr Gruppe¬ ''What about logic now?""-by referring him to future critics.

     But even now-now that Feuerbach both in his Theses in the Anecdotis and, in detail, in The Philosophy of the Future, has in principle overthrown the old dialectic and philosophy; now that that school of criticism, on the other hand, which was incapable of accomplishing this has all the same seen it accomplished and has proclaimed itself pure, resolute, absolute criticism-criticism that has come into the clear with itself; now that this criticism, in its spiritual pride, has reduced the whole process of history to the relation between the rest of the world and itself ( the rest of the world, in contrast to itself, falling under the category of ""the masses"" ) and dissolved all dogmatic antithesis into the single dogmatic antithesis of its own cleverness and the stupidity of the world-the antithesis of the critical Christ and Mankind, the rabble; now that daily and hourly it has demonstrated its own excellence against the dullness of the'masses; now, finally, that it has proclaimed the critical Last Judgement in the shape of an announcement that the day is approaching when the whole of expiring humanity will assemble before it and be sorted by it into groups, each particular mob receiving its testimonium paupertatis;7 now that it has made known in print8 its superiority to human feelings as well as its superiority to the world, over which it sits enthroned in sublime solitude, only letting -fall from time to time from its sarcastic lips the ringing laughter of the Olympian Gods-even now, after all these delightful antics of moribund idealism in the guise of criticism (i.e., of Young-Hegelianism)-even now it has not expressed the suspicion that the time was ripe for a critical settling of accounts with the mother of Young-Hegelianism-the Hegelian dialectic-and even h ad [nothing] to say about its critical attitude towards the Feuerbachian dialectic. Criticism with a completely uncritical attitude to itself!

     Feuerbach is the only one who has a serious, critical attitude to the Hegelian dialectic and who has made genuine discoveries in this field. He is in fact the true conqueror of the old philosophy. The extent of his achievement, and the unpretentious simplicity With which he, Feuerbach, gives it to the world, stand in striking contrast to the reverse.

     Feuerbach's great achievement is:

      (1) The proof that philosophy is nothing else but religion rendered into thoughts and thinking expounded, and that it has therefore likewise to be condemned as another form and manner of existence of the estrangement of the essence of man;

      (2) The establishment of true materialism and of real science, since Feuerbach also makes the social relationship ""of man to man"" the basic principle of the theory;

      ( 3) His opposing to the negation of the negation, which claims to be the absolute positive, the self-supporting positive, positively grounded on itself.

     Feuerbach explains the Hegelian dialectic (and thereby justifies starting out from the positive, from sense-certainty) as follows:

     Hegel sets out from the estrangement of Substance ( in Logic, from the Infinite, the abstractly universal ) -from the absolute and fixed abstraction; which means, put popularly, that he sets out from religion and theology.

     Secondly, he annuls the infinite, and establishes the actual, sensuous, real, finite, particular (philosophy-annulment of religion and theology).

     Thirdly, he again annuls the positive and restores the abstraction, the infinite-restoration of religion and theology.

     Feuerbach thus conceives the negation of the negation only as a contradiction of philosophy with itself-as the philosophy which affirms theology ( the transcendent, etc. ) after having denied it, and which it therefore affirms in opposition to itself.

     The position or self-affirmation and self-confirmation contained in the negation of the negation is taken to be a position which is not yet sure of itself, which is therefore burdened with its opposite, which is doubtful of itself and therefore in need of proof, and which, therefore, is not a position establishing itself by its existence-not a position that justifies itself; hence it is directly and immediately confronted by the self-grounded position of sense-certanity.9

     But because Hegel has conceived the negation of the negation from the point of view of the positive relation inherent in it as the true and only positive, and from the point of view of the negative relation inherent in it as the only true act and self-realizing act of all being, he has only found the abstract, logical, speculative expression for the movement of history; and this historical process is not yet the real history of man-of man as a given subject, but only man's act of genesis-the story of man's origin: We shall explain both the abstract form of this process , and the difference between this process as it is in Hegel in contrast to modern criticism, that is, in contrast to the same process in Feuerbach's Wesen des Christentums (Essence of Christianity), or rather the critical form of this in Hegel still uncritical process.

     Let us take a look at the Hegelian system. One must begin with Hegel's Phenomenology, the true point of origin and the secret of the Hegelian philosophy.

                                        D. Absolute Knowledge

Hegel's Encyclopaedia,2 beginning as it does with Logic, with pure speculative thought, and ending with Absolute Knowledge-with the self-conscious, self-comprehending, philosophic or absolute (i.e., superhuman) abstract mind-is in its entirety nothing but the display, the self-objectification, of the essence of the philosophic mind, and the philosophic mind is nothing but the estranged mind of the world thinking within its self-estrangement-i.e., comprehending itself abstractly. Logic ( mind's coin of the realm, the speculative or thought-value of man and nature-their essence grown totally indifferent to all real determinateness, and hence their unreal essence) is alienated thinking, and therefore thinking which abstracts from nature and from real man: abstract thinking. Then: The externality of this abstract thinking… nature, as it is for this abstract thinking. Nature is external to it-its self-loss; and it apprehends nature also in an external fashion, as abstract thinking-but as alienated abstract thinking. Finally, Mind, this thinking returning home to its own point of origin-the thinking which, as the anthropological, phenomenological, psychological, ethical, artistic and religious mind, is not valid for itself, until ultimately it finds itself, and relates itself to itself, as absolute knowledge in the hence absolute, i.e., abstract mind, and so receives its conscious embodiment in a mode of being corresponding to it. For its real mode of being is abstraction.

     There is a double error in Hegel.

     The first emerges most clearly in the Phenomenology, the Hegelian philosophy's place of origin. When, for instance, wealth, state-power, etc., are understood by Hegel as entities estranged from the human being, this only happens in their form as thoughts . . . They are thought-entities, and therefore merely an estrangement of pure, i.e., abstract, philosophical thinking. The whole process therefore ends with Absolute Knowledge. It is precisely abstract thought from which these objects are estranged and which they confront with their arrogation of reality. The philosopher sets up himself (that is, one who is himself an abstract form of estranged man) as the measuring-rod of the estranged world. The whole history of the alienation-process and the whole process of the retraction of the alienation is therefore nothing but the history of the production of abstract (i.e., absolute) thought-of logical, speculative thought. The estrangement, which therefore forms the real interest of this alienation and of the transcendence of this alienation, is the opposition of in itself and for itself, of consciousness and self-consciousness, of object and subject-that is to say, .it is the opposition, within thought itself, between abstract thinking and sensuous reality or real sensuousness. All other oppositions and movements of these oppositions are but the semblance, the cloak, the exoteric shape of these oppositions which alone matter, and which constitute the meaning of these other, profane oppositions. It is not the fact that the human being objectifies himself inhumanly,in opposition to himself, but the fact that he objectifies himself in distinction from and in opposition to abstract thinking, that is the posited essence of the estrangement and the thing to be superseded.

     The appropriation of man's essential powers, which have become objects-indeed, alien objects-is thus in the first place only an appropriation occurring in consciousness, in pure thought-i.e., in abstraction: it is the appropriation of these objects as thoughts and as movements of thought. Consequently, despite its thoroughly negative and critical appearance and despite the criticism really contained in it, which often anticipates far later development, there is already latent in the Phenomenology as a germ, a potentiality, a secret, the uncritical positivism and the equally uncritical idealism of Hegel's later works-that philosophic dissolution and restoration of the existing empirical world. In the second place: the vindication of the objective world for man-for example, the realization that sensuous consciousness is not an abstractly sensuous consciousness but a humanly sensuous consciousness-that religion, wealth, etc., are but the estranged world of human objectification, of man’s essential powers given over to work and that they are therefore but the path to the true human world-this appropriation or the insight into this process consequently appears in Hegel in this form, that sense, religion, state-power, etc., are spiritual entities; for only mind is the true essence of man, and the true form of mind is thinking mind, the logical, speculative mind. The humanness of nature and of the nature begotten by history-the humanness of man's products-appears in the form that they are products of abstract mind and as such, therefore, phases of mind-thought entities. The Phenomenology is, therefore, an occult critique-still to itself obscure and mystifying criticism; but inasmuch as it keeps steadily in view man's estrangement, even though man appears only in the shape of mind, there lie concealed in it all the elements of criticism, already prepared and elaborated in a manner often rising far above the Hegelian standpoint. The ""Unhappy Consciousness,"" the ""Honest Consciousness,"" the struggle of the ""Noble and Base Consciousness,"" etc.,-these separate sections contain, but still in .an estranged form, the critical elements of whole spheres such as religion, the state, civil life, etc. Just as entities, objects, appear as thought-entities, so the subject is always consciousness or self-consciousness; or rather the object appears only as abstract consciousness, man only as self-consciousness: the distinct forms of estrangement which make their appearance are, therefore, only various forms of consciousness and self-consciousness. Just as in itself abstract consciousness ( the form in which the object is conceived) is merely a moment of distinction of self-consciousness, what appears as the result of the movement is the identity of self¬consciousness with consciousness-absolute knowledge-the movement of abstract thought no longer directed outwards but going on now oniy within its own self: that is to say, the dialectic of pure thought is the result.

     The outstanding thing in Hegel's Phenomenology and its final outcome-that is, the dialectic of negativity as the moving and generating principle-is thus first that Hegel conceives the self-genesis of man as a process, conceives objectification as loss of the object, as alienation and as transcendence of this alienation; that he thus grasps the essence of labour and comprehends objective man-true, because real man-as the outcome of man's own labour. The real, active orientation of man to himself as a species being, or his manifestation as a real species being ( i.e., as a human being ) , is only possible by his really bringing out of himself all the powers that are his as the species man-something which in turn is only possible through the totality of man's actions, as the result of history-is only possible by man's treating these generic powers as objects: and this, to begin with, is again only possible in the form of estrangement.

     We shall now demonstrate in detail Hegel's one-sidedness and limitations as they are displayed in the final chapter of the Phenomenology, ""Absolute Knowledge""-a chapter which contains the concentrated spirit of the Phenomenology, the relationship of the Phenomenology to speculative dialectic, and also Hegel's consciousness concerning both and their relationship to one another.

       Let us provisionally say just this much in advance: Hegel's standpoint is that of modern political economy. He grasps labour as the essence of man-as man's essence in the act of proving itself: he sees only the positive, not the negative side of labour. Labour is man's coming to-be for himself within alienation, or as alienated man. The only labour which Hegel knows and recognizes is abstractly mental labour. Therefore, that which constitutes the essence of philosophy-the alienation of man in his knowing of himself, or alienated science thinking itself-Hegel grasps as its essence; and he is therefore able vis-à-vis preceding philosophy to gather together its separate elements and phases, and to present his philosophy as the philosophy. What the other philosophers did¬that they grasped separate phases of nature and of human life as phases of self-consciousness, and indeed of abstract self-consciousness-is known to Hegel as the doings of philosophy. Hence his science is absolute.

     Let us now turn to our subject.

     Absolute Knowledge. The last chapter of the ""Phenomenology.""

     The main point is that the object of consciousness is nothing else but self-consciousness, or that the object is only objectified self-consciousness-self-consciousness as object.

    ( Positing of man=self-consciousness.)

     The issue, therefore, is to surmount the ,object of consciousness. Objectivity as such is regarded as an estranged human relationship which does not correspond to the essence of man, to self¬consciousness. The re-appropriation of the objective essence of man, begotten in the form of estrangement as something alien, has the meaning therefore not only to annul estrangement, but objectivity as well. Man, that is to say, is regarded as a non-objective, spiritual being.

     The movement of surmounting the object of consciousness is now described by Hegel in the following way:

     The object reveals itself not merely as returning into the self-for Hegel that is the one-sided way of apprehending this movement, the grasping of only one side. Man is posited as equivalent to self. The self, however, is only the abstractly conceived man-man begotten by abstraction. Man is egotistic. His eye, his ear, etc., are egotistic. In him every one of his essential powers has the quality of selfhood. But it is quite false to say an that account ""Self-consciousness has eyes, ears, essential powers."" Self-consciousness is rather a quality of h uman nature, of the human eye, etc.; it is not human nature that is a quality of self-consciousness.

     The self-abstracted and fixed for itself is man as abstract egoist-egoism raised in its pure abstraction to the level of thought. (We shall return to this point later.)

     For Hegel the essence of man-man-equals self-consciousness. All estrangement of the human essence is therefore nothing but estrangement of self-consciousness. The estrangement of self¬consciousness is not regarded as an expression of the real estrangement of the human being-its expression reflected in the realm of knowledge and thought. Instead, the real estrangement-that which appears real-is from its innermost, hidden nature (a nature only brought to light by philosophy) nothing but the manifestation of the estrangement of the real essence of man, of self¬consciousness. The science which comprehends this is therefore called Phenomenology. All re-appropriation of the estranged objective essence appears, therefore, as a process of incorporation into self-consciousness : The man who takes hold of his essential being is merely the self-consciousness which takes hold of objective essences. Return of the object into the self is therefore the re-appropriation of the object.

     The surmounting of the object of consciousness, comprehensively expressed, means: 4

      (1) That the object as such presents itself to consciousness as something vanishing. (2) That it is the alienation of self¬consciousness which establishes thinghood. (3) That this externalization5 of self-consciousness has not merely a negative but a positive significance. (4) That it has this meaning not merely for us or intrinsically, but for self-consciousness itself. (5) For self-consciousness, the negative of the object, its annulling of itself, has positive significance-self-consciousness knows this nullity of the object-because self-consciousness itself alienates itself; for in this alienation it establishes itself as object, or, for the sake of the indivisible unity of being-for-self, establishes the object as itself. (6) On the other hand, there is also this other moment in the process, that self-consciousness has also just as much annulled and superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus at home with itself in its other-being as such (7) This is the movement of consciousness and in this movement consciousness is the totality of its moments. (8) Consciousness must similarly have taken up a relation to the object in all its aspects and phases, and have comprehended it from the point of view of each of them. This totality of its determinate characteristics makes the object intrinsically a spiritual being; and it becomes so in truth for consciousness through the apprehending of each single one of them as self or through what was called above the spiritual attitude to them.

     As to (1): That the object as such presents itself to consciousness as something vanishing-this is the above-mentioned return of the object into the self.

     As to (2): The alienation of self-consciousness establishes thinghood. Because man equals self-consciousness, his alienated, objective essence, or thinghood, equals alienated self-consciousness, and thinghood is th us established through this alienation (thing hood being that which is an object for man and an object for him is really only that which is to him an essential object, therefore his objective essence. And since it is not real Man, nor therefore Nature-Man being human Nature-who as such is made the subject, but only the abstraction of man-self-consciousness-thinghood cannot be anything but alienated self-conciousness ). It is only to be expected that a living, natural being equipped and endowed with objective (i.e., material) essential powers should have real natural objects of his essence; as is the fact that his self-alienation should lead to the establishing of a real, objective world-but a world in the form of externality-a world, therefore, not belonging to his own essential being, and an over¬powering world. There is nothing incomprehensible or mysterious in this. It would be mysterious, rather, if it were otherwise. But it is equally clear that a self-consciousness can only establish thinghoodthrough its alienation-i.e., establish something which itself is only an abstract thing, a thing of abstraction and not a real thing. It is clear, further, that thinghood is therefore utterly without any independence, any essentiality vis-à-vis self-consciousness; that on the contrary, it is a mere creature-something posited by self-consciousness. And what is posited, instead of confirming itself, is but a confirmation of the act of positing in which is concentrated for a moment the energy of the act as its product, seeming to give the deposit-but only for a moment-the character of an independent, real substance.1

     Whenever real, corporeal man, man with his feet firmly on the solid ground, man exhaling and inhaling all the forces of nature, establishes his real, objective essential powers as alien objects by his externalization, it is not the act of positing which is the subject in this process: it is the subjectivity of objective essential powers whose action, therefore, must also be something obfective.  A being who is objective acts objectively, and he would not act objectively if the objective did not reside in the very nature of his being. He creates or establishes only objects, because he is established by objects-because at bottom he is nature. In the act of establishing, therefore, this objective being does not fall from his state of ""pure activity"" into a creating of the object; on the contrary, his objective product only confirms his objective activity, establishing his activity as the activity of an objective, natural being.

     Here we see how consistent naturalism or humanism distinguishes itself both from idealism and materialism, constituting at the same time the unifying truth of both. We see also how only naturalism is capable of comprehending the act of world history.

     Man is directly a natural being. As a natural being and as a living natural being he is on the one hand furnished with natural powers of life-he is an active natural being. These forces exist in him as tendencies and abilities-as impulses. On the other hand, as a natural, corporeal, sensuous, objective being he is a suffering, conditioned and limited creature, like animals and plants. That is to say, the objects of his impulses exist outside him, as objects independent of him; yet these objects are objects of his need-essential objects, indispensable to the manifestation and confirmation of his essential powers. To say that man is a corporeal, living, real, sensuous, objective being full of natural vigour is to say that he has real, sensuous, objects as the objects of his being or of his life, or that he can only express his life in real, sensuous objects. To be objective, natural and sensuous, and at the same time to have object, nature and sense outside oneself, or oneself to be object, nature and sense for a third party, is one and the same thing. Hunger is a natural need; it therefore needs a nature outside itself,  an object outside itself, in order to satisfy itself, to be stilled. Hunger is an acknowledged need of my body for an object existing outside it, indispensable to its integration and to the expression of its essential being. The sun is the object of the plant-an indispensable object to it, confirming its life-just as the plant is an object of the sun, being an expression of the life-awakening power of the sun, of the sun's objective essential power.

     A being which does not have its nature outside itself is not a natural being, and plays no part in the system of nature. A being which has no object outside itself is not an objective being. A being which is not itself an object for some third being has no being for its object; i.e., it is not objectively related. Its being is not objective. 1

     An unobjective being is a nullity-an un-being.

     Suppose a being which is neither an object itself, nor has an object. Such a being, in the first place, would be the unique being: there would exist no being outside it-it would-exist solitary and alone. For as soon as there are objects outside me, as soon as I am not alone, I am another-another reality than the object outside me. For this third object I am thus an other reality than it; that is, I am its object. Thus, to suppose a being which is not the object of another being is to presuppose that no objective being exists. As soon as I have an object, this object has me for an object. But a non-objective being is an unreal, nonsensical thing-something merely thought of (merely imagined, that is)-a creature of abstraction. To be sensuous, that is, to be an object of sense, to be a sensuous object, and thus to have sensuous objects outside one¬self-objects of one's sensuousness. To be sensuous is to suffer.8

     Man as an objective, sensuous being is therefore a suffering being-and because he feels what he suffers, a passionate being. Passion is the essential force of man energetically bent on its object.

     But man is not merely a natural being: he is a human natural being. That is to say, he is a being for himself. Therefore he is a species being, and has to confirm and manifest himself as such both in his being and in his knowing. Therefore, human objects are not natural objects as they immediately present themselves, and neither is human sense as it immediately is-as it is objectively¬human sensibility, human objectivity. Neither nature objectively nor nature subjectively is directly given in a form adequate to the human being. And as everything natural has to have its beginning, man too has his act of coming-to-be-history-which, however, is for him a known history, and hence as an act of coming-to-be it is a conscious self-transcending act of coming-to-be. History is the true natural history of man (on which more later) .

     Thirdly, because this establishing of thinghood is itself only sham, an act contradicting the nature of pure activity, it has to be cancelled again and thinghood denied.

     Re. 3, 4, 5 and 6. (3) This externalization of consciousness has not merely a negative but a positive significance, and (4) it has this meaning not merely for us or intrinsically, but for consciousness itself.9 (5) For consciousness the negative of the object, its annulling of itself, has positive significance-consciousness knows this nullity of the object because it alienates itself; for in this alienoation it knows itself as object, or, for the sake of the indivisible unity of being-for•itself, the object as itself. (6) On the other hand, there is also this other moment in the process, that consciousness has also just as much annulled and superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus at home with itself in its other-being as such.

     As we have already seen: the appropriation of what is estranged and objective, or the annulling of objectivity in the form of estrangement ( which has to advance from indifferent foreignness to real, antagonistic estrangement) means equally or even primarily for Hegel that it is objectivity which is to be annulled, because it is not the determinate character of the object, but rather its objective character that is offensive and constitutes estrangement for self-consciousness. The object is therefore something negative, self¬annulling nullity. This nullity of the object has not only a negative but a positive meaning for consciousness, for such a nullity of the object is precisely the self•confirmation of the non• objectivity, of the abstraction of itself. For consciousness itself this nullity of the object has a positive meaning because it knows this nullity, the objective being, as its self-alienation; because it knows that it exists only as a result of its own self-alienation....

     The way in which consciousness is, and in which something is for it, is knowing. Knowing is its sale act. Something therefore comes to be for consciousness in so far as the latter knows this something. Knowing is its sale objective relation. Consciousness; then, knows the nullity of the object (i.e., knows the non-existence of the distinction between the object and itself, the non-existence of the object for it) because it knows the object as its self alienation; that is, it knows itself-knows knowing as the object-because the object is only the semblance of an object, a piece of mystification, which in its essence, however, is nothing else but knowing itself, which has confronted itself with itself and in so doing has confronted itself with a nullity-a something which has no objectivity outside the knowing. Or: knowing knows that in relating itself to an object it is only outside itself-that lt only externalizes itself; that it itself appears to itself only as an object-or that that which appears to it as an object is only it itself.

     On the other hand, says Hegel, there is at the same time this other moment in this process, that consciousness has just as much annulled and superseded this externalization and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus at home in its other-being as such.

     In this discussion are brought together all the illusions of speculation.

     First of all: consciousness-self-consciousness-is at home with itself in its other-being as such. It is therefore-or if we here abstract from the Hegelian abstraction and put the self-consciousness of man instead of Self-consciousness-it is at home with itself in its other-being, as such. This implies, for one thing, that consciousness (knowing as knowing, thinking as thinking) pretends to be directly the other of itself-to be the world of sense, the real world, life-thought over-reaching itself in thought (Feuerbach).1 This aspect is contained herein, inasmuch as con¬sciousness as mere consciousness takes offence not at estranged objectivity, but at objectivity as such.

     Secondly, this implies that self-conscious man, in so far as he has recognized and annulled and superseded the spiritual world (or his world's spiritual, general mode of being) as self-alienation, nevertheless again confirms this in its alienated shape and passes it off as his true mode of being-re-establishes it, and pretends to be at home in his other-being as such. Thus, for instance, after annulling and superseding religion, after recognizing religion to be a product of self-alienation, he yet finds confirmation of himself in religion as religion. Here is the root of Hegel's false positivism, or of his merely apparent criticism: this is what Feuerbach designated as the positing, negating and re-establishing of religion or theology-but it has to be grasped in more general terms. Thus reason is at home in unreason as unreason. The man who has recognized that he is leading an alienated life in politics, law, etc., is leading his true human life in this alienated life as such. Self-affirmation, in contradiction with itself-in contradiction both with the knowledge of and with the essential being of the object-is thus true knowledge and life.

     There can therefore no longer be any question about an act of accommodation on Hegel's part vis-à-visreligion, the state, etc.,since this lie is the lie of his principle.

     If I know religion as alienated human self-consciousness, then what I know in it as religion is not my self-consciousness, but my alienated self-consciousness confirmed in it. I therefore know my own self, the self-consciousness that belongs to its very nature, confirmed not in religion but rather in annihilated and superseded religion.

     In Hegel, therefore, the negation of the negation is not the confirmation of the true essence, effected precisely through negation of the pseudo-essence. With him the negation of the negation is the confirmation of the pseudo-essence, or of the self-estranged essence in its denial; or it is the denial of this pseudo-essence as an objective being dwelling outside man and independent of him, and its transformation into the subject.

     A peculiar role, therefore, is played by the act of superseding in which denial and preservation-denial and affirmation-are bound together.

     Thus, for example, in Hegel's Philosophy of Right, Private Right superseded equals Morality, Morality superseded equals the Family, the Family superseded equals Civil Society, Civil Society superseded equals the State, the State superseded equals World History. In the actual world private right, morality, the family, civil society, the state, etc., remain in existence, only they have become moments of man-state of his existence and being-which have no validity in isolation, but dissolve and engender one another, etc. They have become moments of motion.

     In their actual existence this mobile nature of theirs is hidden. It first appears and is made manifest in thought, in philosophy. Hence my true religious existence is my existence in the philosophy of religion; my true political existence is my existence within the philosophy of right; my true natural existence, existence in the philosophy of nature; my true artistic existence, existence in the philosophy of art; my true human existence, my existence in philosophy. Likewise the true existence of religion, the state, nature, art is, the philosophy of religion, of nature, of the state and of art. If, however, the philosophy of religion, etc., is for me the sole true existence of religion, then, too, it is only as a philosopher of religion that I am truly religious, and so I deny real religious sentiment and the really religious man. But at the same time I assert them, in part within my own existence or within the alien existence which I oppose to them-for this is only their philosophic expression-and in part I assert them in their own original shape, for they have validity for me as merely the apparent other-being, as allegories, forms of their own true existence ( i.e., of my philosophical existence) hidden under sensuous disguises.

     In just the same way, Quality superseded equals Quantity, Quantity superseded equals Measure, Measure superseded equalsEssence, Essence superseded equals Appearance, Appearance superseded equals Actuality, Actuality superseded equals the Concept, the Concept superseded equals Objectivity, Objectivity superseded equals the Absolute Idea, the Absolute Idea superseded equals Nature, Nature superseded equals Ethical Objective Mind, Ethical Mind superseded equals Art, Art superseded equals Religion, Religion superseded equals Absolute Knowledge.2

     On the one hand, this act of superseding is a transcending of the thought entity; th us, Private Property as a thought is transcended in the thought of morality. And because thought imagines itself to be directly the other of itself, to be sensuous reality-and therefore takes its own action for sensuous, real action-this superseding in thought, which leaves its object standing in the real world, believes that it has really overcome it. On the other hand, because the object has now become for it a moment of thought, thought takes it in its reality too to be self-confirmation of itself-of self• consciousness, of abstraction.

     From the one point of view the existent which Hegel supersedes in philosophy is therefore not real religion, the real state, or real nature, but religion itself already become an object of knowledge, i.c., Dogmatics; thc same with Jurisprudence, Political Science and Natural Science. From the one point of view, therefore, he stands in opposition both to the real thing and to immediate, unphilosophic science or the unphilosophic conceptions of this thing. He therefore contradicts their conventional conceptions.3

     On the other hand, the religious man, etc., can find in Hegel his final confirmation.

     It is now time to lay hold of the positive aspects of the Hegelian dialectic within the realm of estrangement.

      (a) Annulling as an objective movement of retracting the alienation into self. This is the insight, expressed within the• estrangement, concerning the appropriation of the objective essence through the annulment of its estrangement; it is the estranged insight into the real objectification of man, into the real appropriation of his objective essence through the annihilation of the estranged character of the objective world, through the annulment of the objective world in its estranged mode of being-just as atheism, being the annulment of God, is the advent of theoretic humanism, and communism, as the annulment of private property, is the justification of real human life as man's possession and thus the advent of practical humanism (or just as atheism is humanism mediated with itself through the annulment of religion, whilst communism is humanism mediated with itself through the annulment of private property). Only through the annulment of this mediation-which is itself, however, a necessary premise-does positively self-deriving humanism, positive humanism, come into being.

     But atheism and communism are no flight, no abstraction; they are not a losing of the objective world begotten by man-of man's essential powers given over to the realm of objectivity; they are not a returning in poverty to unnatural, primitive simplicity. On the contrary, they are but the first real coming-to-be, the realization become real for man, of man's essence-of the essence of man as something real.

     Thus, by grasping the positive meaning of self-referred negation (if even again in estranged fashion) Hegel grasps man's self¬estrangement, the alienation of man's essence, man's loss of objectivity and his loss of realness as finding of self, change of his nature, his objectification and realization. In short, within the sphere of abstraction, Hegel conceives labour as man's act of self¬genesis-conceives man's relation to himself as an alien being and the manifesting of h imself as an alien being to be the coming-to-be of species-consciousness and species-life.

      (b) However, apart from, or rather in consequence of, the perverseness already described, this act appears in Hegel:

     First of all as a merely formal, because abstract, act, because the human essence itself is taken to be only an abstract, thinking
essence, conceived merely as. self-consciousness. And,
     secondly, because the conception is formal and abstract, the annulment of the alienation becomes a confirmation of the alienation; or again, for Hegel this movement of self-genesis and self¬objectification in the form of self-alienation and self-estrangement is the absolute, and hence final, expression of human life-of life with itself as its aim, of life at rest in itself, of life that has attained oneness with its essence.

     This movement, in its abstract form as dialectic, is therefore regarded as truly human life, and because it is nevertheless an abstraction-an estrangement of human life-it is regarded as a divine process, but as the divine process of man, a process traversed by man's abstract, pure, absolute essence that is distinct from him.

     Thirdly, this process must have a bearer, a subject. But the subject first emerges as a result. This result-the subject knowing itself as absolute self-consciousness-is therefore God-absolute Spirit-the self-knowing and self-manifesting Idea. Real man and real nature become mere predicates-symbols of this esoteric, unreal man and of this unreal nature. Subject and predicate are therefore related to each other in absolute inversion-a mystical subject¬object or a subjectivity reaching beyond the object-the absolute subject as a process, as subject alienating itself and returning from alienation into itself, but at the same time retracting this alienationinto itself, and the subject as this process; a pure, restless revolving within itself.

     First, the formal and abstract conception of man's act of self¬genesis or self-objectification.

     Hegel having posited man as equivalent to self-consciousness, the estranged object-the estranged essential reality of man-is nothing but consciousness, the thought of estrangement merely¬estrangement's abstract and therefore empty and unreal expression, negation. The annulment of the alienation is therefore likewise nothing but an abstract, empty annulment of that empty abstraction-the negation of the negation. The rich, living, sensuous, concrete activity of self-objectification is therefore reduced to its mere abstraction, absolute negativity-an abstraction which is again fixed as such and thought of as an independent activity-as sheer activity. Because this so-called negativity is nothing but the abstract, empty form of that real living act, its content can in consequence be merely a formal content begotten by abstraction from all content. As a result there are general, abstract forms of abstraction pertaining to every content and on that account indifferent to, and, consequently, valid for, all content-the thought-forms or logical categories torn from real mind and from real nature. (We shall unfold the logical content of absolute negativity further on.)

     Hegel's positive achievement here, in his speculative logic, is that the determinate concepts, the universal fixed thought-forms in their independence vis-à-vis nature and mind are a necessary result of the general estrangement of the human essence and therefore also of human thought, and that Hegel has there-fore brought these together and presented them as moments of the abstraction¬process. For example, superseded Being is Essence, superseded Essence is Concept, the Concept superseded is ... the Absolute Idea. But what, then, is the Absolute Idea? It supersedes its own self again, if it does not want to traverse once more from the beginning the whole act of abstraction, and to acquiesce in being a totality of abstractions or in being the self-comprehending abstraction. But abstraction comprehending itself as abstraction knows itself to be nothing: it must abandon itself-abandon abstraction-and so it arrives at an entity which is its exact contrary -at nature. Thus, the entire Logic is the demonstration that abstract thought is nothing in itself; that the Absolute Idea is nothing in itself; that only Nature is something.

     The absolute idea, the abstract idea, which ""considered with regard to its unity with itself is intuiting,""4 ( Hegel's Encyclopaedia, 3rd edition, p. 222 ) , and which ""in its own absolute truth resolves to let the moment of its particularity or of initial characterization and other-being-the immediate idea, as its reflection, go forth freely from itself as nature"" (l.c.)-this whole idea which behaves in such a strange and singular way, and which has given the Hegelians such terrible headaches, is from beginning to end nothing else but abstraction ( i.e., the abstract thinker)¬abstraction which, made wise by experience and enlightened concerning its truth, resolves under various (false and themselves still abstract) conditions to abandon itself and to replace its self¬absorption, nothingness, generality and indeterminateness by its other-being, the particular, and the determinate; resolves to let nature, which it held hidden in itself only as an abstraction, as a thought-entity, go forth freely from itself: that is to say, abstraction resolves to forsake abstraction and to have a look at nature free of abstraction. The abstract idea, which without mediation becomes intuiting, is nothing else through-and-through but abstract thinking that gives itself up and resolves on intuition. This entire transition from Logic to Natural Philosophy is nothing else but the transition-so difficult to effect for the abstract thinker and therefore so queer in his description of it-from abstracting to intuiting. The mystical feeling which drives the philosopher forward from abstract thinking to intuiting is boredom-the longing for a content.
      ( The man estranged from himself is also the thinker estranged from his essence-that is, from the natural and human essence. His thoughts are therefore fixed mental shapes or ghosts dwelling outside nature and man. Hegel has locked up all these fixed mental forms together in his Logic, laying hold of each of them first as negation-that is, as an alienation of human thought-and then as negation of the negation-that is, as a superseding of this alienation, as a real expression of human thought. But as even this still takes place within the confines of the estrangement, this negation of the negation is in part the restoring of these fixed forms in their estrangement; in part a stopping-short at the last act-the act of self-reference in alienation-as the true mode of being of these fixed mental forms;5 and in part, to the extent that this abstraction apprehends itself and experiences an infinite weariness with itself, there makes its appearance in Hegel, in the formof the resolution to recognize nature as the essential being and to go over to intuition, the abandonment of abstract thought-the abandonment of thought revolving solely within the orbit of thought, of thought devoid of eyes, of teeth, of ears, of everything.)

     But nature too, taken abstractly, for itself-nature fixed in isolation from man-is nothing for man. It goes without saying that the abstract thinker who has committed himself to intuiting, intuits nature abstractly. Just as nature lay enclosed in the thinker in the form of the absolute idea, in the form of a thought-entity-in a shape which is his and yet is esoteric and mysterious even to him-so what he has let go forth from himself in truth is only this abstract nature, only nature as a thought-entity-but with the significance now of being the other-being of thought, of being real, intuited nature-of being nature distinguished from abstract thought. Or, to talk a human language, the abstract thinker learns in his intuition of nature that the entities which he thought to create from nothing, from pure abstraction-the entities he believed he was producing in the divine dialectic as pure products of the labour of thought forever weaving in itself and never looking outward-are nothing else but abstractions from characteristics of nature. To him, therefore, the whole of nature merely repeats the logical abstractions in a sensuous, external form . He analyses it and these abstractions over again. Thus, his intuition of nature is only the act of confirming his abstraction from the intuition of nature-is only the conscious repetition by him of the process of begetting his abstraction. Thus, for example, Time equals Negativity referred to itself (l.c., p. 238): to the superseded Becoming as Being there corresponds, in natural form, superseded Movement as Matter. Light is Reflection-in-Itself, in natural form. Body as Moon and Comet is the natural form of the antithesis which according to the Logic is on the one side the Positive resting on itself and on the other side the Negative resting on itself. The Earth is the natural form of the logical Ground, as the negative unity of the anti thesis, etc.

     Nature as nature-that is to say, in so far as it is still sensuously distinguished from that secret sense hidden within it-nature isolated, distinguished from these abstractions, is nothing-a nothing proving itself to be nothing-is devoid of sense, or has only the sense of being an externality which has to be annulled.

        &nb   ""In the finite-teleological position is to be found the correct
     premise that nature does not contain within itself the absolute purpose"" (p. 225 )
     Its purpose is the confirmation of abstraction.
            ""Nature has shown itself to be the Idea in the form of
      other-being. Since the Idea is in this form the negative of itself
      or external to itself, nature is not just relatively external vis-à-vis
      this idea, but externality constitutes the form in which it exists as nature"" (p. 227 ) .

      Externality here is not to be understood as the self-externalizing world of sense open to the light, open to the man endowed with senses. It is to be taken here in the sense of alienation-a mistake, a defect, which ought not to be. For what is true is still the Idea. Nature is only the form of the Idea's other-being. And since abstract thought is the essence, that which is external to it is by its essence something merely external. The abstract thinker recognizes at the same time that sensuousness-externality in contrast to thought weaving within itself-is the essence of nature. But he expresses his contrast in such a way as to make this externality of nature, its contrast to thought, its defect, so that inasmuch as it is distinguished from abstraction, nature is something defective. Something which is defective not merely for me or in my eyes but in itself-intrinsically-has something outside itself which it lacks. That is, its being is something other than it itself. Nature has therefore to supersede itself for the abstract thinker, for it is already posited by him as a potentially superseded being.

            ""For us, Mind has nature, for its premise, being nature's truth
     and for that reason its absolute prius. In this truth nature has vanished, and mind has resulted as the Idea arrived at being-
      for-itself, the object of which, as well as the subject, is the con-
      cept. This identity is absolute negativity, for whereas in nature
      the concept has its perfect external objectivity, this its alienation
      has been superseded, and in this alienation the concept has
      become identical with itself. But it is this identity, therefore,
      in being a return out of nature"" (p. 392 ).
            ""As the abstract idea, revelation is unmediated transition to,
      the coming-to-be of, nature; as the revelation of the mind, which
      is free, it is the establishing of nature as the mind's world-an
      establishing which at the same time, being reflection, is a presup-
    posing of the world as independently-existing nature. Revelation
      in conception is the creation of nature as the mind's being, in
      which the mind procures the affirmation and the truth of its
      freedom.""7 ""The absolute is mind. This is the highest definition
      of the absolute.""


                               Critical Marginal Notes on the Article
                             ""The King of Prussia and Social Reform""
                                                   KARL MARX

Apart from showing Marx's pride in being the socialist spokesman of a revolutionarily ""philosophical people,"" the Germans, and his sense of the theoretical preeminence of German socialist thought because of its philosophical depth, this early article is especially notable for its discussion of the relation between social and political revolution. The ""Prussian"" who wrote the article Marx attacks was Arnold Ruge. The event under discussion was the Silesian weavers' uprising of June 1844. The essay was written in July 1844 and published the following month in the newspaper Vorwarts.

   No. 60 of Vorwarts contains an article headed ""Der Konig von Preussen und die Sozialreform,"" signed ""A Prussian.""
   First of all this alleged Prussian sets out the content of the royal Prussian Cabinet order on the uprising of the Silesian workers and the opinion of the French newspaper La Reforme on the Prussian Cabinet order. The Reforme, he writes, considers that the King's ""alarm and religious feeling"" are the source of the Cabinet order. It even sees in this document a presentiment of the great reforms which are in prospect for bourgeois society. The ""Prussian"" lectures the Réforme as follows :

         The King and German society has not yet arrived at the ‘pre-sentiment of
     their reform,"" even the Silesian and Bohemian uprisings have not aroused
     this feeling. It is impossible to makesuch an unpolitical
     country as Gemany regard the partial distressof the factory districts
     as a matter of general concern, let alone as an affliction of the whole civilised
      world. The Germans regard this event as if it were of the same nature as
     any local distress due to flood or famine. Hence the King regards it as due
     to deficiencies in the administration or in charitable activity. For this
     reason, and because a few soldiers sufficed to cope with the feeble weavers,
     the destruction of factories and machinery, too, did not inspire any ""alarm""
     either in the King or the authorities.Indeed, the Cabinet order was not
      prompted even by religious feeling: it is a very sober
     expression of the Christian art of statesmanship and of a doctrine which
     considers that no difficulties can withstand its sole medicine-""the well
     -disposed Christian  hearts."" Poverty and crime are two great evils; who can
     cure them? The state and the authorities? No, but the union of all Christian
     hearts can.

   The alleged Prussian denies the King's ""alarm"" on the grounds, among others, that a few soldiers sufficed to cope with the feeble weavers.

   Therefore, in a country where ceremonial dinners with liberal toasts and liberally foaming champagne-recall the Dusseldorf festival inspired a royal Cabinet order;1where not a single soldier was needed to shatter the desires of the entire liberal bourgeoisie for freedom of the press and a constitution; in a country where passive obedience is the order of the day-<:an it be that in such a country the necessity to employ armed force against feeble weavers is not an event, and not an alarming event? Moreover, at the first encounter the feeble weavers were victorious. They were suppressed only by subsequent troop reinforcements. Is the uprising of a body of workers less dangerous because it did not require a whole army to suppress it? Let the wise Prussian compare the uprising of the Silesian weavers with the revolts of the English workers, and the Silesian weavers will be seen by him to be strong weavers.

   Starting out from the general relation of politics to social ills, we shall show why the uprising of the weavers could not cause the King any special ""alarm."" For the time being we shall say only the following: the uprising was not aimed directly against the King of Prussia, but against the bourgeoisie. As an aristocrat and absolute monarch, the King of Prussia cannot love the bourgeoisie; still less can he be alarmed if the submissiveness and impotence of the bourgeoisie is increased because of a tense and difficult relationship between it and the proletariat. Further: the orthodox Catholic is more hostile to the orthodox Protestant than to the atheist, just as the Legitimist is more hostile to the liberal than to the Communist. This is not because the atheist and the Communist are more akin to the Catholic or Legitimist, but because they are more foreign to him than are the Protestant and the liberal, being outside his circle. In the sphere of politics, the King of Prussia, as a politician, has his direct opposite in liberalism. For the King, the proletariat is as little an antithesis as the King is for the proletariat. The proletariat would have to have already attained considerable power for it to stifle the other antipathies and political antitheses and to divert to itself all political enmity. Finally: in view of the well-known charac¬ter of the King, avid for anything interesting and significant, it must have been a joyful surprise for him to discover this ""interesting"" and ""much discussed"" pauperism in his own territory and con-sequently a new opportunity for making people talk about him. How pleasant for him must have been the news that henceforth he posseses his ""own,"" royal Prussian pauperism! Let us suppose * * * that the ""Prussian's"" remarks about the German Government and the German bourgeoisie-after all, the latter is included in "" German society""-are entirely well founded. Is this section of society more at a loss in Germany than in England and France? Can one be more at a loss than, for example, in England, where perplexity has been made into a system? When today workers' revolts break out throughout England, the bourgeoisie and government there know no better what to do than in the last third of the eighteenth century. Their sole expedient is material force, and since this material force diminishes in the same proportion as the spread of pauperism and the understanding of the proletariat increase, England's perplexity inevitably grows in geometrical progression.
   Finally, it is untrue, actually untrue, that the German bourgeoisie totally fails to understand the general significance of the Silesian uprising. In several towns the masters are trying to act jointly with the apprentices. All the liberal German newspapers, the organs of the liberal bourgeoisie, teem with articles about the organisation of labour, the reform of society, criticism of monopolies and competition, etc. All this is the result of the movements among the workers.* * *

                                                   * * *

   Let us pass now to the oracular pronouncements of the ""Prussian"" on the German workers. ""The German poor,"" he says wittily, ""are no wiser than the poor Germans, i.e., nowhere do they see beyond their own hearth and home, their own factory, their own district; the whole question has so far still been ignored by the all-penetrating political soul.""

   In order to be able to compare the condition of the German workers with the condition of the French and English workers, the ""Prussian"" would have had to compare the first form, the start, of the English and French workers' movement with the Germanmovement that is just beginning. He failed to do so. Consequently, his arguments lead to trivialities, such as that industry in Germany is not yet so developed as in England, or that a movement at its start looks different from the movement in its subsequent progress. He wanted to speak about the specific character of the German workers' movement, but he has not a word to say on this subject of his.

   On the other hand, suppose the ""Prussian"" were to adopt the correct standpoint. He will find that not one of the French and English workers' uprisings had such a theoretical and consciouscharacter as the uprising of the Silesian weavers.

   First of all, recall the song of the weavers,2 that bold call to struggle, in which there is not even a mention of hearth and home, factory or district, but in which the proletariat at once, in a striking, sharp, unrestrained and powerful manner, proclaims its opposition to the society of private property. The Silesian uprising begins precisely with what the French and English workers' uprisings end, with consciousness of the nature of the proletariat. The action itself bears the stamp of this superior character. Not only machines, these rivals of the workers, are destroyed, but also ledgers, the titles to property. And while all other movements were aimed primarily only against the owner of the industrial enterprise, the visible enemy, this movement is at the same time directed against the banker, the hidden enemy. Finally, not a single English workers' uprising was carried out with such courage, thought and endurance.

   As for the educational level or capacity for education of the German workers in general, I call to mind Weitling's brilliant writings, which as regards theory are often superior even to those of Proudhon, however much they are inferior to the latter in their exe¬cution. Where among the bourgeoisie including its philosophers and learned writers is to be found a book about the emancipation of the bourgeoisie-political emancipation similar to Weitling's work: Garantien der Harmonie und Freiheit? It is enough to compare the petty, faint-hearted mediocrity of German political literature with this vehement and briliant literary debut of the German workers, it is enough to compare these gigantic infant shoes of the proletariat with the dwarfish, worn-out political shoes of the German bourgeoisie, and one is bound to prophesy that the German Cinderella will one day have the figure of an athlete. It has to be admitted that the German proletariat is the theoretician of the European proletariat, just as the English proletariat is its econo¬mist, and the French proletariat its politician. It has to be admitted that Germany is just as much classically destined for a social revolution as it is incapable of a political one. For, just as the impotence of the German bourgeoisie is the political impotence of Germany cial capability of Germany. The disparity between the philosophical and the political development of Germany is not an anomaly. It is an inevitable disparity. A philosophical people can find its corresponding practice only in socialism, hence it is only in the proletariat that it can find the dynamic elements of its emancipation.

                                                 * *  *

   Why does the ""Prussian"" judge the German workers so contemptuously? Because he finds that the ""whole question""-namely, the question of the distressed state of the workers-has ""so far still"" been ignored by the ""all-penetrating politicalsoul"" He expounds his platonic love for the political soul in more detail as follows : ""Alluprisings which break out in this disastrous isolation of people from the community, and of their thoughts from social principles, will be smothered in blood and incomprehension; but when distress pro¬duces understanding, and the political understanding of the Germans discovers the roots of social distress, then in Germany too these events will be appreciated as symptoms of a great revolution.""

                                                 * *  *

   Thatsocial distress produces political understanding is so incorrect . that, on the contrary, what is correct is the opposite : social well-being produces political understanding. Political understanding is a spiritualist, and is given to him who already has, to him who is already comfortably situated. Let our ""Prussian"" listen to a French economist, M. Michel Chevalier, on this subject: ""'When the bourgeoisie rose up in 1789, it lacked in order to be free only participation in governing the country. Emancipation consisted for it in wresting the control of public affairs, the principal civil, military and religious functions, from the hands of the privileged who had the monopoly of these functions. Rich and enlightened, capable of being self-sufficient and of managing its own affairs, it wanted to escape from the system of arbitrary rule.""3

   We have already shown the ""Prussian"" how incapable politicalunderstanding is of discovering the source of social distress. Just oneword more on this view of his. The more developed and universal the political understanding of a people, the more does the proletariat-at any rate at the beginning of the movement-squander its forces in senseless, useless revolts, which are drowned in blood. Because it thinks in the framework of politics, the proletariat sees the cause of all evils in the will, and all means of remedy in violence and in the overthrow of a particular form of state. The proof: the first uprisings of the French proletariat.4 The Lyons workers believed that they were pursuing only political aims, that they were only soldiers of the republic, whereas actually they were soldiers of socialism. Thus their political understanding concealed from them the roots of social distress, thus it falsified their insight into their real aim, thus their political understanding deceived their social instinct.

   But if the ""Prussian"" expects understanding to be produced by distress, why does he lump together ""smothering in blood"" and ""smothering in incomprehension""? If distress is in general a means of producing understanding, then bloody distress is even a very acute means to this end. The ""Prussian"" therefore should have said: smothering in blood will smother incomprehension and procure a proper current of air for the understanding.

    The ""Prussian"" prophesies the smothering of uprisings which break out in ""disastrous isolation of people from the community, and in the separation of their thoughts from social principles.""

   We have shown that the Silesian uprising occurred by no means in circumstances of the separation of thoughts from social principles. It only remains for us to deal with the ""disastrous isolation of people from the community."" By community here is meant the political community, the state. This is the old story about unpolitical Germany.

   But do not all uprisings, without exception, break out in a disas-trous isolation of man from the community? Does not every uprising necessarily presuppose isolation? Would the 1789 revolution have taken place without the disastrous isolation of French citizens from the community? It was intended precisely to abolish this isolation.

   But the community from which the worker is isolated is a community the real character and scope of which is quite different from that of the political community . The community from which the worker is isolated by his own labour is life itself, physical and mental life, human morality, human activity, human enjoyment, human nature. Human nature is the true community of men. The disastrous isolation from this essential nature is incomparably more universal, more intolerable, more dreadful, and more contradictory, than isolation from the political community. Hence, too, the abolition of this isolation and even a partial reaction to it, an uprisingagainst it-is just as much more infinite as man is more infinite than the citizen, and human life more infinite than political life. Therefore, however partial the uprising of the industrial workersmay be, it contains within itself a universal soul; however universal a political uprising may be, it conceals even in its most grandioseform a narrow-minded spirit.

   The ""Prussian"" worthily concludes his article with the following sentence: ""A social revolution without a political soul (i.e., without an organising idea from the point of view of the whole ) is im¬possible.""

   We have already seen that a social revolution is found to have the point of view of the whole because even if it were to occur in only one factory district it represents man's protest against a de- humanised life, because it starts out from the point of view of a separate real individual, because the community, against the separation of which from himself the individual reacts, is man's true community, human nature. The politicalsoul of revolution, on the other hand, consists in the tendency of classes having no political influence to abolish their isolation from statehood and rule. Its point of view is that of the state, of an abstractwhole, which exists only through separation from real life, and which is inconceivablewithout the organized contradiction between the universal idea of man and the individual existence of man. Hence, too, a revolution with a political soul, in accordance with the limited and dichotomous nature of this soul, organises a ruling stratum in society at the expense of society itself.

   We want to divulge to the ""Prussian"" what a ""social revolutionwith a political soul"" actually is; we shall thereby at the same time confide the secret to him that he himself is unable, even in words, to rise above the narrow-minded political point of view.

   A ""social"" revolution with a political soul is either a nonsensical concoction, if by ""social"" revolution the ""Prussian"" means a ""social"" as opposed to a political revolution, and nevertheless endows the social revolution with a political soul instead of a social one; or else a ""social revolution with a political soul"" is only a paraphrase for what was usually called a ""political revolution,"" or ""simply a revolution."" Every revolution dissolves the old society!' and to that extent it is social. Every revolution overthrows the old powerand to that extent it is political.

   Let the ""Prussian"" choose between theparaphrase and the nonsense! But whereas a social revolution with a political soul is a para-phrase or nonsense, a political revolution with a social soul has a rational meaning. Revolution in general-the overthrow of the existing power and dissolution of the old relationships is a politi¬cal act. But socialism cannot be realised without revolution. It needs this political act insofar as it needs destruction and dissolution. But where its organizing activity!' begins, where its proper object, its soul, comes to the fore-there socialism throws off the
political cloak.

                                     Alienation and Social Classes

                                               KARL MARX

A meeting between Marx and Engels in Paris at the end of August, 1844, inaugurated their lifelong collaboration. Their first jointly written work, published in 1845, was The Holy Family: A Critique of Critical Criticism, a heavily satirical polemic against Bruno Bauer and the Young Hegelians. The following passage, probably written by Marx, shows the alienation doctrine of the 1844 manuscripts merging into the class struggle doctrine as we encounter it in The German Ideology and later Marxist writings. It is also of value as a revelation of Marx's special way of conceiving and ex¬plaining historical necessity.

   The translation for this edition is by R. C. Tucker

   * * *The proletariat and wealth are opposites. As such they form a whole. They are both products of the world of private property. The whole question is what position each of these two ele¬ments occupies within the opposition. It does not suffice to pro-claim them two sides of one whole.

   Private property as private property, as wealth, is compelled to preserve its own existence and thereby the existence of its opposite, the proletariat. This is the positive side of the antagonism, private property satisfied with itself.

   The proletariat, on the other hand, is compelled to abolish itself and thereby its conditioning opposite private property which makes it a proletariat. This is the negative side of the antagonism, its disturbance within itself, private property abolished and in the process of abolishing itself.

   The possessing class and the proletarian class represent one and the same human self-alienation.2 But the former feels satisfied and affirmed in this self-alienation, experiences the alienation as a sign of its own power, and possesses in it the appearance of a human existence. The latter, however, feels destroyed in this alienation, seeing in it its own impotence and the reality of an inhuman existence. To use Hegel's expression, this class is, within depravity, anIndignation against this depravity, an indignation necessarily aroused in this class by the contradiction between its human natureand its life-situation, which is a blatant, outright and all-embracing denial of that very nature.

   Within the antagonism as a whole, therefore, private property represents the conservative side and the proletariat the destructiveside. From the former comes action aimed at preserving the antago¬nism; from the latter, action aimed at its destruction.

   In its economic movement, it is true, private property presses towards its own dissolution, but it does this only by means of a developmental course that is unconscious and takes place independently of it and against its will, a course determined by the nature of the thing itself. It does this only by giving rise to the proletariat as proletariat this poverty conscious of its own spiritual and physical poverty, this dehumanization which is conscious of itself as a dehumanization and hence abolishes itself.3 The proletariat executes the sentence that proletariat producing private property passes upon itself, just as it executes the sentence that wage labour passes upon itself by producing others' wealth and its own poverty. When the proletariat wins victory, it by no means becomes the absolute side of society, for it wins victory only by abolishing itself and its opposite. Both the proletariat itself and its conditioning opposite-private property disappear with the victory of the proletariat.

   If socialist writers attribute this world historical role to the proletariat, this is by no means, as critical criticism assures us, because they regard the proletarians as gods. On the contrary. Since the fully formed proletariat represents, practically speaking, the completed abstraction from everything human, even from the appearance of being human; since all the living conditions of contemporary society have reached the acme of inhumanity in the living conditions of the proletariat; since in the proletariat man has lost himself, although at the same time he has both acquired a theoretical consciousness of this loss and has been directly forced into indigna¬tion against this inhumanity by virtue of an inexorable, utterly unembellishable, absolutely imperious need, that practical expression of necessity-because of all this the proletariat itself can and must liberate itself. But it cannot liberate itself without destroying its own living conditions. It cannot do so without destroying all the inhuman living conditions of contemporary society which are concentrated in its own situation. Not in vain does it go through the harsh but hardening school of labour. It is not a matter of what this or that proletarian or even the proletariat as a whole pictures at present as its goal . It is a matter of what the proletariat is in actuality and what, in accordance with this being, it will historically becompelled t o d o . Its goal and its historical action are prefigured in the most clear and ineluctable way in its own life-situation as well as in the whole organization of contemporary bourgeois society. There is no need to harp on the fact that a large part of the English and French proletariat is already conscious of its historic task and is continually working to bring this consciousness to full clar¬ity.

                                    Society and Economy in History

                                                   KARL MARX

This selection comes from Marx's letter of December 28, 1846, to P. V. Annenkov, who had asked for his opinion of Pierre• Joseph Proudhon's new book The Philosophy of Poverty. Marx subsequently expanded his critique of the book into a book-length polemic, The Poverty of Philosophy( themeat of which is succinctly stated in this letter).

    The material here presented is of interest as a trenchant statement of the materialist conception of history, Marx's enlarged understanding of the division of labor as a ubiquitous fact of human historical development, his view on the evolution of machinery, and his notion of dialectics as a process that finds final resolution in a social condition beyond conflict (""contradictions"") . Since this document appeared at the close of Marx's early period, it conclusively disproves the notion of a hiatus between a Hegelian-Feuer- bachian philosophical early Marx who hadn't reached historical materialism, and a scientific mature Marx who had.*  It was in and through the early writings represented in this section of our reader that Marx created historical materialism.

                                                    * * *

* * *M. Proudhon sees in history a series of social developments; he finds progress realised in history; finally he finds that men, as individuals, did not know what they were doing and were mistaken about their own movement, that is to say, their social development seems at the first glance to be distinct, separate and independent of their individual development. He cannot explain these facts, and so the hypothesis of universal reason manifesting itself comes in very handy. Nothing is easier than to invent mystical causes, that is to say, phrases which lack common sense.

     But when M. Proudhon admits that he understands nothing about the historical development of humanity-he admits this by using such high-sounding words as : Universal Reason, God, etc.¬is he not implicitly and necessarily admitting that he is incapable of understanding economic development?

     What is society, whatever its form may be? The product of men's reciprocal action. Are men free to choose this or that form of society? By no means. Assume a particular state of development in the productive faculties of man and you will get a particular form of commerce and consumption. Assume particular stages of development in production, commerce and consumption and you will have a corresponding social constitution, a corresponding organisation of the family, of orders or of classes, in a word, a corresponding civil society. Assume a particular civil society and you will get particular political conditions which are only the official expression of civil society. M. Proudhon will never understand this because he thinks he is doing something great by appealing from the state to civil society that is to say, from the official resume of society to official society.

   It is superfluous to add that men are not free to choose their productive forces-which are the basis of all their history for every productive force is an acquired force, the product of former activity. The productive forces are therefore the result of practical human energy; but this energy is itself conditioned by the circumstances in which men find themselves, by the productive forces already acquired, by the social form which exists before they do, which they do not create, which is the product of the preceding generation. Because of this simple fact that every succeeding generation finds itself in possession of the productive forces acquired by the previous generation, which serve it as the raw material for new production, a coherence arises in human history, a history of humanity takes shape which is all the more a history of humanity as the productive forces of man and therefore his social relations have been more developed. Hence it necessarily follows that the social history of men is never anything but the history of their individual development, whether they are conscious of it or not. Their material relations are the basis of all their relations. These material relations are only the necessary forms in which their material and individual activity is realised.

   M. Proudhon mixes up ideas and things. Men never relinquish what they have won, but this does not mean that they never relinquish the social form in which they have acquired certain productive forces. On the contrary, in order that they may not be deprived of the result attained and forfeit the fruits of civilisation, they are obliged, from the moment when their mode of carrying on commerce no longer corresponds to the productive forces acquired, to change all their traditional social forms. I am using the word ""commerce"" here in its widest sense, as we use Verkehr in German. For example: the privileges, the institution of guilds and corporations, the regulatory regime of the Middle Ages, were social relations that alone corresponded to the acquired productive forces and to the social condition which had previously existed and from which these institutions had arisen. Under the protection of the regime of cor-porations and regulations, capital was accumulated, overseas trade was developed, colonies were founded. But the fruits of this menwould have forfeited if they had tried to retain the forms under whose shelter these fruits had ripened. Hence burst two thunder¬claps-the Revolutions of 1640 and 1688. All the old economic forms, the social relations corresponding to them, the political conditions which were the official expression of the old civil society, were destroyed in England. Thus the economic forms in which men produce, consume, and exchange, are transitory and historical. With the acquisition of new productive faculties, men change their mode of production and with the mode of production all the economic relations which are merely the necessary relations of this particular mode of production.

   This is what M. Proudhon has not understood and still less demonstrated. M. Proudhon, incapable of following the real movement of history, produces a phantasmagoria which presumptuously claims to be dialectical. He does not feel it necessary to speak of .the seven teenth, the eighteenth or the nineteenth century, for his history proceeds in the misty realm of imagination and rises far above space and time. In short, it is not history but old Hegelian junk, it is not profane history-a history of man-but sacred history-a history of ideas. From his point of view man is only the instrument of which the idea or the eternal reason makes use in order to unfold itself. The evolutions of which M. Proudhon speaks are understood to be evolutions such as are accomplished within the mystic womb of the absolute idea. If you tear the veil from thisaP1ystical language, what it comes to is that M. Proudhon is offering you the order in which economic categories arrange themselves inside his own mind. It wi1l not require great exertion on my part to prove to you that it is the order of a very disorderly mind.

   The series of economic evolutions of the eternal reason begins with divisionof labour. To M. Proudhon division of labour is a perfectly simple thing. But was not the caste regime also a particular division of labour? Was not the regime of the corporations another division of labour? And is not the division of labour under the system of manufacture, which in England begins in the middle of the seventeenth century and comes to an end in the last part of the eighteenth, also totally different from the division of labour in large-scale, modern industry?

   M. Proudhon is so far from the truth that he neglects what even the profane economists attend to. When he talks about division of labour he does not feel it necessary to mention the world market. Good. Yet must not the division of labour in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, when there were still no colonies, when America did not as yet exist for Europe, and Eastern Asia only existed for her through the medium of Constantinople, have been fundamentally different from what it was in the seventeenth century when colonies were already developed.

   And that is not all. Is the whole inner organisation of nations, areall their international relations anything else than the expression of a particular division of labour? And must not these change when the division of labour changes?

   M. Proudhon has so little understood the problem of the division of labour that he never even mentions the separation of town and country, which took place in Germany, for instance, from the ninth to the twelfth century. Thus, to M. Proudhon, this separation is an eternal law since he knows neither its origin nor its development. All through his book he speaks as if this creation of a particular mode of production would endure until the end of time. All that M. Proudhon says about the division of labour is only a summary, and moreover a very superficial and incomplete summary, ofwhat Adam Smith and a thousand others have said before him .

   The second evolution is machinery. The connection between the division of labour and machinery is entirely mystical to M. Proud¬hon. Each kind of division of labour had its specific instruments of production. Between the middle of the seventeenth and themiddle of the eighteenth century, for instance, people did not make everything by hand. They had instruments, and very complicated ones at that, such as looms, ships, levers, etc.

   Thus there is nothing more absurd than to derive machinery from division of labour in general.

   I may also remark, by the way, that M. Proudhon has understood very little the historical origin of machinery, but has still less understood its development. One can say that up to the year 1825-the period of the first general crisis-the demands of consumption in general increased more rapidly than production, and the development of machinery was a necessary consequence of the needs of the market. Since 1825, the invention and application of machinery has been simply the result of the war between workers and employers. But this is only true of England. As for the European nations, they were driven to adopt machinery owing to English competition both in their home markets and on the world market. Finally, in North America the introduction of machinery was due both to competition with other countries and to lack of hands, that is, to the disproportion between the population of North America and its industrial needs. From these facts you can see what sagacity Monsieur Proudhon develops when he conjures up the spectre of competition as the third evolution, the antithesis to machinery!

   Lastly and in general, it is altogether absurd to make machineryan economic category alongside with division of labour, competition, credit, etc.

   Machinery is no more an economic category than the ox which draws the plough. The application of machinery in the present day is one of the relations of our present economic system, but the wayin which machinery is utilised is totally distinct from the machinery itself. Powder is powder whether used to wound a man or to dress his wounds.

                                                    * * *

   M. Proudhon, mainly because he lacks the historical knowledge, has not perceived that as men develop their productive faculties, that is, as they live, they develop certain relations with one another and that the nature of these relations must necessarily change with the change and growth of the productive faculties. He has not perceived that economic categories are only abstract expressions of these actual relations and only remain true while these relations exist. He therefore falls into the error of the bourgeois economists, who regard these economic categories as eternal and not as historical laws which are only laws for a particular historical development, for a definite development of the productive forces. Instead, therefore, of regarding the political-economic categories as abstract expressions of the real, transitory, historic social relations, Monsieur Proudhon, thanks to a mystic inversion, sees in the real relations only embodiments of these abstractions. These abstractions themselves are formulas which have been slumbering in the heart of God the Father since the beginning of the world.

                                                    * * *

   Monsieur Proudhon has very well grasped the fact that men produce cloth, linen, silks, and it is a great merit on his part to have grasped this small amount! What he has not grasped is that these men, according to their abilities, also produce the social relationsamid which they prepare cloth and linen. Still less has he understood that men, who produce their social relations in accordance with their material productivity, also produce ideas, categories, that is to say the abstract ideal expressions of these same social relations. Thus the categories are no more eternal than the relations they express. They are historical and transitory products. To M. Proud¬hon, on the contrary, abstractions, categories are the primordial cause. According to him they, and not men, make history. Theabstraction, the category taken as such, i.e., apart from men and their material activities, is of course immortal, unchangeable, unmoved; it is only one form of the being of pure reason; which is only another way of saying that the abstraction as such is abstract. An admirable tautology!

   Thus, regarded as categories, economic re1'ations for M. Proudhon are eternal formulas without origin or progress.

                                                    * * *

M. Proudhon is therefore necessarily doctrinaire. To him the historical movement, which is turning the present-day world upside down, reduces itself to the problem of discovering the correct equilibrium, the synthesis, of two bourgeois thoughts. And so the clever fellow by virtue of his subtlety discovers the hidden thought of God, the unity of two isolated thoughts which are only isolated because M. Proudhon has isolated them from practical life, from present-day production, which is the combination of the realities which they express. In place of the great historical movement arising from the conflict between the productive forces already acquired by men and their social relations, which no longer correspond to these productive forces; in place of the terrible wars which are being prepared between the different classes within each nation and between different nations; in place of the practical and violent action of the masses by which alone these conflicts can be resolved in place of this vast, prolonged and complicated movement, Monsieur Proudhon supplies the whimsical motion of his own head. So it is the men of learning that make history, the men who know how to purloin God's secret thoughts. The common people have only to apply their revelations. You will now understand why M. Proudhon is the declared enemy of every political movement. The solution of present problems does not lie for him in public action but in the dialectical rotations of his own head. Since to him the categories are the motive force, it is not necessary to change practical life in order to change the categories. Quite the contrary. One must change the categories and the consequence will be a change in the existing society.

   In his desire to reconcile the contradictions Monsieur Proudhon does not even ask if the very basis of those contradictions must not be overthrown. He is exactly like the political doctrinaire who wants to have the king and the chamber of deputies and the chamber of peers as integral parts of social life, as eternal categories . All he is looking for is a new formula by which to establish an equilibriumbetween these powers whose equilibrium consists precisely in the actual movement in which one power is now the conqueror and now the slave of the other. Thus in the eighteenth century a number of mediocre minds were busy finding the true formula which would bring the social estates, nobility, king, parliament, etc., into equilibrium, and they woke up one morning to find that there was in fact no longer any king, parliament or nobility. The true equilibrium in this antagonism was the overthrow of all the social relations which served as a basis for these feudal existences and for the antagonisms of these feudal existences.

   Because M. Proudhon places eternal ideas, the categories of pure reason, on the one side and h uman beings and their practical life, which, according to him is the application of these categories, on the other, one finds with him from the beginning a dualism between life and ideas, between soul and body, a dualism which recurs in many forms. You can see now that this antagonism is nothing butthe incapacity of M. Proudhon to understand the profane origin and the profane history of the categories which he deifies.

   My letter is already too long for me to speak of the absurd case which M. Proudhon puts up against communism. For the moment you will grant me that a man who has not understood the present state of society may be expected to understand still less the movement which is tending to overthrow it, and the literary expressions of this revolutionary movement.

   Thesole point on which I am in complete agreement with Monsieur Proudhon is in his dislike for sentimental socialistic day¬dreams. I had already, before him, drawn much enmity upon myself by ridiculing this sentimental, utopian, mutton-headed socialism. But is not M. Proudhon strangely deluding himself when he sets up his petty-bourgeois sentimentality-I am referring to his declamations about home, conjugal love and all such banalities-in opposition to socialist sentimentality, which in Fourier, for example goes much deeper than the pretentious platitudes of our worthy Proudhon? * * *

                                         Theses on Feuer bach

                                                KARL MARX

Marx wrote the ""Theses 'on Feuerbach"" in the spring of 1845 as he and Engels were starting their collaborative work The German Ideology. More than forty years later, Engels found them in one of the notebooks that had come into his possession after his friend died. He published them as an appendix to his essay of 1888 on Ludwig Feuerbachand the End of Classical German Philosophy, and described them in the foreword to this essay as "" the brilliant germ of the new world outlook,"" They have fascinated Marx scholars ever since, and an extensive literature of exegesis of the ""Theses"" has accumulated. The eleventh thesis, in which Marx proclaims it the task of philosophy not simply to interpret but to change the world, is one of his most frequently quoted statements.

   Before resorting to commentaries, however, the reader' should apply himself to Marx's own amplification of the ""Theses"" in Part I of The German Ideology, which follows this selection.

   Engels made a few small changes in the ""Theses"" when he published them in 1888: he added the phrase ""in Robert Owen, for example,"" in parentheses, at the end of the first paragraph of Thesis ' III; italicized ""social product"" in Thesis VII; italicized ""contemplative"" and placed quotation marks around ""civil society"" in Thesis IX, The version presented below is Marx's.

                                                          I

   The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism that of Feuerbach includedis that the thing, reality, sensuousness, is conceived only in the form of the object or of contemplation, but not as human sensuous activity, practice, not subjectively. Hence it happened that the active side, in contradistinction to materialism, was developed by idealism-but only abstractly, since, of course, idealism does not know real, sensuous activity as such. Feuerbach wants sensuous objects, really distinct from the thought objects, but he does not conceive human activity itself as objective activity. Hence, in Das Wesen des Christentums, he regards the theoretical attitude as the only genuinely human attitude, while practice is conceived and fixed only in its dirty-judaical manifestation. Hence he does not grasp the significance of ""revolutionary,"" of practicalcritical, activity.

                                                         II
   The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory but is a practical question. Man must prove the truth, that is, the reality and power, the this-sided ness of his thinking in practice. The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question.

                                                         III

   The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of other circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that it is essential to educate the educator himself. Hence, this doctrine necessarily arrives at dividing society into two parts, one of which is superior to society .

   The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionising practice.

                                                         IV

     Feuerbach starts out from the fact of religious self-alienation, of the duplication of the world into a religious, imaginary world and a real one. His work consists in resolving the religious world into its secular basis. He overlooks the fact that after completing this work, the chief thing still remains to be done. For the fact that the secular basis detaches itself from itself and establishes itself in the clouds as an independent realm can only be explained by the cleavage and self-contradictions within this secular basis. The latter must itself, therefore, first be understood in its contradiction and then, by the removal of the contradiction, revolutionised in practice. Thus, for instance, after the earthly family is discovered to be the secret of the holy family, the former must then itself be criticised in theory and revolutionised in practice.

                                                         V

 Feuerbach, not satisfied with abstract thinking, appeals to sensuous contemplation; but he does not conceive sensuousness as practical, human sensuous activity.

                                                         VI

   Feuerbach resolves the religious essence into the human essence. But the human essence is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In its reality it is the ensemble of the social relations.

   Feuerbach, who does not enter upon a criticism of this real essence, is consequently compelled:

    (1) To abstract from the historical process and to fix the religious sentiment as something by itself and to presuppose an abstract -isolated-human individual.

    (2) The human essence, therefore, can with him be comprehended only as ""genus,"" as an internal, dumb generality which merely naturally unites the many individuals.


                                                         VII

   Feuerbach, consequently, does not see that the ""religious sentiment"" is itself a social product, and that the abstract individual whom he analyses belongs in reality to a particular form of society.


                                                         VIII

 Social life is essentially practical. All mysteries which mislead theory into mysticism find their rational solution in human practice and in the comprehension of this practice.


                                                         IX

   The highest point attained by contemplative materialism, that is, materialism which does not comprehend sensuousness as practical activity, is the contemplation of single individuals in civil society.

                                                         X

The standpoint of the old materialism is ""civil"" society; the standpoint of the new is human society, or socialised humanity.

                                                         XI

The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.

                                      The German Ideology : Part I

                                                  KARL MARX

Marx and Engels wrote The German Ideology in 1845-46 in order (as Marx later recalled) ""to settle accounts with our erstwhile philosophical conscience."" He further explained: ""The manuscript, two large octavo volumes, had long reached its place of publication in Westphalia when we received the news that altered circumstances did not allow of its being printed. Vie abandoned the manuscript to the gnawing criticism of the mice, all the more willingly as we had achieved our main purpose self-clarification.""* The work was first published in 1932 by the Marx¬Engels Institute in Moscow.

   The original difficulty of publication was very probably connected with the fact that most of this very bulky work consisted of satirically written, rather arid polemics against Bruno Bauer, Max Stirner, Karl Grun, and others. But Part I (here presented in full) is a different matter. Although polemical at various points, it is basically a work of exposition. It gives every appearance of being the work for which the ""Theses on Feuerbach"" served as an outline; hence we may infer that it was written by Marx. It is, in essence, a restatement, minus much of the German philosophical terminology, of the theory of history adumbrated in the manuscripts of 1 844. Marx now calls it the materialist conception of history."" It is particularly valuable and important to the student of Marxist thought because Marx never again set down a comprehensive statement of his theory of history at such length and in such detail. This point is not contradicted by Engels' remark in the 1888 foreword that the exposihon of the materialist conception of history in The German Ideology ""proves only how incomplete our knowledge of economic history still was at that time.""

   The German Ideology has recently appeared in a re-edited version containing several previously unknown pages of the manuscript that were discovered in the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam, where the original manuscript is kept. Part I appears here in this new and fuller version as translated from the German and edited by S. Ryazanskaya, and published in English by the Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, in 1964. In preparing this new translation, the translator made use of an earlier English translation made by VI. Lough and edited by R. Pascal.

                            Feuerbach : Opposition of the Materialistic
                                              and Idealistic Outlook

      As we hear from German ideologists, Germany has in the last few years gone through an unparalleled revolution. The decomposition of the Hegelian philosophy, which began with Strauss, has developed into a universal ferment into which all the ""powers of the past"" are swept. In the general chaos mighty empires have arisen only to meet with immediate doom, heroes have emerged momentarily only to be hurled back into obscurity by bolder and stronger rivals. It was a revolution beside which the French Revolution was child's play, a world struggle beside which the struggles of the Diadochi appear insignificant. Principles ousted one another, heroes of the mind overthrew each other with unheard-of rapidity, and in the three years 1842-45 more of the past was swept away in Germany than at other times inthree centuries.

     All this is supposed to have taken place in the realm of pure thought.

     Certainly it is an interesting event we are dealing with: the putrescepc.e of the absolute spirit. When the last spark of its life had failed, the various components of this caput mortuum1 began to decompose, entered into new combinations and formed new substances. The industrialists of philosophy, who till then had lived on the exploitation of the absolute spirit, now seized upon the new combinations. Each with all possible zeal set about retailing h is apportioned share. This naturally gave rise to competition, which, to start with, was carried on in moderately staid bourgeois fashion. Later when the German market was glutted, and the commodity in spite of all efforts found no response in the world market, the business was spoiled in the usual German manner by fabricated and fictitious production, deterioration in quality, adulteration of the raw materials, falsification of labels, fictitious purchases, bill-jobbing and a credit system devoid of any real basis. The competition turned into a bitter struggle, which is now being extolled and interpreted to us as a revolution of world significance, the begetter of the most prodigious results and achievements.

   If we wish to rate at its true value this philosophic charlatanry, which awakens even in the breast of the honest German citizen a glow of national pride, if we wish to bring out clearly the pettiness, the parochial narrowness of this whole Young-Hegelian movementand in particular the tragicomic contrast between the illusions of these heroes about their achievements and the actual achievements themselves, we must look at the whole spectacle from a standpoint beyond the frontiers of Germany.

                       A. IDEOLOGY IN GENERAL, GERMAN IDEOLOGY
                                                 IN PARTICULAR

     German criticism has, right up to its latest efforts, never quitted the realm of philosophy. Far from examining its general philosophic premises, the whole body of its inquiries has actually sprung from the soil of a definite philosophical system, that of Hegel. Not only in their answers but in their very questions there was a mystification. This dependence on Hegel is the reason why not one of these modern critics has even attempted a comprehensive criticism of the Hegelian system, however much each professes to have advanced beyond Hegel. Their polemics against Hegel and against one another are confined to this-each extracts one side of the Hegelian system and turns this against the whole system as well as against the sides extracted by the others. To begin with they extracted pure unfalsified Hegelian categories such as ""substance"" and ""self-consciousness,"" later they desecrated these categories with more secular names such as ""species,"" ""the Unique,"" ""Man,"" etc.

     The entire body of German philosophical criticism from Strauss to Stirner is confined to criticism of religious conceptions. The critics started from real religion and actual theology. What religious consciousness and a religious conception really meant was determined variously as they went along. Their advance consisted in subsuming the allegedly dominant metaphysical, political, juridical, moral and other conceptions under the class of religious or theological, conceptions; and similarly in pronouncing political, juridical, moral consciousness as religious or theological, and the political, juridical, moral man-""man"" in the last resort as religious. The dominance of religion was taken for granted. Gradually every dominant relationship was pronounced a religious relationship and transformed into a cult, a cult of law, a cult of the State, etc. On all sides it was only a question of dogmas and belief in dogmas. The world was sanctified to an ever• increasing extent till at last our venerable Saint Max was able to canonise it en bloc and thus dispose of it once for all.

     The Old Hegelians had comprehended everything as soon as it was reduced to an Hegelian logical category. The Young Hegelians criticized everything by attributing to it religious conceptions or by pronouncing it a theological matter. The Young Hegelians are in agreement with the Old Hegelians in their belief in the rule of religion, of concepts, of a universal principle in the existing world. Only, the one party attacks this dominion as usurpation, while the other extols it as legitimate.

   Since the Young Hegelians consider conceptions, thoughts, ideas, in fact all the products of consciousness, to which they attribute an independent existence, as the real chains of men (just as the Old Hegelians declared them the true bonds of human society) it is evident that the Young Hegelians have to fight only against these illusions of the consciousness. Since, according to their fantasy, the relationships of men, all their doings, their chains and their limitations are products of their consciousness, the Young Hegelians logically put to men the moral postulate of exchanging their present consciousness for human, critical or egoistic consciousness, and thus of removing their limitations. This demand to change consciousness amounts to a demand to interpret reality in another way, i.e., to recognise it by means of another interpretation. The Young Hegelian ideologists, in spite of their allegedly ""world-shattering"" statements, are the staunchest conservatives. The most recent of them have found the correct expression for their activity when they declare they are only fighting against ""phrases."" They forget, however, that to these phrases they themselves are only opposing other phrases, and that they are in no way combating the real existing world when they are merely combating the phrases of this world. The only results which this philosophic criticism could achieve were a few ( and at that thoroughly one-sided) elucidations of Christianity from the point of view of religious history; all the rest of their assertions are only further embellishments of their claim to have furnished, in these unimportant elucidations, discoveries of universal importance.

   It has not occurred to any one of these philosophers to inquire into the connection of German philosophy with German reality, the relation of their criticism to their ownmaterial surroundings.

   The premises from which we begin are not arbitrary ones, notdogmas, but real premises from which abstraction can only be made in the imagination. They are the realindividuals, their activity and the material conditions under which they live, both thosewhich they find already existing and those produced by their active-ity. These premises can thus be verified in a purely empirical way.

   The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established isthe physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature. Of course, we cannot here go either into the actual physical nature of man, or into the natural conditions in which man finds himself geological, orohydrographical,climatic and so on. The writing of history must always set out from these natural bases and their modification in the course of history through the action of men.

   Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion or anything else you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical organization. By producing their means of subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material life.

   The way in which men produce their means of subsistence depends first of all on the nature of the actual means of subsistence they find in existence and have to reproduce. This mode of production must not be considered simply as being the reproduction of the physical existence of the individuals. Rather it is a definite form of activity of these individuals, a definite form of expressing their life, a definite mode of life on their part. As individuals express their life, so they are. What they are, therefore, coincides with their production, both with what they produce and with howthey produce. The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production.

   This production only makes its appearance with  the increase of population. In its turn this presupposes the intercourse [Verkehr]of individuals with one another. The form of this intercourse is again determined by production.

   The relations ofdifferent nations among themselves depend upon the extent to which each has developed its productive forces, the division of labour and internal intercourse. This statement is generally recognised. But not onlythe relation of one nation to others, but also the whole internal structure of the nation itself depends on the stage of development reached by its production and its internal and external intercourse. How far the productive forces of a nation are developed is shown most manifestly by the degree to which the division of labour has been carried. Each new productice force, insofar as it is not merely a quantitive extension of productive forces already known ( for instance the bringing into cultivation of fresh land ), causes a further development of the divisionof labour.

   The division of labour inside a nation leads at first to the separation of industrial and commercial fromagricultural labour, and hence to the separationof town and country and to  the conflict of their interests. Its further development leads to the separation ofcommercial from industrial labour. At the same time through the division of labour inside these various branches there develop various divisions among the individuals co-operating in definite kinds of labour. The relative position of these individual groups is determined by the methods employed in agriculture, industry and commerce ( patriarchalism, slavery, estates, classes ). These same conditions are to be seen (given a more developed intercourse) in the relations of different nations to one another.

   The various stages of development in the division of labour are just so many different forms of ownership, i.e., the existing stage in the division of labour determines also the relations of individuals to one another with reference to the material, instrument, and product of labour.

   The first form of ownership is tribal [Stammeigentum] ownership. It corresponds to the undeveloped stage of  production, at which a people lives by hunting and fishing, by the rearing of beasts or, in the highest stage, agriculture. In the latter case it pre-supposes a great mass of uncultivated stretches of land. The division of labour is at this stage still very elementary and is confined to a further extension of the natural division of labour existing in the family. The social structure is, therefore, limited to an extension of the family; patriarchal family chieftains, below them the members of the tribe; finally slaves. The slavery latent in the family only develops gradually with the increase of population, the growth of wants, and with the extension of external relations, both of war and of barter.

   The second form is the ancient communal and State ownership which  proceeds especially from the union of several tribes into a city by agreement or by conquest, and which is still accompanied by slavery. Beside communal ownership we already find movable,and later also immovable, private property developing, but as an abnormal form subordinate to communal ownership. The citizens hold power over their labouring slaves only in their community, and on this account alone, therefore, they are bound to the form of communal ownership. It is the communal private property which compels the active citizens to remain in this spontaneously derived form of association over against their slaves. For this reason the whole structure of society based on this communal ownership, and with it the power of the people, decays in the same measure as; in particular, immovable private property evolves. The division of labour is already more developed. We already find the antagonismof town and country; later the antagonism between those states which represent town interests and those which represent country interests, and inside the towns themselves the antagonism between industry and maritime commerce. The class relation between citizens and slaves is now completely developed.

   This whole interpretation of history appears to be contradicted by the fact of conquest. Up till now violence, war, pillage, murder and robbery, etc., have been accepted as the driving force of history. Here we must limit ourselves to the chief points and take, therefore, only the most striking example--:the destruction of an old civilisation by a barbarous people and the resulting formation of an entirely new organisation of society. ( Rome and the barbarians; feudalism and Gaul; the Byzantine Empire and the Turks.) With the conquering barbarian people war itself is still, as indicated above, a regular form of intercourse; which is the more eagerly exploited as the increase in population together with the traditional and, for it, the only possible, crude mode of production gives rise to the need for new means of production. In Italy, on the other hand, the concentration of landed property (caused not only by buying-up and indebtedness but also by inheritance, since loose living being rife and marriage rare, the old families gradually died out and their possessions fell into the hands of a few) and its conversion into grazing land (caused not only by the usual economic forces still operative today but by the importation of plundered and tribute corn and the resultant lack of demand for Italian corn) brought about the almost total disappearance of the free population. The very slaves died out again and again, and had constantly to be replaced by new ones. Slavery remained the basis of the whole productive system. The plebeians, midway between freemen and slaves, never succeeded in becoming more than a proletarian rabble. Rome indeed never became more than a city; its connection with the provinces was almost exclusively political and could, therefore, easily be broken again by political events.

   With the development of private property, we find here for the first time the same conditions which we shall find again, only on a more extensive scale, with modern private property. On the one hand, the concentration of private property, which began very early in Rome ( as the Licinian agrarian law proves ) and proceeded very rapidly 'from the time of the civil wars and especially under the Emperors; on the other hand, coupled with this, the transformation of the plebejan small peasantry into a proletariat, which, however, owing To its intermediate position between propertied citizens and slaves, never achieved an independent development.

   The third form of ownership is feudal or estate property. If antiquity started out from the town and its little territory, the Middle Ages started out from the country. This different starting point was determined by the sparseness of the population at that time, which was scattered over a large area and which received no large increase from the conquerors. In contrast to Greece and Rome, feudal development at the outset, therefore, extends over a much wider territory, prepared by the Roman conquests and the spread of agriculture at first associated with them. The last centuries of the declining Roman Empire and its conquest by the bar barbar-ians destroyed a number of productive forces; agriculture had declined, industry had decayed for want of a market, trade had died out or been violently suspended, the rural and urban population had decreased. From these conditions and the mode of organisation of the conquest determined by them, feudal property developed under the infiluence of the Germanic military constitution. Like tribal and communal ownership, it is based again on a community; but the directlyproducing class standing over against it is not, as in the case of the ancient community, the slaves, but theenserfed small peasantry. As soon as feudalism is fully developed, there also arises antagonism to the towns. The hierarchical structure oflandownership, and the armed bodies of retainers associated with it, gave the nobility power over the serfs. This feudal organisation was, just as much as the ancient communal ownership, an association against a subjected producing class; but the form of associtation and the relation to the direct producers were differentbecause of the different conditions of production. This feudal system of landownership had its counterpart in thetowns in the shape of corporative property, the feudal organisationof trades.Here property consisted chIefly in the Ia hour of each •individual person. The necessity for association against the organised robber nobility, the need for communal covered markets in an age when the industrialist was at the same time a merchant, the growing competition of the escaped serfs swarming into the rising towns, the feudal structure of the whole country: these combined to bring about the  guilds. The gradually accumulated small capital of individual craftsmen and their stable numbers, as against the growing population, evolved the relation of journeyman and apprentice, which brought into being in the towns a hierarchy similar to that in the country.

   Thus the chief form of  property during the feudal epoch consisted on the one hand of landed property with serf labour chainedto it, and on the other of the labour of the individual with small capital commanding the labour of journeymen. The organization ofboth was determined by the restricted conditions of production the small-scale and primitive cultivation of the land, alld-Ihe craft type of industry. There was little division of labour in the heyday of feudalism. Each country bore in itself the antithesis of town and country; the division into estates was certainly strongly marked; but apart from the differentiation of princes, nobility, clergy and peasants in the country, and masters, journeymen, apprentices and soon also the rabble of casual labourers in the towns, no division of importance took place. In agriculture it was rendered difficult by the strip-system, beside which the cottage industry of the peasants themselves emerged. In industry there wasno division of labour at all in the individual trades themselves, and very little between them. The separation of industry and commerce was found already in existence in older towns; in the newer it only developed later, when the towns entered into mutual relations.

   The grouping of larger territories into feudal kingdoms was a necessity for the landed nobility as for the towns. The organisation of the ruling class, the nobility, had, therefore, everywhere a monarch at its head.

   The fact is, therefore, that definite individuals who are productively active in a definite way enter into these definite social and political relations. Empirical observation must in each separate instance bring out empirically, and without any mystification and speculation, the connection of the social and political structure with production. The social structure and the State are continually evolving out of the life process of definite individuals, but of individuals, not as they may appear in their own or other people's imagination, but as they really are; i.e., as they operate, produce materially, and hence as they work under definite material limits, presuppositions and conditions independent of their will.

   The production of ideas, of conceptions, of consciousness, is at first directly interwoven with the material activity and the material intercourse of men, the language of real life. Conceiving, thinking, the mental intercourse of men, appear at this stage as the direct efflux of their material behaviour. The same applies to mental production as expressed in the language of politics, laws, morality, religion, metaphysics, etc., of a people. Men are the producers of their conceptions, ideas:Is, etc-real, active men, as they are conditioned by a definite deve1opment of their productlve forces  and of the intercourse corresponding to these, up to its furthest forms. Consciousness can never be anything else than conscious existence andthe existence of men is their actual life-process. If in all ideology men and their circumstances appear upside-down as in a camera obscura, this phenomenon arises just as much from their historical life-process as the inversion of objects on the retina does from their physical life-process.

   In direct contrast to German philosophy which descends from Hayen to earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, we do not set out from .what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and on the basis of their real life-process we demonstrate the develop¬ment of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life-process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life-process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness,thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life. In the first method of approach the starting point is consciousness taken as the living individual; in the second method, which conforms to real life, it is the real living individuals themselves, and consciousness is considered solely as their consciousness.

   This method of approach is not devoid of premises. It starts out from the real premises and does not abandon them for a moment. Its premises are men, not in any fantastic isolation and rigidity, but in their actual, empirically perceptible process of development under definite conditions. As soon as this active life-process is described, history ceases to be a collection of dead facts as it is with the empiricists ( themselves still abstract), or an imagined activity of imagined subject, as with the idealists.

   Where speculation ends-in real life-there real, positive science begins : the representation of the practical activity, of the practical, process of development of men. Empty talk about consciousness ceases, and real knowledge has to take its place. When reality is depicted, philosophy as an independent branch of knowledge loses its medium of existence. At the best its place can only be taken by summing up of the most general results, abstractions which arise from the observation of the historical development of men. Viewed apart from real history, these' abstractions have in themselves no value whatsoever. They can only serve to facilitate the arrangement of historical material, to indicate the sequence of its separate strata.But they by no means afford a recipe or schema, as does philosophy, for neatly trimming the epoch of history. On the contrary,our difficulties begin only when we set about the observation and the arrangement the real depiction of our historical material,whether of a past epoch or of the present. The removal of these difficulties is governed by premises which it is quite impossible to state here, but which only the study of the actual life-process arid the activity of the individuals of each epoch will make evident. We shall select here some of these abstractions, which we use in contradistioncion to the ideologists, and shall iilustrate them by historical examples.

                                                1. History

   Since we are dealing with the Germans, who are devoid of premises, we must begin by stating the first premise of all human existence and, therefore, of all history, the premise, namely, that men,must be in a position to live in order to be able to ""makehistory.’’2 But life involves before everything else eating and drinking, a habitation, clothing and many other things. Tne first historical act is thus the production of the means to satisfy these needs, the production of material life itself. And indeed this is an histori¬cal act, a fundamental condition of all history, which today, as thousands of years ago, must daily and hourly be fulfilled merely in order to sustain human life. Even when the sensuous world is reduced to a minimum, to a stick as with Saint Bruno, it presup¬poses the action of producing the stick. Therefore in any interpretation of history one has first of all to observe this fundamental fact in all its significance and all its implications and to accord it its due importance. It is well known that the Germans have never done this, and they have never, therefore, had an earthly basis for history and consequently never a historian.The French and the English, even if they have conceived the relation of this fact with so-calledhistory only in an extremely one-sided fashion, particularly as long as they remained in the toils of political ideology, have nevertheless made the first attempts to give the writing of history a materialistic basis by being the first to write histories of civil society, of commerce and industry.

   The second point is that the satisfaction of the first need ( theaction of satisfying, and the instrument of satisfaction which has been acquired) leads to new needs; and this production of newneeds is the first historical act. Here we recognise immediately the spiritual ancestry of the great historical wisdom of the Germans who, when they run out of positive material and when they can serve up neither theological nor political nor literary rubbish, assert that this is not history at all, but the ""prehistoric era."" They do not, however, enlighten us as to how we proceed from this nonsensical ""prehistory"" to history proper; although, on the other hand, in their historical speculation they seize upon this ""prehistory"" with especial eagerness because they imagine themselves safe there from interference on the part of ""crude facts,"" and, at the same time, because there they can give full rein to their speculative impulse and set up and knock down hypotheses by the thousand.The third circumstance which, from the very outset, enters into historical development, is that men, who daily remake their own life, begin to make other men, to propagate their kind: the relation between man and woman, parents and children, the family. The family, which to begin with is the .only social relationship, becomes later, when increased needs create new social relatIons and the increased population new needs, a subordinate one ( except in Germany), and must then be  treated and analysed according to the existing empirical data, not according to ""the concept of the family,"" as is the custom in Germany.3 These three aspects of social activity are not of course to be taken as three different stages, but just as three aspects or, to make it clear to the Germans, three ""moments,"" which have existed simultaneously since the dan ofhistory and the first men, and which still assert themselves in history today.

   The production of life, both of one's own in labour and of fresh  life in procreation, now appears as a double relationship: on the one hand as a natural, on the other as a social relationship. By social we understand the co-operation of several individuals, no matter under what conditions, in what manner and to what end. It follows from this that a certain mode, of production, or industrial stage, is always combined with a certain mode of co-operation, or social stage, and this mode of co-operation ' is itself a ""productive force."" Further, that the multitude of productive forces accessible to men determines the nature of society, hence, that the ‘’history humanity’’ must always be studied and treated in relation to thehistory of industry and exchange. But it is also clear how in Germany it is impossible to write this sort of history, because the Germans lack not only the necessary power of comprehension and the material but also the ""evidence of their senses,"" for across the Rhine you cannot have any experience of these things since history has stopped happening. Thus it is quite obvious from the start that there exists a materialistic connection of men with one another, which is determined by their needs and their mode of production, and which is as old as men themselves. This connection is evertaking on new forms, and thus presents a ‘’history’’ independentlyof the existence of any political or religious nonsense which would especially hold men together.

   Only now, after having considered four moments, four aspects ofthe primary historical relationships, do we find that man also possesses “consciousness”;4 but, even so, not inherent, not ""pure"" consciousness. From the start the ""spirit"" is afflicted with the curse of being ""burdened"" with matter, which here makes its appearance in the form of agitated layers of air, sounds, in short, of language. Language is as old as consciousness, language is practical conscious¬ness that exists also for other men, and for that reason alone it really exists for me personally as well; language, like consciousness, only arises from the need, the necessity, of intercourse with other men. Where there exists a relationship, it exists for me : the animal does not enter into ""relations"" with anything, it does not enter into any relation at all. For the animal, its relation to others does not exist as a relation. Consciousness is, therefore, from the very beginning a social product, and remains so as long as men exist at all. Consiousness is at first, of course, merely consciousness concerning the immediate sensous environment and consciousness of the limited connection with other persons and things outside the individual who"" is growing self-conscious. At the same time it is consciousness of nature, which first appears to men as a completely alien, all-powerful and unassailable force, with which men's relations are purely animal and by which they are overawed like beasts; it is thus a purely animal consciousnessof nature (natural religion).

   We see here immediately: this natural religion or this particular relation of men to nature is determined by the form of society and vice versa. Here, as everywhere, the identity of nature and man appears in such a way that the restricted relation of men to nature determines their restricted relation to one another, and their restricted relation to one another determines men's restricted relation to nature, just because nature is as yet hardly modified historically; and, on the other hand, man's consciousness of the necessity of associating with the individuals around him is the beginning of he consciousness that he is living in society at all. This beginning is as animal as social life itself at this stage. It is mere herd-consciousness, and at this point man is only distinguished from sheep by the fact that with him consciousness takes the place of instinct or that his instinct is a conscious one. This sheep-like or tribal consciousness receives its further development and extension through increasedprodyctivity, the increase of needs, and, what isfundamental to both of these, the increase of population. With these there develops the division of labour, which was originally nothing but the division of labour in the sexual act, then that division of labour which develops spontaneously or ""naturally"" by virtue of natural predisposition (e.g., physical strength), needs, accidents, etc., etc. Division of labour only becomes truly such from the moment when a division of material and mental labour appears.5 Fromt this moment onwards consciousness can really Ratler""Itself that it is something other than consciousness of existing practice, that it really represents something without represent- ing something real; from now on consciousness is in a position to emancipate itself from the world and to proceed to the formation of ""pure"" theory, theology, philosophy, ethics, etc. But even if this theory, theology, philosophy, ethics, etc., comes into contrawith the existing relations, this c    only occur because existing social relations have come into contradiction with existing forces of production; this, moreover, can also occur in a particular national sphere of'relations through the appearance of the contradiction, not within the national orbit, but between this national consciousness and the practice of other nations,6 i.e., between the national and the general consciousness of a nation (as we see it now in Germany).

   Moreover, it is quite immaterial what consciousness starts to do on its own: out of all such muck we get only the one inference that these threeoments, the forces of production, the state of society, and consciousness, can and must come into contradicfion with one another, because the division of labour implies the possibility,naythe fact that intellectual and material activity-enjoyment and labour, production and consumption devolve on different individuals, and that the only possibility of their not coming into contradiction lies in the negation in its turn of the division of labour. It is self-evident, moreover, that ""spectres,"" ""bonds,"" ""the higherbeing,"" ""concept,"" ""scruple,"" are merely the idealistic, spiritual expression, the conception apparently of the isolated individual, the image of very empirical fetters and limitations, within which the mode of production of life and the form of intercourse coupled with it move.

   With the division of labour, in which all these contradictions are implicit, and which in its turn is based on the natural division of labour in the family and the separation of society into individual. families opposed to one another, is given simultaneously thedistri-bution, and indeed the unequal distribution, both quantitive and qualitative, of labour and its products, hence property: the nucleus, the first form, of which lies in the family, where wife and children are the slaves of the husband. This latent slavely in the family, though still very crude, is the first property, but even at this early stage it corresponds perfectly to the definition of modern economists who call it the power of disposing of the labour-power of others. Division of labour and private property are, moreover, identical expressions: in the one the same thing is affirmed with reference to activity as is affirmed in the other with reference to the product of the activity.

   Further, the division of labour implies the contradiction between the interest of the separate individual or the individual family and the communal interest of all individuals who have intercourse with one another. And indeed, this communal interest does not exist merely in the imagination, as the ""general interest,"" but first of all in reality, as the mutual interdependence of the individuals among whom the labour is divided. And finally, the division of labour offers us the first example of how, as long as man remains in natural society, that is, as long as a cleavage exists between the particu¬voluntarily, but naturally, divided, man’s own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him. For as soon as the distribution of labour comes into being each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a shepherd, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, shepherd or critic. This fixation of social activity, this consolidation of what we ourselves produce intoan objective power above us, growing out of control, thwarting our expectations, bringing to naught our calculations, is one of the chief factors in historical development up till now.

   And out of this very contradiction between the interest of the individual and that of the community the latter takes an independent form as theState, divorced from the real interests of individual and community, and at the same time as an illusory communal life, always based, however, on the real ties existing in every family and tribal conglomeration-such as flesh and blood, language, division of labour on a larger scale, and other interests and especial1y, as we shall enlarge upon later, on the classes, already determined by the division of labour, which in every such mass of men separate out, and of which one dominates all the others. It follows from this that all struggles within the State, the struggle between democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy, the struggle for the franchise, etc., etc.,are merely the illusory forms in which the real struggles of the different classes are fought out among one another (of this the German theoreticians have nof the fainest inkling, although they have received a sufficient introduction to the subject in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher and Die heilige Familie). Further, it follows that every class which is struggling for mastery, even when its domination, as is the case with the proletariat, postulates the abolition of the old form of society in its entirety and of domination itself, must first conquer for itself political power in order to represent its interest in turn as the general interest, which in the first moment it is forced to do. Just because individuals seek only their particular interest, which for them does not coincide with their communal interest (in fact the general is the illusory form of communal life), the latter will be imposed on them as an interest ""alien"" to them, and ""independent"" of them, as in its turn a particular, peculiar ""general"" interest; or they themselves must remain within this discord, as in democracy. On the other hand, too, the practicalstruggle of these particular interests, which constantly really run counter to the communal and illusory communal interests, makes practical intervention and control necessary through the illusory ‘’general’’ interest in the form of the State, The social power, i.e., the multiplied productive force, which arises through the the co-operation of different  individuals as it is determined by the division of labour, appears to these individuals, since their co-operation is not voluntary but has come about naturally, not as their own united power, but as an alien forceexisting outside them, of the origin and goal of which they are ignorant, which they thus cannot control, which on the contrary passes through a peculiar series of phases and stages independent of the will and the action of man, nay even being the prime governor of these.

   This’’estrangement’’ (to use a term which will be comprehensible to the philosophers) can, of course, only be abolished given two
practical premises. For it to become an ""intolerable"" power, i.e., a power against which men make a revolution, it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity ""propertyless,"" and produced, at the same time, the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture, both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power, a high degree of its development. And, on the other hand, this development of productive forces (which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their world-historical, instead of local, being) is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general, and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced; and furthermore, because only with this universal development of productive forces isa universal intercourse between men established, which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the ""propertyless"" mass (universal competition), makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others, and finally has put world-historical,  empirically universal individuals in place of local ones. Without this, ( 1)communism could only exist as a local event; (2) the forces of intercourse themselves could not have developed as universal, hence intolerable powers: they would have remained home-bred conditions surrounded by superstition; and (3) each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism. Empirically, communism is only possible as the act of the dominant peoples ""all at once"" and simultaneously, which presupposes the universaldevelopment of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism. How otherwise ccould for instance property have had a history at all, have taken on different forms, and landed property, for example, according to the different premises given, have proceeded in France from parcellation to centralisation in the hands of a few, in England from centralisation in the hands of a few to parcellation, as is actually the case today? Or how does it happen that trade, which after all is nothing more than the exchange of products of various individuals and countries, rules the whole world through the relation of supply and demand-a relation which, as an English economist says, hovers over the earth like the fate of the ancients, and with invisible hand allots fortune and misfortune to men, sets up empires and overthrows empires, causes nations to rise and to disappear while with the abolition of the basis of private property, with the communistic regulation of production (and, implicit in this, the destruction of the alien relation between men and what they themselves produce), the power of the relation of supply and demand is dissolved into nothing, and men get exchange, production, the mode of their mutual relation, under their own control again?
   Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to b established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself.We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence. Moreover, the mass of propertylessworkers-the utterly precarious position of labour-power on a mass scale cut off from capital or from even a limited satisfaction and, therefore, no longer merely temporarily deprived of work itself as a secure source of life-presupposes the world market through competition. The proletariat can thus only exist world-historically, just as communism, its activity, can only have a ""world-historical"" existence. World-historical existence of individuals, i.e., existenceof individuals which is directly linked up with world history.

   The form of intercourse determined by the existing productive forces af all previous historical stages, and in its turn determingthese, is civil society. The latter, as is clear from what we have said above, has as its premises and basis the simple family and the multiple, the so-called tribe, and the more precise determinants of this society are enumerated in our remarks above. Already here we see how this civil society is the true source and theatre of all history, and how absurd is the conception of history held hitherto, which neglects the real relationships and confines itself to high-sounding dramas of princes and states.

   Civil society embraces the whole material intercourse of individuals within a definite stage of the development of productive forces.It embraces the whole commercial and industrial life of a given stage and, insofar, transcends the State and the nation, though on the other hand again, it must assert itself in its foreign relations as nationality, and inwardly must organise itseld as State. The term ‘’civil society’’ [burgerliche Gesellschaft]7 emerged in the eighteenth century, when property relationships had already extricated themselves from the ancient and medieval communal society. Civil society as such only develops with the bourgeoisie; the social organisation evolving directly out of production and commerce, which in all ages forms the basis of the State and of the rest of the idealistic superstructure, has, however, always been designated by the same name.

                           2. Concerning the Production of Consciousness

   In history up to the present it is certainly an empirical fact that separate individuals have, with the broadening of their activity into world historical activity, become more and more enslaved under a power alien to them (a pressure which they have conceived of as a dirty trick on the part of the so-called universal spirit, etc.), a power which has become more and more enormous and, in the last instance, turns out to be the world market. But it is just as empirically established that, by the overthrow of the existing state of society by the communist revolution (of which more below) and the abolition of private property which is identical with it, this power, which so baffles the German theoreticians, will be dissolved; and that then the liberation of each single individual will be accomplished in the measure in which history becomes transformed into world history. From the above it is clear that the real intellectual wealth of the individual depends entirely on the wealth of his real connections. Only then will the separate individuals be liberated from the various national and local barriers, be brought into practical connection with the material and intellectual production of the whole world and be put in a position to acquire the capacity to enjoy this all-sided production of the whole earth (the creations of man). All-round dependence, this natural form of the world¬historical co-operation of individuals, will be transformed by this communist revolution into the control and conscious mastery of these powers, which, born of the action of men on one another, have till now overawed and governed men as powers completely alien to them. Now this view can be expressed again in speculative-idealistic, i.e., fantastic, terms as ""self-generation of the species"" (""society as the subject""), and thereby the consecutive series of interrelated individuals connected with each other can be conceived as a single individual, which accomplishes the mystery of generating itself, It is clear here that individuals certainly make one another, physically and mentally, but do not make themselves either in the nonsense of Saint Bruno, or in the sense of the ""Unique,"" of the ""made"" man.

   This conception of history depends on our ability to .expound the real process of production, starting out from the material production of life itself, and to comprehend the form of intercourse connected with this and created by this mode of production (i.e., civil society in its various stages), as the basis of all history; and to show it in its action as State, to explain all the different theoretical products and forms of consciousness, religion, philosophy, ethics, etc., etc., and trace their origins and growth from that basis; by which means, of course, the whole thing can be depicted in its totality (and therefore, too, the reciprocal action of these various sides on one another). It has not, like the idealistic view of  history, in every period to look for a category, but remains constantly on the real ground of history; it does not explain practice from the idea but explains the formation of ideas from material practice; and accordingly it comes to the conclusion that all forms and products of consciousness cannot be dissolved by mental criticism, by resolution into ""self-consciousness"" or transformation into ""apparitions,"" ""spectres,"" ""fancies,"" etc., but only by the practical overthrow of the actual social relations which gave rise to this idealistic humbug; that not criticism but revolution is the driving force of history, also of religion, of philosophy and all other types of theory. It shows that history does not end by being resolved into ""self¬consciousness"" as ""spirit of the spirit,"" but that in it at each stage there is found a material result: a sum of productive forces, a historically created relation of individuals to nature and to one another, which is handed down to each generation from its predecessor; a mass of productive forces, capital funds and conditions, which, on the one hand, is indeed modified by the new generation,but also on the other prescribes for it its conditions of life and gives it a definite development, a special character. It shows that circumstances make men just as m uch as men make circumstances. This sum of productive forces, capital funds and social forms of intercourse, which every individual and generation finds in existence as something given, is the real basis of what the philosophers have conceived as ""substance"" and ""essence of man,"" and what they have deified and attacked: a real basis which is not in the least disturbed, in its effect and influence on the development of men, by the fact that these philosophers revolt against it as ""self¬consciousness"" and the ""Unique."" These conditions of life, which different generations find in existence, decide also whether or not the periodically recurring revolutionary convulsion will be strong enough to overthrow the basis of the entire existing system. And if these material elements of a complete revolution are not present
( namely, on the one hand the existing productive forces, on the other the formation of a revolutionary mass, which revolts not only against separate conditions of society up till then, but against the very ""production of life"" till then, the ""total activity"" on which it was based), then, as far as practical development is concerned, it is absolutely immaterial whether the idea of this revolution has been expressed a hundred times already, as the history of communism proves.

   In the whole conception of history up to the present this real basis of history has either been totally neglected or else considered as a minor matter quite irrelevant to the course of history. History must, therefore, always be written according to an extraneous standard; the real production of life seems to be primeval history, while the truly historical appears to be separated from ordinary life, something extra-superterrestrial. With this the relation of man to nature is excluded from history and hence the antithesis of nature and history is created. The exponents of this conception of history have consequently only been able to see in history the political actions of princes and States, religious and all sorts of theoretical struggles, and in particular in each historical epoch have had to share the illusion of that epoch. For instance, if an epoch imagines itself to be actuated by purely ""political"" or ""religious"" motives, although ""religion"" and ""politics"" are only forms of its true motives, the historian accepts this opinion. The ""idea,"" the ""conception"" of the people in question about their real practice, is transformed into the sole determining, active force, which controls and determines their practice. When the crude form in which the division of labour appears with the Indians and Egyptians calls forth the caste-system in their State and religion, the historian believes that the caste-system is the power which has produced this crude social form . While the French and the English at least hold by the political illusion, which is moderately close to reality, the Germans move in the realm of the ""pure spirit,"" and make religious illusion the driving force of history. The Hegelian philosophy of history is the last consequence, reduced to its ""finest expression,"" of all this German historiography, for which it is not a question of real, nor even of political, interests, but of pure thoughts, which consequently must appear to Saint Bruno, as a series of ""thoughts"" that devour one another and are finally swallowed up in ""self¬consciousness"";8 and even more consistently the course of history appears to the Blessed Max Stirner, who knows not a thing about real history, as a mere tale of ""knights,"" robbers and ghosts, from whose visions he can, of course, only save himself by ""unholiness."" This conception is truly religious: it postulates religious man as the primitive man, the starting point of history; and in its imagination puts the religious production of fancies in the place of the real production of the means of subsistence and of life itself. This whole conception of history, together with its dissolution and the scruples and qualms resulting from it, is a purely national affair of the Germans and has only local interest for the Germans, as for instance the important question treated several times of late: how really we ""pass from the realm of God to the realm of Man"" -as if this ""realm of God"" had ever existed anywhere save in the imagination, and the learned gentlemen, without being aware of it, were not constantly living in the ""realm of Man"" to which they are now seeking the way; and as if the learned pastime ( for it is nothing more) of explaining the mystery of this theoretical bubble-blowing did not on the contrary lie in demonstrating its origin in actual earthly conditions. Always, for these Germans, it is simply a matter of resolving the nonsense of earlier writers into some other freak, i.e., of presupposing that all this nonsense has a special sense which can be discovered; while really it is only a question of explaining this theoretical talk from the actual existing conditions. The real, practical dissolution of these phrases, the removal of these notions from the consciousness of men, will, as we have already said, be effected by altered circumstances, not by theoretical deductions. For the mass of men, i.e., the proletariat, these theoretical notions do not exist and hence do not require to be dissolved, and if this mass ever had any theoretical notions, e .g., religion, etc., these have now long been dissolved by circumstances.

   The purely national character of these questions and solutions is shown again in the way these theorists believe in all seriousness that chimeras like ""the God-Man,"" ""Man,"" etc., have presided overindividual epochs of history (Saint Bruno even goes so far as to assert that ""only criticism and critics have made history"") and when they themselves construct historical systems, they skip over all earlier periods in the greatest haste and pass immediately from ""Mongolism"" to history ""with meaningful content,"" that is to say, to the history of the Hallische and Deutsche Jahrbucher and the dis¬solution of the Hegelian school into a general squabble. They forget all other nations, all real events, and the theatrum mundi is confined to the Leipzig Book Fair and the mutual quarrels of ""Criticism,"" ""Man,"" and ""the Unique."" If these theorists treat really historical subjects, as for instance the eighteenth centrry, they merely give a history of the i deas of the times, torn away from the facts and the practical development fundamental to them; and even that merely in order to represent that period as an imperfect preliminary stage, the as yet limited predecessor of the real historical age, i.e., the period of the German philosophic struggle from 1840 to 1844. As might be expected when the history of an earlier period is written with the aim of accentuating the brilliance of anun historic person and his fantasies, all the really historic events, even the really historic invasion of politics into history, receive no mention. Instead we get a narrative based not on research but on arbitrary constructions and literary gossip, such as Saint Bruno provided in his now forgotten history of the eighteenth century. These high-falutin and haughty hucksters of ideas, who imagine themselves infinitely exalted above all national prejudices, are thus in practice far more national than the beer-quaffing philistines who dream of a united Germany. They do not recognise the deeds of other nations as historical: they live in Germany, to Germany, and for Germany; they turn the Rhine-song into a religious hymn and conquer Alsace and Lorraine by robbing French philosophy instead of the French State, by Germanising French ideas instead of French provinces. Herr Venedey is a cosmopolitan compared with the Saints B runo and Max, who, in the universal dominance of theory, proclaim the universal dominance of Germany.

   It is also clear from these arguments how grossly Feuerbach is deceiving himself when (Wigand's Vierteljahrsschrift, 1845, Volume 2) by virtue of the qualification ""common man"" he declares himself a communist, transforms the latter into a predicate of ""man,"" and thereby thinks it possible to change the word ""communist,"" which in the real world means the follower of a definite revolutionary party, into a mere category. Feuerbach's whole deduction with regard to the relation of men to one another goes only so far as to prove that men need and alwayshave needed each other. He wants to est a blish consciousness of this fact, that is to say, like the other theorists, merely to produce a correct consciousness aboutan existing fact; whereas for the real communist it is a question of overthrowing the existing state of things. We thoroughly appreciate, moreover, that Feuerbach, in endeavouring to produce consciousness of just this fact, is going as far as a theorist possibly can, without ceasing to be a theorist and philosopher. It is characteristic, however, that Saint Bruno and Saint Max seize on Feuerbach's conception of the communist and put it in place of the real communist which occurs, partly, in order that they can combat communism too as ""spirit of the spirit,"" as a philosophical category, as an equal opponent and, in the case of Saint Bruno, partly also for pragmatic reason. As an example of Feuerbach's acceptance and at the same time misunderstanding of existing reality, which he still shares with our opponents, we recall the passage in the Philosophie der Zukunft where he develops the view that the existence of a thing or a man is at the same time its or his essence, that the conditions of existence, the mode of life and activity of an animal or human individual are those in which its ""essence"" feels itself satisfied. Here every exception is expressly conceived as an unhappy chance, as an abnormality which cannot be altered. Thus if millions of proletarians feel by no means contented with their living conditions, if their ""existence"" does not in the least correspond to their ""essence,"" then, according to the passage quoted, this is an unavoidable misfortune, which must be borne quietly. The millions of proletarians and communists, however, think differently and will prove this in time, when they bring their ""existence"" into harmony with their ""essence"" in a practical way, by means of a revolution. Feuerbach, therefore, never speaks of the world of man in such cases, but always takes refuge in external nature, and moreover in nature which has not yet been subdued by men. But every new invention, every advance made by industry, detaches another piece from this domain, so that the ground which produces examples illustrating such Feuerbachian propositions is steadily shrinking. The ""essence"" of the fish is its ""existence,"" water to go no further than this one proposition. The ""essence"" of the freshwater fish is the water of a river. But the latter ceases to be the ""essence"" of the fish and is no longer a suitable medium of existence as soon as the river is made to serve industry, as soon as it is polluted by dyes and other waste products and navigated by steamboats, or as soon as its water is diverted into canals where simple drainage can deprive the fish of its medium of existence. The explanation that all such contradictions are inevitable abnormalities does not essentially differ from the consolation which the Blessed Max Stirner offers to the discontented, saying that this contradiction is their own contradiction and this predicament their own predicament,whereupon they should either set their minds at ease, keep their disgust to themselves, or revolt against it in some fantastic way. It differs just as little from Saint Bruno's allegation that these unfortunate circumstances are due to the fact that those concerned are stuck in the muck of ""substance,"" have not advanced to ""absolute self-consciousness,"" and do not realise that these adverse conditions are spirit of their spirit.

   We shall, of course, not take the trouble9 to enlighten our wise philosophers by explaining to them that the ""liberation"" of ""man"" is not advanced a single stepl by reducing philosophy, theology, substance and all the trash to ""self-consciousness""2 and by liberating man from the domination of these phrases,3 which have never held him in thrall.4 Nor will we explain to them that it is only possible to achieve real liberation in the real world and by employing. real means, that slavery cannot be abolished without the steam¬engine and the mule and spinning-jenny, serfdom cannot be abolished without improved agriculture, and that, in general, people cannot be liberated as long as they are unable to obtain food and drink, housing and clothing in adequate quality and quantity. ""Liberation"" is a historical and not a mental act, and it is brought about by historical conditions, the [development] of industry, commerce, [agri]culture, the [conditions of intercourse] * * * 5

   In Germany,6a country where only a trivial historical development is taking place, these mental developments, these glorified and ineffective trivialities, naturally serve as a substitute for the lack of historical development, and they take root and have to be combated. But this fight is of local importance.7

   * * * 8in reality and for the practical materialist, i.e., the communist, it is a question of revolutionising the existing world, of practically attacking and changing existing things . When occasionally we find such views with Feuerbach, they are never more than isolated surmises and have much too little influence on his general outlook to be considered here as anything else than embryos capable of development. Feuerbach's ""conception"" of the sensuous world is confined on the one hand to mere contemplation of it, and on the other to mere feeling; he says ""Man"" instead of ""real historical man."" ""Man"" is really ""the German."" In the first case, the contemplation of the sensuous world, he necessarily lights on things whichcontradict his consciousness and feeling, which disturb the harmony he presupposes, the harmony of all parts of the sensuous world and especially of man and nature.9 To remove this disturbance, he must take refuge in a double perception, a profane one which only perceives the ""flatly obvious"" and a higher, philosophical, one which perceives the ""true essence"" of things. He does not see how the sensuous world around him is, not a thing given direct from all eternity, remaining ever the same, but the product of industry and of the state of society; and, indeed, in the sense that it is an historical product, the result of the activity of a whole succession of generations, each standing on the shoulders of the preceding one, developing its industry and its intercourse, modifying its social system according to the changed needs. Even the objects of the simplest ""sensuous certainty"" are only given him through social development, industry and commercial intercourse. The cherry-tree, like almost all fruit-trees, was, as is well known, only a few centuries ago transplanted by commerce into our zone, and therefore only by this action of a definite society in a definite age it has become ""sensuous certainty"" for Feuerbach.

   Incidentally, when we conceive things thus, as they really are and happened, every profound philosophical problem is resolved, as will be seen even more clearly later, quite simply into an empirical fact. For instance, the important question of the relation of man to nature (Bruno goes so far as to speak of ""the antitheses in nature and history"" (p. 110), as though these were two separate ""things"" and man did not always have before him an historical nature and a natural history) out of which all the ""unfathomably lofty works"" on ""substance"" and ""self-consciousness"" were born, crumbles of itself when we understand that the celebrated ""unity of man with nature"" has always existed in industry and has existed in varying forms in every epoch according to the lesser or greater development of industry, just like the ""struggle"" of man with nature, right up to the development of his productive powers on a corresponding basis. Industry and commerce, production and the exchange of the necessities of life, themselves determine distribution, the structure of the different social classes and are, in turn, determined by it as to the mode in which they are carried on; and so it happens that in Manchester, for instance, Feuerbach sees only factories and machines, where a hundred years ago only spinning-wheels and weaving-looms were to be seen, or in the Campagna of Rome he finds only pasture lands and swamps, where in the time of Augustus he would have found nothing but the vineyards and villas of Roman capitalists. Feuerbach speaks in particular of the perception of natural science; he mentions secrets which are disclosed only to the eye of the physicist and chemist; but where would natural science be without industry and commerce? Even this ""pure"" natural science is provided with an aim, as with its material, only through trade and industry, through the sensuous activity of men. So much is this activity, this unceasing sensuous labour and creation, this production, the basis of the whole sensuous world as it now exists, that, were it interrupted only for a year, Feuerbach would not only find an enormous change in the natural world, but would very soon find that the whole world of men and his own perceptive faculty, nay his own existence, were missing. Of course, in all this the priority of external nature remains unassailed, and all this has no application to the original men produced by generatio aequivoca; 1 but this differentiation has meaning only insofar as man is considered to be distinct from n ature. For that matter, nature, the nature that preceded human history, is not by any means the nature in which Feuerbach lives, it is nature which today no longer exists anywhere (except perhaps on a few Australian coral-islands of recent origin) and which, therefore, does not exist for Feuerbach.

   Certainly Feuerbach has a great advantage over the ""pure"" materialists in that he realises how man too is an ""object of the senses."" But apart from the fact that he only conceives him as an ""object of the senses,"" not as ""sensuous activity,"" because he still remains in the realm of theory and conceives of men not in their given social connection, not under their existing conditions of life, which have made them what they are, he never arrives at the really existing active men, but stops at the abstraction ""man,"" and gets no further than recognising ""the true, individual, corporeal man"" emotionally, i.e., he knows no other ""human relationships"" ""of man to man"" than love and friendship, and even then idealised. He gives no criticism of the present conditions of life. Thus he never manages to conceive the sensuous world as the total living sensuous activity of the individuals composing it; and therefore when, for example, he sees instead of healthy men a crowd of scrofulous, overworked and consumptive starvelings, he is compelled to take refuge in the ""higher perception"" and in the ideal ""compensation in the species,"" and thus to relapse into idealism at the very p oint where the communist materialist sees the necessity, and at the same time the condition, of a transformation both of industry and of the social structure.    As far as Feuerbach is a materialist he does not deal with history, and as far as he considers history he is not a materialist. With him materialism and history diverge completely, a fact which inciden¬tally is already obvious from what has been said.

   History is nothing but the succession of the separate generations, each of which exploits the materials, the capital funds, the productive forces handed down to it by all preceding generations, and thus, on the one hand, continues the traditional activity in completely changed circumstances and, on the other, modifies the old circumstances with a completely changed activity. This can be speculatively distorted so that later history is made the goal of earlier history, e.g., the goal ascribed to the discovery of America is to further the eruption of the French Revolution. Thereby history receives its own special aims and becomes ""a person ranking with other persons"" (to wit: ""Self-Consciousness, Criticism, the Unique,"" etc.), while what is designated with the words ""destiny,"" ""goal,"" ""germ,"" or ""ideal"" of earlier history is nothing more than an abstraction formed from later history, from the active influence which earlier history exercises on later history.

   The further the separate spheres, which act on one another, extend in the course of this development, the more the original isolation of the separate nationalities is destroyed by the developed mode of production and intercourse and the division of labour between various nations naturally brought forth by these, the more history becomes world history. Thus, for instance, if in England a machine is invented, which deprives countless workers of bread in India and China, and overturns the whole form of existence of these empires, this invention becomes a world-historical fact. Or again, take the case of sugar and coffee which have proved their world-historical importance in the nineteenth century by the fact that the lack of these products, occasioned by the Napoleonic Continental System, caused the Germans to rise against Napoleon, and thus became the real basis of the glorious ""Vars of Liberation of 1813. From this it follows that this transformation of history into world history is not indeed a mere abstract act on the part of the ""self-consciousness,"" the world spirit, or of any other metaphysical spectre, but a quite material, empirically verifiable act, an act the proof of which every individual furnishes as he comes and goes, eats, drinks and clothes himself .

   The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas: i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectualforce. The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships, the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas; hence of the relationships which make the one class the ruling one, therefore, the ideas of its dominance. The individuals composing the ruling class possess among other things consciousness, and therefore think. Insofar, therefore, as they rule as a class and determine the extent and compass of an epoch, it is self-evident that they do this in its whole range, hence among other things rule also as thinkers, as producers of ideas, and regulate the production and distribution of the ideas of their age: thus their ideas are the ruling ideas of the epoch. For instance, in an age and in a country where royal power, aristocracy and bourgeoisie are contending for mastery and where, therefore, mastery is shared, the doctrine of the separation of powers proves to be the dominant idea and is expressed as an ""eternal law.""

   The division of labour, which we have already seen above as one of the chief forces of history up till now, manifests itself also in the ruling class as the division of mental and material labour, so that inside this class one part appears as the thinkers of the class (its active, conceptive ideologists, who make the perfecting of the illusion of the class about itself their chief source of livelihood), while the others' attitude to these ideas and illusions is more passive and receptive, because they are in reality the active members of this class and have less time to make up illusions and ideas about themselves. Within this class this cleavage can even develop into a certain opposition and hostility between the two parts, which, how¬ever, in the case of a practical collision, in which the class itself is endangered, automatically comes to nothing, in which case there also vanishes the semblance that the ruling ideas were not the ideas of the ruling class and had a power distinct from the power of this class. The existence of revolutionary ideas in a particular period pre¬supposes the existence of a revolutionary class; about the premises for the latter sufficient has already been said above.

   If now in considering the course of history we detach the ideas of the ruling class from the ruling class itself and attribute to therp an independent existence, if we confine ourselves to saying that these or those ideas were dominant at a given time, without bothering ourselves about the conditions of production and the producers of these ideas, if we thus ignore the individuals and world conditions which are the source of the ideas, we can say, for instance, that during the time that the aristocracy was dominant, the concepts honour, loyalty, etc., were dominant, during the dominance of the bourgeoisie the concepts freedom, equality, etc. The ruling class itself on the whole imagines this to be so. This conception of history, which is common to all historians, particularly since the eighteenth century, will necessarily come up against the phenomenon that increasingly abstract ideas hold sway, i.e., ideas whichincreasingly take on the form of universality. For each new class which puts itself in the place of one ruling before it, is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to represent its interest as the common interest of all the members of society, that is, expressed in ideal form: it has to give its ideas the form of univer¬sality, and represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones. The class making a revolution appears from the very start, if only because it is opposed to a class, not as a class but as the representative of the whole of society; it appears as thewhole mass of society confronting the one ruling class.2 It can do this because, to start with, its interest really is more connected with the common interest of all other non-ruling classes, because under the pressure of hitherto existing conditions its interest has not yet been able to develop as the particular interest of a particular class. Its victory, therefore, benefits also many individuals of the other classes which are not winning a dominant position, but only insofar as it now puts these individuals in a position to raise themselves into the ruling class. When the French bourgeoisie overthrew the power of the aristocracy, it thereby made it possible for many proletarians to raise themselves above the proletariat, but only insofar as they became bourgeois. Every new class, therefore, achieves its hegemony only on a broader basis than that of the class ruling previously, whereas the opposition of the non-ruling class against the new ruling class later develops all the more sharply and profoundly. Both these things determine the fact that the struggle to be waged against this new ruling class, in its turn, aims at a more decided and radical negation of the previous conditions of society than could all previous classes which sought to rule.

   This whole semblance, that the rule of a certain class is only the rule of certain ideas, comes to a natural end, of course, as soon as class rule in general ceases to be the form in which society is organised, that is to say, as soon as it is no longer necessary to represent a particular interest as general or the ""general interest"" as ruling.

   Once the ruling ideas have been separated from the ruling individuals and, above all, from the relationships which result from a given stage of the mode of production, and in this way the conclusion has been reached that history is always under the sway of ideas, it is very easy to abstract from these various ideas "" the idea,"" the notion, etc., as the dominant force in history, and thus to understand all these separate ideas and concepts as ""forms of self-determination"" on the part of the concept developing in history. Itfollows then naturally, too, that all the relationships of men can be derived from the concept of man, man as conceived, the essence of man, Man. This has been done by the speculative philosophers. Hegel himself confesses at the end of the Geschichtsphilosophiethat he ""has considered the progress of the concept only"" and has represented in history the ""true theodicy."" Now one can go back again to the producers of the ""concept,"" to the theorists, ideologists and philosophers, and one comes then to"" the conclusion that the philosophers, the thinkers as such, have at all times been dominant in history : a conclusion, as we see, already expressed by Hegel. The whole trick of proving the hegemony of the spirit in history ( hierarchy Stirner calls it) is thus confined to the following three efforts.

   No. 1. One must separate the ideas of those ruling for empirical reasons, under empirical conditions and as empirical individuals, from these actual rulers, and thus recognise the rule of ideas or illusions in history.

   No. 2. One must bring an order into this rule of ideas, prove a mystical connection among the successive ruling ideas, which is managed by understanding them as ""acts of self-determination on the part of the concept"" ( this is possible because by virtue of their empirical basis these ideas are really connected with one another and because, conceived asmere ideas, they become self-distinctions, distinctions made by thought) .

   No. 3. To remove the mystical appearance of this ""self-determining concept"" it is changed into a person-""Self-Consciousness""¬or, to appear thoroughly materialistic, into a series of persons, who represent the ""concept"" in history, into the ""thinkers,"" the ""philosophers,"" the ideologists, who again are understood as the manufacturers of history, as the ""council of guardians,"" as the rulers.3Thus the whole body of materialistic elements has been removed from history and now full rein can be given to the speculative steed.

   Whilst in ordinary life every shopkeeper is very well able to distinguish between what somebody professes to be and what he really is, our historians have not yet won even this trivial insight. They take every epoch at its word and believe that everything it says and imagines about itself is true.

   This historical method which reigned in Germany and especially the reason why, must be understood from its connection with the illusion of ideologists in general, e.g., the illusions of the jurists, politicians (of the practical statesmen among them, too ), from the dogmatic dreamings and distortions of these fellows; this is explained perfectly easily from their practical position in life, their job, and the division of labour.

                              [B. THE REAL BASIS OF IDEOLOGY] 4

                                1. Intercourse and Productive Forces

   The greatest division of material and mental labour is the separation of town and country. The antagonism between town and country begins with the transition from barbarism to civilisation, from tribe to State, from locality to nation, and runs through the whole history of civilisation to the present day ( the Anti-Corn Law League) .

   The existence of the town implies, at the same time, the necessity of administration, police, taxes, etc., in short, of the municipality, and thus of politics in general. Here first became manifest the division of the population into two great classes, which is directly based on the division of labour and on the instruments of production. The town already is in actual fact the concentration of the population, of the instruments of production, of capital, of pleasures, of needs, while the country demonstrates just the opposite fact, isolation and separation. The antagonism between town and country can only exist within the framework of private property. It is the most crass expression of the subjection of the individual under the division of labour, under a definite activity forced upon him a subjection which makes one man into a restricted town¬animal, the other into a restricted country-animal, and daily creates anew the conflict between their interests. Labour is here again the chief thing, power over individuals, and as long as the latter exists, private property must exist. The abolition of the antagonism between town and country is one of the first conditions of communal life, a condition which again depends on a mass of material premises and which cannot be fulfilled by the mere will, as anyone can see at the first glance. (These conditions have still to be enumerated.) The separation of town and country can also be understood as the separation of capital and landed property, as the beginning of the existence and development of capital independent of landed property-the beginning of property having its basis only in labour and exchange.

   In the towns which, in the Middle Ages, did not derive ready¬made from an earlier period but were formed anew by the serfs who had become free, each man's own particular labour was his only property apart from the small capital he brought with him, consisting almost solely of the most necessary tools of his craft. The competition of serfs constantly escaping into the town, the constant war of the country against the towns and thus the necessity of an organised municipal military force, the bond of common ownership in a particular kind of labour, the necessity of common buildings for sale of their wares at a time when craftsmen were also traders, and the consequent exclusion of the unauthorised from these buildings, the conflict among the interests of the various crafts, the necessity of protecting their laboriously acquired skill, and the feudal organisation of the whole of the country: these were the causes of the union of the workers of each craft in guilds. We have not at this point to go further into the manifold modifications of the guild-system, which arise through later historical developments. The flight of the serfs into the towns went on without interruption right through the Middle Ages. These serfs, persecuted by their lords in the country, came separately into the towns, where they found an organised community, against which they were powerless and in which they had to subject themselves to the station assigned to them by the demand for their labour and the interest of their organised urban competitors. These workers, entering separately, were never able to attain to any power, since, if their labour was of the guild type which had to be learned, the guild-masters bent them to their will and organised them according to their interest; or if their labour was not such as had to be learned, and therefore not of the guild type, they became day-labourers and never managed to organise, remaining an unorganised rabble. The need for day-labourers in the towns created the rabble.

   These towns were true ""associations,"" called forth by the direct need, the care of providing for the protection of property, and of multiplying the means of production and defence of the separate members. The rabble of these towns was devoid of any power, composed as it was of individuals strange to one another who had entered separately, and who stood un organised over against an organised power, armed for war, and jealously watching over them. The journeymen and apprentices were organised in each craft as it best suited the interest of the masters. The patriarchal relationship existing between them and their masters gave the latter a double power-on the one hand because of their influence on the whole life of the journeymen, and on the other because, for the journeymen who worked with the same master, it was a real bond which held them together against the journeymen of other masters and separated them from these. And finally, the journeymen were bound to the existing order by their simple interest in becoming masters themselves. While, therefore, the rabble at least carried out revolts against the whole municipal order, revolts which remained completely ineffective because of their powerlessness, the journeymen never got further than small acts of insubordination within sepa-rate guilds, such as belong to the very nature of the guild system. The great risings of the Middle Ages all radiated from the country, but equally remained totally ineffective because of the isolation and consequent crudity of the peasants.

   In the towns, the division of labour between the individual guilds was as yet [quite naturally derived] and, in the guilds themselves, not at all developed between the individual workers. Every workman had to be versed in a whole round of tasks, had to be able to make everything that was to be made with his tools. The limited commerce and the scanty communication between the individual towns, the lack of population and the narrow needs did not allow of a higher division of labour, and therefore every man who wished to become a master had to be proficient in the whole of his craft. Thus there is found with medieval craftsmen an interest in their special work and in proficiency in it, which was capable of rising to a narrow artistic sense. For this very reason, however, every medieval craftsman was completely absorbed in his work, to which he had a contented, slavish relationship, and to which he was subjected to a far greater extent than the modern worker, whose work is a matter of indifference to him.

   Capital in these towns was a naturally derived capital, consisting of a house, the tools of the craft, and the natural, hereditary customers; and not being realisable, on account of the backwardness of commerce and the lack of circulation, it descended from father to son. Unlike modern capital, which can be assessed in money and which may be indifferently invested in this thing or that, this capital was directly connected with the particular work of the owner, inseparable from it and to this extent estate capital.

   The next extension of the division of labour was the separation of production and commerce, the formation of a special class of merchants; a separation which, in the towns bequeathed by a former period, had been handed down ( among other things with the Jews ) and which very soon appeared in the newly formed ones. With this there was given the possibility of commercial communications transcending the immediate neighbourhood, a possibility, the realisation of which depended on the existing means of communication, the state of public safety in the countryside, which was determined by political conditions ( during the whole of the Middle Ages, as is well known, the merchants travelled in armed caravans ), and on the cruder or more advanced needs ( determined by the stage of culture attained) of the region accessible to intercourse.

   With commerce the prerogative of a particular class, with the extension of trade through the merchants beyond the immediate surroundings of the town, there immediately appears a reciprocal action between production and commerce. The towns enter intorelations with one another, new tools are brought from one town into the other, and the separation between production and commerce soon calls forth a new division of production between the individual towns, each of which is soon exploiting a predominant branch of industry. The local restrictions of earlier times begin gradually to be broken down.

   In the Middle Ages the citizens in each town were compelled to unite against the landed nobility to save their skins. The extension of trade, the establishment of communications, led the separate towns to get to know other towns, which had asserted the same interests in the struggle with the same antagonist. Out of the many local corporations of burghers there arose only gradually the burgher class. The conditions of life of the individual burghers became, on account of their contradiction to the existing relationships and of the mode of labour determined by these, conditions which were common to them all and independent of each individual. The burghers had created the conditions insofar as they had torn themselves free from feudal ties, and were created by them insofar as they were determined by their antagonism to the feudal system which they found in existence. When the individual towns began to enter into associations, these common conditions developed into class conditions. The same conditions, the same contradiction, the same interests necessarily called forth on the whole similar customs everywhere. The bourgeoisie itself, with its conditions, develops only gradually, splits according to the division of labour into various fractions and finally absorbs all propertied classes it finds in existence5( while it develops the majority of the earlier propertyless and a part of the hitherto propertied classes into a new class, the proletariat) in the measure to which all property found in existence is transformed into industrial or commercial capital. The separate individuals form a class only insofar as they have to carry on a common battle against another class; otherwise they are on hostile terms with each other as competitors. On the other hand, the class in its turn achieves an independent existence  overagainst the individuals, so that the latter find their conditions of existence predestined, and hence have their position in life and their personal development assigned to them by their class, become subsumed under it. This is the same phenomenon as thlre subjection of the separate individuals to the division of labour and can only be removed by the abolition of private property and of labour itself. We have already indicated several times how this subsuming of individuals under the class brings with it their subjection to all kinds of ideas, etc.

    It depends purely on the extension of commerce whether the productive forces achieved in a locality, especially inventions, are lost for later development or not. As long as there exists no commerce transcending the immediate neighborhood, every invention must be made separately in each locality, and mere chances such as irruptions of barbaric peoples, even ordinary wars, are sufficient to cause a country with advanced productive forces and needs to have to start right over again from the beginning. In primitive history every invention had to be made daily anew and in each locality independently. How little highly developed productive forces are safe from complete destruction, given even a relatively very extensive commerce, is proved by the Phoenicians,6 whose inventions were for the most part lost for a long time to come through the ousting of this nation from commerce, its conquest by Alexander and its consequent decline. Likewise, for instance, glass-painting in the Middle Ages. Only when commerce has become world commerce and has as its basis large-scale industry, when all nations are drawn into the competitive struggle, is the permanence of the acquired productive forces assured.

   The immediate consequence of the division of labour between the various towns was the rise of manufactures, branches of produc¬tion which had outgrown the guild-system. Manufactures first flour¬ished, in Italy and later in Flanders, under the historical premise of commerce with foreign nations. In other countries, England and France for example, manufactures were at first confined to the home market. Besides the premises already mentioned manufactures depend on an already advanced concentration of population, particularly in the countryside, and of capital, which began to accumulate in the hands of individuals, partly in the guilds in spite of the guild regulations, partly among the merchants.
   That labour which from the first presupposed a machine, even of the crudest sort, soon showed itself the most capable of development. Weaving, earlier carried on in the country by the peasants as a secondary occupation to procure their clothing, was the first labour to receive an impetus and a further development through the extension of commerce. Weaving was the first and remained the principal manufacture. The rising demand for clothing materials, consequent on the growth of population, the growing accumulation and mobilisation of natural capital through accelerated circulation, the demand for luxuries called forth by the latter and favoured generally by the gradual extension of commerce, gave weaving a quantitative and qualitative stimulus, which wrenched it out of the form of production hitherto existing. Alongside the peasants weaving for their own use, whocontinued, and still continue, with this sort of work, there emerged a new class of weavers in the towns, whose fabrics were destined for the whole home market and usually for foreign markets too:

   Weaving, an occupation demanding in most cases little skill and soon splitting up into countless branches, by its whole nature resisted the trammels of the guild. Weaving was, therefore, carried on mostly in villages and market centres without guild organisation, which gradually became towns, and indeed the most flourishing towns in each land.

   With guild-free manufacture, property relations also quickly changed. The first advance beyond naturally derived estate capital was provided by the rise of merchants whose capital was from the beginning movable, capital in the modern sense as far as one can speak of it, given the circumstances of those times. The second advance came with manufacture, which again made mobile a mass of natural capital, and altogether increased the mass of movable capital as against that of natural capital.
   At the same time, manufacture became a refuge of the peasants from the guilds which excluded them or paid them badly, just as earlier the guild-towns had [served] as a refuge for the peasants from [the oppressive landed nobility] .

   Simultaneously with the beginning of manufactures there was a period of vagabondage caused by the abolition of the feudal bodies of retainers, the disbanding of the swollen armies which had flocked to serve the kings against their vassals, the improvement of agriculture, and the transformation of great strips of tillage into pasture land. From this alone it is clear how this vagabondage is strictly connected with the disintergration of the feudal system. As early as the thirteenth century we find isolated epochs of this kind, but only at the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth does this vagabondage make a general and permanent appearance. These vagabonds, who were so numerous that, for instance, Henry VIlI of England had 72,000 of them hanged, were only prevailed upon to work with the greatest difficulty and through the most extreme necessity, and then only after long resistance. The rapid rise of manufactures, particularly in England, absorbed them gradually.

   With the advent of manufactures, the various nations entered into a competitive relationship, the struggle for trade, which was fought out in wars, protective duties and prohibitions, whereas earlier the nations, insofar as they were connected at all, had carried on an inoffensive exchange with each other. Trade had from now on a political significance.

   With the advent of manufacture the relationship between worker and employer changed. In the guilds the patriarchal relationship between journeyman and master continued to exist; in manufacture its place was taken by the monetary relation between worker aad capitalist-a relationship which in the countryside and in small towns retained a patriarchal tinge, but in the larger, the real manufacturing towns, quite early lost almost all patriarchal complexion.
   Manufacture and the movement of production in general received an enormous impetus through the extension of commerce which came with the discovery of America and the sea-route to the East Indies. The new products imported thence, particularly the masses of gold and silver which came into circulation and totally changed the position of the classes towards one another, dealing a hard blow to feudal landed property and to the workers; the expeditions of adventurers, colonisation; and above all the extension of markets into a world market, which had now become possible and was daily becoming more and more a fact, called forth a new phase of historical development, into which in general we cannot here enter further. Through the colonisation of the newly discovered countries the commercial struggle of the nations amongst one another was given new fuel and accordingly greater extension and animosity.

   The expansion of trade and manufacture accelerated the accumulation of movable capital, while in the guilds, which were not stimulated to extend their production, natural capital remained stationary or even declined. Trade and manufacture created the big bourgeoisie; in the guilds was concentrated the petty bourgeoisie, which no longer was dominant in the towns as formerly, but had to bow to the might of the great merchants and manufacturers.7Hence the decline of the guilds, as soon as they came into contact with manufacture.
   The intercourse of nations took on, in the epoch of which we have been speaking, two different forms. At first the small quantity of gold and silver in circulation involved the ban on the export of these metals; and industry, for the most part imported from a broad and made necessary by the need for employing the growing urban population, could not do without those privileges which could be granted not only, of course, against home competition, but chiefly against foreign. The local guild privilege was in these original prohibitions extended over the whole nation. Customs duties originated from the tributes which the feudal lords exacted as protective levies against robbery from merchants passing through their territories; tributes later imposed likewise by the towns, and which, with therise of the modem states, were the Treasury's most obvious means of raising money.

   The appearance of American gold and silver on the European markets, the gradual development of industry, the rapid expansion of trade and the consequent rise of the non-guild bourgeoisie and of money, gave these measures another significance. The State, which was daily less and less able to do without money, now retained the ban on the export of gold and silver out of fiscal considerations; the bourgeois, for whom these masses of money which were hurled on to the market became the chief object of speculative buying, were thoroughly content with this; privileges established earlier became a source of income for the government and were sold for money; in the customs legislation there appeared the export duty, which, since it only [placed] a hindrance in the way of industry, had a purely fiscal aim.

   The second period began in the middle of the seventeenth century and lasted almost to the end of the eighteenth. Commerce and navigation had expanded more rapidly than manufacture, which played a secondary role; the colonies were becoming considerable consumers; and after long struggles the separate nations shared out the opening world market among themselves. This period begins with the Navigation Laws and colonial monopolies. The competition of the nations among themselves was excluded as far as possible by tariffs, prohibitions and treaties; and in the last resort the competitive struggle was carried on and decided by wars (especially naval wars). The mightiest maritime nation, the English, retained preponderance in trade and manufacture. Here, already, we find concentration in one country.

   Manufacture was all the time sheltered by protective duties in the home market, by monopolies in the colonial market, and abroad as much as possible by differential duties . The working-up of home-produced material was encouraged ( wool and linen in England, silk in France ), the export of home-produced raw material forbidden (wool in England), and the [working-up] of imported material neglected or suppressed (cotton in England ). The nation dominant in sea trade and colonial power naturally secured for itself also the greatest quantitative and qualitative expansion of manufacture. Manufacture could not be carried on without protection , since, if the slightest change takes place inother countries, it can lose its market and be ruined; under reasonably favourable conditions it may easily be introduced into a country, but for this very reason can easily be destroyed. At the same time through the mode in which it is carried on, particularly in the eighteenth century, in the countryside, it is to such an extent inter-woven with the vital relationships of a great mass of individuals, that no country dare jeopardise its existence by permitting free competition. Insofar as it manages to export, it therefore depends entirely on the extension or restriction of commerce, and exercises a relatively very small reaction [on the latter] . Hence its secondary [importance] and the influence of [the merchants] in the eighteenth century. It was the merchants and especially the shippers who more than anybody else pressed for State protection and monopolies; the manufacturers also demanded and indeed received protection, but all the time were inferior in political importance to the merchants. The commercial towns, particularly the maritime towns, became to some extent civilised and acquired the outlook of the big bourgeoisie, but in the factory towns an extreme petty bourgeois outlook persisted. Cf. Aiken, etc. The eighteenth centurywas the century of trade. Pinto says this expressly: ""Le commerce fait la marotte du siècle"";8 and: ""Depuis quelque temps il n'est plus question que de commerce, de navigation et de marine. ""9

   This period is also characterised by the cessation of the bans on the export of gold and silver and the beginning of the trade in money; by banks, national debts, paper money; by speculation in stocks and shares and stockjobbing in all articles; by the development of finance in general. Again capital lost a great part of the natural character which had still clung to it.

   The concentration of trade and manufacture in one country, England, developing irresistibly in the seventeenth century, gradually created for this country a relative world market, and thus a demand for the manufactured products of this country, which could no longer be met by the industrial productive forces hitherto existing. This deinand, outgrowing the productive forces, was the motive power which, by producing big industry the application of elemental forces to industrial ends, machinery and the most complex division of labour called into existence the third period of private ownership since the Middle Ages. There already existed in England the other pre-conditions of this new phase: freedom of competition inside the nation, the development of theoretical mechanics, etc. ( Indeed, the science of mechanics perfected by Newton was altogether the most popular science in France and England in the eighteenth century. )( Free competition inside the nation itself had everywhere to be conquered by a revolution-1640 and 1688 in England, 1789 in France. ) Competition soon compelled every country that wished to retain its historical role to protect its manufactures by renewed customs regulations ( the old duties were no longer any good against big industry) and soon after to introduce big industry under protective duties. Big industry universalised competition in spite of these protective measures ( it is practical free trade; the protective duty is only a palliative, a measure of defence within free trade ), established means of communication and the modern world market, subordinated trade to itself, transformed all capital into industrial capital, and thus produced the rapid circulation ( development of the financial system ) and the centralisation of capital. By universal competition it forced all individuals to strain their energy to the utmost. It destroyed as far as possible ideology, religion, morality, etc., and where it could not do this, made them into a palpable lie. It produced world history for the first time, insofar as it made all civilised nations and every individual member of them dependent for the satisfaction of their wants on the whole world, thus destroying the former natural exclusiveness of separate nations. It made natural science subservient to capital and took from the division of labour the last semblance of its natural character. It destroyed natural growth in general, as far as this is possible while labour exists, and resolved all natural relationships into money relationships. In the place of naturally grown towns it created the modern, large industrial cities which have sprung up overnight. Wherever it penetrated, it destroyed the crafts and all earlier stages of industry. It completed the victory of the commercial town over the countryside. [Its first premise] was the automatic system. [Its development] produced a mass of productive forces, for which private [property] became just as much a fetter as the guild had been for manufacture and the small, rural workshop for the developing craft. These productive forces received under the system of private property a one¬sided development only, and became for the majority destructive forces; moreover, a great multitude of such forces could find no application at all within this system. Generally speaking, big industry created everywhere the same relations between the classes of society, and thus destroyed the peculiar individuality of the various nationalities. And finally, while the bourgeoisie of each nation still retained separate national interests, big industry created a class, which in all nations has the same interest and with which nationality is already dead; a class which is really rid of all the old worldand at the same time stands pitted against it. Big industry makes for the worker not only the relation to the capitalist, but labouritself, unbearable.

   It is evident that big industry does not reach the same level ofdevelopment in all districts of a country. This does not, however, retard the class movement of the proletariat, because the proletarians created by big industry assume leadership of this movement and carry the whole mass along with them, and because the workers excluded from big industry are placed by it in a still worse situation than the workers in big industry itself. The countries in which big industry is developed act in a similar manner upon the more or less non-industrial countries, insofar as the latter are swept by universal commerce into the universal competitive struggle.l

   These different forms are just so many forms of the organisation of labour, and hence of property. In each period a unification of the existing - productive forces takes place, insofar as this has been rendered necessary by needs.

                            2. The Relation of State and Law to Property

   The first form of property, in the ancient world as in the Middle Ages, is tribal property, determined with the Romans chiefly by war, with the Germans by the rearing of cattle. In the case of the ancient peoples, since several tribes live together in one town, thetribal property appears as State property, and the right of the individual to it as mere ‘’possession’’ which, however, like tribal property as a whole, is confined to landed property only. Real private property began with the ancienfs, as with modern nationll, with movable property.(Slavery and community) ( dominium ex jure Quiritum2 ). In the case of the nations which grew out of the Middle Ages, tribal property evolved through various stages-feudal landed property, corporative movable property, capital invested in manufacture-to modern capital, determined by big industry and universal competition, i.e., pure private property, which has cast off all semblance of a communal institution and has shut out the State from any influence on the development of property. To thismodern private property corresponds the modern State, which, purchased gradually by the owners of property by means of taxation, has fallen entirely into their hands through the national debt, and its existence has become wholly dependent on the commercial credit which the owners of property, the bourgeois, extend to it, as reflected in the rise and fall of State funds on the stock exchange. By the mere fact that it is a class and no longer an estate, the bour Geoisie is forced to organize itself no longer locally, but nationally, and to give a general form to its mean average interest. Through the emancipation of private property from the community, the State has become a separate entity, beside and outside Civil society; but it is nothing more than the form of organisation which  the bourgeois necessarily adopt both for internal and external purposes, forthe mutual guarantee of their property and interests. The independence of the State is only found nowadays  in those countries where the estates have not yet completely developed into classes, where the estates, done away with in more advanced countries, still have a part to play, and where there exists a mixture; countries, that is to say, in which no one section of the population can achieve dominance over the others. This is the case particularly in Germany. The most perfect example of the modern State is North America. The modern French, English and American writers all express the opinion that the State exists only for the sake of private property, so that this fact has penetrated into the consciousness of the normal man.

   Since the State is the form in which the individuals of a ruling class assert their common interests, and in which the whole civil society of an epoch is epitomised, it follows that the State mediates in the formation of all common institutions and that the institutions receive a political form. Hence the illusion that law is based on the will, and indeed on the will divorced from its real basis on free will. Similarly, justice is in its turn reduced to the actual laws.

   Civil law develops simultaneously with private property out of the disintegration of the natural community . With the Romans the development of private property and civil law had no further' industrial and commercial consequences, because their whole mode of production did not alter.3 With modern peoples, where the feudal community was disintegrated by industry and trade, there began with the rise of private property and civil law a new phase, which was capable of  further development. The very first town which carried on an extensive maritime trade in the Middle Ages, Amalfi, also developed maritime law. As soon as industry and trade developed private property further, first in Italy and later in other countries, the highly developed Roman civil law was immediately adopted again and raised to authority. When later the bourgeoisie had acquired so much power that the princes took up its interests in order to overthrow the feudal nobility by means of the bourgeoisie, there began in all countries-in France in the sixteenth century-the real development of law, which in all countries except Eng-land proceeded on the basis of the Roman Codex. In England, too, Roman legal principles had to be introduced to further the development of civil law (especially in the case of movable property). (It must not be forgotten that law has just as little an independent cc history as religion.)

     In civil law the existing property relationships are declared to be the result of the general will. The jus utendi et abutendi4 itself asserts on the one hand the fact that private property has become entirely independent of the community, and on the other the illu¬sion that private property itself is based solely on the private will, the arbitrary disposal of the thing. In practice, the abuti5 has very definite economic limitations for the owner of private property, if he does not wish to see his property and hence his jus abutendi pass into other hands, since actually the thing, considered merely with reference to his will, is not a thing at all, but only becomes a thing, true property in intercourse, and independently of the law (a relationship, which the philosophers call an idea 5 ). This juridical illusion, which reduces law to the mere will, necessarily leads, in the further development of property relationships, to the position that a man may have a legal title to a thing without really having the thing. If, for instance, the income from a piece of land is lost owing to competition, then the proprietor has certainly his legal title to it along with the jus utendi et abutendi. But he can do nothing with it: he owns nothing as a landed proprietor if in addi¬tion he has not enough capital to cultivate his ground. This illusion of the jurists also explains the fact that for them, as for every code, it is altogether fortuitous that individuals enter into relationships among themselves (e.g., contracts); it explains why they consider that these relationships [can] be entered into or not at will, and that their content rests purely on the individual [free] will of the contracting parties.

     Whenever, through the development of industry and commerce, new forms of intercourse have been evolved (e.g., ensurance companies, etc.), the law has always been compelled to admit them among the modes of acquiring property.

             [3. Natural and Civilised Instruments of Production and Forms
                                                 of Property ]

     * * * 7 From the first, there follows the premise of a highly developed division of labour and an extensive commerce; from the second, the locality. In the first case the individuals must be brought together, in the second they find themselves alongside the given instrument of production as instruments of production themselves. Here, therefore, arises the difference between natural instruments of production and those created by civilisation. The field (water, etc.) can be regarded as a natural instrument of production. In the first case, that of the natural instrument of production, individuals are subservient to nature; in the second, to a product of labour. In the first case, therefore, property (landed property) appears as direct natural domination in the second, as domination of labour, particularly of accumulated labour, capital. The first case presupposes that the individuals are united by some bond: family, tribe, the land itself, etc.; the second that they are independent of one another and are only held together by exchange. In the first case, what is involved is chiefly an exchange between men and nature in which the labour of the former is exchanged for the products of the latter; in the second, it is predominantly an exchange of men among themselves. In the first case, average, human commonsense is adequate-physical activity is as yet not separated from mental activity; in the second, the division between physical and mental labour must already be practically completed. In the first case, the domination of the proprietor over the property less may be based on a personal relationship, on a kind of community; in the second, it must have taken on a material shape in a third party¬money. In the first case, small industry exists, but determined by the utilisation of the natural instrument of production and therefore without the distribution of labour among various individuals; in the second, industry exists only in and through the division of labour.

     Our investigation hitherto started from the instruments of production, and it has already shown that private property was a necessity for certain industrial stages. In industrie extractive private property still coincides with labour; in small industry and all agriculture up till now property is the necessary consequence of the existing instruments of production; in big industry the contradiction between the instrument of production and private property appears for the first time and is the product of big industry; moreover, big industry must be highly developed to produce this contradiction. And thus only with big industry does the abolition of private property become possible.

     In big industry and competition the whole mass of conditions of existence, limitations, biases of individuals, are fused together into the two simplest forms : private property and labour. With money every form of intercourse, and intercourse itself, is considered for¬tuitous for the individuals. Thus money implies that all previous intercourse was only intercourse of individuals under particular conditions, not of individuals as individuals. These conditions are reduced to two: accumulated labour or private property, and actual labour. If both or one of these ceases, then intercourse comes to a standstill. The modern economists themselves, e.g., Sismondi, Cherbuliez, etc., oppose ""association of individuals"" to ""association of capital."" On the other hand, the individuals themselves are entirely subordinated to the division of labour and hence are brought into the most complete dependence on one another. Private property, insofar as within labour itself it is opposed to labour, evolves out of the necessity of accumulation, and has still, to begin with, rather the form of the communality; but in its further development it approaches more and more the modern form of private property. The division of labour implies from the outset the division of the conditions of labour, of tools and materials, and thus the splitting-up of accumulated capital among different owners, and thus, also, the division between capital and labour, and the different forms of property itself. The more the division of labour develops and accumulation grows, the sharper are the forms that this process of differentiation assumes. Labour itself can only exist on the premise of this fragmentation.

     Thus two facts are here revealed.8  First the productive forces appear as a world for themselves, quite independent of and divorced from the individuals, alongside the individuals: the reason for this is that the individuals, whose forces they are, exist split up and in opposition to one another, whilst, on the other hand, these forces are only real forces in the intercourse and association of these individuals. Thus, on the one hand, we have a totality of productive forces, which have, as it were, taken on a material form and are for the individuals no longer the forces of the individuals but of private property, and hence of the individuals only insofar as they are owners of private property themselves. Never, in any earlier period, have the productive forces taken on a form so indifferent to the intercourse of individuals as individuals, because the.ir inter¬course itself was formerly a restricted one. On the other hand, standing over against these productive forces, we have the majority of the individuals from whom these forces have been wrested away, and who, robbed thus of all real life-content, have become abstract individuals, but who are, however, only by this fact put into a position to enter into relation with one another as individuals.

     The only connection which still links them with the productive forces and with their own existence-labour has lost all sem¬blance of self-activity and only sustains their life by stunting it. While in the earlier periods self-activity and the production of material life were separated, in that they devolved on different persons, and while, on account of the narrowness of the individuals themselves, the production of material life was considered as a subordinate mode of self-activity, they now diverge to such an extent that altogether material life appears as the end, and what produces this material life, labour ( which is now the only possible but, as we see, negative form of self-activity ), as the means.

     Thus things have now come to such a pass, that the individuals must appropriate the existing totality of productive forces, not only to achieve self-activity, but, also, merely to safeguard their very existence. This appropriation is first determined by the object to be appropriated, the productive forces, which have been developed to a totality and which only exist within a universal intercourse. From this aspect alone, therefore, this appropriation must have a universal character corresponding to the productive forces and the intercourse. The appropriation of these forces is itself nothing more than the development of the individual capacities corresponding to the material instruments of production. The appropriation of a totality of instruments of production is, for this very reason, the development of a totality of capacities in the individuals themselves. This appropriation is further determined by the persons appropriating. Only the proletarians of the present day, who are completely shut off from all self-activity, are in a position to achieve a complete and no longer restricted self-activity, which consists in the appropriation of a totality of productive forces and in the thus postulated development of a totality of capacities. All earlier revolutionary appropriations were restricted; individuals, whose self-activity was restricted by a crude instrument of production and a limited intercourse, appropriated this crude instrument of production, and hence merely achieved a new state of limitation. Their instrument of production became their property, but they themselves remained subordinate to the division of labour and their own instrument of production. In all expropriations up to now, a mass of individuals remained subservient to a single instrument of production; in the appropriation by the proletarians, a mass of instruments of production must be made subject to each individual and property to all. Modern universal intercourse can be controlled by individuals, therefore, only when controlled by all.

     This appropriation is further determined by the manner in which it must be effected. It can only be effected through a union, which by the character of the proletariat itself can again only be a universal one, and through a revolution, in which, on the one hand, the power of the earlier mode of production and intercourse and social organisation is overthrown, and, on the other hand, there develops the universal character and the energy of the proletariat, without which the revolution cannot be accomplished; and in which, further, the proletariat rids itself of everything that still clings to it from its previous position in society.

     Only at this stage does self-activity coincide with material life, which corresponds to the development of individuals into complete individuals and the casting-off of all natural limitations. The transformation of labour into self-activity corresponds to the transformation of the earlier limited intercourse into the intercourse of individuals as such. With the appropriation of the total productive forces through united individuals, private property comes to an end. Whilst previously in history a particular condition always appeared as accidental, now the isolation of individuals and the particular private gain of each man have themselves become accidental.

     The individuals, who a re no longer subject to the division of labour, have been conceived by the philosophers as an ideal, under the name ""Man."" They have conceived the whole process which we have outlined as the evolutionary process of ""Man,"" so that at every historical stage ""Man"" was substituted for the individuals and shown as the motive force of history. The whole process was thus conceived as a process of the self-estrangement of ""Man,"" and this was essentially due to the fact that the average individual of the later stage was always foisted on to the earlier stage, and the consciousness of a later age on to the individuals of an earlier. Through this inversion, which from the first is an abstract image of the actual conditions, it was possible to transform the whole of history into an evolutionary process of consciousness.

     Finally, from the conception of history we have sketched we obtain these further conclusions: (1) In the development of productive forces there comes a stage  when productive forces and means of intercourse are brought into being, which, under the existing relationships, only cause mischief, and are no longer productive but destructive forces ( machinery and money); and connected with this a class is called forth, which has to bear all the burdens of society without enjoying its advantages, which, ousted from society, is forced into the most decided antagonism to all other classes; a class which forms the majority of all members of society, and from which emanates the consciousness of the necessity of a fundamental revolution, the communist consciousness, which may, of course, arise among the other classes too through the contemplation of the situation of this class. (2) The conditions under which definite productive forces can be applied, are the conditions of the rule C?f a definite class of society, whose social power, deriving from its property, has its practical-idealistic expression in each case in the form of the State; and, therefore, every revolutionary struggle is directed against a class, which till then has been in power.9 (3) In all revolutions up till now the mode of activity always remained unscathed and it was only a question of a different distribution of this activity, a new distribution of labour to other persons, whilst the communist revolution is directed against the preceding mode of activity, does away with labour, and abolishes the rule of all classes with the classes themselves, because it is carried through by the class which no longer counts as a class in society, is not recognised as a class, and is in itself the expression of the dissolution of all classes, nationalities, etc., within present society; and (4) Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist consciousness, and for the success of the cause itself, the alteration of men on a mass scale is necessary, an alteration which can only take place in a practical movement, a revolution; this revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in  any other way, but also because the class overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew.

                     C. COMMUNISM. THE PRODUCTION OF THE FORM
                                       OF INTERCOURSE  ITSELF

     Communism differs from all previous movements in that it over¬turns the basis of all earlier relations of production and intercourse, and for the first time consciously treats all natural premises as the creatures of hitherto existing men, strips them of their natural character and subjugates them to the power of the united individuals. Its organisation is, therefore, essentially economic, the material' production of the conditions of this unity; it turns existing conditions into conditions of unity. The reality, which communism is creating, is precisely the true basis for rendering it impossible that anything should exist independently of individuals, in so far, as reality is only a product of the preceding intercourse of individuals themselves. Thus the communists in practice treat the conditions created up to now by production and intercourse as inorganic conditions, without, however, imagining that it was the plan or the destiny of previous generations to give them material, and without believing that these conditions were inorganic for the individuals creating them. The difference between the individual as a person and what is accidental to him is not a conceptual difference but a historical fact. This distinction has a different significance at different times-e.g., the estate as something accidental to the individual in the eighteenth century, the family more or less too. It is not a distinction that we have to make for each age, but one which each age makes itself from among the different elements which it finds in existence, and indeed not according to any theory, but compelled by material collisions in life. What appears accidental to the later age as opposed to the earlier-and this applies also to the elements handed down by an earlier age-is a form of intercourse which corresponded to a definite stage of development of the productive forces. The relation of the productive forces to the form of intercourse is the relation of the form of intercourse to the occupation or activity of the individuals. (The fundamental form of this activity is, of course, material, on which depend all other forms-mental, political, religious, etc. The various shaping of material life is, of course, in every case dependent on the needs which are already developed, and the production, as well as the satisfaction, of these needs is an historical process, which is not found in the case of a sheep or a dog. (Stirner's refractory principal argument adversus hominem), although sheep and dogs in their present form certainly, but malgre eux, are products of an historical process.) The conditions under which individuals have intercourse with each other, so long as the above-mentioned contradiction is absent, are conditions appertaining to their individuality, in no way external to them; conditions under which these definite individuals, living under definite relations, can alone produce their material life and what is connected with it, are thus the conditions of their self-activity and are produced by this self-activity.1 The definite condition under which they produce, thus corresponds, as long as the contradiction has not yet appeared, to the reality of their condi¬tioned nature, their one-sided existence, the one-sidedness of which only becomes evident when the contradiction enters on the scene and thus exists for the later individuals. Then this condition appears as an accidental fetter, and the consciousness that it is a fetter is imputed to the earlier age as well.

     These various conditions, which appear first as conditions of self-activity, later as fetters upon it, form in the whole evolution of history a coherent series of forms of intercourse, the coherence of which consists in this: in the place of an earlier form of inter¬course, which has become a fetter, a new one is put, corresponding to the more developed productive forces and, hence, to the advanced mode of the self-activity of individuals-a form which in its turn becomes a fetter and is then replaced by another. Since these conditions correspond at every stage to the simultaneous development of the productive forces, their history is at the same time the history of the evolving productive forces taken over by each new generation, and is, therefore, the history of the development of the forces of the individuals themselves.

     Since this evolution takes place naturally, i.e., is not subordinated to a general plan of freely combined individuals, it proceeds from various localities, tribes, nations, branches of labour, etc., each of which to start with develops independently of the others and only gradually enters into relation with the others. Furthermore, it takes place only very slowly; the various stages and interests are never completely overcome, but only subordinated to the prevailing interest and trail along beside the latter for centuries afterwards. It follows from this that within a nation itself the individuals, even apart from their pecuniary circumstances, have quite different developments, and that an earlier interest, the peculiar form of intercourse of which has already been ousted by that belonging to a later interest, remains for a long time afterwards in possession of a traditional power in the illusory community ( State, law), which has won an existence independent of the individuals; a power which in the last resort can only be broken by a revolution. This explains why, with reference to individual points which allow of a more general summing-up, consciousness can sometimes appear further advanced than the contemporary empirical relationships, so that in the struggles of a latter epoch one can refer to earlier theoreticians as authorities.

     On the other hand, in countries which, like North America begin in an already advanced historical epoch, the development proceeds very rapidly. Such countries have no other natural premises than the individuals, who settled there and were led to do so because the forms of intercourse of the old countries did not correspond to their wants. Thus they begin with the most advanced individuals of the old countries, and, therefore, with the correspondingly most advanced form of intercourse, before this form of intercourse has been able to establish itself in the old countries.2 This is the case with all colonies, insofar as they are not mere military or trading stations. Carthage, the Greek colonies, and Iceland in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, provide examples of this. A similar relationship issues from conquest, when a form of intercourse which has evolved on another soil is brought over complete to the conquered country: whereas in its home it was still encumbered with interests and relationships left over from earlier periods, here it can and must be established completely and without hindrance, if only to assure the conquerors' lasting power. (England and Naples after the Norman conquest, when they received the most perfect form of feudal organisation.)

     Nothing is more common than the notion that in history up till now it has only been a question of taking. The barbarians take the Roman Empire, and this fact of taking is made to explain the transition from the old world to the feudal system. In this taking by barbarians, however, the question is, whether the nation which is conquered has evolved industrial productive forces, as is the case with modern peoples, or whether their productive forces are based for the most part merely on their association and on the community. Taking is further determined by the object taken. A banker's fortune, consisting of paper, cannot be taken at all, without the taker's submitting to the conditions of production and intercourse of the country taken. Similarly the total industrial capital of a modern industrial country, and finally, everywhere there is very soon an end to taking, and when there is nothing more to take, you have to set about producing. From this necessity of producing, which very soon asserts itself, it follows that the form of community adopted by the settling conquerors must correspond to the stage of development of the productive forces they find in existence; or, if this is not the case from the start, it must change according to the productive forces. By this, too, is explained the fact, which people profess to have noticed everywhere in the period following the migration of the peoples, namely, that the servant was master, and that the conquerors very soon took over language, culture and manners from the conquered. The feudal system was by no means brought complete from Germany, but had its origin, as far as the conquerors were concerned, in the martial organisation of the army during the actual conquest, and this only evolved after the conquest into the feudal system proper through the action of the productive forces found in the conquered countries. To what an extent this form was determined by the productive forces is shown by the abortive attempts to realise other forms derived from reminiscences of ancient Rome (Charlemagne, etc.).

     Thus all collisions in history have their origin, according to our view, in the contradiction between the productive forces and the form of intercourse. Incidentally, to lead to collisions in a country, this contradiction need not necessarily have reached its extremelimit in this particular country. The competition with industrially more advanced countries, brought about by the expansion of international intercourse, is sufficient to produce a similar contradiction in countries with a backward industry (e.g., the latent proletariat in Germany brought into view by the competition of English indus¬try) .

     This contradiction between the productive forces and the form of intercourse, which, as we saw, has occurred several times in past history, without, however, endangering the basis, necessarily on each occasion burst out in a revolution, taking on at the same time various subsidiary forms, such as all-embracing collisions, collisions of various classes, contradiction of consciousness, battle of ideas, etc., political conflict, etc. From a narrow point of view one may isolate one of these subsidiary forms and consider it as the basis of these revolutions; and this is all the more easy as the individuals who started the revolutions had illusions about their own activity according to their degree of culture and the stage of historical development.

     The transformation, through the division of labour, of personal powers (relationships ) into material powers, cannot be dispelled by dismissing the general idea of it from one's mind, but can only be abolished by the individuals again subjecting these material powers to themselves and abolishing the division of labour.3 This is not possible without the community. Only in community [with others has each] individual the means of cultivating his gifts in all directions; only in the community, therefore, is personal freedom possible. In the previous substitutes for the community, in the State, etc., personal freedom has existed only for the individuals who developed within the relationships of the ruling class, and only insofar as they were individuals of this class. The illusory community, in which individuals have up till now combined, always took on an independent existence in relation to them, and was at the same time, since it was the combination of one class over against another, not only a completely illusory community, but a new fetter as well. In the real community the individuals obtain their freedom in and through their association.

     It follows from all we have been saying up till now that the communal relationship into which the individuals of a class entered, and which was determined by their common interests over against a third party, was always a community to which these individuals belonged only as average individuals, only insofar as they lived within the conditions of existence of their class-a relationship in which they participated not as individuals but as members of a class. With the community of revolutionary proletarians, on the other hand, who take their conditions of existence and those of all members of society under their control, it is just the reverse; it is as individuals that the individuals participate in it. It is just this combination of individuals (assuming the advanced stage of modern productive forces, of course) which puts the conditions of the free development and movement of individuals under their control conditions which were previously abandoned to chance and had won an independent existence over against the separate individuals just because of their separation as individuals, and because of the necessity of their combination which had been determined by the division of labour, and through their separation had become a bond alien to them. Combination up till now (by no means an arbitrary one, such as is expounded for example in the Contrat social, but a necessary one) was an agreement upon these conditions, within which the individuals were free to enjoy the freaks of fortune (compare, e.g., the formation of the North American State and the South American republics). This right to the undisturbed enjoyment, within certain conditions, of fortuity and chance has up till now been called personal freedom. These conditions of existence are, of course, only the productive forces and forms of intercourse at any particular time.

     If from a philosophical point of view one considers this evolution of individuals in the common conditions of existence of estates and classes, which followed on one another, and in the accompanying general conceptions forced upon them, it is certainly very easy to imagine that in these individuals the species, or ""Man,"" has evolved, or that they evolved ""Man""-and in this way one can give history some hard clouts on the ear.4 One can conceive these various estates and classes to be specific terms of the general expression, subordinate varieties of the species, or evolutionary phases of  ""Man.""

     This subsuming of individuals under definite classes cannot be abolished until a class has taken shape, which has no longer any particular class interest to assert against the ruling class.

     Individuals have always built on themselves, but naturally on themselves within their given historical conditions and relationships, not on the ""pure"" individual in the sense of the ideologists. But in the course of historical evolution, and precisely through the inevitable fact that within the division of labour social relationships take on an independent existence, there appears a division within the life of each individual, insofar as it is personal and insofar as it is determined by some branch of labour and the conditions pertaining to it. (We do not mean it to be understood from this that, for example, the rentier, the capitalist, etc., cease to be persons; but their personality is conditioned and determined by quite definite class relationships, and the division appears only in their opposition to another class and, for themselves, only when they go bankrupt.) In the estate (and even more in the tribe) this is as yet concealed: for instance, a nobleman always remains a nobleman, a commoner always a commoner, apart from his other relationships, a quality inseparable from his individuality. The division between the personal and the class individual, the accidental nature of the conditions of life for the individual, appears only with the emergence of the class, which is itself a product of the bourgeoisie. This accidental character is only engendered and developed by competition and the struggle of individuals among themselves. Thus, in imagination, individuals seem freer under the dominance of the bourgeoisie than before, because their conditions of life seem accidental; in reality, of course, they are less free, because they are more subjected to the violence of things. The difference from the estate comes out particularly in the antagonism between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. When the estate of the urban burghers, the corporations, etc., emerged in opposition to the landed nobility, their condition of existence-movable property and craft labour, which had already existed latently before their separation from the feudal ties appeared as something positive, which was asserted against feudal landed property, and, therefore, in its own way at first took on a feudal form. Certainly the refugee serfs treated their previous servitude as something accidental to their personality. But here they only were doing what every class that is freeing itself from a fetter does; and they did not free themselves as a class but separately. Moreover, they did not rise above the system of estates, but only formed a new estate, retaining their previous mode of labour even in their new situation, and developing it further by freeing it from its earlier fetters, which no longer corresponded to the development already attained.5

     For the proletarians, on the other hand, the condition of their existence, labour, and with it all the conditions of existence governing modern society, have become something accidental, something over which they, as separate individuals, have no control, and over which no social organisation can give them control. The contradiction between the individuality of each separate proletarian and labour, the condition of life forced upon him, becomes evident to him himself, for he is sacrificed from youth upwards and, within his own class,)has no chance of arriving at the conditions which would place him in the other class.

     Thus, while the refugee serfs only wished to be free to develop and assert those conditions of existence which were already there, and hence, in the end, only arrived at free labour, the proletarians, if they are to assert themselves as individuals, will have to abolish the very condition of their existence hitherto (which has, moreover, been that of all society up to the present) , namely, labour. Thus they find themselves directly opposed to the form in which, hith¬erto, the individuals, of which society consists, have given themselves collective expression, that is, the State. In order, therefore, to assert themselves as individuals, they must overthrow the State.

I am indebted to Thomas Ferguson for bringing the crossed-out material to my attention.

1. Particularly.

2. Marx refers here to the Young Hegelian Bruno Bauer, who had published in Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung two long reviews dealing with books, articles and pamphlets on the Jewish question. Most of the quoted phrases are taken from these reviews in Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, vol.1, December, 1843; vol. 4, March, 1844. The expressions ""utopian phrase"" and ""compact mass"" can be found in Bauer's article ""Was ist jetzt der Gegenstand del' Kritik?"" published in Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, vol. 8, July, 1844. Allgemeine Literatuf-Zeitung (General Literary Gazette), a German monthly, was published by Bauer in Charlottenburg from December, 1843,to October, 1844.

3. Passages enclosed in brackets were crossed out by Marx in his manuscript.

It included Marx's Notes on the Latest Prussian Instruction to Censors and Luther-the Arbiter Between Strauss and Feuerbach, and articles by Bruno Bauer, Ludwig Feuerbach, Friedrich Koppen, Arnold Ruge, etc.

9. Marx has in mind Hauer and his followers, who were associated with the
Allgemeine Lite,atur-Zeitung.

1. ""Moment"" is a technical term in Hegelian philosophy meaning a vital element of thought. The term is used to stress that thought is a process, and thus that elements in a system of thought are also phases in a movement.

2. In Hegel, ""feeling"" (Empfindung) denotes a relatively low form of mental life in which the subjective and the objective are still confused together ""Consciousness"" (Bewusstein)-the name given by Hegel to the first major section of his Phenomenology of Mind-denotes those forms of mental activity where a subject first seeks to comprehend an object. ""Self-consciousness"" and ""mind"" denote subsequent, higher phases in the evolution of ""absolute knowledge"" or ""the absolute.""

6. At this point the first manuscript breaks off unfinished.

7. Prostitution is only a specific expression of the general prostitution of the labourer, and since it is a relationship in which falls not the prostitute alone, but also the one who prostitutes-and the latter's abomination is still greater-the capitalist, etc., also comes under this head. [Marx]

8. For this reason it is just as highly priced as the determinations of human essence and activities. [Marx]

5. In the manuscript the lower left corner of the page is torn off. Just the right-hand endings of the last six lines remain, making restorations of the text impossible. It is possible to surmise, however, that Marx here criticizes Hegel's idealistic ""transcending"" of estrangement ( the words that have survived are cited in the next footnote ) .

6. In ""transcending"" estrangement ""in the old German manner-the manner of the Hegelian phenomenology,"" i.e., in transcending it exclusively in the ""consciousness"" of the subject.

Wandering I am lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover

And I merely survive because of my pride
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
Lovers left me and I don't know the reason why
Well, I guess I'll have to cry
Many rivers to cross
But just where to begin, I'm playing for time
There been times when I find myself
Thinking of committing some dreadful crime

That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm ok
But that's not what gets me
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do
It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder, getting up, getting dressed, living with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm ok
But that's not what gets me
What hurts the most

375,Cleaning This Gun (Come On In Boy),"SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE OF MONELL POLICY AND PRACTICE OF TORTURE AND COVER-UP, AND OF DEFENDANTS MARTIN’S, SHINES’, NEEDHAM’S AND HILLARD’S INVOLVEMENT [REDACTED]

1. Mayor Richard M. Daley was the States’ Attorney of Cook County from 1981 through 1988, and he has served as Mayor of the City of Chicago from 1989 to the present.

2. On or about February 25, 1982, Police Superintendent Richard Brzeczek informed States Attorney Richard M. Daley by letter of the allegations made by Dr. John Raba, that Andrew Wilson had been beaten and electric shocked by Chicago Police detectives at Area 2 on February 14, 1982. 2/25/82 Brzeczek Letter to Daley; Brzeczek Affidavit.

3. Brzeczek further informed Daley that he would not initiate a criminal investigation into the allegations that Wilson was tortured unless Daley authorized such an investigation. Id.

4. Daley never authorized a criminal investigation, and the Chicago Police Department therefore did not initiate a criminal investigation into Wilson’s allegations, and on May 19, 1983, Daley honored Burge and four other Area 2 detectives for their work in the Wilson case” Brzeczek Dep., Wilson v. City of Chicago, pp 123-24; Brzeczek Affidavit; Chicago Tribune, 5/20/83, “Daley Hails 11 in Crime War.”

5. The Chicago Police Department never investigated numerous allegations of police torture and abuse which arose from the manhunt to find and arrest Andrew Wilson and which were lodged with its IAD and OPS in February of 1982. Wilson v. City of Chicago, 6 F3d 1230 (7th Cir. 1993).

6. On November 12, 1982, Andrew Wilson testified at his motion to suppress hearing that he was tortured by Jon Burge, John Yucaitis, and other Area 2 detectives by electric shock, bagging, beating and burning on a radiator. People v. Wilson. 2

7. In their Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of the City of Chicago and Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin, judicially admitted that: At the hearing, Andrew Wilson will testify that on February 14, 1982, he was arrested at an apartment by several officers, including respondents Burge and Yucaitis. As Wilson was being taken to the car to be transported to Area II, he heard Burge telling the transporting officers not to “mess with” Wilson and that they would deal with him when they arrived at the station. Wilson was then taken to Area II by Yucaitis and three other officers. Transcript of Testimony of Andrew Wilson, July 7, 10, 11, 1989, at 2914-31 When they arrived at Area II, Wilson was taken to a room where the four transporting officers, including Yucaitis, and other officers started beating him. They hit him, kicked him, knocked him down and slammed him into a window so hard that it broke. In addition, one of the officers grabbed a plastic garbage bag and put it over Wilson’s head, holding it around his neck so that he could not breathe. The officers took the bag off when Wilson bit a hole in it. The officers stopped beating Wilson when Burge entered the room and stated that if it had been him, he would not have left any marks on Wilson. Tr. at 2932-36 Wilson was taken to a second room and handcuffed to the wall. Yucaitis then took Wilson to a telephone and told him to call his brother. When Wilson replied that he did not want to talk but wanted a lawyer, he was taken back to the second room again handcuffed to the wall. Tr. At 2937-44. Burge entered the room and told Wilson he was going to make a statement because Burge’s reputation was at stake. Burge left the room and Yucaitis came in with a brown paper bag. Yucaitis opened the bag and took out a black box about 12-14 inches long, 8-9 inches wide and 6 ½-7 inches high. The box had a crank and two wires with clamps. Yucaitis squatted down in front of Wilson with the box between his own legs, and put one clamp in Wilson’s nose and one on Wilson’s ears, and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson’s teeth to grind and was so painful that he kicked Yucaitis. Yucaitis punched him in the mouth and cranked the box again. Yucaitis left the room and then returned, put the black box in the bag, and left again. Tr. at 2947-55. Respondent O’Hara then came in and took Wilson to see the Assistant State’s Attorney, Lawrence Hyman. According to Wilson’s testimony, with O’Hara present, Wilson asked Hyman, “You want me to make a statement after they’ve been torturing me?” O’Hara took Wilson back to the second room. Tr. at 2956-59. Burge later returned to the second room with the brown paper bag and said, “Fun time.” Burge put a pair of handcuffs on Wilson’s other arm and another pair on Wilson’s 3 ankles. He then placed the bag in the garbage can and left. He returned, took out the black box, put the clamps on Wilson’s ears and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson’s to grind his teeth and knocked Wilson out of his chair. Wilson kept rubbing the clips from the electrical device off his ears. Tr at 2961-63. Wilson was then handcuffed across the radiator, kneeling with his arms outstretched. Burge and another officer put the clamps on Wilson’s little fingers and cranked the box repeatedly this time for longer periods. As he was being shocked, Wilson’s chest, leg and face were forced against the radiator and he was burned. Tr. at 2963-66 When Burge stopped cranking and took the clamps off Wilson’s little fingers, he took another shocking device out of the bag. It plugged into an electrical outlet and had a cord sticking out of it. Burge placed the device very near Wilson’s skin so that he could feel it tingling. Burge then jabbed the second device into Wilson’s back and Wilson got a full jolt, slamming Wilson into the grill on the window. Wilson began spitting out blood. Burge and the other officer put the devices back in the bag and left. Tr. at 296-68. A while later, Wilson was taken to Area I headquarters for a lineup. At Area I, Burge stuck his gun in Wilson’s mouth and cocked it back and forth. When Wilson arrived back at Area II after the lineup, Burge told him that if he did not make a statement, he would shock him again. Later, Burge told Wilson he was going to “fry his black ass.” Tr. at 2969-75. Memorandum In Opposition, pp.4-6.

Jones testified that he kept hollering and telling Burge that he wasn’t supposed to do this to him, that Burge said to him that he had no proof, that Burge asked detective Flood, who was present for the shocking, if he saw anything and Flood looked at the ceiling and said no. Jones further stated that Burge said, “[n]o court and no State are going to take your word against a Lieutenant’s word,” and Burge later hit him in the head with a stapler. People v. Jones, 8/5/82, pp. 65-71, 74.

12. Melvin Jones further testified that on February 6, 1982, while he was still being detained in an Area 2 interview room, Defendant McWeeny entered the room with another detective and questioned Jones, after which Lieutenant Burge entered the room and asked McWeeny if Jones had started talking yet. Jones further stated that when McWeeny said Jones hadn’t said anything yet, Burge pulled out a gun and cocked it, put it up to Jones’ head and said
he was going to “blow Jones’ black head off.” Id. pp. 76-79.

13. Melvin Jones testified on February 19, 1992 on behalf of the City at the Chicago Police Board Hearing, that McWeeny told Burge to get out of the room and McWeeny stated to him later that evening that he [McWeeny] “had got the Lieutenant off me for right now. He said, if you are going to talk, you know, it would be easier for me.” Id. at 79; Chicago Police Board, 2/19/92, p. 856.

14. Cassandra Watson, Melvin Jones’ attorney in 1982, testified at the Chicago Police 5 Board Hearings on 2/19/92 that Jones told her within the first 10 days of February, 1982 that he had been beaten and threatened at Area 2, that while he was in an interview room at Area 2 a gun had been placed to his head, and that Lieutenant Burge had electrically shocked him with an electrical shock box.

When he failed to give information implicating himself in the murder, respondent Burge entered the room and told Jones that he was going to talk. Burge then asked Jones if he had ever heard of him, and when Jones replied that he had not, Burge told him that before he left the station Jones would “wish he had never set eyes on him.” Burge left the interrogation room but returned after Jones persisted in his refusal to talk to the interrogating detectives. Burge had Jones cuffed to a second ring and then produced and plugged into the wall socket a wooden box measuring approximately 10"" x 6"" x 6"", with tweezers and a long nail type device. He again asked Jones if he was going to talk. When Jones again refused, Burge pulled down Jones’ pants and shorts and, using
the electrical device, shocked Jones three times, on the foot, thigh, and penis. While he was shocking Jones, Burge demanded that Jones talk. He told Jones that he had also shocked “Satan” (Anthony Holmes) and “Cochise,” forcing them to crawl all over the floor. He also told Jones that nobody would believe his word against a lieutenant’s. Burge asked another Area II detective present in the room if he had seen anything, and the detective looked at the ceiling and said no. Burge also tied a sock in Jones’ mouth. Burge was interrupted in his interrogation of Jones, apparently by the news that a policeman had been shot and killed on a bus in his area. Later, Burge also struck Jones with a stapler. When Jones continued to deny knowing anything about the murder, Burge again entered the interrogation room. He pointed a gun at Jones’ head, cocked it and told Jones he was going to “blow his black head off.” 6

took my officer’s life.” Police Board Proceedings, 11/30/89, pp. 19-25.

85. At the Chicago City Council Hearings held in December 24, 1990, counsel for Andrew Wilson tendered the Committee and its counsel, a 21 page document entitled “Fact Sheet: Evidence of Police Torture By Commander Jon Burge and His Men.”

86. The “Fact Sheet: Evidence of Police Torture By Commander Jon Burge and His
Men” which was tendered by counsel for Andrew Wilson to the Committee and its counsel at the Chicago City Council Hearings held on December 24, 1990, listed more than thirty victims of alleged torture at Area 2, including Aaron Patterson, Madison Hobley, Stanley Howard, and Leroy Orange.

87. At the Christmas Eve hearing, evidence that SA Daley refused to investigate when requested to do so by Superintendent Brzeczek. was presented, and Daley responded publicly, with his office stating that “Andrew Wilson refused to testify before the grand jury about the 19 allegations.” Chicago Tribune, 12/25/90, “Hearing Examines Brutality Charges;” Chicago Sun Times, 12/25/90, “Davis Urges New Review of Police Brutality Cases.”

88. The “Fact Sheet: Evidence of Police Torture By Commander Jon Burge and His
Men” which listed more than thirty victims of alleged torture at Area 2, including Aaron Patterson, Madison Hobley, Stanley Howard, and Leroy Orange, was tendered by counsel for Andrew Wilson to Superintendent Leroy Martin on or about December 19, 1990.

89. In a letter dated January 9, 1991, OPS Director Gayle Shines wrote to counsel for Andrew Wilson that “Superintendent Martin has referred to me your letter of 19 December and the attached Fact Sheet.”

90. The City Council or its Finance committee never issued a report or took any other action after the December 24th torture hearings.

91. On January 28, 1991, Amnesty International issued a Report calling for “a full inquiry into allegations that Chicago police systematically tortured criminal suspects from 1972 to 1984,” and in response, the spokesman for Mayor Daley said she had “‘no comment whatsoever.’” Chicago Sun Times, 1/28/91, “Police Torture Probe Sought Here.”

92. On or about November 2, 1990 OPS Director Gayle Shines approved as
“compelling” and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 25 page Report and findings made by OPS investigator Michael Goldston concerning allegations of torture and abuse at Area 2. This Report included the following findings:
As to the matter of alleged physical abuse, the preponderance of the evidence is that abuse did occur and that it was systematic. The time span involved covers more than ten years. The type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture. The evidence presented by some individuals convinced juries and appellate courts that personnel assigned to Area 2 engaged in methodical abuse. 20 The number of incidents in which an Area 2 command member is identified as an accused can lead to only one conclusion. Particular command members were aware of the systematic abuse and participated in it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end. This conclusion is also supported by the number of incidents in which Area 2 offices are named as the location of the abuse.
OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings, and Cover Letter, Shines to Martin, dated November 2, 1990 (Goldston Report).

93. In her forwarding memo of November 2, 1990, OPS Director Shines, while
approving the conclusions of Goldston and Sanders, further informed Superintendent Martin that they both did “a masterful job of marshaling the facts in this intensive and extensive project and their conclusions are compelling.” 11/2/90 Cover Memo, Shines to Martin, with OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings enclosed.

94. On or about November 2, 1990, OPS Director Gayle Shines approved “as
compelling” and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 66 page report and conclusions of OPS investigator Francine Sanders which found that based on “the overwhelming body of evidence which supports the allegations” that administrative charges of excessive force should be sustained against Jon Burge and John Yucaitis including that they “repeatedly administered electrical stimulation to Mr [Andrew] Wilson’s body in order to create pain” and that Burge “held Mr. Wilson, while handcuffed, against a hot radiator causing burns to Mr. Wilson’s face, chest and thigh.” Chicago Police Office of Professional Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), pp.62-66.

95. Martin acknowledged the “ serious nature” of Goldston’s conclusions Martin memo to Shines, 11/18/90.

96. At no time from receiving the Goldston Report in November of 1990 until he left 21 office in April of 1992, did Martin, OPS Director Shines, or any other City policymaking official take any steps to further investigate the allegations made by the some fifty victims listed in the Goldston report.

97. Instead, Martin, after waiting three months, wrote Shines seeking “further
clarification” concerning the Goldston and Sanders Reports. Memo, Martin to Shines, 2/6/91.

98. Despite all of the torture evidence contained in the Goldston and Sanders Reports, in the Fact Sheet, and that was previously presented to Martin and the City Council, the City and Martin did not seek the prosecution of Burge and his confederates in the Wilson case, for a continuing conspiracy on the basis of the numerous other torture cases listed in the Goldston report, or to prosecute Burge for the numerous other cases which were documented in the
evidence presented, including the Patterson and Madison Hobley cases.

99. In her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Martin, Shines supplied the “clarifications” sought by Martin, and informed him that the OPS findings “reflect the unprecedented comprehensiveness of this investigation.” Shines memo, 4/30/91.

100. With her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Superintendent Martin, OPS Director
Shines included investigator Goldston’s clarification memo, in which Goldston set forth that his investigation established that Area 2 detectives and supervisors Jon Burge, John Byrne, Peter Dignan, Charles Grunhard, John Yucaitis, Thomas McKenna, and Patrick O’Hara were “players”
whose names “repeatedly appeared as connected to allegations of abuse.” Goldston Memo of 4/30/91, attached to Shines Memo to Martin of the same date.

101. After waiting an additional seven months, in November of 1991, Superintendent Leroy Martin approved the findings set forth in the Chicago Police Office of Professional 22 Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, dated October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), Burge and Yucaitis were administratively charged by the CPD for abusing Andrew Wilson in the manner found in the Report, and separation proceedings were initiated before the
Chicago Police Board. Cr 123543 (reopened).

102. However, after secret communications with Corporation Counsel Kelly Welch, which the City still refuses to produce, Martin refused to accept or adopt the Goldston findings, open any additional criminal or administrative investigations into the numerous allegations of Area 2 torture, to commission additional investigation into the alleged systemic pattern and practice of torture, or to discipline or seek criminal charges against any of the named officers, but rather contacted the Police Foundation in order to have them evaluate the methodology used by Goldston in arriving at his findings. Martin Letter to Williams, 11/8/91; City Privilege Log.

103. During this time period, community groups, including Citizen’s Alert, by letters and in face to face meetings, were demanding that Martin release the results of the OPS investigation into torture at Area 2. Powers Letter to Martin, 8/14/91.

104. Instead, Martin, through his lawyers at the Corporation Counsel’s Office, fought production and public release of the Goldston Report and its findings. See, generally, proceedings in Fallon v. Dillon, 90 C 6722.

105. In November of 1991, after Defendant Martin and Corporation Counsel Kelly
Welsh had initiated proceedings before the Police Board to fire Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara for torturing Andrew Wilson, Mayor Daley “defended his decision not to take action against the officers when he was state’s attorney in 1982, explaining that . . [Wilson] refused to cooperate with his office at that time.” Chicago Tribune, 11/26/91 “3 Cops Face Hearing in Torture Case.” 23

106. On or about February 7, 1992, the Goldston and Sanders were publicly released, over the City’s strenuous objection, pursuant to the order of Judge Milton Shadur in the case of Fallon v. Dillon, #90-C-6722.

107. In an article which appeared in the February 8, 1992 Chicago Tribune,
Superintendent Leroy Martin, whgo was one of the previous Area 2 Commanders, was quoted as saying that it was an “outright lie” that Area 2 commanders knew about or condoned torture. Chicago Tribune, “13 Years of Cop Torture Alleged,” February 8, 1992.

108. In the same article, Mayor Richard M. Daley was quoted as saying of the Report, “these are only allegations . . . not substantiated cases,” as defending Martin’s suppression of the report, stating: “it’s allegations, rumors, stories, things like that” and of denying that the torture
at Area 2 was “systematic.” Chicago Tribune, 2/8/92, “13 Years of Cop Torture Alleged;” Los Angeles Times, 2/8/92, “Chicago Police Used Torture Report Says,”

109. In their Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning
Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Police Board in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, made the following judicial admission concerning the testimony of “seven additional victims of torture tactics at Area II
headquarters:” The testimony regarding similar acts sets forth detailed accounts of tortuous treatment that are almost identical to the torture suffered by Andrew Wilson. The testimony reveals an astounding pattern or plan on the part of respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara] to torture certain suspects, often with substantial criminal records, into confessing to crimes
or to condone such activity. 24 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, p. 1.

110. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, identified the “seven
additional victims of torture tactics at Area II headquarters” as Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes,
George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree. Id., pp. 7-
14.
111. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission - - - that the similar acts
testimony of Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin,
Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree
[I]s highly probative of the modus operandi used or condoned in the torturing of suspects
to elicit statements. Respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara’s] methods of torture
through electric shock, bagging, and holding a gun to a suspect’s head are more that
sufficiently unique to establish a modus operandi for 404 b purposes. In addition, the
testimony establishes a pattern of and plan to torture these suspects in these similar ways
to elicit confessions to violent crimes.
Id. p. 17.
112. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin
Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and
Lawrence Poree:
clearly establishes respondents’ [Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara’s] motive and intent in
torturing or condoning the torture of Wilson. Respondents generally engaged in these
similar practices in order to coerce a confession to a serious crime.
Id. p. 22. 25
113. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin
Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and
Lawrence Poree:
shows the physical existence of one or more electric shock devices at Area II, prior to
and subsequent to Wilson’s arrest, and Burge’s possession of and familiarity with the use
of the devices. It is also admissible to show knowledge of that technique and of the
bagging technique, about which respondents deny knowing, and the technique of putting
a gun to the head of a victim.
Id., p. 24.
114. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission:
There is no question that the similarities between [Andrew] Wilson’s testimony
and the similar victims’ testimony is more than sufficient to meet the 404 b standard.
Burge was the main perpetrator of the torture in almost all of the cases, and, when he was
not the principal, he was still involved. In the case of all but one of the victims, the
victim was picked up and taken to Area II where he was then interrogated regarding his
knowledge or involvement in a serious offense. Although Donald White was taken
instead to Area I, he was taken there and interrogated by Area II detectives. All of the
victims were black and generally had significant criminal histories.
Also similar was the way in which several victims were threatened with
consequences if they refused to make a statement. After an initial refusal, the
punishment would begin and then would become stronger and more painful as the
refusals to speak persisted. The most striking similarities, however, are found in the
methods of torture used on the suspects. Wilson was electro shocked by Yucaitis using
the black box and by Burge who used the black box and a curling-iron looking device,
was “bagged” and beaten, and was threatened with a gun placed in his mouth. Jones,
Holmes, Poree, Powell and Orange were similarly electro shocked by Burge. Holmes,
Powell, White and Mumin were all “bagged” and beaten to the point where they lost or
almost lost consciousness. Burge pointed a cocked gun at Jones’s head, hit Poree in the
head with a pistol, and placed a revolver containing one bullet at Mumin’s head and
snapped it three times slowly. White had a gun placed in his mouth. Additionally, each
of the victims was slapped around and punched.
Burge’s statements to the victims were also very similar. Burge told both Jones
and Mumin that nobody would ever believe their word against his. As he did in relation
to Wilson, he referred to the absence of marks on Mumin’s body. He said “fun time” as 26
he approached Wilson and Poree with the black box, and laughed when he bagged
Mumin. He told Wilson he would “fry his black ass” and Jones he would “blow his
black head off.”
As the case law cited above aptly demonstrates, these actions or the condoning of
these actions are overwhelming in their similarity.
Id., pp. 25-26.
115. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, made the
following judicial admission:
Given the similarities between the serious offenses charged and the offenses to which the
similar victims will testify, there is no question that the offenses are close enough in time
to be relevant to this case. Tak[ing] the offenses in sequence, they reveal a pattern of
almost identical acts of torture directed towards persons suspected of violent crimes.
While the sequence spans twelve years, each offense is close enough to the next to
connect it to the relevant pattern of behavior. Moreover, Melvin Jones’ and Donald
White’s testimony will demonstrate that they were tortured just days before Andrew
Wilson was tortured.
Id., p. 28.
116. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted:
Indeed, as the testimony of the similar victims shows, respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and
O’Hara] counted on the fact that their testimony would be believed over that of a convict
when they persisted in their pattern of torture.
Id., p. 28.
117. In a document filed in the case of Wilson v. City of Chicago, Jon Burge, Patrick
O’Hara and John Yucaitis, 86-C-2360, entitled “City of Chicago’s Memorandum in Response
To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers,
made the following judicial admission:
Plaintiff Andrew Wilson has testified that he was beaten, kicked, punched, burned by
being harnessed to a radiator, and repeatedly electro shocked on his hands, face, ears, and 27
between his legs by defendant police officers. Plaintiff now seeks summary judgment that
this outrageous conduct, unsanctioned and condemned by the City, and for which
defendant officers were fired and/or disciplined, was within the defendants’ scope of
employment.
City Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 1.
118. In a document filed in the case of Wilson v. City of Chicago, 86-C-2360, entitled
“City of Chicago’s Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for
Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers, made the following judicial admission:
The instrumentalities by which defendants tortured plaintiff also illustrate that defendant
officers were not in the scope of their employment. Plaintiff has failed to furnish any
evidence to suggest that the instruments used by the officers to shock him - - -the black
box device and the modified curling iron - - were furnished by the City.
Id., p. 17.
119. In its Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for
Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers, made the judicial admission that
Burge “cruelly torture[d]” Andrew Wilson and “denie[d] him necessary medical
assistance.”
Id., p. 19.
120. In this Memorandum, the City, through its lawyers, made the following admission
concerning it change of position from defending Burge for his alleged torture of Andrew Wilson
to asserting that said torture was so outrageous as to be outside the scope of Burge’s
employment: “The change in the City’s position was the result of inquiries undertaken by the
City in good faith and in the public interest.” Id. p. 12.
121. On July 30, 1992, almost two years after Superintendent Martin had first received
the Goldston findings, the Police Foundation submitted its report to Superintendent of Police
Matt Rodriguez. After noting that because “hangings, shockings, ‘baggings’ beatings, chokings,
and beatings were alleged to occur, many in the Area 2 Headquarters itself, a thorough and
rigorous investigation seemed required,” and that it passed no judgment as to whether the torture
alleged had in fact took place, the Report criticized Goldston’s methodology. Police Foundation 28
Report, “An Analysis of the Methods Employed in the Preparation of the Goldston Report,”
7/30/92.
122. The Police Foundation recommended, inter alia, that the Chicago Police
Department investigate or re-investigate cases of serious misconduct listed in the Goldston
Report, create a database concerning these investigations, rigorously and uniformly investigate
them, and create a monitoring system to identify patterns of serious police misconduct. Id.
123. Almost three years after first receiving the Goldston Report, OPS Director Shines
reopened the Cannon, Howard, Adkins, Craft, Holmes, White and Michael Johnson cases and
assigned OPS investigators to them. Numerous other serious Area 2 torture cases, including
those of Plaintiff, Leroy Orange, Melvin Jones, Anthony Homes, George Powell, and Madison
Hobley, were not opened or reopened. Shines’ Dep. in Santiago v. Marquez; CRs of named
Victims.
124. Leroy Orange testified on May 22,1985, at his trial that on January 12, 1984 he
was taken to Area 2 and interrogated. During this interrogation, he was handcuffed behind his
back to a circle in the wall, a plastic bag was put over his head, and when the bag was put over
his head a second time he was punched in the stomach. People v. Orange, 5/22/85, pp. 1112-14.
125. Leroy Orange further testified that he was shocked on the arm with an electrical
device, and that an officer stuck his hands between his legs and squeezed his testicles. Id. at
1114; Affidavits of Leroy Orange.
126. Leroy Orange averred in ¶¶ 11-13 of an affidavit that he was interviewed in the
summer of 1990 by a male OPS investigator at Pontiac Correctional Center, and after reviewing
a stack of photographs, he identified Jon Burge as one of the detectives involved in his torture. 29
127. OPS Investigator Michael Goldston listed Orange as a victim tortured by Burge in
his 1990 OPS report. Goldston Report.
128. Detectives McWeeny and Madigan testified at Orange’s trial that they were
partners and they arrested Orange on January 12, 1984, and they transported him to Area 2
Headquarters where they locked him in an interview room, and the next day they conducted lineups with him. People v. Orange, pp. 615-17, 624,1232-34.
129. Leroy Orange stated at his bond hearing on January 14, 1984 that he had pin marks
on his butt, that was the only visible bruise he had to show, and that “other things happened.”
People v. Orange, Kidd, 1/14/84, p. 3.
130. Orange’s co-defendant, Leonard Kidd, also stated at the January 14th bond hearing
that he was hurting between his legs where the police jumped on him, and his lawyer also noted
on the record that Kidd was limping and that he came in injured. Id.
131. On February 9, 1984, Orange’s attorney told a reporter for the Chicago Sun Times
that officers administered electrical shocks to Orange’s buttocks and anus with a “black box.”
“Cop ‘black box’ torture charged,” Chicago Sun Times, 2/9/84.
132. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Chicago Superintendent Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that:
In January of 1984, Leroy Orange was taken to Area II where he was interrogated and
tortured while Burge was in the room. Orange was shocked and jolted repeatedly with a
black box plugged into the wall. Orange’s pants were pulled down while electroshock
was applied to his body, including his buttocks. He was then asked if he was ready to
make a statement, and he replied that he was. Orange reported this torture to his
attorney, Earl Washington, who reported it to the media..
Memorandum In Opposition, January 22, 1992, p. 13.
133. In February of 1984, the OPS registered a complaint, number 136454, alleging that 30
Jon Burge and others who allegedly tortured Leroy Orange on January 12 and 13, 1984.
134. The OPS entered a not sustained finding on these allegations without ever taking a
statement from Orange, Burge or any other Area 2 detective or supervisor.
135. The Chicago Police Department has since destroyed the OPS file in complaint
number 136454.
136. On or about September 24, 1979, the OPS registered complaint number 108817
alleging that George Powell was beaten and suffocated with a bag while being questioned at
Area 2, the OPS entered a not sustained finding on these allegations without ever taking a
statement from Powell, Burge, or any other Area 2 detective or supervisor, and the Chicago
Police Department has since destroyed the OPS file in complaint number 108817.
137. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago
lawyers, on behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted
that:
On September 20, 1979, George Powell was arrested at his girlfriend’s house and
taken to Area II where he was handcuffed to a wall. Burge brought in a long object with a
cord, similar to a cattle prod, and said he was go to do to Powell what he had done to
“Satan.” Burge shocked Powell on his stomach and chest, such that Powell almost passed
out. Also, while slapping ans questioning Powell, Burge put a bag over Powell’s head
and Powell had to bite a hole in it in order to breathe. Powell’s mother filed a complaint
with the office of Professional standards, who ultimately made a finding of not sustained.
Memorandum In Opposition, filed on January 22, 1992 in the Matter of Charges Filed against
Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick o’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, p. 9.
138. In a statement taken on June 14, 2004, George Powell stated that he was electric
shocked, suffocated with a plastic bag, and beaten by Jon Burge and other Area 2 detectives
during his interrogation in September of 1999. 31
139. On May 11, 1989, Andrew Wilson's lawyers in Wilson’s civil rights trial filed
""Plaintiff's Proffer of Other Acts of Beating, Torture and Electroshock By Defendant Burge and
Other Detectives."" and served it on the City through counsel.
140. “Plaintiff’s Proffer “listed 19 alleged victims of Burge, Sergeant Byrne, and their
fellow Area 2 detectives.
141. “Plaintiff’s Proffer” listed Anthony “Satan” Holmes, stating:
Anthony Holmes, nicknamed “Satan, ” was taken to Area II headquarters at
approximately 4:00 a.m. Jon Burge presided over his interrogation, during which, in an
effort to obtain a confession, plastic bags were put over his head, causing him to pass out
three separate times. Burge also applied the end of an electric shock device, housed in a
black box, to Holmes’ handcuffs, giving Holmes an intense shock, and causing him to
fall out of his chair and roll on the floor.
142. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted:
On May 30, 1973, at approximately 4:00 a.m., Anthony Holmes, whose street name is
“Satan,” was taken to Area II headquarters where he was held, interrogated and tortured
for approximately six hours. Respondent Burge presided over his interrogation, during
which, in an effort to obtain a confession, plastic bags were placed over Holmes’ head,
causing him to pass out three times. Burge also applied the end of an electric shock
device, housed in a black box, to Holmes’ handcuffs, giving Holmes an intense shock,
which caused him to fall out of his chair and roll on the floor. The shock was extremely
painful and caused Holmes to press his jaws together and grit his teeth.
Memorandum In Opposition filed on January 22, 1992, p. 9.
143. On April 19, 2004 Anthony Holmes gave a Court reported statement in which he
described the allegations made in Plaintiff’s Proffer in even greater detail.
144. Neither the OPS nor the CPD opened an investigation into Anthony Holmes’
allegations in response Plaintiff Wilson’s Proffer, in response to the City’s statements in their
January 22, 1992 Memorandum, or at any other time. 32
145. Plaintiff’s Proffer also listed Lawrence Poree, stating:
Lawrence Poree was interrogated on two occasions in 1973 by Burge and Hoke. The
first time they showed him a wooden box, with no top and a generator inside with two
wires. Burge said “this is what we got for niggers like you.” Later (that year) Burge and
Hoke put Poree, while handcuffed, on a table and hit him. They then pulled his pants
down and applied electric shock to his arm, testicles and under his armpits.
146. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that:
Lawrence Poree will testify that on two occasions in 1973, he was interrogated by
respondent Burge and another detective. The first time they showed him a wooden box
with no top, a generator inside, and two wires. Burge then said, “this is what we’ve got
for niggers like you.” Later in 1973, Burge and [detective] Hoke put Poree, while
handcuffed, on a table and hit him. They then pulled his pants down and applied
electroshock to his arm and armpits, and to his testicles.
On August 7, 1979, Poree was arrested and brought to Area II where he was
interrogated by Burge. Poree was handcuffed in the interrogation room, and the black
box was on the table. Burge came in and said, “fun time again.” Poree was handcuffed
to the wall and hit in the head with a pistol. Apparently referring to Anthony Holmes,
Burge said “You can ask your fat friend about the box.” Burge shocked Poree eight or
nine times on the arms, chest, forehead, and back, causing him to clench his teeth and
bite his tongue and his mouth to bleed.
(Memorandum In Opposition, January 22, 1992, pp. 13-14.
147. On April 19, 2004 Lawrence Poree gave a Court reported statement in which he
described the allegations which were made in Plaintiff’s Proffer in more detail.
148. Neither the OPS nor the CPD opened an investigation into Lawrence Poree’s
allegations either in response Plaintiff Wilson’s Proffer, in response to the January 22, 1992,
City Memorandum, or at any other time.
149. In U.S. ex. rel. Maxwell v. Gilmore, 1999 WL 130331 (N.D.Ill.) at *14; Judge
Shadur stated the following in his decision:
It is now common knowledge that in the early to mid-1980s Chicago Police Commander
Jon Burge and many officers working under him regularly engaged in the physical abuse 33
and torture of prisoners to extract confessions. Both internal police accounts and
numerous lawsuits and appeals brought by suspects alleging such abuse substantiate that
those beatings and other means of torture occurred as an established practice, not just on
an isolated basis.
150. At the May 13, 2003 oral argument in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in US
ex. rel. Leonard Hinton v. McArdory, Seventh Circuit Judge Diane Wood made the following statement
from the bench: “terrible things were happening in Area 2, things that should make us ashamed
of our police force and justice system.”
151. In Wilson v. City of Chicago, 120 F.3d 681, 683-85 (7th Cir. 1997), the Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals held that Defendant Burge acted within the scope of his employment
with the City “when he tortured Wilson,” stating:
Burge was not pursuing a frolic of his own. He was enforcing the criminal law of Illinois
overzealously by extracting confessions from criminal suspects by improper means. He
was, as it were, too loyal an employee. He was acting squarely within the scope of his
employment.
152. OPS investigator Veronica [Tillman] Messenger was assigned to investigate the reopened Darrel Cannon OPS complaint (CR #134723) in May, 1993. CR # 134723, TillmanMessenger Testimony, People v. Cannon.
153. Pursuant to that investigation, she located the site Cannon had previously
described as the location where he had been allegedly tortured. Id.
154. This location was under a viaduct at 12409 S. Torrence, and Tillman-Messenger
had photographs taken of the site. Id.
155. OPS Investigator [Tillman] Messenger finished her investigation in January of
1994, and entered sustained findings against all three accused officers, finding that:
a) Sergeant Byrne struck Cannon with a cattle prod on his testicles and penis and in
his mouth; 34
b) Sergeant Byrne repeatedly called Cannon a “nigger;”
c) Sergeant Byrne held a 9 mm handgun to Cannon’s head;
e) Sergeant Byrne attempted to lift Cannon by the handcuffs;

not sit down. Burge told Mumin that he wanted to know about the robbery, and Mumin
replied that he had no knowledge of what burge was talking about. Burge told Mumin
he would talk before Mumin left left there and tightened Mumin’s handcuffs. The
handcuffs were painful and cut off Mumin’s circulation. Burge then left the room.

lucky” that Burge didn’t kill him and that he wanted to know about the “fucking
robbery.”

typewriter cover. He said, “you’ll fucking talk or I’ll kill you,” and placed the cover
over his head. Burge held the cover over his head and pushed it down in his face so he
couldn’t breathe. Mumin, who was handcuffed behind his back, passed out. Burge put it
on his head three times. The third time, Mumin hollered and Burge took the cover off

he would do anything. Burge told Mumin that if he told anybody, nobody would believe
him because there were no marks on him and that he had better sign the statement.

212. White further testified that the detectives asked him questions about who killed

219. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago
lawyers, on behalf of Superintendent Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted:
On the evening of February 12, 1982, two days before Andrew Wilson’s arrest, Donald
White was picked up by police officers and taken to 11th and State. He was taken to a
room on the 5th floor by Hill, McKenna, Katalinic and respondent O’Hara, and they
began asking him who killed the police officers. They continued to ask him and White
repeatedly told them that he did not shoot the officers. Hill got mad and said “I am tired
of this fucking shit.” He took a black garbage bag and put it over White’s head and then
someone began beating him on his head. Although he could not see them with the bag
over his head, there had to have been at least four people hitting him. O’Hara was in
the room, as was Burge at various times. When White still stated that he did not shoot
the officers and did not know anything, they put the bag back over his head two more
times and beat him again. White almost lost consiousness. At one point, someone
stuck a gun in his mouth. White then said he would tell them anything they wanted to
know. Hill then asked him questions, and, when White didn’t have it right, Hill
pretended he was going to hit White.
White testified to these facts in a deposition taken in connection with Andrew
Wilson’s civil trial. White had not told anyone for five years that he had been abused
because he feared for his life at the hands of the police officers. When he finally agreed
to testify about the abuse he suffered, he did so only on the condition that
Wilson’s lawyers would move him out of Illinois. In addition, because he was
afraid and did not know who he could trust, he did not file an OPS complaint. His
mother, however, did file an OPS complaint in connection with his torture at the hands
of the police officers. OPS reached a finding of “not sustained.” 48

Two. It dominated the news. Mayor Jane Byrne offered a $50,000 reward and met with
Burge during the investigation. A now retired Area Two detective who took part in the
dragnet told the Reader that ""there were a million volunteers....Normally you'd have 15 to
20 violent crimes guys on duty. Now you've got not only them, you've got the property
crimes guys, the gang crimes guys. Detectives from Area One were there. The brass was
there because it was such a heater case....My partner and I worked 36 hours straight.
Burge had to send someone to his house to get clean socks and a shirt. He didn't go
home."" The detective said, ""It was a reign of terror. I don't know what Kristallnacht was
like, but this was probably close."" Complaints were widespread, with Jesse Jackson
saying that the community was living ""under military occupation.""

of torture at Area 2 and later at Area 3 Headquarters under the command of Jon Burge, and that
this opinion was based, inter alia, on his evaluations of several alleged Area 2 and 3 torture 71
victims, including Andrew Wilson, Darrell Cannon, Leroy Orange and Marcus Wiggins,
discussions with Chicago detectives who acknowledged that there was police torture at Area 2,
the fact that frequent allegations of electric shock, bagging, Russian Roulette only arose from
Area 2 and later from Area 3 Headquarters while Jon Burge was the commander, and not
against other officers in other station houses, and that the patterns and methodologies at Area 2
and 3 under Burge and Byrne closely mirrored those which he observed, investigated, and
evaluated in places such as Turkey and Israel. Id. at 5-6, 10-45, 57-59, 69, 80-81, 90-93, 96.

348. Brzeczek further averred that he made the following true and accurate statements
to Chicago Tribune reporter Steve Mills which appeared in an April 29 2002 Chicago Tribune
article:
Twenty years later, Brzeczek, now a defense attorney, said that there is ‘no doubt in my
mind’ that Burge and his detectives tortured some suspects. The whole situation at Area 2
[was] a disgrace and an embarrassment. It’s time something is done about it,” Brzeczek

allegedly occurred.

Police Department, [he] monitored litigation initiated by persons making claims and/or
allegations regarding torture sustained at the hands of police officers at Detective Division Area
2. [He] further monitored the prosecution of certain police officers previously assigned to Area 2
based on allegations of torture and other improper treatment of prisoners under their control 72
before the Chicago police Board. [He] also monitored media coverage of allegations and legal
actions arising out of allegations of torture and other improper treatment brought by persons
against police officers assigned to Detective Division Area 2.” Id., ¶ 10.
350. Brzeczek further averred that “based on the fact that allegations continued to arise
alleging torture and other improper treatment occurring at a time after [he] left the Chicago
Police Department on April 29, 1983, and based upon the fact that Richard M. Daley, State’s
Attorney of Cook County, did not conduct (or at least affiant is not aware of any such action),
any investigation into the allegations brought to his attention by the affiant in the letter as
aforesaid, affiant was and is convinced that some persons held in custody at Area 2 had to be
tortured.” Id., ¶11.
351. In his affidavit, Brzeczek further averred that “based on the sheer number of the
allegations, the findings of the courts in certain litigation brought against officers assigned to the
Detective Division Area 2, and the fact that police officers were discharged and/or suspended for
their roles in allegations made against them for the improper treatment of prisoners while
assigned to Detective Division Area 2, the affiant was and is convinced that some persons were
tortured while in custody at Detective Division Area 2.” Id., ¶12.

Hearing on Police Brutality, Day 5, October 11, 1989, p. 285.

358. On or about October 19, 1987, OPS Director Fogel sent a document entitled
“Proposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,” to the Mayor of the City of Chicago
in which he wrote:
By accepting all cases, even erring on the liberal side, to be accommodative to the
public, OPS gives the appearance of moving forward on all complaints. The opposite
occurs. The appearance of doing a thorough investigation with full due process
and endless unnecessary reviews for all, actually operates to immunize police
from internal discipline, increases their overtime, leads to an enormous “paper storm”
and has institutionalized lying.

360. In Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d 985, (7th Cir. 1987) the Seventh Circuit 76
Court of Appeals affirmed a jury verdict against Area 2 Violent Crimes detectives, supervisors
and commanding officers, including detectives James Houtsma, Dennis McGuire, John McCabe,
and Raymond McNally, Sgt. Alvin Palmer, Lt. Griffith, and Commander Milton Deas, for
conspiracy to “railroad” 18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating:
We cannot say that the jury acted unreasonably in finding that all of the
individual defendants were voluntary participants in a common venture to
railroad George Jones.
Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d at 992.
361. In Jones v. City of Chicago, the Seventh Circuit affirmed a jury verdict against the
City of Chicago for maintaining a “street files”custom or policy which led to the railroading of
18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating:
The custom in question is the maintenance of the ""street files,"" police
files withheld from the state's attorney and therefore unavailable as a
source of exculpatory information that might induce him not to prosecute
or, failing that, would at least be available to defense counsel under
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). As
we noted recently, information undermining the credibility of a government
witness is within the scope of Brady's rule. See United States v.
Herrera-Medina, 853 F.2d 564, slip op. at 5 (7th Cir. 1988).
Although the lawfulness of the street-files practice has never been
adjudicated, the City, which has abandoned the practice, does not challenge
the jury's implicit finding that it denied criminal defendants due process
of law. Brady v. Maryland does not require the police to keep written
records of all their investigatory activities; but attempts to circumvent
the rule of that case by retaining records in clandestine files
deliberately concealed from prosecutors and defense counsel cannot be
tolerated. The City sensibly does not attempt to defend such behavior in
this court.
There is little doubt that the clandestine character of the street files
played a role in Jones's misfortunes. Cf. Harris v. City of Pagedale, 821
F.2d 499, 507 (8th Cir. 1987). If the state's attorney had had [*996]
access to them, he would have discovered memos by Kelly and especially by
Laverty that would have given any prosecutor pause. Alternatively, defense 77
counsel would have obtained them prior to trial and the trial would have
ended even sooner than it did. The only question is whether this custom was
a custom of the City of Chicago. As the custom was department-wide
and of long standing, the jury was entitled to conclude that it had been
consciously approved at the highest policy-making level for decisions
involving the police department -- the standard suggested by the recent
plurality opinion in City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 108 S.
Ct. 915, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988). See also Stokes v. Bullins, 844 F.2d 269,
273 (5th Cir. 1988).

582. In a May 21, 2003 Chicago Tribune article, Special Prosecutor Egan was quoted as
saying: ""We believe something happened. You'd have to be a chump not to."" “Probers Believe
Brutality Claims,” Chicago Tribune, May 21, 2003.
583. On March 3, 1998, upon becoming Police Superintendent, Terry Hillard told the
Chicago Sun Times that “barring new evidence, it's time to close the book on the Burge era and
move on.” Hillard Dep., Santiago v. Marquez, 5/3/99, pp. 32-33, 35-36, 43-46
584. In an August 31, 1998 memo from the office of the Superintendent , Thomas
Needham, General Counsel to the Superintendent, to Leonard Benefico, Office of Professional
Standards, Needham listed the following cases:
Darrell Cannon CR#134723
Stanley Howard CR# 142017
Gregory Banks CR# 188617
Lee Holmes CR# 126802
Philip Adkins CR# 142201
Donald White CR# 169867
Lavert Jones CR# 200390
Stanley Ware CR# 202019 112
Michael Johnson CR# 125071
and wrote that “you are hereby instructed to classify all of the allegations in the above
referenced complaint register files as ‘not sustained.’” August 31, 1998 memo from Thomas
Needham, General Counsel to the Superintendent, to Leonard Benefico, Office of Professional
Standards.
585. As a basis for this unprecedented order, Needham cited the age of the cases and the
purported lack of “new evidence,” when, in fact, a wealth of new evidence had been developed
by the OPS investigators in almost all of the cases. Id.; CR files of listed cases; Testimony of
OPS investigators at People v. Cannon Hearing.
586. Superintendent Hillard, after talking to Neeedham about his decision, ratified his
actions in “not sustaining’” these cases, stating, under oath, that “I support Tom Needham 100
percent when it comes down to representing me in this department in hard cases like that.”
Hillard Dep., Santiago v. Marquez, 5/3/99, pp. 32-33, 35-36.
587. In a letter dated August 2, 1999, from Citizens Alert, addressed to Superintendent
Terry Hillard, OPS Director Callie Baird and Police Board President Demitrius Carney, the
signators wrote:
We write as a group of public officials, citizens and organizations concerned with
police violence and discipline to urge you to immediately reopen and review several
Office of Professional Standards (OPS) investigations into police torture, and to open
investigations in numerous other torture cases where no OPS investigations have been
conducted. We further urge you to commission an independent investigation into the
obvious violations of police regulations and procedure and legal process by certain OPS
and police officials during the torture investigations which were conducted by the OPS.
August 2, 1999 Letter from Citizens Alert, Mary Powers et. al. to Hillard, Carney, and Baird.
588. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators further wrote: 113
Recent news articles and publicly released documents and depositions reveal that the
OPS reopened nine torture investigations in 1992 and 1993 as a result of prior OPS
findings that physical abuse of African American suspects at Area 2 from 1973 to 1986
included ""psychological techniques and planned torture,"" was ""systematic,"" and
""methodical,"" and that Area 2 command members, particularly Jon Burge, ""were aware
of the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in same or
failing to take any action to bring it to an end."" Goldston Report, pp 2-3. The now public
evidence further reveals that OPS investigators Tillman, Lawrence, and Cosey conducted
thorough investigations in each of these cases, discovered new evidence not available
during the initial investigations, and sustained findings in six of the cases. The sustained
findings included findings that victims were electric shocked, suffocated with a plastic
bag, suspended in air by their handcuffs, beaten and stomped, and racially abused. The
evidence further shows that these sustained findings were entered against several police
officers who were and are still Chicago police officers in good standing, most notably
Lieutenant Peter Dignan, who had allegations of torture and abuse sustained against him
in five of the six cases. The evidence further reveals that these findings and the
investigative files were tendered to OPS Director Gayle Shines in 1994 for her review,
and that she overturned the findings in four of the cases in late 1994 and early 1995, at
the same time that Peter Dignan was nominated by the Mayor and the Department for
merit promotion to Lieutenant. Ms. Shines has admitted that in the approximately 2500
sustained cases which she reviewed during her eight year career as Director, she
overturned a total of 10 cases, including these four against Dignan.
The evidence further shows that in the other two cases, Darrell Cannon and Stanley
Howard, Ms. Shines never completed her review of the sustained findings of torture, but
rather kept these files in her office for four years, together with the other seven files.
Cannon, who was on trial in a murder case, and Howard, who is on death row, sought
these files by subpoena, but Shines and the Department failed to produce these files,
which contained highly exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, after Ms. Shines left the OPS
in 1998, counsel to the Superintendent, Thomas Needham, obtained the nine torture files
from the OPS and, without consultation with the Superintendent, summarily reversed the
sustained findings and closed the cases. Needham, who, as a longtime assistant state’s
attorney, was closely connected to the prosecution of several torture victims, including
Cannon, admitted that his summary reversals of the torture findings were not based on
the merits of the cases, but rather on the fact that the files had languished in Shines’
office for so long a period of time. The Superintendent never reviewed these cases on the
merits as he is required by police procedure to do, and he only learned of his counsel’s
unjustifiable actions by reading about them in a February 1999 Chicago Tribune article.
Additionally, the public evidence reveals that the OPS failed to investigate numerous
additional documented cases of police torture against African American suspects. In the
case of Melvin Jones, Mary Powers of Citizen’s Alert specifically requested by a letter
dated July 26, 1989 that the OPS open an investigation into the recently revealed
allegations that Jones was electric shocked at by Jon Burge and several other Area 2
detectives who remain on the force to this day. Contrary to police and OPS procedure, no
investigation was ever opened, despite the fact that the City has subsequently admitted in 114
official court papers that Jones was in fact tortured. Similarly, in the Shadeed Mumin
case, an investigation was opened and OPS investigators developed compelling new
evidence that he was tortured by Burge and an unidentified detective. Just as the OPS
investigator was about to identify this officer, the OPS discontinued the investigation,
supposedly because the investigation had not been assigned a complaint register number.
In numerous other cases, including Aaron Patterson and nine other men who are
presently on death row as a result of confessions which they allege were tortured from
them, the OPS has failed to conduct any investigation whatsoever into these most serious
allegations.
Id.
589. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators made the following demands:
1. Given Ms. Shines’ clear misconduct, lack of objectivity, and failure to complete her
review of the Cannon and Howard sustained findings, that new OPS Director, Callie
Baird, conduct an independent review on the merits of the six sustained torture
cases;
2. If Ms. Baird concurs with one or more of the sustained findings, that the
Superintendent fully and fairly review those findings on the merits, as he is required by
police procedure to do;
3. That counsel Thomas Needham be disqualified from any role in reviewing or
otherwise participating in any torture investigations;
4. That Peter Dignan and any other active officers against whom torture findings were
entered by OPS investigators be suspended pending complete review;
5. That the department and its OPS open an investigation into the allegations that Melvin
Jones was electric shocked by Jon Burge and other still active detectives and consider
in making its findings that the City has admitted that Jones was in fact tortured;
6. That the Department and its OPS reopen and complete the Shadeed Mumin
investigation;
7. That the Department and its OPS open investigations into the other numerous
documented cases of police torture, as listed in the Appendix attached hereto,
including those allegations made by men on death row;
8. That the Department commission an independent investigation into the serious
violations of departmental rules and court process by high ranking police and OPS
officials, including Thomas Needham and Gayle Shines;
9. That the Department and the OPS Director meet with representatives from the
undersigned groups and discuss these proposals and to periodically report on the
progress of these investigations;
10.That these investigations and findings be subject to public scrutiny.
Id. 115
590. In the August 2, 1999, from Citizens Alert, the signators set forth the following cases

592. Superintendent Hillard subsequently met with representatives from the signators of
the August 2, 1999 Citizens Alert letter.
593. Other than Hillard’s meeting with representatives from the signators of the August
2, 1999 Citizens Alert letter, no action was taken on any of the demands made in the letter. 116
594. In an e mail dated 1/10/02, Corporation Counsel Mara S. Georges wrote to her
assistant: “Sheila O’Grady would like us to explore bringing an action against Burge. Will you
please think about it and give us your thoughts?” “New documents Report that City Considered
Suing Burge, City continues Paying For Fired Commander’s Legal Defense,” NBC 5.com.,
4/29/04.
595. On January 1, 2002, Sheila O’Grady was Mayor Daley’s Chief of Staff. Id.
596. In response, Jeffrey Given, Georges’ assistant, wrote that suing Burge “would
seem to undercut our ability to defend [against the inmates’] suit by challenging the underlying
facts . . .” “City Considered Suing Burge; Officials Weighed Their Options to Fight Growing
Uproar over Torture Allegations Against the Fired Police Commander,” Chicago Tribune,
4/29/04.
597. Mindful that the torture allegations were gaining new momentum, Given and
Georges also considered mounting a public relations campaign to counter continuing negative
publicity about Burge and the City’s role in the torture scandal. Id.
598. Given and Georges recognized that the campaign would not be easy for a wide
variety of reasons, including that some of Burge’s men were still on the police force, the
department had been embarrassed by Needham’s unilateral shelving of the OPS torture
investigations despite the investigators’ sustained findings, and that the Tribune’s then recent
series on the continuing CPD practice of obtaining false confessions had again focused attention
on the issue, and Given further stated “but query how we’ll do in the court of public opinion
after a long, public, expensive and embarrassing discovery process?” NBC5.com; Chicago
Tribune.
599. Instead of suing Burge, or otherwise distancing the City from him, the City decided 117
to invest unlimited public funds in representing Burge and at least thirty-five other Area 2
detectives accused of torture and abuse in the four torture cases and to fight production and
public disclosure of additional documents that would further expose the City’s central role in the
torture scandal in civil and criminal cases and with the Special Prosecutor. Id.
600. On August 27, 2004 in his sworn testimony before the Prisoner Review Board,
former Area 2 Commander and Superintendent Leroy Martin falsely denied that he did not have
contemporaneous knowledge of the allegations of torture and abuse against Jon Burge and other
Area 2 detectives while he was Commander. Tr. of 8/27/04 Parole Revocation Hearing of Darrell
Cannon.
601. In her concurring opinion in Hinton v. Uchtman (sub. nom.)___F 3d ___ (7th Cir.
2005), Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Diane Wood found:
[T]he claim Hinton has made regarding his confession illustrates dramatically the
high price our system of criminal justice pays when police abuse runs rampant: a
cloud hangs over everything that the bad actors touched . . . [A] mountain of
evidence indicates that torture was an ordinary occurrence at the Area Two station
of the Chicago Police Department during the exact time period pertinent to
Hinton's case. Eventually, as this sorry tale came to light, the Office of
Professional Standards Investigation of the Police Department looked into the
allegations, and it issued a report that concluded that police torture under the
command of Lt. Jon Burge — the officer in charge of Hinton's case — had been a
regular part of the system for more than ten years. And, in language reminiscent
of the news reports of 2004 concerning the notorious Abu Ghraib facility in Iraq,
the report said that ""[t]he type of abuse described was not limited to the usual
beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and
planned torture."" The report detailed specific cases, such as the case of Andrew
Wilson, who was taken to Area Two on February 14, 1982. There a group led by
Burge beat Wilson, stuffed a bag over his head, handcuffed him to a radiator, and
repeatedly administered electric shocks to his ears, nose, and genitals. See People
v. Wilson, 506 N.E.2d 571 (Ill. 1987). Burge eventually lost his job with the
police, though not until 1992. See In the Matter of the Charges Filed Against Jon
Burge, No. 91-1856 (Chicago Police Board, February 11, 1993). To this day,
Burge has not been prosecuted for any of these actions, though it appears that he
at least thinks that he may still be at some risk of prosecution. See, for example, 118
""Cop brutality probe must be thorough, fair,"" Chi. Sun-Times, May 16, 2002
(editorial); Hal Dardick, ""Burge repeatedly takes 5th; Former police commander
stays mum on torture questions,"" Chi. Tribune, Sept. 2, 2004 (noting allegations
that Burge or people reporting to him had tortured 108 Black and Latino suspects
between August 1972 and September 1991). . . .
Behavior like that attributed to Burge imposes a huge cost on society: it
creates distrust of the police generally, despite the fact that most police officers
would abhor such tactics, and it creates a cloud over even the valid convictions in
which the problem officer played a role. Indeed, the alleged conduct is so
extreme that, if proven, it would fall within the prohibitions established by the
United Nations Convention Against Torture (""CAT""), which defines torture as
""any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is
intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a
third person information or a confession . . .,"" thereby violating the fundamental
human rights principles that the United States is committed to uphold. . . .",University of Chicago,Rodney Atkins,2008,"[67, 64, 53, 49, 44, 40, 45, 44, 51, 54, 58, 65, 65, 75, 78, 88]",16

Maybe the season
The colours change in the valley skies
Dear God I've sealed my fate
Running through hell, heaven can wait

[Chorus]
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight

[Verse 3]
For every piece to fall in place
Forever gone without a trace
Your horizon takes its shape
No turning back, don't turn that page

[Verse 4]
Come now, I'm leaving here tonight
Come now, let's leave it all behind
Is that the price you pay
Running through hell, heaven can wait

[Chorus]
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends
Long road to ruin there in your eyes

385,Letter To Me,"[Verse 1]
If I could write a letter to me
And send it back in time to myself at seventeen
First I'd prove it's me by sayin' look under your bed
There's a Skoal can and a Playboy no one else would know you hid
And then I'd say I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months
And yeah, I know you really liked her and it just don't seem fair
But all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare

[Chorus]
And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
She wasn't right for you and still you feel like there's a knife
Stickin' out of your back and you're wonderin' if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me

[Verse 2]
At the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth
Always stop completely, don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridgett, make sure the tank is full
On second thought forget it, that one turns out kinda cool
Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and dad is right
And you should really thank Mrs. Brinkman, she spends so much extra time
It's like she sees the diamond underneath and she's polishing you 'til you shine

[Chorus 2]
And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
Tonight's the bonfire rally but you're stayin' home instead
Because if you fail Algebra, mom and dad will kill you dead
Trust me you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me

[Verse 3]
You've got so much up ahead, you'll make new friends
You should see your kids and wife
And I'd end up sayin' have no fear
These are nowhere near the best years of your life

[Bridge]
I guess I'll see you in the mirror, when you're a grown man
P.S.: Go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can

[Chorus]
And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
I wish you'd study Spanish, I wish you'd taken typin' class
I wish you wouldn't worry, let it be, hey I'd say have a little faith and you'll see

386,Stealing Cinderella,"[Verse 1]
I went to see her dad for a sit down man to man
It wasn't any secret, I'd be asking for her hand
I guess that's why he left me waiting
In the living room by myself
With at least a dozen pictures of her sitting on a shelf
She was

[Chorus]
Playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him
In her eyes I'm prince charming
But to him I'm just some fellow
Riding in and stealing Cinderella

[Verse 2]
I leaned in towards those pictures
To get a better look at one
When I heard a voice behind me say
""Now, ain't she somethin son?""
I said ""Yeah, she's quite a woman""
And he just stared at me
And I realized that in his eyes she would always be

[Chorus]
Playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him
In her eyes I'm prince charming
But to him I'm just some fellow
Riding in and stealing Cinderella

[Bridge]
Oh, he slapped me on the shoulder
Then he called her in the room
When she threw her arms around him
That's when I could see it too

[Chorus]
She was playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin

This is how I do, when I think about you
I never thought that you could break me apart
I keep a sinister smile and a hole in my heart
You want to get inside, then you can get in line
But not this time

[Chorus]
'Cause you caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine

[Verse 2]
I won't try to philosophize
I'll just take a deep breath then I'll look in your eyes
This is how I feel, and it's so surreal
I got a closet filled up to the brim
With the ghosts of my past and their skeletons
And I don't know why
You'd even try
But I won't lie

You caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine
Do you know that your love is the sweetest sin?

And I feel a weakness coming on

Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She balls, he calls (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed
Go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in the wrong car
Bruised up, scarred hard

Pimpin' got harder 'cause hoes got smarter
On the strip is somethin' they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club, shakin' for a dub
Get triple times the money and spendin' it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the 9
See, everyday they feel the struggle but stayin' on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow, you gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know whether or not to lay low

She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Whatever, now she like sour amaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she ask him: ""Where my money at?""

393,Going On,"[Verse 1]
I've seen it with my own eyes
How we're getting otherwise, without the luxury of leaving
The touch and feeling of free is intangible, technically
Something you've got to believe in
Connect the cause and effect, one foot in front of the next
This is the start of a journey
And my mind is already gone
And the fear of the unknown
Somehow, just doesn't concern me
And you can stand right there, if you want

[Chorus]
But I'm going on
And I'm prepared to go it alone
I'm going on
To a place in the sun that's nice and warm
I'm going on
And I'm sure they'll have a place for you, too

[Verse 2]
Anyone that needs what they want
And doesn't want what they need
I want nothing to do with
I aim to do what I want, and to do what I please
Is first off my to-do list
But every once in a while, I think about her smile
One of the few things I do miss
But, baby, I've got to go
Baby, I've got to know
Baby, I've got to prove it
And I'll see you, when you get there

[Chorus]
But, I'm going on
And I'm prepared to go it alone
I'm going on
May my love lift you up to the place you belong
I'm going on
And I promise I'll be waiting for you",Gnarls Barkley,Gnarls Barkley,2008,[88],1

402,If I Had Eyes,"[Verse 1]
If I had eyes in the back of my head
I would have told you that
You looked good
As I walked away

If you could have tried to trust the hand that fed
You would've never been hungry
But you never really be

The more of this or less of this or is there any difference
Or are we just holding onto the things we don't have anymore

[Chorus]
Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
Just stand still
While we fall
In or out of love again I doubt I'm going to win you back
When you got eyes like that
It won't let me in
Always looking out

[Backing vocals and claps]

[Verse 2]
Lot of people spend their time just floating
We were victims together but lonely
You got hungry eyes that just can't look forward
Can't give them enough but we just can't start over

Building with bent nails we're
Falling but holding, I don't want to take up anymore of your time
Time, time, time

[Chorus]
Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
Just stand still
While we fall
In or out of love again I doubt I'm going to win you back
When you got eyes like that
It won't let me in
Always looking out

At a caramel colored sunset sky
Checkin my watch doin the math in my head
Counting back words to when you said goodbye
Well those runway lights are gettin brighter

Im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you dont love me anymore
Right now im sittin' out here watching airplanes

I would've lied could've cried should've tried harder
Done anything to make you stay
I wonder what you'd do if you looked out your window
Saw me runnin down the runway just like i was crazy
That fence is too high so am I

So I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
By now I know you're thirty thousand feet above me
But a million miles away, a million miles away
By now I know I outta act like you don't love me

But im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore

Yeah im just sittin' out here watching airplanes

To find me somewhere inside of you

And I'll take what remains of me

It's tricky, I'm picky, baby, but I just spotted you
Doin' your thang, G-string, shoe-string point of view
Hey – lend me your body, you got me in the zone
Bet a million and a half cash I can make you explode
You don't wanna brave the cold, you want a day of Combs
I can take you on outer limits away from home
(Where your bills pile?) I'm whylin' fo' sho'
In the middle of the club, doin' a rodeo show
The hoes seem steamy, wet, dreamy
Invisible sets gleamy; (incredible sex) you need me
Ease me, please me, baby
I maybe am a little crazy but in a way that they playa-pay me

Don't make me get buck in here!
Shorty drop it to the ground like she ain't got manners

You're the type that make me grip that handle
Lick shots in the air, bustin' that random

You like it like that, don't you, baby?
The flow's insane, and the stroke is crazy
I stroke so good like Tiger Woods
Then I ROWRR! like a tiger would
My livelihood is not Hollywood
I'm still Southside Atlanta, that's a lively hood
A circus, big top like Ringling Brothers

Sit back and observe, invite your friends
We can mix it all up, like juice and gin

I see you, you're with him, he ain’t right but you don’t trip
You stand by while he lies then turn right round and forgive

But what can I do? I gotta stay true 'cause deep down I’m still a G

It ain't fresh to just let him call the shots
You’re a queen, you should be getting all that someone’s got
You should be rocking the latest in purses, bracelets and watches
You’re worth much more than an occasional

414,"Ready, Set, Don't Go","                                      MADAME SWANN AT HOME

A BREAK IN THE NARRATIVE: OLD FRIENDS IN NEW ASPECTS — THE MARQUIS DE NORPOIS — BERGOTTE — HOW I CEASE FOR THE TIME BEING TO SEE GILBERTE: A GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE SORROW CAUSED BY A PARTING AND OF THE IRREGULAR PROCESS OF OBLIVION

    My mother, when it was a question of our having M. de Norpois to dinner for the first time, having expressed her regret that Professor Cottard was away from home, and that she herself had quite ceased to see anything of Swann, since either of these might have helped to entertain the old Ambassador, my father replied that so eminent a guest, so distinguished a man of science as Cottard could never be out of place at a dinner-table, but that Swann, with his ostentation, his habit of crying aloud from the housetops the name of everyone that he knew, however slightly, was an impossible vulgarian whom the Marquis de Norpois would be sure to dismiss as — to use his own epithet — a ‘pestilent’ fellow. Now, this attitude on my father’s part may be felt to require a few words of explanation, inasmuch as some of us, no doubt, remember a Cottard of distinct mediocrity and a Swann by whom modesty and discretion, in all his social relations, were carried to the utmost refinement of delicacy. But in his case, what had happened was that, to the original ‘young Swann’ and also to the Swann of the Jockey Club, our old friend had added a fresh personality (which was not to be his last), that of Odette’s husband. Adapting to the humble ambitions of that lady the instinct, the desire, the industry which he had always had, he had laboriously constructed for himself, a long way beneath the old, a new position more appropriate to the companion who was to share it with him. In this he shewed himself another man. Since (while he continued to go, by himself, to the houses of his own friends, on whom he did not care to inflict Odette unless they had expressly asked that she should be introduced to them) it was a new life that he had begun to lead, in common with his wife, among a new set of people, it was quite intelligible that, in order to estimate the importance of these new friends and thereby the pleasure, the self-esteem that were to be derived from entertaining them, he should have made use, as a standard of comparison, not of the brilliant society in which he himself had moved before his marriage but of the earlier environment of Odette. And yet, even when one knew that it was with unfashionable officials and their faded wives, the wallflowers of ministerial ball-rooms, that he was now anxious to associate, it was still astonishing to hear him, who in the old days, and even still, would so gracefully refrain from mentioning an invitation to Twickenham or to Marlborough House, proclaim with quite unnecessary emphasis that the wife of some Assistant Under-Secretary for Something had returned Mme. Swann’s call. It will perhaps be objected here that what this really implied was that the simplicity of the fashionable Swann had been nothing more than a supreme refinement of vanity, and that, like certain other Israelites, my parents’ old friend had contrived to illustrate in turn all the stages through which his race had passed, from the crudest and coarsest form of snobbishness up to the highest pitch of good manners. But the chief reason — and one which is applicable to humanity as a whole — was that our virtues themselves are not free and floating qualities over which we retain a permanent control and power of disposal; they come to be so closely linked in our minds with the actions in conjunction with which we make it our duty to practise them, that, if we are suddenly called upon to perform some action of a different order, it takes us by surprise, and without our supposing for a moment that it might involve the bringing of those very same virtues into play. Swann, in his intense consciousness of his new social surroundings, and in the pride with which he referred to them, was like those great artists — modest or generous by nature — who, if at the end of their career they take to cooking or to gardening, display a childlike gratification at the compliments that are paid to their dishes or their borders, and will not listen to any of the criticism which they heard unmoved when it was applied to their real achievements; or who, after giving away a canvas, cannot conceal their annoyance if they lose a couple of francs at dominoes

    As for Professor Cottard, we shall meet him again and can study him at our leisure, much later in the course of our story, with the ‘Mistress,’ Mme. Verdurin, in her country house La Raspelière. For the present, the following observations must suffice; first of all, in the case of Swann the alteration might indeed be surprising, since it had been accomplished and yet was not suspected by me when I used to see Gilberte’s father in the Champs-Elysées, where, moreover, as he never spoke to me, he could not very well have made any display of his political relations. It is true that, if he had done so, I might not at once have discerned his vanity, for the idea that one has long held of a person is apt to stop one’s eyes and ears; my mother, for three whole years, had no more noticed the salve with which one of her nieces used to paint her lips than if it had been wholly and invisibly dissolved in some clear liquid; until one day a streak too much, or possibly something else, brought about the phenomenon known as super-saturation; all the paint that had hitherto passed unperceived was now crystallised, and my mother, in the face of this sudden riot of colour, declared, in the best Combray manner, that it was a perfect scandal, and almost severed relations with her niece. With Cottard, on the contrary, the epoch in which we have seen him assisting at the first introduction of Swann to the Verdurins was now buried in the past; whereas honours, offices and titles come with the passage of years; moreover, a man may be illiterate, and make stupid puns, and yet have a special gift, which no amount of general culture can replace — such as the gift of a great strategist or physician. And so it was not merely as an obscure practitioner, who had attained in course of time to European celebrity, that the rest of his profession regarded Cottard. The most intelligent of the younger doctors used to assert — for a year or two, that is to say, for fashions, being themselves begotten of the desire for change, are quick to change also — that if they themselves ever fell ill Cottard was the only one of the leading men to whom they would entrust their lives. No doubt they preferred, socially, to meet certain others who were better read, more artistic, with whom they could discuss Nietzsche and Wagner. When there was a musical party at Mme. Cottard’s, on the evenings when she entertained — in the hope that it might one day make him Dean of the Faculty — the colleagues and pupils of her husband, he, instead of listening, preferred to play cards in another room. Yet everybody praised the quickness, the penetration, the unerring confidence with which, at a glance, he could diagnose disease. Thirdly, in considering the general impression which Professor Cottard must have made on a man like my father, we must bear in mind that the character which a man exhibits in the latter half of his life is not always, even if it is often his original character developed or withered, attenuated or enlarged; it is sometimes the exact opposite, like a garment that has been turned. Except from the Verdurins, who were infatuated with him, Cottard’s hesitating manner, his excessive timidity and affability had, in his young days, called down upon him endless taunts and sneers. What charitable friend counselled that glacial air? The importance of his professional standing made it all the more easy to adopt. Wherever he went, save at the Verdurins’, where he instinctively became himself again, he would assume a repellent coldness, remain silent as long as possible, be peremptory when he was obliged to speak, and not forget to say the most cutting things. He had every opportunity of rehearsing this new attitude before his patients, who, seeing him for the first time, were not in a position to make comparisons, and would have been greatly surprised to learn that he was not at all a rude man by nature. Complete impassivity was what he strove to attain, and even while visiting his hospital wards, when he allowed himself to utter one of those puns which left everyone, from the house physician to the junior student, helpless with laughter, he would always make it without moving a muscle of his face, while even that was no longer recognisable now that he had shaved off his beard and moustache

    But who, the reader has been asking, was the Marquis de Norpois? Well, he had been Minister Plenipotentiary before the War, and was actually an Ambassador on the Sixteenth of May; in spite of which, and to the general astonishment, he had since been several times chosen to represent France on Extraordinary Missions — even as Controller of the Public Debt in Egypt, where, thanks to his great capability as a financier, he had rendered important services — by Radical Cabinets under which a reactionary of the middle classes would have declined to serve, and in whose eyes M. de Norpois, in view of his past, his connexions and his opinions, ought presumably to have been suspect. But these advanced Ministers seemed to consider that, in making such an appointment, they were shewing how broad their own minds were, when the supreme interests of France were at stake, were raising themselves above the general run of politicians, were meriting, from the Journal des Débats itself, the title of ‘Statesmen,’ and were reaping direct advantage from the weight that attaches to an aristocratic name and the dramatic interest always aroused by an unexpected appointment. And they knew also that they could reap these advantages by making an appeal to M. de Norpois, without having to fear any want of political loyalty on his part, a fault against which his noble birth not only need not put them on their guard but offered a positive guarantee. And in this calculation the Government of the Republic were not mistaken. In the first place, because an aristocrat of a certain type, brought up from his cradle to regard his name as an integral part of himself of which no accident can deprive him (an asset of whose value his peers, or persons of even higher rank, can form a fairly exact estimate), knows that he can dispense with the efforts (since they can in no way enhance his position) in which, without any appreciable result, so many public men of the middle class spend themselves — to profess only the ‘right’ opinions, to frequent only the ‘sound’ people. Anxious, on the other hand, to increase his own importance in the eyes of the princely or ducal families which take immediate precedence of his own, he knows that he can do so by giving his name that complement which hitherto it has lacked, which will give it priority over other names heraldically its equals: such as political power, a literary or an artistic reputation, or a large fortune. And so what he saves by avoiding the society of the ineffective country squires, after whom all the professional families run helter-skelter, but of his intimacy with whom, were he to profess it, a prince would think nothing, he will lavish on the politicians who (free-masons, or worse, though they be) can advance him in Diplomacy or ‘back’ him in an election, and on the artists or scientists whose patronage can help him to ‘arrive’ in those departments in which they excel, on everyone, in fact, who is in a position to confer a fresh distinction or to ‘bring off’ a rich marriage

    But in the character of M. de Norpois there was this predominant feature, that, in the course of a long career of diplomacy, he had become imbued with that negative, methodical, conservative spirit, called ‘governmental,’ which is common to all Governments and, under every Government, particularly inspires its Foreign Office. He had imbibed, during that career, an aversion, a dread, a contempt for the methods of procedure, more or less revolutionary and in any event quite incorrect, which are those of an Opposition. Save in the case of a few illiterates — high or low, it makes no matter — by whom no difference in quality is perceptible, what attracts men one to another is not a common point of view but a consanguinity of spirit. An Academician of the kind of Legouvé, and therefore an upholder of the classics, would applaud Maxime Ducamp’s or Mezière’s eulogy of Victor Hugo with more fervour than that of Boileau by Claudel. A common Nationalism suffices to endear Barrés to his electors, who scarcely distinguish between him and M. Georges Berry, but does not endear him to those of his brother Academicians who, with a similar outlook on politics but a different type of mind, will prefer to him even such open adversaries as M. Ribot and M. Deschanel, with whom, in turn, the most loyal Monarchists feel themselves more closely allied than with Maurras or Léon Daudet, although these also are living in the hope of a glorious Restoration. Miserly in the use of words, not only from a professional scruple of prudence and reserve, but because words themselves have more value, present more subtleties of definition to men whose efforts, protracted over a decade, to bring two countries to an understanding, are condensed, translated — in a speech or in a protocol — into a single adjective, colourless in all appearance, but to them pregnant with a world of meaning, M. de Norpois was considered very stiff, at the Commission, where he sat next to my father, whom everyone else congratulated on the astonishing way in which the old Ambassador unbent to him. My father was himself more astonished than anyone. For not being, as a rule, very affable, his company was little sought outside his own intimate circle, a limitation which he used modestly and frankly to avow. He realised that these overtures were an outcome, in the diplomat, of that point of view which everyone adopts for himself in making his choice of friends, from which all a man’s intellectual qualities, his refinement, his affection are a far less potent recommendation of him, when at the same time he bores or irritates one, than are the mere straightforwardness and good-humour of another man whom most people would regard as frivolous or even fatuous. “De Norpois has asked me to dinner again; it’s quite extraordinary; everyone on the Commission is amazed, as he never has any personal relations with any of us. I am sure he’s going to tell me something thrilling, again, about the ‘Seventy war.” My father knew that M. de Norpois had warned, had perhaps been alone in warning the Emperor of the growing strength and bellicose designs of Prussia, and that Bismarck rated his intelligence most highly. Only the other day, at the Opera, during the gala performance given for King Theodosius, the newspapers had all drawn attention to the long conversation which that Monarch had held with M. de Norpois. “I must ask him whether the King’s visit had any real significance,” my father went on, for he was keenly interested in foreign politics. “I know old Norpois keeps very close as a rule, but when he’s with me he opens out quite charmingly.”

    As for my mother, perhaps the Ambassador had not the type of mind towards which she felt herself most attracted. I should add that his conversation furnished so exhaustive a glossary of the superannuated forms of speech peculiar to a certain profession, class and period — a period which, for that profession and that class, might be said not to have altogether passed away — that I sometimes regret that I have not kept any literal record simply of the things that I have heard him say. I should thus have obtained an effect of old-fashioned courtesy by the same process and at as little expense as that actor at the Palais-Royal who, when asked where on earth he managed to find his astounding hats, answered, “I do not find my hats. I keep them.” In a word, I suppose that my mother considered M. de Norpois a trifle ‘out-of-date,’ which was by no means a fault in her eyes, so far as manners were concerned, but attracted her less in the region — not, in this instance, of ideas, for those of M. de Norpois were extremely modern — but of idiom. She felt, however, that she was paying a delicate compliment to her husband when she spoke admiringly of the diplomat who had shewn so remarkable a predilection for him. By confirming in my father’s mind the good opinion that he already had of M. de Norpois, and so inducing him to form a good opinion of himself also, she knew that she was carrying out that one of her wifely duties which consisted in making life pleasant and comfortable for her husband, just as when she saw to it that his dinner was perfectly cooked and served in silence. And as she was incapable of deceiving my father, she compelled herself to admire the old Ambassador, so as to be able to praise him with sincerity. Incidentally she could naturally, and did, appreciate his kindness, his somewhat antiquated courtesy (so ceremonious that when, as he was walking along the street, his tall figure rigidly erect, he caught sight of my mother driving past, before raising his hat to her he would fling away the cigar that he had just lighted); his conversation, so elaborately circumspect, in which he referred as seldom as possible to himself and always considered what might interest the person to whom he was speaking; his promptness in answering a letter, which was so astonishing that whenever my father, just after posting one himself to M. de Norpois, saw his handwriting upon an envelope, his first thought was always one of annoyance that their letters must, unfortunately, have crossed in the post; which, one was led to suppose, bestowed upon him the special and luxurious privilege of extraordinary deliveries and collections at all hours of the day and night. My mother marvelled at his being so punctilious although so busy, so friendly although so much in demand, never realising that ‘although,’ with such people, is invariably an unrecognised ‘because,’ and that (just as old men are always wonderful for their age, and kings extraordinarily simple, and country cousins astonishingly well-informed) it was the same system of habits that enabled M. de Norpois to undertake so many duties and to be so methodical in answering letters, to go everywhere and to be so friendly when he came to us. Moreover she made the mistake which everyone makes who is unduly modest; she rated everything that concerned herself below, and consequently outside the range of, other people’s duties and engagements. The letter which it seemed to her so meritorious in my father’s friend to have written us promptly, since in the course of the day he must have had ever so many letters to write, she excepted from that great number of letters, of which actually it was a unit; in the same way she did not consider that dining with us was, for M. de Norpois, merely one of the innumerable activities of his social life; she never guessed that the Ambassador had trained himself, long ago, to look upon dining-out as one of his diplomatic functions, and to display, at table, an inveterate charm which it would have been too much to have expected him specially to discard when he came to dine with us

    The evening on which M. de Norpois first appeared at our table, in a year when I still went to play in the Champs-Elysées, has remained fixed in my memory because the afternoon of the same day was that upon which I at last went to hear Berma, at a matinée, in Phèdre, and also because in talking to M. de Norpois I realised suddenly, and in a new and different way, how completely the feelings aroused in me by all that concerned Gilberte Swann and her parents differed from any that the same family could inspire in anyone else

    It was no doubt the sight of the depression in which I was plunged by the approach of the New Year holidays, in which, as she herself had informed me, I was to see nothing of Gilberte, that prompted my mother one day, in the hope of distracting my mind, to suggest, “If you are still so anxious to hear Berma, I think that your father would allow you perhaps to go; your grandmother can take you.”

    But it was because M. de Norpois had told him that he ought to let me hear Berma, that it was an experience for a young man to remember in later life, that my father, who had hitherto been so resolutely opposed to my going and wasting my time, with the added risk of my falling ill again, on what he used to shock my grandmother by calling ‘futilities,’ was now not far from regarding this manner of spending an afternoon as included, in some vague way, in the list of precious formulae for success in a brilliant career. My grandmother, who, in renouncing on my behalf the profit which, according to her, I should have derived from hearing Berma, had made a considerable sacrifice in the interests of my health, was surprised to find that this last had become of no account at a mere word from M. de Norpois. Reposing the unconquerable hopes of her rationalist spirit in the strict course of fresh air and early hours which had been prescribed for me, she now deplored, as something disastrous, this infringement that I was to make of my rules, and in a tone of despair protested, “How easily led you are!” to my father, who replied angrily “What! So it’s you that are not for letting him go, now. That is really too much, after your telling us all day and every day that it would be so good for him.”

    M. de Norpois had also brought about a change in my father’s plans in a matter of far greater importance to myself. My father had always meant me to become a diplomat, and I could not endure the thought that, even if I did have to stay for some years, first, at the Ministry, I should run the risk of being sent, later on, as Ambassador, to capitals in which no Gilberte dwelt. I should have preferred to return to the literary career that I had planned for myself, and had been abandoned, years before, in my wanderings along the Guermantes way. But my father had steadily opposed my devoting myself to literature, which he regarded as vastly inferior to diplomacy, refusing even to dignify it with the title of career, until the day when M. de Norpois, who had little love for the more recent generations of diplomatic agents, assured him that it was quite possible, by writing, to attract as much attention, to receive as much consideration, to exercise as much influence, and at the same time to preserve more independence than in the Embassies

    “Well, well, I should never have believed it. Old Norpois doesn’t at all disapprove of your idea of taking up writing,” my father had reported. And as he had a certain amount of influence himself, he imagined that there was nothing that could not be ‘arranged,’ no problem for which a happy solution might not be found in the conversation of people who ‘counted.’ “I shall bring him back to dinner, one of these days, from the Commission. You must talk to him a little, and let him see what he thinks of you. Write something good that you can shew him; he is an intimate friend of the editor of the Deux-Mondes; he will get you in there; he will arrange it all, the cunning old fox; and, upon my soul, he seems to think that diplomacy, nowadays ——!”

    My happiness in the prospect of not being separated from Gilberte made me desirous, but not capable, of writing something good which could be shewn to M. de Norpois. After a few laboured pages, weariness made the pen drop from my fingers; I cried with anger at the thought that I should never have any talent, that I was not ‘gifted,’ that I could not even take advantage of the chance that M. de Norpois’s coming visit was to offer me of spending the rest of my life in Paris. The recollection that I was to be taken to hear Berma alone distracted me from my grief. But just as I did not wish to see any storms except on those coasts where they raged with most violence, so I should not have cared to hear the great actress except in one of those classic parts in which Swann had told me that she touched the sublime. For when it is in the hope of making a priceless discovery that we desire to receive certain impressions from nature or from works of art, we have certain scruples about allowing our soul to gather, instead of these, other, inferior, impressions, which are liable to make us form a false estimate of the value of Beauty. Berma in Andromaque, in Les Caprices de Marianne, in Phèdre, was one of those famous spectacles which my imagination had so long desired. I should enjoy the same rapture as on the day when in a gondola I glided to the foot of the Titian of the Frari or the Carpaccios of San Giorgio dei Schiavoni, were I ever to hear Berma repeat the lines beginning

                         “On dit qu’un prompt départ vous éloigne de
                                 nous, Seigneur — —”

    I was familiar with them from the simple reproduction in black and white which was given of them upon the printed page; but my heart beat furiously at the thought — as of the realisation of a long-planned voyage — that I should at length behold them, bathed and brought to life in the atmosphere and sunshine of the voice of gold. A Carpaccio in Venice, Berma in Phèdre, masterpieces of pictorial or dramatic art which the glamour, the dignity attaching to them made so living to me, that is to say so indivisible, that if I had been taken to see Carpaccios in one of the galleries of the Louvre, or Berma in some piece of which I had never heard, I should not have experienced the same delicious amazement at finding myself at length, with wide-open eyes, before the unique and inconceivable object of so many thousand dreams. Then, while I waited, expecting to derive from Berma’s playing the revelation of certain aspects of nobility and tragic grief, it would seem to me that whatever greatness, whatever truth there might be in her playing must be enhanced if the actress imposed it upon a work of real value, instead of what would, after all, be but embroidering a pattern of truth and beauty upon a commonplace and vulgar web

    Finally, if I went to hear Berma in a new piece, it would not be easy for me to judge of her art, of her diction, since I should not be able to differentiate between a text which was not already familiar and what she added to it by her intonations and gestures, an addition which would seem to me to be embodied in the play itself; whereas the old plays, the classics which I knew by heart, presented themselves to me as vast and empty walls, reserved and made ready for my inspection, on which I should be able to appreciate without restriction the devices by which Berma would cover them, as with frescoes, with the perpetually fresh treasures of her inspiration. Unfortunately, for some years now, since she had retired from the great theatres, to make the fortune of one on the boulevards where she was the ‘star,’ she had ceased to appear in classic parts; and in vain did I scan the hoardings; they never advertised any but the newest pieces, written specially for her by authors in fashion at the moment. When, one morning, as I stood searching the column of announcements to find the afternoon performances for the week of the New Year holidays, I saw there for the first time — at the foot of the bill, after some probably insignificant curtain-raiser, whose title was opaque to me because it had latent in it all the details of an action of which I was ignorant — two acts ofPhèdre with Mme. Berma, and, on the following afternoons, Le Demi-Monde, Les Caprices de Marianne, names which, like that of Phèdre, were for me transparent, filled with light only, so familiar were those works to me, illuminated to their very depths by the revealing smile of art. They seemed to me to invest with a fresh nobility Mme. Berma herself when I read in the newspapers, after the programme of these performances, that it was she who had decided to shew herself once more to the public in some of her early creations. She was conscious, then, that certain stage-parts have an interest which survives the novelty of their first production or the success of a revival; she regarded them, when interpreted by herself, as museum pieces which it might be instructive to set before the eyes of the generation which had admired her in them long ago, or of that which had never yet seen her in them. In thus advertising, in the middle of a column of plays intended only to while away an evening, this Phèdre, a title no longer than any of the rest, nor set in different type, she added something indescribable, as though a hostess, introducing you, before you all go in to dinner, to her other guests, were to mention, casually, amid the string of names which are the names of guests and nothing more, and without any change of tone:—“M. Anatole France.”

    The doctor who was attending me — the same who had forbidden me to travel — advised my parents not to let me go to the theatre; I should only be ill again afterwards, perhaps for weeks, and should in the long run derive more pain than pleasure from the experience. The fear of this might have availed to stop me, if what I had anticipated from such a spectacle had been only a pleasure for which a subsequent pain could so compensate as to cancel it. But what I demanded from this performance — just as from the visit to Balbec, the visit to Venice for which I had so intensely longed — was something quite different from pleasure; a series of verities pertaining to a world more real than that in which I lived, which, once acquired, could never be taken from me again by any of the trivial incidents — even though it were the cause of bodily suffering — of my otiose existence. At best, the pleasure which I was to feel during the performance appeared to me as the perhaps inevitable form of the perception of these truths; and I hoped only that the illness which had been forecast for me would not begin until the play was finished, so that my pleasure should not be in any way compromised or spoiled. I implored my parents, who, after the doctor’s visit, were no longer inclined to let me go to Phèdre. I repeated, all day long, to myself, the speech beginning

                   “On dit qu’un prompt départ vous éloigne de nous                                    — —”

    seeking out every intonation that could be put into it, so as to be able better to measure my surprise at the way which Berma would have found of uttering the lines. Concealed, like the Holy of Holies, beneath the veil that screened her from my gaze, behind which I invested her, every moment, with a fresh aspect, according to which of the words of Bergotte — in the pamphlet that Gilberte had found for me — was passing through my mind; “plastic nobility,” “Christian austerity” or “Jansenist pallor,” “Princess of Troezen and of Cleves” or “Mycenean drama,” “Delphic symbol,” “Solar myth”; that divine Beauty, whom Berma’s acting was to reveal to me, night and day, upon an altar perpetually illumined, sat enthroned hi the sanctuary of my mind, my mind for which not itself but my stern, my fickle parents were to decide whether or not it was to enshrine, and for all time, the perfections of the Deity unveiled, in the same spot where was now her invisible form. And with my eyes fixed upon that inconceivable image, I strove from morning to night to overcome the barriers which my family were putting in my way. But when those had at last fallen, when my mother — albeit this matinée was actually to coincide with the meeting of the Commission from which my father had promised to bring M. de Norpois home to dinner — had said to me, “Very well, we don’t wish you to be unhappy; — if you think that you will enjoy it so very much, you must go; that’s all;” when this day of theatre-going, hitherto forbidden and unattainable, depended now only upon myself, then for the first time, being no longer troubled by the wish that it might cease to be impossible, I asked myself if it were desirable, if there were not other reasons than my parents’ prohibition which should make me abandon my design. In the first place, whereas I had been detesting them for their cruelty, their consent made them now so dear to me that the thought of causing them pain stabbed me also with a pain through which the purpose of life shewed itself as the pursuit not of truth but of loving-kindness, and life itself seemed good or evil only as my parents were happy or sad. “I would rather not go, if it hurts you,” I told my mother, who, on the contrary, strove hard to expel from my mind any lurking fear that she might regret my going, since that, she said, would spoil the pleasure that I should otherwise derive fromPhèdre, and it was the thought of my pleasure that had induced my father and her to reverse their earlier decision. But then this sort of obligation to find a pleasure in the performance seemed to me very burdensome. Besides, if I returned home ill, should I be well again in time to be able to go to the Champs-Elysées as soon as the holidays were over and Gilberte returned? Against all these arguments I set, so as to decide which course I should take, the idea, invisible there behind its veil, of the perfections of Berma. I cast into one pan of the scales “Making Mamma unhappy,” “risking not being able to go on the Champs-Elysées,” and the other, “Jansenist pallor,” “Solar myth,” until the words themselves grew dark and clouded in my mind’s vision, ceased to say anything to me, lost all their force; and gradually my hesitations became so painful that if I had now decided upon the theatre it would have been only that I might bring them to an end, and be delivered from them once and for all. It would have been to fix a term to my sufferings, and no longer in the expectation of an intellectual benediction, yielding to the attractions of perfection, that I would let myself be taken, not now to the Wise Goddess, but to the stern, implacable Divinity, featureless and unnamed, who had been secretly substituted for her behind the veil. But suddenly everything was altered. My desire to go and hear Berma received a fresh stimulus which enabled me to await the coming of the matinée with impatience and with joy; having gone to take up, in front of the column on which the playbills were, my daily station, as excruciating, of late, as that of a stylite saint, I had seen there, still moist and wrinkled, the complete bill of Phèdre, which had just been pasted up for the first time (and on which, I must confess, the rest of the cast furnished no additional attraction which could help me to decide). But it gave to one of the points between which my indecision wavered a form at once more concrete and — inasmuch as the bill was dated not from the day on which I read it but from that on which the performance would take place, and from the very hour at which the curtain would rise — almost imminent, well on the way, already, to its realisation, so that I jumped for joy before the column at the thought that on that day, and at that hour precisely, I should be sitting there in my place, ready to hear the voice of Berma; and for fear lest my parents might not now be in time to secure two good seats for my grandmother and myself, I raced back to the house, whipped on by the magic words which had now taken the place, in my mind, of “Jansenist pallor” and “Solar myth”; —“Ladies will not be admitted to the stalls in hats. The doors will be closed at two o’clock.”

    Alas! that first matinée was to prove a bitter disappointment. My father offered to drop my grandmother and me at the theatre, on his way to the Commission. Before leaving the house he said to my mother: “See that you have a good dinner for us to-night; you remember, I’m bringing de Norpois back with me.” My mother had not forgotten. And all that day, and overnight, Françoise, rejoicing in the opportunity to devote herself to that art of the kitchen — of which she was indeed a past-master, stimulated, moreover, by the prospect of having a new guest to feed, the consciousness that she would have to compose, by methods known to her alone, a dish of beef in jelly — had been living in the effervescence of creation; since she attached the utmost importance to the intrinsic quality of the materials which were to enter into the fabric of her work, she had gone herself to the Halles to procure the best cuts of rump-steak, shin of beef, calves’-feet, as Michelangelo passed eight months in the mountains of Carrara choosing the most perfect blocks of marble for the monument of Julius II— Françoise expended on these comings and goings so much ardour that Mamma, at the sight of her flaming cheeks, was alarmed lest our old servant should make herself ill with overwork, like the sculptor of the Tombs of the Medici in the quarries of Pietrasanta. And overnight Françoise had sent to be cooked in the baker’s oven, shielded with breadcrumbs, like a block of pink marble packed in sawdust, what she called a “Nev’-York ham.” Believing the language to be less rich than it actually was in words, and her own ears less trustworthy, the first time that she heard anyone mention York ham she had thought, no doubt — feeling it to be hardly conceivable that the dictionary could be so prodigal as to include at once a ‘York’ and a ‘New York’— that she had misheard what was said, and that the ham was really called by the name already familiar to her. And so, ever since, the word York was preceded in her ears, or before her eyes when she read it in an advertisement, by the affix ‘New’ which she pronounced ‘Nev’.’ And it was with the most perfect faith that she would say to her kitchen-maid: “Go and fetch me a ham from Olida’s. Madame told me especially to get a Nev’-York.” On that particular day, if Françoise was consumed by the burning certainty of creative genius, my lot was the cruel anxiety of the seeker after truth. No doubt, so long as I had not yet heard Berma speak, I still felt some pleasure. I felt it in the little square that lay in front of the theatre, in which, in two hours’ time, the bare boughs of the chestnut trees would gleam with a metallic lustre as the lighted gas-lamps shewed up every detail of their structure; before the attendants in the box-office, the selection of whom, their promotion, all their destiny depended upon the great artist — for she alone held power in the theatre, where ephemeral managers followed one after the other in an obscure succession — who took our tickets without even glancing at us, so preoccupied were they with their anxiety lest any of Mme. Berma’s instructions had not been duly transmitted to the new members of the staff, lest it was not clearly, everywhere, understood that the hired applause must never sound for her, that the windows must all be kept open so long as she was not on the stage, and every door closed tight, the moment that she appeared; that a bowl of hot water must be concealed somewhere close to her, to make the dust settle: and, for that matter, at any moment now her carriage, drawn by a pair of horses with flowing manes, would be stopping outside the theatre, she would alight from it muffled in furs, and, crossly acknowledging everyone’s salute, would send one of her attendants to find out whether a stage box had been kept for her friends, what the temperature was ‘in front,’ who were in the other boxes, if the programme sellers were looking smart; theatre and public being to her no more than a second, an outermost cloak which she would put on, and the medium, the more or less ‘good’ conductor through which her talent would have to pass. I was happy, too, in the theatre itself; since I had made the discovery that — in contradiction of the picture so long entertained by my childish imagination — there was but one stage for everybody, I had supposed that I should be prevented from seeing it properly by the presence of the other spectators, as one is when in the thick of a crowd; now I registered the fact that, on the contrary, thanks to an arrangement which is, so to speak, symbolical of all spectatorship, everyone feels himself to be the centre of the theatre; which explained to me why, when Françoise had been sent once to see some melodrama from the top gallery, she had assured us on her return that her seat had been the best in the house, and that instead of finding herself too far from the stage she had been positively frightened by the mysterious and living proximity of the curtain. My pleasure increased further when I began to distinguish behind the said lowered curtain such confused rappings as one hears through the shell of an egg before the chicken emerges, sounds which speedily grew louder and suddenly, from that world which, impenetrable by our eyes, yet scrutinised us with its own, addressed themselves, and to us indubitably, in the imperious form of three consecutive hammer-blows as moving as any signals from the planet Mars. And — once this curtain had risen — when on the stage a writing-table and a fireplace, in no way out of the ordinary, had indicated that the persons who were about to enter would be, not actors come to recite, as I had seen them once and heard them at an evening party, but real people, just living their lives at home, on whom I was thus able to spy without their seeing me — my pleasure still endured; it was broken by a momentary uneasiness; just as I was straining my ears in readiness before the piece began, two men entered the theatre from the side of the stage, who must have been very angry with each other, for they were talking so loud that in the auditorium, where there were at least a thousand people, we could hear every word, whereas in quite a small café one is obliged to call the waiter and ask what it is that two men, who appear to be quarrelling, are saying; but at that moment, while I sat astonished to find that the audience was listening to them without protest, drowned as it was in a universal silence upon which broke, presently, a laugh here and there, I understood that these insolent fellows were the actors and that the short piece known as the ‘curtain-raiser’ had now begun. It was followed by an interval so long that the audience, who had returned to their places, grew impatient and began to stamp their feet. I was terrified at this; for just as in the report of a criminal trial, when I read that some noble-minded person was coming, against his own interests, to testify on behalf of an innocent prisoner, I was always afraid that they would not be nice enough to him, would not shew enough gratitude, would not recompense him lavishly, and that he, in disgust, would then range himself on the side of injustice; so now attributing to genius, in this respect, the same qualities as to virtue, I was afraid lest Berma, annoyed by the bad behaviour of so ill-bred an audience — in which, on the other hand, I should have liked her to recognise, with satisfaction, a few celebrities to whose judgment she would be bound to attach importance — should express her discontent and disdain by acting badly. And I gazed appealingly round me at these stamping brutes who were about to shatter, in their insensate rage, the rare and fragile impression which I had come to seek. The last moments of my pleasure were during the opening scenes of Phèdre. The heroine herself does not appear in these first scenes of the second act; and yet, as soon as the curtain rose, and another curtain, of red velvet this time, was parted in the middle (a curtain which was used to halve the depth of the stage in all the plays in which the ‘star’ appeared), an actress entered from the back who had the face and voice which, I had been told, were those of Berma. The cast must therefore have been changed; all the trouble that I had taken in studying the part of the wife of Theseus was wasted. But a second actress now responded to the first. I must, then, have been mistaken in supposing that the first was Berma, for the second even more closely resembled her, and, more than the other, had her diction. Both of them, moreover, enriched their parts with noble gestures — which I could vividly distinguish, and could appreciate in their relation to the text, while they raised and let fall the lovely folds of their tunics — and also with skilful changes of tone, now passionate, now ironical, which made me realise the significance of lines that I had read to myself at home without paying sufficient attention to what they really meant. But all of a sudden, in the cleft of the red curtain that veiled her sanctuary, as in a frame, appeared a woman, and simultaneously with the fear that seized me, far more vexing than Berma’s fear could be, lest someone should upset her by opening a window, or drown one of her lines by rustling a programme, or annoy her by applauding the others and by not applauding her enough; — in my own fashion, still more absolute than Berma’s, of considering from that moment theatre, audience, play and my own body only as an acoustic medium of no importance, save in the degree to which it was favourable to the inflexions of that voice — I realised that the two actresses whom I had been for some minutes admiring bore not the least resemblance to her whom I had come to hear. But at the same time all my pleasure had ceased; in vain might I strain towards Berma’s eyes, ears, mind, so as not to let one morsel escape me of the reasons which she would furnish for my admiring her, I did not succeed in gathering a single one. I could not even, as I could with her companions, distinguish in her diction and in her playing intelligent intonations, beautiful gestures. I listened to her as though I were readingPhèdre, or as though Phaedra herself had at that moment uttered the words that I was hearing, without its appearing that Berma’s talent had added anything at all to them. I could have wished, so as to be able to explore them fully, so as to attempt to discover what it was in them that was beautiful, to arrest, to immobilise for a time before my senses every intonation of the artist’s voice, every expression of her features; at least I did attempt, by dint of my mental agility in having, before a line came, my attention ready and tuned to catch it, not to waste upon preparations any morsel of the precious time that each word, each gesture occupied, and, thanks to the intensity of my observation, to manage to penetrate as far into them as if I had had whole hours to spend upon them, by myself. But how short their duration was! Scarcely had a sound been received by my ear than it was displaced there by another. In one scene, where Berma stands motionless for a moment, her arm raised to the level of a face bathed, by some piece of stagecraft, in a greenish light, before a back-cloth painted to represent the sea, the whole house broke out in applause; but already the actress had moved, and the picture that I should have liked to study existed no longer. I told my grandmother that I could not see very well; she handed me her glasses. Only, when one believes in the reality of a thing, making it visible by artificial means is not quite the same as feeling that it is close at hand. I thought now that it was no longer Berma at whom I was looking, but her image in a magnifying glass. I put the glasses down, but then possibly the image that my eye received of her, diminished by distance, was no more exact; which of the two Bermas was the real? As for her speech to Hippolyte, I had counted enormously upon that, since, to judge by the ingenious significance which her companions were disclosing to me at every moment in less beautiful parts, she would certainly render it with intonations more surprising than any which, when reading the play at home, I had contrived to imagine; but she did not attain to the heights which Œnone or Aricie would naturally have reached, she planed down into a uniform flow of melody the whole of a passage in which there were mingled together contradictions so striking that the least intelligent of tragic actresses, even the pupils of an academy, could not have missed their effect; besides which, she ran through the speech so rapidly that it was only when she had come to the last line that my mind became aware of the deliberate monotony which she had imposed on it throughout

    Then, at last, a sense of admiration did possess me, provoked by the frenzied applause of the audience. I mingled my own with theirs, endeavouring to prolong the general sound so that Berma, in her gratitude, should surpass herself, and I be certain of having heard her on one of her great days. A curious thing, by the way, was that the moment when this storm of public enthusiasm broke loose was, as I afterwards learned, that in which Berma reveals one of her richest treasures. It would appear that certain transcendent realities emit all around them a radiance to which the crowd is sensitive. So it is that when any great event occurs, when on a distant frontier an army is in jeopardy, or defeated, or victorious, the vague and conflicting reports which we receive, from which an educated man can derive little enlightenment, stimulate in the crowd an emotion by which that man is surprised, and in which, once expert criticism has informed him of the actual military situation, he recognises the popular perception of that ‘aura’ which surrounds momentous happenings, and which may be visible hundreds of miles away. One learns of a victory either after the war is over, or at once, from the hilarious joy of one’s hall porter. One discovers the touch of genius in Berma’s acting a week after one has heard her, in the criticism of some review, or else on the spot, from the thundering acclamation of the stalls. But this immediate recognition by the crowd was mingled with a hundred others, all quite erroneous; the applause came, most often, at wrong moments, apart from the fact that it was mechanically produced by the effect of the applause that had gone before, just as in a storm, once the sea is sufficiently disturbed, it will continue to swell, even after the wind has begun to subside. No matter; the more I applauded, the better, it seemed to me, did Berma act. “I say,” came from a woman sitting near me, of no great social pretensions, “she fairly gives it you, she does; you’d think she’d do herself an injury, the way she runs about. I call that acting, don’t you?” And happy to find these reasons for Berma’s superiority, though not without a suspicion that they no more accounted for it than would for that of the Gioconda or of Benvenuto’s Perseus a peasant’s gaping “That’s a good bit of work. It’s all gold, look! Fine, ain’t it?”, I greedily imbibed the strong wine of this popular enthusiasm. I felt, all the same, when the curtain had fallen fer the last time, disappointed that the pleasure for which I had so longed had been no greater, but at the same time I felt the need to prolong it, not to depart for ever, when I left the theatre, from this strange life of the stage which had, for a few hours, been my own, from which I should be tearing myself away, as though I were going into exile, when I returned to my; own home, had I not hoped there to learn a great deal more about Berma from her admirer, to whom I was indebted already for the permission to go to Phèdre, M. de Norpois. I was introduced to him before dinner by my father, who summoned me into his study for the purpose. As I entered, the Ambassador rose, held out his hand, bowed his tall figure and fixed his blue eyes attentively on my face. As the foreign visitors who used to be presented to him, in the days when he still represented France abroad, were all more or less (even the famous singers) persons of note, with regard to whom he could tell, when he met them, that he would be able to say, later on, when he heard then — names mentioned in Paris or in Petersburg, that he remembered perfectly the evening he had spent with them at Munich or Sofia, he had formed the habit of impressing upon them, by his affability, the pleasure with which he was making their acquaintance; but in addition to this, being convinced that in the life of European capitals, in contact at once with all the interesting personalities that passed through them and with the manners and customs of the native populations, one acquired a deeper insight than could be gained from books into the intellectual movement throughout Europe, he would exercise upon each newcomer his keen power of observation, so as to decide at once with what manner of man he had to deal. The Government had not for some time now entrusted to him a post abroad, but still, as soon as anyone was introduced to him, his eyes, as though they had not yet been informed of their master’s retirement, began their fruitful observation, while by his whole attitude he endeavoured to convey that the stranger’s name was not unknown to him. And so, all the time, while he spoke to me kindly and with the air of importance of a man who is conscious of the vastness of his own experience, he never ceased to examine me with a sagacious curiosity, and to his own profit, as though I had been some exotic custom, some historic and instruct tive building or some ‘star’ upon his course. And in this way he gave proof at once, in his attitude towards me, of the majestic benevolence of the sage Mentor and of the zealous curiosity of the young Anacharsis

    He offered me absolutely no opening to the Revue des Deux-Mondes, but put a number of questions to me on what I had been doing and reading; asked what were my own inclinations, which I heard thus spoken of for the first time as though it might be a quite reasonable thing to obey their promptings, whereas hitherto I had always supposed it to be my duty to suppress them. Since they attracted me towards Literature, he did not dissuade me from that course; on the contrary, he spoke of it with deference, as of some venerable personage whose select circle, in Rome or at Dresden, one remembers with pleasure, and regrets only that one’s multifarious duties in life enable one to revisit it so seldom. He appeared to be envying me, with an almost jovial smile, the delightful hours which, more fortunate than himself and more free, I should be able to spend with such a Mistress. But the very terms that he employed shewed me Literature as something entirely different from the image that I had formed of it at Combray, and I realised that I had been doubly right in abandoning my intention. Until now, I had reckoned only that I had not the ‘gift’ for writing; now M. de Norpois took from me the ambition also. I wanted to express to him what had been my dreams; trembling with emotion, I was painfully apprehensive that all the words which I could utter would not be the sincerest possible equivalent of what I had felt, what I had never yet attempted to formulate; that is to say that my words had no clear significance. Perhaps by a professional habit, perhaps by virtue of the calm that is acquired by every important personage whose advice is commonly sought, and who, knowing that he will keep the control of the conversation in his own hands, allows the other party to fret, to struggle, to take his time; perhaps also to emphasize the dignity of his head (Greek, according to himself, despite his sweeping whiskers), M. de Norpois, while anything was being explained to him, would preserve a facial immobility as absolute as if you had been addressing some ancient and unhearing bust in a museum. Until suddenly, falling upon you like an auctioneer’s hammer, or a Delphic oracle, the Ambassador’s voice, as he replied to you, would be all the more impressive, in that nothing in his face had allowed you to guess what sort of impression you had made on him, or what opinion he was about to express

    “Precisely;” he suddenly began, as though the case were now heard and judged, and after allowing me to writhe in increasing helplessness beneath those motionless eyes which never for an instant left my face. “There is the case of the son of one of my friends, which, mutatis mutandis, is very much like yours.” He adopted in speaking of our common tendency the same reassuring tone as if it had been a tendency not to literature but to rheumatics, and he had wished to assure me that it would not necessarily prove fatal. “He too has chosen to leave the Quai d’Orsay, although the way had been paved for him there by his father, and without caring what people might say, he has settled down to write. And certainly, he’s had no reason to regret it. He published two years ago — of course, he’s much older than you, you understand — a book dealing with the Sense of the Infinite on the Western Shore of Victoria Nyanza, and this year he has brought out a little thing, not so important as the other, but very brightly, in places perhaps almost too pointedly written, on the Repeating Rifle in the Bulgarian Army; and these have put him quite in a class by himself. He’s gone pretty far already, and he’s not the sort of man to stop half way; I happen to know that (without any suggestion, of course, of his standing for election) his name has been mentioned several times, in conversation, and not at all unfavourably, at the Academy of Moral Sciences. And so, one can’t say yet, of course, that he has reached the pinnacle of fame, still he has made his way, by sheer industry, to a very fine position indeed, and success — which doesn’t always come only to agitators and mischief-makers and men who make trouble which is usually more than they are prepared to take — success has crowned his efforts.”

    My father, seeing me already, in a few years’ time, an Academician, was tasting a contentment which M. de Norpois raised to the supreme pitch when, after a momentary hesitation in which he appeared to be calculating the possible consequences of so rash an act, he handed me his card and said: “Why not go and see him yourself? Tell him I sent you. He may be able to give you some good advice,” plunging me by his words into as painful a state of anxiety as if he had told me that, next morning, I was to embark as cabin-boy on board a sailing ship, and to go round the world

    My Aunt Léonie had bequeathed to me, together with all sorts of other things and much of her furniture, with which it was difficult to know what to do, almost all her unsettled estate — revealing thus after her death an affection for me which I had hardly suspected in her lifetime. My father, who was trustee of this estate until I came of age, now consulted M. de Norpois with regard to several of the investments. He recommended certain stocks bearing a low rate of interest, which he considered particularly sound, notably English consols and Russian four per cents. “With absolutely first class securities such as those,” said M. de Norpois, “even if your income from them is nothing very great, you may be certain of never losing any of your capital.” My father then told him, roughly, what else he had bought. M. de Norpois gave a just perceptible smile of congratulation; like all capitalists, he regarded wealth as an enviable thing, but thought it more delicate to compliment people upon their possessions only by a half-indicated sign of intelligent sympathy; on the other hand, as he was himself immensely rich, he felt that he shewed his good taste by seeming to regard as considerable the meagre revenues of his friends, with a happy and comforting resilience to the superiority of his own. He made amends for this by congratulating my father, without hesitation, on the “composition” of his list of investments, selected “with so sure, so delicate, so fine a taste.” You would have supposed, to hear him, that he attributed to the relative values of investments, and even to investments themselves, something akin to aesthetic merit. Of one, comparatively recent and still little known, which my father mentioned, M. de Norpois, like the people who have always read the books of which, you imagine, you yourself alone have ever heard, said at once, “Ah, yes, I used to amuse myself for some time with watching it in the papers; it was quite interesting,” with the retrospective smile of a regular subscriber who has read the latest novel already, in monthly instalments, in his magazine. “It would not be at all a bad idea to apply for some of this new issue. It is distinctly attractive; they are offering it at a most tempting discount.” But when he came to some of the older investments, my father, who could not remember their exact names, which it was easy to confuse with others of the same kind, opened a drawer and shewed the securities themselves to the Ambassador. The sight of them enchanted me. They were ornamented with cathedral spires and allegorical figures, like the old, romantic editions that I had pored over as a child. All the products of one period have something in common; the artists who illustrate the poetry of their generation are the same artists who are employed by the big financial houses. And nothing reminds me so much of the monthly parts of Notre-Dame de Paris, and of various books by Gérard de Nerval, that used to hang outside the grocer’s door at Combray, than does, in its rectangular and flowery border, supported by recumbent river-gods, a ‘personal share’ in the Water Company

    The contempt which my father had for my kind of intelligence was so far tempered by his natural affection for me that, in practice, his attitude towards anything that I might do was one of blind indulgence. And so he had no qualm about telling me to fetch a little ‘prose poem’ which I had made up, years before, at Combray, while coming home from a walk. I had written it down in a state of exaltation which must, I felt certain, infect everyone who read it. But it was not destined to captivate M. de Norpois, for he handed it back to me without a word

    My mother, who had the most profound respect for all my father’s occupations, came in now, timidly, to ask whether dinner might be served. She was afraid to interrupt a conversation in which she herself could have no part. And indeed my father was continually reminding the Marquis of some useful suggestion which they had decided to make at the next meeting of the Commission; speaking in the peculiar tone always adopted, when in a strange environment by a pair of colleagues — as exclusive, in this respect, as two young men from the same college — whose professional routine has furnished them with a common fund of memories to which the others present have no access, and to which they are unwilling to refer before an audience

    But the absolute control over his facial muscles to which M. de Norpois had attained allowed him to listen without seeming to hear a word. At last my father became uneasy. “I had thought,” he ventured, after an endless preamble, “of asking the advice of the Commission . . . ” Then from the face of the noble virtuoso, who had been sitting inert as a player in an orchestra sits until the moment comes for him to begin his part, were uttered, with an even delivery, on a sharp note, and as though they were no more than the completion (but scored for a different voice) of the phrase that my father had begun, the words: “of which you will not hesitate, of course, to call a meeting; more especially as the present members are all known to you personally, and there may be a change any day.” This was not in itself a very remarkable ending. But the immobility that had preceded it made it detach itself with the crystal clarity, the almost malicious unexpectedness of those phrases in which the piano, silent until then,‘takes up at a given moment, the violoncello to which one has just been listening, in a Mozart concerto

    “Well, did you enjoy your matinée?” asked my father, as we moved to the dining-room; meaning me to ‘shew off,’ and with the idea that my enthusiasm would give M. de Norpois a good opinion of me. “He has just been to hear Berma. You remember, we were talking about it the other day,” he went on, turning towards the diplomat, in the same tone of retrospective, technical, mysterious allusiveness as if he had been referring to a meeting of the Commission

    “You must have been enchanted, especially if you had never heard her before. Your father was alarmed at the effect that the little jaunt might have upon your health, which is none too good, I am told, none too robust. But I soon set his mind at rest. Theatres to-day are not what they were even twenty years ago. You have more or less comfortable seats now, and a certain amount of ventilation, although we have still a long way to go before we come up to Germany or England, which in that respect as in many others are immeasurably ahead of us. I have never seen Mme. Berma in Phèdre, but I have always heard that she is excellent in the part. You were charmed with her, of course?”

    M. de Norpois, a man a thousand times more intelligent than myself, must know that hidden truth which I had failed to extract from Berma’s playing; he knew, and would reveal it to me; in answering his question I would implore him to let me know in what that truth consisted; and he would tell me, and so justify me in the longing that I had felt to see and hear the actress. I had only a moment, I must make what use I could of it and bring my cross-examination to bear upon the essential points. But what were they? Fastening my whole attention upon my own so confused impressions, with no thought of making M. de Norpois admire me, but only that of learning from him the truth that I had still to discover, I made no attempt to substitute ready-made phrases for the words that failed me — I stood there stammering, until finally, in the hope of provoking him into declaring what there was in Berma that was admirable, I confessed that I had been disappointed

    “What’s that?” cried my father, annoyed at the bad impression which this admission of my failure to appreciate the performance must make on M. de Norpois, “What on earth do you mean; you didn’t enjoy it? Why, your grandmother has been telling us that you sat there hanging on every word that Berma uttered, with your eyes starting out of your head; that everyone else in the theatre seemed quite bored, beside you.”

    “Oh, yes, I was listening as hard as I could, trying to find out what it was that was supposed to be so wonderful about her. Of course, she’s frightfully good, and all that . . . ”

    “If she is ‘frightfully good,’ what more do you want?”

    “One of the things that have undoubtedly contributed to the success of Mme. Berma,” resumed M. de Norpois, turning with elaborate courtesy towards my mother, so as not to let her be left out of the conversation, and in conscientious fulfilment of his duty of politeness to the lady of the house, “is the perfect taste that she shews in selecting her parts; thus she can always be assured of success, and success of the right sort. She hardly ever appears in anything trivial. Look how she has thrown herself into the part of Phèdre. And then, she brings the same good taste to the choice of her costumes, and to her acting. In spite of her frequent and lucrative tours in England and America, the vulgarity — I will not say of John Bull; that would be unjust, at any rate to the England of the Victorian era — but of Uncle Sam has not infected her. No loud colours, no rant. And then that admirable voice, which has been of such service to her, with which she plays so delightfully — I should almost be tempted to describe it as a musical instrument!”

    My interest in Berma’s acting had continued to grow ever since the fall of the curtain, because it was then no longer compressed within the limits of reality; but I felt the need to find explanations for it; moreover it had been fixed with the same intensity, while Berma was on the stage, upon everything that she offered, in the indivisibility of a living whole, to my eyes and ears; there was nothing separate or distinct; it welcomed, accordingly, the discovery of a reasonable cause in these tributes paid to the simplicity, to the good taste of the actress, it attracted them to itself by its power of absorption, seized hold of them, as the optimism of a drunken man seizes hold of the actions of his neighbour, in each of which he finds an excuse for emotion. “He is right!” I told myself. “What a charming voice, what an absence of shrillness, what simple costumes, what intelligence to have chosen Phèdre. No; I have not been disappointed!”

    The cold beef, spiced with carrots, made its appearance, couched by the Michelangelo of our kitchen upon enormous crystals of jelly, like transparent blocks of quartz

    “You have a chef of the first order, Madame,” said M. de Norpois, “and that is no small matter. I myself, who have had, when abroad, to maintain a certain style in housekeeping, I know how difficult it often is to find a perfect master-cook. But this is a positive banquet that you have set before us!”

    And indeed Françoise, in the excitement of her ambition to make a success, for so distinguished a guest, of a dinner the preparation of which had been obstructed by difficulties worthy of her powers, had given herself such trouble as she no longer took when we were alone, and had recaptured her incomparable Combray manner

    “That is a thing you can’t get in a chophouse — in the best of them, I mean; a spiced beef in which the jelly does not taste of glue and the beef has caught the flavour of the carrots; it is admirable! Allow me to come again,” he went on, making a sign to shew that he wanted more of the jelly. “I should be interested to see how your Vatel managed a dish of quite a different kind; I should like, for instance, to see him tackle a boeuf Stroganoff.”

    M. de Norpois, so as to add his own contribution to the gaiety of the repast, entertained us with a number of the stories with which he was in the habit of regaling his colleagues in “the career,” quoting now some ludicrous sentence uttered by a politician, an old offender, whose sentences were always long and packed with incoherent images, now some monumental epigram of a diplomat, sparkling with attic salt. But, to tell the truth, the criterion which for him set apart these two kinds of phrase in no way resembled that which I was in the habit of applying to literature.. Most of the finer shades escaped me; the words which he repeated with derision seemed to me not to differ very greatly from those which he found remarkable. He belonged to the class of men who, had we come to discuss the books that I liked, would have said: “So you understand that, do you? I must confess that I do not understand, I am not initiated;” but I could have matched his attitude, for I did not grasp the wit or folly, the eloquence or pomposity which he found in a statement or a speech, and the absence of any perceptible reason for one’s being badly and the other’s well expressed made that sort of literature seem more mysterious, more obscure to me than any other. I could distinguish only that to repeat what everybody else was thinking was, in politics, the mark not of an inferior but of a superior mind. When M. de Norpois made use of certain expressions which were ‘common form’ in the newspapers, and uttered them with emphasis, one felt that they became an official pronouncement by the mere fact of his having employed them, and a pronouncement which would provoke a string of comment

    My mother was counting greatly upon the pineapple and truffle salad. But the Ambassador, after fastening for a moment on the confection the penetrating gaze of a trained observer, ate it with the inscrutable discretion of a diplomat, and without disclosing to us what he thought of it. My mother insisted upon his taking some more, which he did, but saying only, in place of the compliment for which she was hoping: “I obey, Madame, for I can see that it is, on your part, a positive ukase!”

    “We saw in the ‘papers that you had a long talk with King Theodosius,” my father ventured

    “Why, yes; the King, who has a wonderful memory for faces, was kind enough to remember, when he noticed me in the stalls, that I had had the honour to meet him on several occasions at the Court of Bavaria, at a time when he had never dreamed of his oriental throne — to which, as you know, he was summoned by a European Congress, and indeed had grave doubts about accepting the invitation, regarding that particular sovereignty as unworthy of his race, the noblest, heraldically speaking, in the whole of Europe. An aide-de-camp came down to bid me pay my respects to his Majesty, whose command I hastened, naturally, to obey.”

    “And I trust, you are satisfied with the results of his visit?”

    “Enchanted! One was justified in feeling some apprehension as to the manner in which a Sovereign who is still so young would handle a situation requiring tact, particularly at this highly delicate juncture. For my own part, I reposed entire confidence in the King’s political sense. But I must confess that he far surpassed my expectations. The speech that he made at the Elysée, which, according to information that has come to me from a most authoritative source, was composed, from beginning to end, by himself, was fully deserving of the interest that it has aroused in all quarters. It was simply masterly; a trifle daring, I quite admit, but with an audacity which, after all, has been fully justified by the event. Traditional diplomacy is all very well in its way, but in practice it has made his country and ours live in an hermetically sealed atmosphere in which it was no longer possible to breathe. Very well! There is one method of letting in fresh air, obviously not one of the methods which one could officially recommend, but one which King Theodosius might allow himself to adopt — and that is to break the windows. Which he accordingly did, with a spontaneous good humour that delighted everybody, and also with an aptness in his choice of words in which one could at once detect the race of scholarly princes from whom he is descended through his mother. There can be no question that when he spoke of the ‘affinities’ that bound his country to France, the expression, rarely as it may occur in the vocabulary of the Chancellories, was a singularly happy one. You see that literary ability is no drawback, even in diplomacy, even upon a throne,” he went on, turning for a moment to myself. “The community of interests had long been apparent, I quite admit, and the relations of the two Powers were excellent. Still, it needed putting into words. The word was what we were all waiting for, it was chosen with marvellous aptitude; you have seen the effect it had. For my part, I must confess I applauded openly.”

    “Your friend M. de Vaugoubert will be pleased, after preparing for the agreement all these years.”

    “All the more so that his Majesty, who is quite incorrigible, really, in some ways, had taken care to spring it on him as a surprise. And it did come as a complete surprise, incidentally, to everyone concerned, beginning with the Foreign Minister himself, who — I have heard — did not find it at all to his liking. It appears that someone spoke to him about it and that he replied, pretty sharply, and loud enough to be overheard by the people on either side of them: ‘I have been neither consulted nor informed!’ indicating clearly by that that he declined to accept any responsibility for the consequences. I must own that the incident has given rise to a great deal of comment, and I should not go so far as to deny,” he went on with a malicious smile, “that certain of my colleagues, for whom the supreme law appears to be that of inertia, may have been shaken from their habitual repose. As for Vaugoubert, you are aware that he has been bitterly attacked for his policy of bringing that country into closer relations with France, which must have been more than ordinarily painful to him, he is so sensitive, such an exquisite nature. I can amply testify to that, since, for all that he is considerably my junior, I have had many dealings with him, we are friends of long standing and I know him intimately. Besides, who could help knowing him? His is a heart of crystal. Indeed, that is the one fault that there is to be found with him; it is not necessary for the heart of a diplomat to be as transparent as all that. Still, that does not prevent their talking of sending him to Rome, which would be a fine rise for him, but a pretty big plum to swallow. Between ourselves, I fancy that Vaugoubert, utterly devoid of ambition as he is, would be very well pleased, and would by no means ask for that cup to pass from him. For all we know, he may do wonders down there; he is the chosen candidate of the Consulta, and for my part I can see him very well placed, with his artistic leanings, in the setting of the Farnese Palace and the Caracci Gallery. At least you would suppose that it was impossible for any one to hate him; but there is a whole camarilla collected round King Theodosius which is more or less held in fief by the Wilhelmstrasse, whose inspiration its members dutifully absorb, and these men have done everything in their power to checkmate him. Not only has Vaugoubert had to face these backstairs intrigues, he has had to endure also the insults of a gang of hireling pamphleteers who later on, being like every subsidised journalist the most arrant cowards, have been the first to cry quits, but in the interval had not shrunk from hurling at our Representative the most fatuous accusations that the wit of irresponsible fools could invent. For a month and more Vaugoubert’s enemies had been dancing round him, howling for his scalp,” M. de Norpois detached this word with shacp emphasis. “But forewarned is forearmed; as for their insults, he spurned them with his foot!” he went on with even more determination, and with so fierce a glare in his eye that for a moment we forgot our food. “In the words of a fine Arab proverb, ‘The dogs may bark; the caravan goes on!’” After launching this quotation M. de Norpois paused and examined our faces, to see what effect it had had upon us. Its effect was great, the proverb being familiar to us already. It had taken the place, that year, among people who ‘really counted,’ of “He who sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind,” which was sorely in need of a rest, not having the perennial freshness of “Working for the King of Prussia.” For the culture of these eminent men was an alternate, if not a tripartite and triennial culture. Of course, the use of quotations such as these, with which M. de Norpois excelled in jewelling his articles in the Revue, was in no way essential to their appearing solid and well-informed. Even without the ornament which the quotations supplied, it sufficed that M. de Norpois should write at a given point (as he never failed to write): “The Court of St. James’s was not the last to be sensible of the peril,” or “Feeling ran high on the Singers’ Bridge, which with anxious eyes was following the selfish but skilful policy of the Dual Monarchy,” or “A cry of alarm sounded from Montecitorio,” or yet again, “That everlasting double-dealing which is so characteristic of the Ballplatz.” By these expressions the profane reader had at once recognised and had paid deference to the diplomat de carrière. But what had made people say that he was something more than that, that he was endowed with a superior culture, had been his careful use of quotations, the perfect example of which, at that date, was still: “Give me a good policy and I will give you good finances, to quote the favourite words of Baron Louis“: for we had not yet imported from the Far East: “Victory is on the side that can hold out a quarter of an hour longer than the other,as the Japanese say.” This reputation for immense literary gifts, combined with a positive genius for intrigue which he kept concealed beneath a mask of indifference, had secured the election of M. de Norpois to the Académie des Sciences Morales. And there were some who even thought that he would riot be out of place in the Académie Française, on the famous day when, wishing to indicate that it was only by drawing the Russian Alliance closer that we could hope to arrive at an understanding with Great Britain, he had not hesitated to write: “Be it clearly understood in the Quai d’Orsay, be it taught henceforward in all the manuals of geography, which appear to be incomplete in this respect, be his certificate of graduation remorselessly withheld from every candidate who has not learned to say, ‘If all roads lead to Rome, nevertheless the way from Paris to London runs of necessity through St. Petersburg.’”

    “In short,” M. de Norpois went on, addressing my father, “Vaugoubert has won himself considerable distinction from this affair, quite beyond anything on which he can have reckoned. He expected, you understand, a correctly worded speech (which, after the storm-clouds of recent years, would have been something to the good) but nothing more. Several persons who had the honour to be present have assured me that it is impossible, when one merely reads the speech, to form any conception of the effect that it produced when uttered — when articulated with marvellous clearness of diction by the King, who is a master of the art of public speaking and in that passage underlined every possible shade of meaning. I allowed myself, in this connexion, to listen to a little anecdote which brings into prominence once again that frank, boyish charm by which King Theo-dosius has won so many hearts. I am assured that, just as he uttered that word ‘affinities,’ which was, of course, the startling innovation of the speech, and one that, as you will see, will provoke discussion in the Chancellories for years to come, his Majesty, anticipating the delight of our Ambassador, who was to find in that word the seal, the crown set upon all his labours, on his dreams, one might almost say, and, in a word, his marshal’s baton, made a half turn towards Vaugoubert and fixing upon him his arresting gaze, so characteristic of the Oettingens, fired at him that admirably chosen word ‘affinities,’ a positive treasure-trove, uttering it in a tone which made it plain to all his hearers that it was employed of set purpose and with full knowledge of the circumstances. It appears that Vaugoubert found some difficulty in mastering his emotion, and I must confess that, to a certain extent, I can well understand it. Indeed, a person who is entirely to be believed has told me, in confidence, that the King came up to Vaugoubert after the dinner, when His Majesty was holding an informal court, and was heard to say, ‘Well, are you satisfied with your pupil, my dear Marquis?’

    “One thing, however,” M. de Norpois concluded, “is certain; and that is that a speech like that has done more than twenty years of negotiation towards bringing the two countries together, uniting their ‘affinities,’ to borrow the picturesque expression of Theodosius II. It is no more than a word, if you like, but look what success it has had, how the whole of the European press is repeating it, what interest it has aroused, what a new note it has struck. Besides it is distinctly in the young Sovereign’s manner. I will not go so far as to say that he lights upon a diamond of that water every day. But it is very seldom that, in his prepared speeches, or better still in the impulsive flow of his conversation, he does not reveal his character — I was on the point of saying ‘does not affix his signature’— by the use of some incisive word. I myself am quite free from any suspicion of partiality in this respect, for I am stoutly opposed to all innovations in terminology. Nine times out of ten they are most dangerous.”

    “Yes, I was thinking, only the other day, that the German Emperor’s telegram could not be much to your liking,” said my father

    M. de Norpois raised his eyes to heaven, as who should say, “Oh, that fellow!” before he replied: “In the first place, it is an act of ingratitude. It is more than a crime; it is a blunder, and one of a crassness which I can describe only as pyramidal! Indeed, unless some one puts a check on his activities, the man who has got rid of Bismarck is quite capable of repudiating by degrees the whole of the Bismarckian policy; after which it will be a leap in the dark.”

    “My husband tells me, sir, that you are perhaps going to take him to Spain one summer; that will be nice for him; I am so glad.”

    “Why, yes; it is an idea that greatly attracts me; I amuse myself, planning a tour. I should like to go there with you, my dear fellow. But what about you, Madame; have you decided yet how you are going to spend your holidays?”

    “I shall perhaps go with my son to Balbec, but I am not certain.”

    “Oh, but Balbec is quite charming, I was down that way a few years ago. They are beginning to build some very pretty little-villas there; I think you’ll like the place. But may I ask what has made you choose Balbec?”

    “My son is very anxious to visit some of the churches in that neighbourhood, and Balbec church in particular. I was a little afraid that the tiring journey there, and the discomfort of staying in the place might be too much for him. But I hear that they have just opened an excellent hotel, in which he will be able to get all the comfort that he requires.”

    “Indeed! I must make a note of that, for a certain person who will not turn up her nose at a comfortable hotel.”

    “The church at Balbec is very beautiful, sir, is it not?” I inquired, repressing my sorrow at learning that one of the attractions of Balbec consisted in its pretty little villas

    “No, it is not bad; but it cannot be compared for a moment with such positive jewels in stone as the Cathedrals of Rheims and Chartres, or with what is to my mind the pearl among them all, the Sainte-Chapelle here in Paris.”

    “But, surely, Balbec church is partly romanesque, is it not?”

    “Why, yes, it is in the romanesque style, which is to say very cold and lifeless, with no hint in it anywhere of the grace, the fantasy of the later gothic builders, who worked their stone as if it had been so much lace. Balbec church is well worth a visit, if you are in those parts; it is decidedly quaint; on a wet day, when you have nothing better to do, you might look inside; you will see the tomb of Tourville.”

    “Tell me, were you at the Foreign Ministry dinner last night?” asked my father. “I couldn’t go.”

    “No,” M. de Norpois smiled, “I must confess that I renounced it for a party of a very different sort. I was dining with a lady whose name you may possibly have heard, the beautiful Mme. Swann.” My mother checked an impulsive movement, for, being more rapid in perception than my father, she used to alarm herself on his account over things which only began to upset him a moment later. Anything unpleasant that might occur to him was discovered first by her, just as bad news from France is always known abroad sooner than among ourselves. But she was curious to know what sort of people the Swanns managed to entertain, and so inquired of M. de Norpois as to whom he had met there

    “Why, my dear lady, it is a house which (or so it struck me) is especially attractive to gentlemen. There were several married men there last night, but their wives were all, as it happened, unwell, and so had not come with them,” replied the Ambassador with a mordancy sheathed in good-humour, casting on each of us a glance the gentleness and discretion of which appeared to be tempering while in reality they deftly intensified its malice

    “In all fairness,” he went on, “I must add that women do go to the house, but women who belong rather — what shall I say — to the Republican world than to Swann’s” (he pronounced it “Svann’s”) “circle. Still, you can never tell. Perhaps it will turn into a political or a literary salon some day. Anyhow, they appear to be quite happy as they are. Indeed, I feel that Swann advertises his happiness just a trifle too blatantly. He told us the names of all the people who had asked him and his wife out for the next week, people with whom there was no particular reason to be proud of being intimate, with a want of reserve, of taste, almost of tact which I was astonished to remark in so refined a man. He kept on repeating, ‘We haven’t a free evening!’ as though that had been a thing to boast of, positively like a parvenu, and he is certainly not that. For Swann had always plenty of friends, women as well as men, and without seeming over-bold, without the least wish to appear indiscreet, I think I may safely say that not all of them, of course, nor even the majority of them, but one at least, who is a lady of the very highest rank, would perhaps not have shewn herself inexorably averse from the idea of entering upon relations with Mme. Swann, in which case it is safe to assume that more than one sheep of the social flock would have followed her lead. But it seems that there has been no indication on Swann’s part of any movement in that direction

    “What do I see? A Nesselrode pudding! As well! I declare, I shall need a course at Carlsbad after such a Lucullus-feast as this

    “Possibly Swann felt that there would be too much resistance to overcome. The marriage — so much is certain — was not well received. There has been some talk of his wife’s having money, but that is all humbug. Anyhow, the whole affair has been looked upon with disfavour. And then, Swann has an aunt who is excessively rich and in an admirable position socially, married to a man who, financially speaking, is a power. Not only has she refused to meet Mme. Swann, she has actually started a campaign to force her friends and acquaintances to do the same. I do not mean to say that anyone who moves in a good circle in Paris has shewn any actual incivility to Mme. Swann. . . . No! A hundred times no! Quite apart from her husband’s being eminently a man to take up the challenge. Anyhow, there is one curious thing about it, to see the immense importance that Swann, who knows so many and such exclusive people, attaches to a society of which the best that can be said is that it is extremely mixed. I myself, who knew him in the old days, must admit that I felt more astonished than amused at seeing a man so well-bred as he is, so much at home in the best houses, effusively thanking the Chief Secretary to the Minister of Posts for having come to them, and asking him whether Mme. Swann might take the liberty of calling upon his wife. He must feel something of an exile, don’t you know; evidently, it’s quite a different world. I don’t think, all the same, that Swann is unhappy. It is true that for some years before the marriage she was always trying to blackmail him in a rather disgraceful way; she would take the child away whenever Swann refused her anything. Poor Swann, who is as unsophisticated as he is, for all that, sharp, believed every time that the child’s disappearance was a coincidence, and declined to face the facts. Apart from that, she made such continual scenes that everyone expected that, from the day she attained her object and was safely married, nothing could possibly restrain her and that their life would be a hell on earth. Instead of which, just the opposite has happened. People are inclined to laugh at the way in which Swann speaks of his wife; it’s become a standing joke. Of course, one could hardly expect that, conscious, more or less of being a —(you remember Molière’s line) he would go and proclaim it urbi et orbi; still that does not prevent one from finding a tendency in him to exaggerate when he declares that she makes an excellent wife. And yet that is not so far from the truth as people imagine. In her own way — which is not, perhaps, what all husbands would prefer, but then, between you and me, I find it difficult to believe that Swann, who has known her for ever so long and is far from being an utter fool, did not know what to expect — there can be no denying that she does seem to have a certain regard for him. I do not say that she is not flighty, and Swann himself has no fault to find with her for that, if one is to believe the charitable tongues which, as you may suppose, continue to wag. But she is distinctly grateful to him for what he has done for her, and, despite the fears that were everywhere expressed of the contrary, her temper seems to have become angelic.”

    This alteration was perhaps not so extraordinary as M. de Norpois professed to find it. Odette had not believed that Swann would ever consent to marry her; each time that she made the suggestive announcement that some man about town had just married his mistress she had seen him stiffen into a glacial silence, or at the most, if she were directly to challenge him, asking: “Don’t you think it very nice, a very fine thing that he has done, for a woman who sacrificed all her youth to him?” had heard him answer dryly: “But I don’t say that there’s anything wrong in it. Everyone does what he himself thinks right.” She came very near, indeed, to believing that (as he used to threaten in moments of anger) he was going to leave her altogether, for she had heard it said, not long since, by a woman sculptor, that “You cannot be surprised at anything men do, they’re such brutes,” and impressed by the profundity of this maxim of pessimism she had appropriated it for herself, and repeated it on every possible occasion with an air of disappointment which seemed to imply: “After all, it’s not impossible in any way; it would be just my luck.” Meanwhile all the virtue had gone from the optimistic maxim which had hitherto guided Odette through life: “You can do anything with men when they’re in love with you, they’re such idiots!” a doctrine which was expressed on her face by the same tremor of an eyelid that might have accompanied such words as: “Don’t be frightened; he won’t break anything.” While she waited, Odette was tormented by the thought of what one of her friends, who had been married by a man who had not lived with her for nearly so long as Odette herself had lived with Swann, and had had no child by him, and who was now in a definitely respectable position, invited to the balls at the Elysée and so forth, must think of Swann’s behaviour. A consultant more discerning than M. de Norpois would doubtless have been able to diagnose that it was this feeling of shame and humiliation that had embittered Odette, that the devilish characteristics which she displayed were no essential part of her, no irremediable evil, and so would easily have foretold what had indeed come to pass, namely that a new rule of life, the matrimonial, would put an end, with almost magic swiftness, to these painful incidents, of daily occurrence but in no sense organic. Practically everyone was surprised at the marriage, and this, in itself, is surprising. No doubt very few people understand the purely subjective nature of the phenomenon that we call love, or how it creates, so to speak, a fresh, a third, a supplementary person, distinct from the person whom the world knows by the same name, a person most of whose constituent elements are derived from ourself, the lover. And so there are very few who can regard as natural the enormous proportions that a creature comes to assume in our eyes who is not the same as the creature that they see. It would appear, none the less, that so far as Odette was concerned people might have taken into account the fact that if, indeed, she had never entirely understood Swann’s mentality, at least she was acquainted with the titles, and with all the details of his studies, so much so that the name of Vermeer was as familiar to her as that of her own dressmaker; while as for Swann himself she knew intimately those traits of character of which the rest of the world must remain ignorant or merely laugh at them, and only a mistress or a sister may gain possession of the revealing, cherished image; and so strongly are we attached to such eccentricities, even to those of them which we are most anxious to correct, that it is because a woman comes in time to acquire an indulgent, an affectionately mocking familiarity, such as we ourselves have with them, or our relatives have, that amours of long standing have something of the sweetness and strength of family affection. The bonds that unite us to another creature receive their consecration when that creature adopts the same point of view as ourself in judging one of our imperfections. And among these special traits there were others, besides, which belonged as much to his intellect as to his character, which, all the same, because they had their roots in the latter, Odette had been able more easily to discern. She complained that when Swann turned author, when he published his essays, these characteristics were not to be found in them as they were in his letters, or in his conversation, where they abounded. She urged him to give them a more prominent place. She would have liked that because it was these things that she herself preferred in him, but since she preferred them because they were the things most typical of himself, she was perhaps not wrong in wishing that they might be found in his writings. Perhaps also she thought that his work, if endowed with more vitality, so that it ultimately brought him success, might enable her also to form what at the Verdurins’ she had been taught to value above everything else in the world — a salon

    Among the people to whom this sort of marriage appeared ridiculous, people who in their own case would ask themselves, “What will M. de Guermantes think, what will Bréauté say when I marry Mlle, de Montmorency?”, among the people who cherished that sort of social ideal would have figured, twenty years earlier, Swann himself, the Swarm who had taken endless pains to get himself elected to the Jockey Club, and had reckoned at that time on making a brilliant marriage which, by consolidating his position, would have made him one of the most conspicuous figures in Paris. Only, the visions which a marriage like that suggests to the mind of the interested party need, like all visions, if they are not to fade away and be altogether lost, to receive sustenance from without. Your most ardent longing is to humiliate the man who has insulted you. But if you never hear of him again, having removed to some other place, your enemy will come to have no longer the slightest importance for you. If one has lost sight for a score of years of all the people on whose account one would have liked to be elected to the Jockey Club or the Institute, the prospect of becoming a member of one or other of those corporations will have ceased to tempt one. Now fully as much as retirement, ill-health or religious conversion, protracted relations with a woman will substitute fresh visions for the old. There was not on Swann’s part, when he married Odette, any renunciation of his social ambitions, for from these ambitions Odette had long ago, in the spiritual sense of the word, detached him. Besides, had he not been so detached, his marriage would have been all the more creditable. It is because they imply the sacrifice of a more or less advantageous position to a purely private happiness that, as a general rule, ‘impossible’ marriages are the happiest of all. (One cannot very well include among the ‘impossible’ marriages those that are made for money, there being no instance on record of a couple, of whom the wife or even the husband has thus sold himself, who have not sooner or later been admitted into society, if only by tradition, and on the strength of so many precedents, and so as not to have two conflicting standards.) Perhaps, on the other hand, the artistic, if not the perverse side of Swann’s nature would in any event have derived a certain amount of pleasure from coupling with himself, in one of those crossings of species such as Mendelians practise and mythology records, a creature of a different race, archduchess or prostitute, from contracting a royal alliance or from marrying beneath him. There had been but one person in all the world whose opinion he took into consideration whenever he thought of his possible marriage with Odette; that was, and from no snobbish motive, the Duchesse de Guermantes. With whom Odette, on the contrary, was but little concerned, thinking only of those people whose position was immediately above her own, rather than in so vague an empyrean. But when Swann in his daydreams saw Odette as already his wife he invariably formed a picture of the moment in which he would take her — her, and above all her daughter — to call upon the Princesse des Laumes (who was shortly, on the death of her father-in-law, to become Duchesse de Guermantes). He had no desire to introduce them anywhere else, but his heart would soften as he invented — uttering their actual words to himself — all the things that the Duchess would say of him to Odette, and Odette to the Duchess, the affection that she would shew for Gilberte, spoiling her, making him proud of his child. He enacted to himself the scene of this introduction with the same precision in each of its imaginary details that people shew when they consider how they would spend, supposing they were to win it, a lottery prize the amount of which they have arbitrarily determined. In so far as a mental picture which accompanies one of our resolutions may be said to be its motive, so it might be said that if Swann married Odette it was in order to present her and Gilberte, without anyone’s else being present, without, if need be, anyone’s else ever coming to know of it, to the Duchesse de Guermantes. We shall see how this sole social ambition that he had entertained for his wife and daughter was precisely that one the realisation of which proved to be forbidden him by a veto so absolute that Swann died in the belief that the Duchess would never possibly come to know them. We shall see also that, on the contrary, the Duchesse de Guermantes did associate with Odette and Gilberte after the death of Swann. And doubtless he would have been wiser — seeing that he could attach so much importance to so small a matter — not to have formed too dark a picture of tie future, in this connexion, but to have consoled himself with the hope that the meeting of the ladies might indeed take place when he was no longer there to enjoy it. The laborious process of causation which sooner or later will bring about every possible effect, including (consequently) those which one had believed to be most nearly impossible, naturally slow at times, is rendered slower still by our impatience (which in seeking to accelerate only obstructs it) and by our very existence, and comes to fruition only when we have ceased to desire it — have ceased, possibly, to live. Was not Swann conscious of this from his own experience, had there not been already, in his life, as it were a préfiguration of what was to happen after his death, a posthumous happiness in this marriage with this Odette whom he had passionately loved — even if she had not been pleasing to him at first sight — whom he had married when he no longer loved her, when the creature that, in Swann, had so longed to live, had so despaired of living all its life in company with Odette, when that creature was extinct?

    I began next to speak of the Comte de Paris, to ask whether he was not one of Swann’s friends, for I was afraid lest the conversation should drift away from him. “Why, yes!” replied M. de Norpois, turning towards me and fixing upon my modest person the azure gaze in which floated, as in their vital element, his immense capacity for work and his power of assimilation. And “Upon my word,” he added, once more addressing my father, “I do not think that I shall be overstepping the bounds of the respect which I have always professed for the Prince (although without, you understand, maintaining any personal relations with him, which would inevitably compromise my position, unofficial as that may be), if I tell you of a little episode which is not without point; no more than four years ago, at a small railway station in one of the countries of Central Europe, the Prince happened to set eyes on Mme. Swann. Naturally, none of his circle ventured to ask his Royal Highness what he thought of her. That would not have been seemly. But when her name came up by chance in conversation, by certain signs — imperceptible, if you like, but quite unmistakable — the Prince appeared willing enough to let it be understood that his impression of her had, in a word, been far from unfavourable.”

    “But there could have been no possibility, surely, of her being presented to the Comte de Paris?” inquired my father

    “Well, we don’t know; with Princes one never does know,” replied M. de Norpois. “The most exalted, those who know best how to secure what is due to them, are as often as not the last to let themselves be embarrassed by the decrees of popular opinion, even by those for which there is most justification, especially when it is a question of their rewarding a personal attachment to themselves. Now it is certain that the Comte de Paris has always most graciously recognised the devotion of Swann, who is, for that matter, a man of character, in spite of it all.”

    “And what was your own impression, your Excellency? Do tell us!” my mother asked, from politeness as well as from curiosity

    All the energy of the old connoisseur broke through the habitual moderation of his speech as he answered: “Quite excellent!”

    And knowing that the admission that a strong impression has been made on one by a woman takes its place, provided that one makes it in a playful tone, in a certain category of the art of conversation that is highly appreciated, he broke into a little laugh that lasted for several seconds, moistening the old diplomat’s blue eyes and making his nostrils, with their network of tiny scarlet veins, quiver. “She is altogether charming!”

    “Was there a writer of the name of Bergotte at this dinner, sir?” I asked timidly, still trying to keep the conversation to the subject of the Swanns

    “Yes, Bergotte was there,” replied M. de Norpois, inclining his head courteously towards me, as though in his desire to be pleasant to my father he attached to everything connected with him a real importance, even to the questions of a boy of my age who was not accustomed to see such politeness shewn to him by persons of his. “Do you know him?” he went on, fastening on me that clear gaze, the penetration of which had won the praise of Bismarck

    “My son does not know him, but he admires his work immensely,” my mother explained

    “Good heavens!” exclaimed M. de Norpois, inspiring me with doubts of my own intelligence far more serious than those that ordinarily distracted me, when I saw that what I valued a thousand thousand times more than myself, what I regarded as the most exalted thing in the world, was for him at the very foot of the scale of admiration. “I do not share your son’s point of view. Bergotte is what I call a flute-player: one must admit that he plays on it very agreeably, although with a great deal of mannerism, of affectation. But when all is said, it is no more than that, and that is nothing very great. Nowhere does one find in his enervated writings anything that could be called construction. No action — or very little — but above all no range. His books fail at the foundation, or rather they have no foundation at all. At a time like the present, when the ever-increasing complexity of life leaves one scarcely a moment for reading, when the map of Europe has undergone radical alterations, and is on the eve, very probably, of undergoing others more drastic still, when so many new and threatening problems are arising on every side, you will allow me to suggest that one is entitled to ask that a writer should be something else than a fine intellect which makes us forget, amid otiose and byzantine discussions of the merits of pure form, that we may be overwhelmed at any moment by a double tide of barbarians, those from without and those from within our borders. I am aware that this is a blasphemy against the sacrosanct school of what these gentlemen term ‘Art for Art’s sake,’ but at this period of history there are tasks more urgent than the manipulation of words in a harmonious manner. Not that Bergotte’s manner is not now and then quite attractive. I have no fault to find with that, but taken as a whole, it is all very precious, very thin, and has very little virility. I can now understand more easily, when I bear in mind your altogether excessive regard for Bergotte, the few lines that you shewed me just now, which it would have been unfair to you not to overlook, since you yourself told me, in all simplicity, that they were merely a childish scribbling.” (I had, indeed, said so, but I did not think anything of the sort.) “For every sin there is forgiveness, and especially for the sins of youth. After all, others as well as yourself have such sins upon their conscience, and you are not the only one who has believed himself to be a poet in his day. But one can see in what you have shewn me the evil influence of Bergotte. You will not, of course, be surprised when I say that there was in it none of his good qualities, since he is a past-master in the art — incidentally quite superficial — of handling a certain style of which, at your age, you cannot have acquired even the rudiments. But already there is the same fault, that paradox of stringing together fine-sounding words and only afterwards troubling about what they mean. That is putting the cart before the horse, even in Bergotte’s books. All those Chinese puzzles of form, all these deliquescent mandarin subtleties seem to me to be quite futile. Given a few fireworks, let off prettily enough by an author, and up goes the shout of genius. Works of genius are not so common as all that! Bergotte cannot place to his credit — does not carry in his baggage, if I may use the expression — a single novel that is at all lofty in its conception, any of those books which one keeps in a special corner of one’s library. I do not discover one such in the whole of his work. But that does not exclude the fact that, with him, the work is infinitely superior to the author. Ah! there is a man who justifies the wit who insisted that one ought never to know an author except through his books. It would be impossible to imagine an individual who corresponded less to his — more pretentious, more pompous, less fitted for human society. Vulgar at some moments, at others talking like a book, and not even like one of his own, but like a boring book, which his, to do them justice, are not — such is your Bergotte. He has the most confused mind, alembicated, what our ancestors called a diseur de phébus, and he makes the things that he says even more unpleasant by the manner in which he says them. I forget for the moment whether it is Loménie or Sainte-Beuve who tells us that Vigny repelled people by the same eccentricity. But Bergotte has never given us a Cinq-Mars, or a Cachet Rouge, certain pages of which are regular anthology pieces.”

    Paralysed by what M. de Norpois had just said to me with regard to the fragment which I had submitted to him, and remembering at the same time the difficulties that I experienced when I attempted to write an essay or merely to devote myself to serious thought, I felt conscious once again of my intellectual nullity and that I was not born for a literary life. Doubtless in the old days at Combray certain impressions of a very humble order, or a few pages of Bergotte used to plunge me into a state of musing which had appeared to me to be of great value. But this state was what my poem in prose reflected; there could be no doubt that M. de Norpois had at once grasped and had seen through the fallacy of what I had discovered to be beautiful simply by a mirage that must be entirely false since the Ambassador had not been taken in by it. He had shewn me, on the other hand, what an infinitely unimportant place was mine when I was judged from outside, objectively, by the best-disposed and most intelligent of experts. I felt myself to be struck speechless, overwhelmed; and my mind, like a fluid which is without dimensions save those of the vessel that is provided for it, just as it had been expanded a moment ago so as to fill all the vast capacity of genius, contracted now, was entirely contained in the straitened mediocrity in which M. de Norpois had of a sudden enclosed and sealed it

    “Our first introduction — I speak of Bergotte and myself ——” he resumed, turning to my father, “was somewhat beset with thorns (which is, after all, only another way of saying that it was not lacking in points). Bergotte — some years ago, now — paid a visit to Vienna while I was Ambassador there; he was presented to me by the Princess Metternich, came and wrote his name, and expected to be asked to the Embassy. Now, being in a foreign country as the Representative of France, to which he has after all done some honour by his writings, to a certain extent (let us say, to be quite accurate, to a very slight extent), I was prepared to set aside the unfavourable opinion that I hold of his private life. But he was not travelling alone, and he actually let it be understood that he was not to be invited without his companion. I trust that I am no more of a prude than most men, and, being a bachelor, I was perhaps in a position to throw open the doors of the Embassy a little wider than if I had been married and the father of a family. Nevertheless, I must admit that there are depths of degradation to which I should hesitate to descend, while these are rendered more repulsive still by the tone, not moral, merely — let us be quite frank and say moralising — that Bergotte takes up in his books, where one finds nothing but perpetual and, between ourselves, somewhat wearisome analyses, torturing scruples, morbid remorse, and all for the merest peccadilloes, the most trivial naughtinesses (as one knows from one’s own experience), while all the time he is shewing such an utter lack of conscience and so much cynicism in his private life. To cut a long story short, I evaded the responsibility, the Princess returned to the charge, but without success. So that I do not suppose that I appear exactly in the odour of sanctity to the gentleman, and I am not sure how far he appreciated Swann’s kindness in inviting him and myself on the same evening. Unless of course it was he who asked for the invitation. One can never tell, for really he is not normal. Indeed that is his sole excuse.”

    “And was Mme. Swann’s daughter at the dinner?” I asked M. de Norpois, taking advantage, to put this question, of a moment in which, as we all moved towards the drawing-room, I could more easily conceal my emotion than would have been possible at table, where I was held fast in the glare of the lamplight

    M. de Norpois appeared to be trying for a moment to remember; then: “Yes, you mean a young person of fourteen or fifteen? Yes, of course, I remember now that she was introduced to me before dinner as the daughter of our Amphitryon. I may tell you that I saw but little of her; she retired to bed early. Or else she went out to see a friend — I forget. But I can see that you are very intimate with the Swann household.”

    “I play with Mlle. Swann in the Champs-Elysées, and she is delightful.”

    “Oh! so that is it, is it? But I assure you, I thought her charming. I must confess to you, however, that I do not believe that she will ever be anything like her mother, if I may say as much without wounding you in a vital spot.”

    “I prefer Mlle. Swann’s face, but I admire her mother, too, enormously; I go for walks in the Bois simply in the hope of seeing her pass.”

    “Ah! But I must tell them that; they will be highly flattered.”

    While he was uttering these words, and for a few seconds after he had uttered them, M. de Norpois was still in the same position as anyone else who, hearing me speak of Swann as an intelligent man, of his family as respectable stockbrokers, of his house as a fine house, imagined that I would speak just as readily of another man equally intelligent, of other stockbrokers equally respectable, of another house equally fine; it was the moment in which a sane man who is talking to a lunatic has not yet perceived that his companion is mad. M. de Norpois knew that there was nothing unnatural in the pleasure which one derived from looking at pretty women, that it was a social convention, when anyone spoke to you of a pretty woman with any fervour, to pretend to think that he was in love with her, and to promise to further his designs. But in saying that he would speak of me to Gilberte and her mother (which would enable me, like an Olympian deity who has taken on the fluidity of a breath of wind, or rather the aspect of the old greybeard whose form Minerva borrows, to penetrate, myself, unseen, into Mme. Swann’s drawing-room, to attract her attention, to occupy her thoughts, to arouse her gratitude for my admiration, to appear before her as the friend of an important person, to seem to her worthy to be invited by her in the future and to enter into the intimate life of her family), this important person who was going to make use, in my interests, of the great influence which he must have with Mme. Swann inspired in me suddenly an affection so compelling that I had difficulty in restraining myself from kissing his gentle hands, white and crumpled, which looked as though they had been left lying too long in water. I even sketched in the air an outline of that impulsive movement, but this I supposed that I alone had observed. For it is difficult for any of us to calculate exactly on what scale his words or his gestures are apparent to others. Partly from the fear of exaggerating our own importance, and also because we enlarge to enormous proportions the field over which the impressions formed by other people in the course of their lives are obliged to extend, we imagine that the accessories of our speech and attitudes scarcely penetrate the consciousness, still less remain in the memory of those with whom we converse, It is, we may suppose, to a prompting of this sort that criminals yield when they ‘touch up’ the wording of a statement already made, thinking that the new variant cannot be confronted with any existing version. But it is quite possible that, even in what concerns the millennial existence of the human race, the philosophy of the journalist, according to which everything is destined to oblivion, is less true than a contrary philosophy which would predict the conservation of everything. In the same newspaper in which the moralist of the ‘Paris column’ says to us of an event, of a work of art, all the more forcibly of a singer who has enjoyed her ‘crowded hour’: “Who will remember this in ten years’ time?” overleaf does not the report of the Académie des Inscriptions speak often of a fact, in itself of smaller importance, of a poem of little merit, which dates from the epoch of the Pharaohs and is now known again in its entirety? Is it not, perhaps, just the same in our brief life on earth? And yet, some years later, in a house in which M. de Norpois, who was also calling there, had seemed to me the most solid support that I could hope to find, because he was the friend of my father, indulgent, inclined to wish us all well, and besides, by his profession and upbringing, trained to discretion, when, after the Ambassador had gone, I was told that he had alluded to an evening long ago when he had seen the moment in which I was just going to kiss his hands, not only did I colour up to the roots of my hair but I was stupefied to learn how different from all that I had believed were not only the manner in which M. de Norpois spoke of me but also the constituents of his memory: this tittle-tattle enlightened me as to the incalculable proportions of absence and presence of mind, of recollection and forgetfulness which go to form the human intelligence; and I was as marvellously surprised as on the day on which I read for the first time, in one of Maspero’s books, that we had an exact list of the sportsmen whom Assurbanipal used to invite to his hunts, a thousand years before the Birth of Christ

    “Oh, sir,” I assured M. de Norpois, when he told me that he would inform Gilberte and her mother how much I admired them, “if you would do that, if you would speak of me to Mme. Swann, my whole life would not be long enough for me to prove my gratitude, and that life would be all at your service. But I feel bound to point out to you that I do not know Mme. Swann, and that I have never been introduced to her.”

    I had added these last words from a scruple of conscience, and so as not to appear to be boasting of an acquaintance which I did not possess. But while I was uttering them I felt that they were already superfluous, for from the beginning of my speech of thanks, with its chilling ardour, I had seen flitting across the face of the Ambassador an expression of hesitation and dissatisfaction, and in his eyes that vertical, narrow, slanting look (like, in the drawing of a solid body in perspective, the receding line of one of its surfaces), that look which one addresses to the invisible audience whom one has within oneself at the moment when one is saying something that one’s other audience, the person whom one has been addressing — myself, in this instance — is not meant to hear. I realised in a flash that these phrases which I had pronounced, which, feeble as they were when measured against the flood of gratitude that was coursing through me, had seemed to me bound to touch M. de Norpois and to confirm his decision upon an intervention which would have given him so little trouble and me so much joy, were perhaps (out of all those that could have been chosen, with diabolical malice, by persons anxious to do me harm) the only ones that could result in making him abandon his intention. Indeed, when he heard me speak, just as at the moment when a stranger with whom we have been exchanging — quite pleasantly — our impressions, which we might suppose to be similar to his, of the passers-by, whom we have agreed in regarding as vulgar, reveals suddenly the pathological abyss that divides him from us by adding carelessly, as he runs his hand over his pocket: “What a pity, I haven’t got my revolver here; I could have picked off the lot!” M. de Norpois, who knew that nothing was less costly or more easy than to be commended to Mme. Swann and taken to her house, and saw that to me, on the contrary, such favours bore so high a price and were consequently, no doubt, of great difficulty, thought that the desire, apparently normal, which I had expressed must cloak some different thought, some suspect intention, some pre-existent fault, on account of which, in the certainty of displeasing Mme. Swann, no one hitherto had been willing to undertake the responsibility for conveying a message to her from me. And I understood that this office was one which he would never discharge, that he might see Mme. Swann daily, for years to come, without ever mentioning my name. He did indeed ask her, a few days later, for some information which I required, and charged my father to convey it to me. But he had not thought it his duty to tell her at whose instance he was inquiring. So she would never discover that I knew M. de Norpois and that I hoped so greatly to be asked to her house; and this was perhaps a less misfortune than I supposed. For the second of these discoveries would probably not have added much to the efficacy, in any event uncertain, of the first. In Odette the idea of her own life and of her home awakened no mysterious disturbance; a person who knew her, who came to see her, did not seem to her a fabulous creature such as he seemed to me who would have flung a stone through Swann’s windows if I could have written upon it that I knew M. de Norpois; I was convinced that such a message, even when transmitted in so brutal a fashion, would have done far more to exalt me in the eyes of the lady of the house than it would have prejudiced her against me. But even if I had been capable of understanding that the mission which M. de Norpois did not perform must have remained futile, nay, more than that, might even have damaged my credit with the Swanns, I should not have had the courage, had he shewn himself consenting, to release the Ambassador from it, and to renounce the pleasure — however fatal its consequences might prove — of feeling that my name and my person were thus brought for a moment into Gilberte’s presence, in her unknown life and home

    After M. de Norpois had gone my father cast an eye over the evening paper; I dreamed once more of Berma. The pleasure which I had found in listening to her required to be made complete, all the more because it had fallen far short of what I had promised myself; and so it at once assimilated everything that was capable of giving it nourishment, those merits, for uir stance, which M. de Norpois had admitted that Berma possessed, and which my mind had absorbed at one draught, like a dry lawn when water is poured on it. Then my father handed me the newspaper, pointing me out a paragraph which ran more or less as follows:—-

    The performance of Phèdre, given this afternoon before an enthusiastic audience, which included the foremost representatives of society and the arts, as well as the principal critics, was for Mme. Berma, who played the heroine, the occasion of a triumph as brilliant as any that she has known in the course of her phenomenal career. We shall discuss more fully in a later issue this performance, which is indeed an event in the history of the stage; for the present we need only add that the best qualified judges are unanimous in the pronouncement that such an interpretation sheds an entirely new light on the part of Phèdre, which is one of the finest and most studied of Racine’s creations, and that it constitutes the purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art which it has been the privilege of our generation to witness

    Immediately my mind had conceived this new idea of “the purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art,” it, the idea, sped to join the imperfect pleasure which I had felt in the theatre, added to it a little of what was lacking, and their combination formed something so exalting that I cried out within myself: “What a great artist!” It may doubtless be argued that I was not absolutely sincere. But let us bear in mind, rather, the numberless writers who, dissatisfied with the page which they have just written, if they read some eulogy of the genius of Chateaubriand, or evoke the spirit of some great artist whose equal they aspire to be, by humming to themselves, for instance, a phrase of Beethoven, the melancholy of which they compare with what they have been trying to express in prose, are so filled with that idea of genius that they add it to their own productions, when they think of them once again, see them no longer in the light in which at first they appeared, and, hazarding an act of faith in the value of their work, say to themselves: “After all!” without taking into account that, into the total which determines their ultimate satisfaction, they have introduced the memory of marvellous pages of Chateaubriand which they assimilate to their own, but of which, in cold fact, they are not the authors; let us bear in mind the numberless men who believe in the love of a mistress on the evidence only of her betrayals; all those, too, who are sustained by the alternative hopes, either of an incomprehensible survival of death, when they think, inconsolable husbands, of the wives whom they have lost but have not ceased to love, or, artists, of the posthumous glory which they may thus enjoy; or else the hope of complete extinction which comforts them when their thoughts turn to the misdeeds that otherwise they must expiate after death; let us bear in mind also the travellers who come home enraptured by the general beauty of a tour of which, from day to day, they have felt nothing but the tedious incidents; and let us then declare whether, in the communal life that is led by our ideas in the enclosure of our minds, there is a single one of those that make us most happy which has not first sought, a very parasite, and won from an alien but neighbouring idea the greater part of the strength that it originally lacked

    My mother appeared none too well pleased that my father no longer thought of ‘the career’ for myself. I fancy that, anxious before all things that a definite rule of life should discipline the eccentricity of my nervous system, what she regretted was not so much seeing me abandon diplomacy as the prospect of my devoting myself to literature. But “Let him alone!” my father protested; “the main thing is that a man should find pleasure in his work. He is no longer a child. He knows pretty well now what he likes, it is not at all probable that he will change, and he is quite capable of deciding for himself what will make him happy in life.” That evening, as I waited for the time to arrive when, thanks to the freedom of choice which they allowed me, I should or should not begin to be happy in life, my father’s words caused me great uneasiness. At all times his unexpected kindnesses had, when they were manifested, prompted in me so keen a desire to kiss, above where his beard began, his glowing cheeks, that if I did not yield to that desire, it was simply because I was afraid of annoying him. And on that day, as an author becomes alarmed when he sees the fruits of his own meditation, which do not appear to him to be of great value since he does not separate them from himself, oblige a publisher to choose a kind of paper, to employ a fount of type finer, perhaps, than they deserve, I asked myself whether my desire to write was of sufficient importance to justify my father in dispensing so much generosity. But apart from that, when he spoke of my inclinations as no longer liable to change, he awakened in me two terrible suspicions. The first was that (at a time when, every day, I regarded myself as standing upon the threshold of a life which was still intact and would not enter upon its course until the following morning) my existence was already begun, and that, furthermore, what was yet to follow would not differ to any extent from what had already elapsed. The second suspicion, which was nothing more, really, than a variant of the first, was that I was not situated somewhere outside the realm of Time, but was subject to its laws, just like the people in novels who, for that reason, used to plunge me in such depression when I read of their lives, down at Combray, in the fastness of my wicker sentry-box. In theory one is aware that the earth revolves, but in practice one does not perceive it, the ground upon which one treads seems not to move, and one can live undisturbed. So it is with Time in one’s life. And to make its flight perceptible novelists are obliged, by wildly accelerating the beat of the pendulum, to transport the reader in a couple of minutes over ten, or twenty, or even thirty years. At the top of one page we have left a lover full of hope; at the foot of the next we meet him again, a bowed old man of eighty, painfully dragging himself on his daily walk about the courtyard of an almshouse, scarcely replying to what is said to him, oblivious of the past. In saying of me, “He is no longer a child,” “His tastes will not change now,” and so forth, my father had suddenly made me apparent to myself in my position in Time, and caused me the same kind of depression as if I had baen, not yet the enfeebled old pensioner, but one of those heroes of whom the author, in a tone of indifference which is particularly galling, says to us at the end of a book: “He very seldom comes up now from the country. He has finally decided to end his days there.”

    Meanwhile my father, so as to forestall any criticism that we might feel tempted to make of our guest, said to my mother: “Upon my word, old Norpois was rather ‘typical,’ as you call it, this evening, wasn’t he? When he said that it would not have been ‘seemly’ to ask the Comte de Paris a question, I was quite afraid you would burst out laughing.”

    “Not at all!” answered my mother. “I was delighted to see a man of his standing, and age too, keep that sort of simplicity, which is really a sign of straightforwardness and good-breeding.”

    “I should think so, indeed! That does not prevent his having a shrewd and discerning mind; I know him well, I see him at the Commission, remember, where he is very different from what he was here,” exclaimed my father, who was glad to see that Mamma appreciated M. de Norpois, and anxious to persucde her that he was even superior to what she supposed, because a cordial nature exaggerates a friend’s qualities with as much pleasure as a mischievous one finds in depreciating them. “What was it that he said, again —‘With Princes one never does know.’ . . .?”

    “Yes, that was it. I noticed it at the time; it was very neat. You can see that he has a vast experience of life.”

    “The astonishing thing is that he should have been dining with the Swanns, and that he seems to have found quite respectable people there, officials even. How on earth can Mme. Swann have managed to catch them?”

    “Did you notice the malicious way he said: ‘It is a house which is especially attractive to gentlemen!’?”

    And each of them attempted to reproduce the manner in which M. de Norpois had uttered these words, as they might have attempted to capture some intonation of Bressant’s voice or of Thiron’s in L’Aventurière or in theGendre de M. Poirier. But of all his sayings there was none so keenly relished as one was by Françoise, who, years afterwards, even, could not ‘keep a straight face’ if we reminded her that she had been qualified by the Ambassador as ‘a chef of the first order,’ a compliment which my mother had gone in person to transmit to her, as a War Minister publishes the congratulations addressed to him by a visiting Sovereign after the grand review. I, as it happened, had preceded my mother to the kitchen. For I had extorted from Françoise, who though opposed to war was cruel, that she would cause no undue suffering to the rabbit which she had to kill, and I had had no report yet of its death. Françoise assured me that it had passed away as peacefully as could be desired, and very swiftly. “I have never seen a beast like it; it died without uttering a word; you would have thought it was dumb.” Being but little versed in the language of beasts I suggested that the rabbit had not, perhaps, a cry like the chicken’s. “Just wait till you see,” said Françoise, filled with contempt for my ignorance, “if rabbits don’t cry every bit as much as chickens. Why, they are far noisier.” She received the compliments of M. de Norpois with the proud simplicity, the joyful and (if but for the moment) intelligent expression of an artist when someone speaks to him of his art. My mother had sent her when she first came to us to several of the big restaurants to see how the cooking there was done. I had the same pleasure, that evening, in hearing her dismiss the most famous of them as mere cookshops that I had had long ago, when I learned with regard to theatrical artists that the hierarchy of their merits did not at all correspond to that of their reputations. “The Ambassador,” my mother told her, “assured me that he knows no place where he can get cold beef and soufflés as good as yours.” Françoise, with an air of modesty and of paying just homage to the truth, agreed, but seemed not at all impressed by the title ‘Ambassador’; she said of M. de Norpois, with the friendliness due to a man who had taken her for a chef: “He’s a good old soul, like me.” She had indeed hoped to catch sight of him as he arrived, but knowing that Mamma hated their standing about behind doors and in windows, and thinking that Mamma would get to know from the other servants or from the porter that she had been keeping watch (for Françoise saw everywhere nothing but ‘jealousies’ and ‘tale-bearings,’ which played the same grim and unending part in her imagination as do for others of us the intrigues of the Jesuits or the Jews), she had contented herself with a peep from the kitchen window, ‘so as not to have words with Madame,’ and beneath the momentary aspect of M. de Norpois had ‘thought it was Monsieur Legrand,’ because of what she called his ‘agelity’ and in spite of their having not a single point in common. “Well,” inquired my mother, “and how do you explain that nobody else can make a jelly as well as you — when you choose?” “I really couldn’t say how that becomes about,” replied Françoise, who had established no very clear line of demarcation between the verb ‘to come,’ in certain of its meanings at least, and the verb ‘to become.’ She was speaking the truth, if not the whole truth, being scarcely more capable — or desirous — of revealing the mystery which ensured the superiority of her jellies or her creams than a leader of fashion the secrets of her toilet or a great singer those of her song. Their explanations tell us little; it was the same with the recipes furnished by our cook. “They do it in too much of a hurry,” she went on, alluding to the great restaurants, “and then it’s not all done together. You want the beef to become like a sponge, then it will drink up all the juice to the last drop. Still, there was one of those Cafés where I thought they did know a little bit about cooking. I don’t say it was altogether my jelly, but it was very nicely done, and the soufflés had plenty of cream.” “Do you mean Henry’s?” asked my father (who had now joined us), for he greatly enjoyed that restaurant in the Place Gaillon where he went regularly to club dinners. “Oh, dear no!” said Françoise, with a mildness which cloaked her profound contempt. “I meant a little restaurant. At that Henry’s it’s all very good, sure enough, but it’s not a restaurant, it’s more like a — soup-kitchen.” “Weber’s, then?” “Oh, no, sir, I meant a good restaurant. Weber’s, that’s in the Rue Royale; that’s not a restaurant, it’s a drinking-shop. I don’t know that the food they give you there is even served. I think they don’t have any tablecloths; they just shove it down in front of you like that, with a take it or leave it.” “Giro’s?” “Oh! there I should say they have the cooking done by ladies of the world.” (‘World’ meant for Françoise the under-world.) “Lord! They need that to fetch the boys in.” We could see that, with all her air of simplicity, Françoise was for the celebrities of her profession a more disastrous ‘comrade’ than the most jealous, the most infatuated of actresses. We felt, all the same, that she had a proper feeling for her art and a respect for tradition; for she went on: “No, I mean a restaurant where they looked as if they kept a very good little family table. It’s a place of some consequence, too. Plenty of custom there. Oh, they raked in the coppers there, all right.” Françoise, being an economist, reckoned in coppers, where your plunger would reckon in gold. “Madame knows the place well enough, down there to the right along the main boulevards, a little way back.” The restaurant of which she spoke with this blend of pride and good-humoured tolerance was, it turned out, the Café Anglais

    When New Year’s Day came, I first of all paid a round of family visits with Mamma who, so as not to tire me, had planned them beforehand (with the aid of an itinerary drawn up by my father) according to districts rather than to degrees of kinship. But no sooner had we entered the drawing-room of the distant cousin whose claim to being visited first was that her house was at no distance from ours, than my mother was horrified to see standing there, his present of marrons glacés or déguisés in his hand, the bosom friend of the most sensitive of all my uncles, to whom he would at once go and report that we had not begun our round with him. And this uncle would certainly be hurt; he would have thought it quite natural that we should go from the Madeleine to the Jardin des Plantes, where he lived, before stopping at Saint-Augustin, on our way to the Rue de l’Ecole de Médecine

    Our visits ended (my grandmother had dispensed us from the duty of calling on her, since we were to dine there that evening), I ran all the way to the Champs-Elysées to give to our own special stall-keeper, with instructions to hand it over to the person who came to her several times a week from the Swanns to buy gingerbread, the letter which, on the day when my friend had caused me so much anxiety, I had decided to send her at the New Year, and in which I told her that our old friendship was vanishing with the old year, that I would forget, now, my old sorrows and disappointments, and that, from this first day of January, it was a new friendship that we were going to cement, one so solid that nothing could destroy it, so wonderful that I hoped that Gilberte would go out of her way to preserve it in all its beauty, and to warn me in time, as I promised to warn her, should either of us detect the least sign of a peril that might endanger it. On our way home Françoise made me stop at the corner of the Rue Royale, before an open-air stall from which she selected for her own stock of presents photographs of Pius IX and Raspail, while for myself I purchased one of Berma. The innumerable admiration which that artist excited gave an air almost of poverty to this one face that she had to respond with, unalterable and precarious as are the garments of people who have not a ‘change,’ this face on which she must continually expose to view only the tiny dimple upon her upper lip, the arch of her eyebrows, a few other physical peculiarities always the same, which, when it came to that, were at the mercy of a burn or a blow. This face, moreover, could not in itself have seemed to me beautiful, but it gave me the idea, and consequently the desire to kiss it by reason of all the kisses that it must have received, for which, from its page in the album, it seemed still to be appealing with that coquettishly tender gaze, that artificially ingenuous smile. For our Berma must indeed have felt for many young men those longings which she confessed under cover of the personality of Phaedra, longings of which everything, even the glamour of her name which enhanced her beauty and prolonged her youth, must render the gratification so easy to her. Night was falling; I stopped before a column of playbills, on which was posted that of the piece in which she was to appear on January 1. A moist and gentle breeze was blowing. It was a time of day and year that I knew; I suddenly felt a presentiment that New Year’s Day was not a day different from, the rest, that it was not the first day of a new world, in which, I might, by a chance that had never yet occurred, that was still intact, make Gilberte’s acquaintance afresh, as at the Creation of the World, as though the past had no longer any existence, as though there had been obliterated, with the indications which I might have preserved for my future guidance, the disappointments which she had sometimes brought me; a new world in which nothing should subsist from the old — save one thing, my desire that Gilberte should love me. I realised that if my heart hoped for such a reconstruction, round about it, of a universe that had not satisfied it before, it was because my heart had not altered, and I told myself that there was no reason why Gilberte’s should have altered either; I felt that this new friendship was the same, just as there is no boundary ditch between their forerunners and those new years which our desire for them, without being able to reach and so to modify them, invests, unknown to themselves, with distinctive names. I might dedicate this new year, if I chose, to Gilberte, and as one bases a religious system upon the blind laws of nature, endeavour to stamp New Year’s Day with the particular image that I had formed of it; but in vain, I felt that it was not aware that people called it New Year’s Day, that it was passing in a wintry dusk in a manner that was not novel to me; in the gentle breeze that floated about the column of playbills I had recognised, I had felt reappear the eternal, the universal substance, the familiar moisture, the unheeding fluidity of the old days and years

    I returned to the house. I had spent the New Year’s Day of old men, who differ on that day from their juniors, not because people have ceased to give them presents but because they themselves have ceased to believe in the New Year. Presents I had indeed received, but not that present which alone could bring me pleasure, namely a line from Gilberte. I was young still, none the less, since I had been able to write her one, by means of which I hoped, in telling her of my solitary dreams of love and longing, to arouse similar dreams in her. The sadness of men who have grown old lies in their no longer even thinking of writing such letters, the futility of which their experience has shewn

    After I was in bed, the noises of the street, unduly prolonged upon this festive evening, kept me awake. I thought of all the people who were ending the night in pleasure, of the lover, the troop, it might be, of debauchees who would be going to meet Berma at the stage-door after the play that I had seen announced for this evening. I was not even able, so as to calm the agitation which that idea engendered in me during my sleepless night, to assure myself that Berma was not, perhaps, thinking about love, since the lines that she was reciting, which she had long and carefully rehearsed, reminded her at every moment that love is an exquisite thing, as of course she already knew, and knew so well that she displayed its familiar pangs — only enriched with a new violence and an unsuspected sweetness — to her astonished audience; and yet each of them had felt those pangs himself. I lighted my candle again, to look once more upon her face. At the thought that it was, no doubt, at that very moment being caressed by those men whom I could not prevent from giving to Berma and receiving from her joys superhuman but vague, I felt an emotion more cruel than voluptuous, a longing that was aggravated presently by the sound of a horn, as one hears it on the nights of the Lenten carnival and often of other public holidays, which, because it then lacks all poetry, is more saddening, coming from a toy squeaker, than “at evening, in the depth of the woods.” At that moment, a message from Gilberte would perhaps not have been what I wanted. Our desires cut across one another’s paths, and in this confused existence it is but rarely that a piece of good fortune coincides with the desire that clamoured for it

    I continued to go to the Champs-Elysées on fine days, along streets whose stylish pink houses seemed to be washed (because exhibitions of water-colours were then at the height of fashion) in a lightly floating atmosphere. It would be untrue to say that in those days the palaces of Gabriel struck me as being of greater beauty, or even of another epoch than the adjoining houses. I found more style, and should have supposed more antiquity if not in the Palais de l’Industrie at any rate in the Troca-déro. Plunged in a restless sleep, my adolescence embodied in one uniform vision the whole of the quarter through which it might be strolling, and I had never dreamed that there could be an eighteenth century building in the Rue Royale, just as I should have been astonished to learn that the Porte-Saint-Martin and the Porte-Saint-Denis, those glories of the age of Louis XIV, were not contemporary with the most recently built tenements in the sordid regions that bore their names. Once only one of Gabriel’s palaces made me stop for more than a moment; that was because, night having fallen, its columns, dematerialised by the moonlight, had the appearance of having been cut out in pasteboard, and by recalling to me a scene in the operetta Orphée aux Enfers gave me for the first time an impression of beauty

    Meanwhile Gilberte never came to the Champs-Elysées. And yet it was imperative that I should see her, for I could not so much as remember what she was like. The questing, anxious, exacting way that we have of looking at the person we love, our eagerness for the word which shall give us or take from us the hope of an appointment for the morrow, and, until that word is uttered, our alternative if not simultaneous imaginings of joy and of despair, all these make our observation, in the beloved object’s presence, too tremulous to be able to carry away a clear impression of her. Perhaps, also, that activity of all the senses at once which endeavours to learn from the visible aspect alone what lies behind it is over-indulgent to the thousand forms, to the changing fragrance, to the movements of the living person whom as a rule, when we are not in love, we regard as fixed in one permanent position. Whereas the beloved model does not stay still; and our mental photographs of her are always blurred. I did not rightly know how Gilberte’s features were composed, save in the heavenly moments when she disclosed them to me; I could remember nothing but her smile. And not being able to see again that beloved face, despite every effort that I might make to recapture it, I would be disgusted to find, outlined in my memory with a maddening precision of detail, the meaningless, emphatic faces of the man with the wooden horses and of the barley-sugar woman; just as those who have lost a dear friend whom they never see even while they are asleep, are exasperated at meeting incessantly in their dreams any number of insupportable creatures whom it is quite enough to have known in the waking world. In their inability to form any image of the object of their grief they are almost led to assert that they feel no grief. And I was not far from believing that, since I could not recall the features of Gilberte, I had forgotten Gilberte herself, and no longer loved her. At length she returned to play there almost every day, setting before me fresh pleasures to desire, to demand of her for the morrow, indeed making my love for her every day, in this sense, a new love. But an incident was to change once again, and abruptly, the manner in which, at about two o’clock every afternoon, the problem of my love confronted me. Had M. Swann intercepted the letter that I had written to his daughter, or was Gilberte merely confessing to me long after the event, and so that I should be more prudent in future, a state of things already long established? As I was telling her how greatly I admired her father and mother, she assumed that vague air, full of reticence and kept secrets, which she invariably wore when anyone spoke to her of what she was going to do, her walks, drives, visits — then suddenly expressed it with: “You know, they can’t abide you!” and, slipping from me like the Undine that she was, burst out laughing. Often her laughter, out of harmony with her words, seemed, as music seems, to be tracing an invisible surface on another plane. M. and Mme. Swann did not require Gilberte to give up playing with me, but they would have been just as well pleased, she thought, if we had never begun. They did not look upon our relations with a kindly eye; they believed me to be a young person of low moral standard and imagined that my influence over their daughter must be evil. This type of unscrupulous young man whom the Swanns thought that I resembled, I pictured him to myself as detesting the parents of the girl he loved, flattering them to their faces but, when he was alone with her, making fun of them, urging her on to disobey them and, when once he had completed his conquest, not allowing them even to set eyes on her again. With these characteristics (though they are never those under which the basest of scoundrels recognises himself) how vehemently did my heart contrast the sentiments that did indeed animate it with regard to Swann, so passionate, on the contrary, that I never doubted that, were he to have the least suspicion of them, he must repent of his condemnation of me as of a judicial error. All that I felt about him I made bold to express to him in a long letter which I entrusted to Gilberte, with the request that she would deliver it. She consented. Alas! so he saw in me an even greater impostor than I had feared; those sentiments which I had supposed myself to be portraying, in sixteen pages, with such amplitude of truth, so he had suspected them; in short, the letter that I had written him, as ardent and as sincere as the words that I had uttered to M. de Norpois, met with no more success. Gilberte told me next day, after taking me aside behind a clump of laurels, along a little path by which we sat down on a couple of chairs, that as he read my letter, which she had now brought back to me, her father had shrugged his shoulders, with: “All this means nothing; it only goes to prove how right I was.” I, who knew the purity of my intentions, the goodness of my soul, was furious that my words should not even have impinged upon the surface of Swann’s ridiculous error. For it was an error; of that I had then no doubt. I felt that I had described with such accuracy certain irrefutable characteristics of my generous sentiments that, if Swann had not at once reconstructed these from my indications, had not come to ask my forgiveness and to admit that he had been mistaken, it must be because these noble sentiments he had never himself experienced, which would make him incapable of understanding the existence of them in other people

    Well, perhaps it was simply that Swann knew that generosity is often no more than the inner aspect which our egotistical feelings assume when we have not yet named and classified them. Perhaps he had recognised in the sympathy that I expressed for him simply an effect — and the strongest possible proof — of my love for Gilberte, by which, and not by any subordinate veneration of himself, my subsequent actions would be irresistibly controlled. I was unable to share his point of view, since I had not succeeded in abstracting my love from myself, in forcing it back into the common experience of humanity, and thus suffering, experimentally, its consequences; I was in despair. I was obliged to leave Gilberte for a moment; Françoise had called me. I must accompany her into a little pavilion covered in a green trellis, not unlike one of the disused toll-houses of old Paris, in which had recently been installed what in England they call a lavatory but in France, by an ill-informed piece of anglomania, ‘water-closets.’ The old, damp walls at the entrance, where I stood waiting for Françoise, emitted a chill and fusty smell which, relieving me at once of the anxieties that Swann’s words, as reported by Gilberte, had just awakened in me, pervaded me with a pleasure not at all of the same character as other pleasures, which leave one more unstable than before, incapable of retaining them, of possessing them, but, on the contrary, with a consistent pleasure on which I could lean for support, delicious, soothing, rich with a truth that was lasting, unexplained and certain. I should have liked, as long ago in my walks along the Guermantes way, to endeavour to penetrate the charm of this impression which had seized hold of me, and, remaining there motionless, to interrogate this antiquated emanation which invited me not to enjoy the pleasure which it was offering me only as an ‘extra,’ but to descend into the underlying reality which it had not yet disclosed to me. But the tenant of the establishment, an elderly dame with painted cheeks and an auburn wig, was speaking to me. Françoise thought her ‘very well-to-do indeed.’ Her ‘missy’ had married what Françoise called ‘a young man of family,’ which meant that he differed more, in her eyes, from a workman than, in Saint-Simon’s, a duke did from a man ‘risen from the dregs of the people.’ No doubt the tenant, before entering upon her tenancy, had met with reverses. But Françoise was positive that she was a ‘marquise,’ and belonged to the Saint-Ferréol family. This ‘marquise’ warned me not to stand outside in the cold, and even opened one of her doors for me, saying: “Won’t you go inside for a minute? Look, here’s a nice, clean one, and I shan’t charge you anything.” Perhaps she just made this offer in the spirit in which the young ladies at Gouache’s, when we went in there to order something, used to offer me one of the sweets which they kept on the counter under glass bells, and which, alas, Mamma would never allow me to take; perhaps with less innocence, like an old florist whom Mamma used to have in to replenish her flower-stands, who rolled languishing eyes at me as she handed me a rose. In any event, if the ‘marquise’ had a weakness for little boys, when she threw open to them the hypogean doors of those cubicles of stone in which men crouch like sphinxes, she must have been moved to that generosity less by the hope of corrupting them than by the pleasure which all of us feel in displaying a needless prodigality to those whom we love, for I have never seen her with any other visitor except an old park-keeper

    A moment later I said good-bye to the ‘marquise,’ and went out accompanied by Françoise, whom I left to return to Gilberte. I caught sight of her at once, on a chair, behind the clump of laurels. She was there so as not to be seen by her friends: they were playing at hide-and-seek. I went and sat down by her side. She had on a flat cap which drooped forwards over her eyes, giving her the same ‘underhand,’ brooding, crafty look which I had remarked in her that first time at Comb ray. I asked her if there was not some way for me to have it out with her father, face to face. Gilberte said that she had suggested that to him, but that he had not thought it of any use. “Look,” she went on, “don’t go away without your letter; I must run along to the others, as they haven’t caught me.”

    Had Swann appeared on the scene then before I had recovered it, this letter, by the sincerity of which I felt that he had been so unreasonable in not letting himself be convinced, perhaps he would have seen that it was he who had been in the right. For as I approached Gilberte, who, leaning back in her chair, told me to take the letter but did not hold it out to me, I felt myself so irresistibly attracted by her body that I said to her: “Look! You try to stop me from getting it; we’ll see which is the stronger.”

    She thrust it behind her back; I put my arms round her neck, raising the plaits of hair which she wore over her shoulders, either because she was still of an age for that or because her mother chose to make her look a child for a little longer so that she herself might still seem young; and we wrestled, locked together. I tried to pull her towards me, she resisted; her cheeks, inflamed by the effort, were as red and round as two cherries; she laughed as though I were tickling her; I held her gripped between my legs like a young tree which I was trying to climb; and, in the middle of my gymnastics, when I was already out of breath with the muscular exercise and the heat of the game, I felt, as it were a few drops of sweat wrung from me by the effort, my pleasure express itself in a form which I could not even pause for a moment to analyse; immediately I snatched the letter from her. Whereupon Gilberte said, good-naturedly:

    “You know, if you like, we might go on wrestling for a little.”

    Perhaps she was dimly conscious that my game had had another object than that which I had avowed, but too dimly to have been able to see that I had attained it. And I, who was afraid that she had seen (and a slight recoil, as though of offended modesty which she made and checked a moment later made me think that my fear had not been unfounded), agreed to go on wrestling, lest she should suppose that I had indeed no other object than that, after which I wished only to sit quietly by her side

    On my way home I perceived, I suddenly recollected the impression, concealed from me until then, towards which, without letting me distinguish or recognise it, the cold, almost sooty smell of the trellised pavilion had borne me. It was that of my uncle Adolphe’s little sitting-room at Combray, which had indeed exhaled the same odour of humidity. But I could not understand, and I postponed the attempt to discover why the recollection of so trivial an impression had given me so keen a happiness. It struck me, however, that I did indeed deserve the contempt of M. de Norpois; I had preferred, hitherto, to all other writers, one whom he styled a mere ‘flute-player’ and a positive rapture had been conveyed to me, not by any important idea, but by a mouldy smell

    For some time past, in certain households, the name of the Champs-Elysées, if a visitor mentioned it, would be greeted by the mother of the family with that air of contempt which mothers keep for a physician of established reputation whom they have (or so they make out) seen make too many false diagnoses to have any faith left in him; people insisted that these gardens were not good for children, that they knew of more than one sore throat, more than one case of measles and any number of feverish chills for which the Champs must be held responsible. Without venturing openly to doubt the maternal affection of Mamma, who continued to let me play there, several of her friends deplored her inability to see what was as plain as daylight

    Neurotic subjects are perhaps less addicted than any, despite the time-honoured phrase, to ‘listening to their insides’: they can hear so many things going on inside themselves, by which they realise later that they did wrong to let themselves be alarmed, that they end by paying no attention to any of them. Their nervous systems have so often cried out to them for help, as though from some serious malady, when it was merely because snow was coming, or because they had to change their rooms, that they have acquired the habit of paying no more heed to these warnings than a soldier who in the heat of battle perceives them so little that he is capable, although dying, of carrying on for some days still the life of a man in perfect health. One morning, bearing arranged within me all my regular disabilities, from whose constant, internal circulation I kept my mind turned as resolutely away as from the circulation of my blood, I had come running into the dining-room where my parents were already at table, and — having assured myself, as usual, that to feel cold may mean not that one ought to warm oneself but that, for instance, one has received a scolding, and not to feel hungry that it is going to rain, and not that one ought not to eat anything — had taken my place between them when, in the act of swallowing the first mouthful of a particularly tempting cutlet, a nausea, a giddiness stopped me, the feverish reaction of a malady that had already begun, the symptoms of which had been masked, retarded by the ice of my indifference, but which obstinately refused the nourishment that I was not in a fit state to absorb. Then, at the same moment, the thought that they would stop me from going out if they saw that I was unwell gave me, as the instinct of self-preservation gives a wounded man, the strength to crawl to my own room, where I found that I had a temperature of 104, and then to get ready to go to the Champs-Elysées. Through the languid and vulnerable shell which encased them, my eager thoughts were urging me towards, were clamouring for the soothing delight of a game of prisoner’s base with Gilberte, and an hour later, barely able to keep on my feet, but happy in being by her side, I had still the strength to enjoy it

    Françoise, on our return, declared that I had been ‘taken bad,’ that I must have caught a ‘hot and cold,’ while the doctor, who was called in at once, declared that he ‘preferred’ the ‘severity,’ the ‘virulence’ of the rush of fever which accompanied my congestion of the lungs, and would be no more than ‘a fire of straw,’ to other forms, more ‘insidious’ and ‘septic.’ For some time now I had been liable to choking fits, and our doctor, braving the disapproval of my grandmother, who could see me already dying a drunkard’s death, had recommended me to take, as well as the caffeine which had been prescribed to help me to breathe, beer, champagne or brandy when I felt an attack coming. These attacks would subside, he told me, in the ‘euphoria’ brought about by the alcohol. I was often obliged, so that my grandmother should allow them to give it to me, instead of dissembling, almost to make a display of my state of suffocation. On the other hand, as soon as I felt an attack coming, never being quite certain what proportions it would assume, I would grow distressed at the thought of my grandmother’s anxiety, of which I was far more afraid than of my own sufferings. But at the same time my body, either because it was too weak to keep those sufferings secret, or because it feared lest, in their ignorance of the imminent disaster, people might demand of me some exertion which it would have found impossible or dangerous, gave me the need to warn my grandmother of my attacks with a punctiliousness into which I finally put a sort of physiological scruple. Did I perceive in myself a disturbing symptom which I had not previously observed, my body was in distress so long as I had not communicated it to my grandmother. Did she pretend to pay no attention, it made me insist. Sometimes I went too far; and that dear face, which was no longer able always to control its emotion as in the past, would allow an expression of pity to appear, a painful contraction. Then my heart was wrung by the sight of her grief; as if my kisses had had power to expel that grief, as if my affection could give my grandmother as much joy as my recovery, I flung myself into her arms. And its scruples being at the same time calmed by the certainty that she now knew the discomfort that I felt, my body offered no opposition to my reassuring her. I protested that this discomfort had been nothing, that I was in no sense to be pitied, that she might be quite sure that I was now happy; my body had wished to secure exactly the amount of pity that it deserved, and, provided that someone knew that it ‘had a pain’ in its right side, it could see no harm in my declaring that this pain was of no consequence and was not an obstacle to my happiness; for my body did not pride itself on its philosophy; that was outside its province. Almost every day during my convalescence I passed through these crises of suffocation. One evening, after my grandmother had left me comparatively well, she returned to my room very late and, seeing me struggling for breath, “Oh, my poor boy,” she exclaimed, her face quivering with sympathy, “you are in dreadful pain.” She left me at once; I heard the outer gate open, and in a little while she came back with some brandy which she had gone out to buy, since there was none in the house. Presently I began to feel better. My grandmother, who was rather flushed, seemed ‘put out’ about something, and her eyes had a look of weariness and dejection

    “I shall leave you alone now, and let you get the good of this improvement,” she said, rising suddenly to go. I detained her, however, for a kiss, and could feel on her cold cheek something moist, but did not know whether it was the dampness of the night air through which she had just passed. Next day, she did not come to my room until the evening, having had, she told me, to go out. I considered that this shewed a surprising indifference to my welfare, and I had to restrain myself so as not to reproach her with it

    As my chokings had persisted long after any congestion remained that could account for them, my parents asked for a consultation with Professor Cottard. It is not enough that a physician who is called in to treat cases of this sort should be learned. Brought face to face with symptoms which may or may not be those of three or four different complaints, it is in the long run his instinct, his eye that must decide with which, despite the more or less similar appearance of them all, he has to deal. This mysterious gift does not imply any superiority in the other departments of the intellect, and a creature of the utmost vulgarity, who admires the worst pictures, the worst music, in whose mind there is nothing out of the common, may perfectly well possess it. In my case, what was physically evident might equally well have been due to nervous spasms, to the first stages of tuberculosis, to asthma, to a toxi-alimentary dyspnoea with renal insufficiency, to chronic bronchitis, or to a complex state into which more than one of these factors entered. Now, nervous spasms required to be treated firmly, and discouraged, tuberculosis with infinite care and with a ‘feeding-up’ process which would have been bad for an arthritic condition such as asthma, and might indeed have been dangerous in a case of toxi-alimentary dyspnoea, this last calling for a strict diet which, in return, would be fatal to a tuberculous patient. But Cottard’s hesitations were brief and his prescriptions imperious. “Purges; violent and drastic purges; milk for some days, nothing but milk. No meat. No alcohol.” My mother murmured that I needed, all the same, to be ‘built up,’ that my nerves were already weak, that drenching me like a horse and restricting my diet would make me worse. I could see in Cottard’s eyes, as uneasy as though he were afraid of missing a train, that he was asking himself whether he had not allowed his natural good-humour to appear. He was trying to think whether he had remembered to put on his mask of coldness, as one looks for a mirror to see whether one has not forgotten to tie one’s tie. In his uncertainty, and, so as, whatever he had done, to put things right, he replied brutally: “I am not in the habit of repeating my instructions. Give me a pen. Now remember, milk! Later on, when we have got the crises and the agrypnia by the throat, I should like you to take a little clear soup, and then a little broth, but always with milk; au lait! You’ll enjoy that, since Spain is all the rage just now; ollé, ollé!” His pupils knew this joke well, for he made it at the hospital whenever he had to put a heart or liver case on a milk diet. “After that, you will gradually return to your normal life. But whenever there is any coughing or choking — purges, injections, bed, milk!” He listened with icy calm, and without uttering a word, to my mother’s final objections, and as he left us without having condescended to explain the reasons for this course of treatment, my parents concluded that it had no bearing on my case, and would weaken me to no purpose, and so they did not make me try it. Naturally they sought to conceal their disobedience from the Professor, and to succeed in this avoided all the houses in which he was likely to be found. Then, as my health became worse, they decided to make me follow out Cottard’s prescriptions to the letter; in three days my ‘rattle’ and cough had ceased, I could breathe freely. Whereupon we realised that Cottard, while finding, as he told us later on, that I was distinctly asthmatic, and still more inclined to ‘imagine things,’ had seen that what was really the matter with me at the moment was intoxication, and that by loosening my liver and washing out my kidneys he would get rid of the congestion of my bronchial tubes and thus give me back my breath, my sleep and my strength. And we realised that this imbecile was a clinical genius. At last I was able to get up. But they spoke of not letting me go any more to the Champs-Elysées. They said that it was because the air there was bad; but I felt sure that this was only a pretext so that I should not see Mlle. Swann, and I forced myself to repeat the name of Gilberte all the time, like the native tongue which peoples in captivity endeavour to preserve among themselves so as not to forget the land that they will never see again. Sometimes my mother would stroke my forehead with her hand, saying: “So little boys don’t tell Mamma their troubles any more?” And Françoise used to come up to me every day with: “What a face, to be sure! If you could just see yourself I Anyone would think there was a corpse in the house.” It is true that, if I had simply had a cold in the head, Françoise would have assumed the same funereal air. These lamentations pertained rather to her ‘class’ than to the state of my health. I could not at the time discover whether this pessimism was due to sorrow or to satisfaction. I decided provisionally that it was social and professional

    One day, after the postman had called, my mother laid a letter upon my bed. I opened it carelessly, since it could not bear the one signature that would have made me happy, the name of Gilberte, with whom I had no relations outside the Champs-Elysées. And lo, at the foot of the page, embossed with a silver seal representing a man’s head in a helmet, and under him a scroll with the device Per viam rectam, beneath a letter written in a large and flowing hand, in which almost every word appeared to be underlined, simply because the crosses of the ‘t’s’ ran not across but over them, and so drew a line beneath the corresponding letters of the word above, it was indeed Gilberte’s signature and nothing else that I saw. But because I knew that to be impossible upon a letter addressed to myself, the sight of it, unaccompanied by any belief in it, gave me no pleasure. For a moment it merely struck an impression of unreality on everything round about me. With lightning rapidity the impossible signature danced about my bed, the fireplace, the four walls. I saw everything sway, as one does when one falls from a horse, and I asked myself whether there was not an existence altogether different from the one I knew, in direct contradiction of it, but itself the true existence, which, being suddenly revealed to me, filled me with that hesitation which sculptors, in representing the Last Judgment, have given to the awakening dead who find themselves at the gates of the next world. “My dear Friend,” said the letter, “I hear that you have been very ill and have given up going to the Champs-Eîysées. I hardly ever go there either because there has been such an enormous lot of illness. But I’m having my friends to tea here every Monday and Friday. Mamma asks me to tell you that it will be a great pleasure to us all if you will come too, as soon as you are well again, and we can have some more nice talks here, just like the Champs-Elysées. Good-bye, dear friend; I hope that your parents will allow you to come to tea very often. With all my kindest regards. GILBERTE.”

    While I was reading these words, my nervous system was receiving, with admirable promptitude, the news that a piece of great good fortune had befallen me. But my mind, that is to say myself, and in fact the party principally concerned, was still in ignorance. Such good fortune, coming from Gilberte, was a thing of which I had never ceased to dream; a thing wholly in my mind, it was, as Leonardo says of painting, cosa mentale. Now, a sheet of paper covered with writing is not a thing that the mind assimilates at once. But as soon as I had finished reading the letter, I thought of it, it became an object of my dreams, became, it also, cosa mentale, and I loved it so much already that every few minutes I must read it, kiss it again. Then at last I was conscious of my happiness

    Life is strewn with these miracles, for which people who are in love can always hope. It is possible that this one had been artificially brought about by my mother who, seeing that for some time past I had lost all interest in life, may have suggested to Gilberte to write to me, just as, when I was little and went first to the sea-side, so as to give me some pleasure in bathing, which I detested because it took away my breath, she used secretly to hand to the man who was to ‘dip’ me marvellous boxes made of shells, and branches of coral, which I believed that I myself had discovered lying at the bottom of the sea. However, with every occurrence which, in our life and among its contrasted situations, bears any relation to love, it is best to make no attempt to understand it, since in so far as these are inexorable, as they are unlooked-for, they appear to be governed by magic rather than by rational laws. When a multi-millionaire — who for all his millions is quite a charming person — sent packing by a poor and unattractive woman with whom he has been living, calls to his aid, in his desperation, all the resources of wealth, and brings every worldly influence to bear without succeeding in making her take him back, it is wiser for him, in the face of the implacable obstinacy of his mistress, to suppose that Fate intends to crush him, and to make him die of an affection of the heart, than to seek any logical explanation. These obstacles, against which lovers have to contend, and which their imagination, over-excited by suffering, seeks in vain to analyse, are contained, as often as not, in some peculiar characteristic of the woman whom they cannot bring back to themselves, in her stupidity, in the influence acquired over her, the fears suggested to her by people whom the lover does not know, in the kind of pleasures which, at the moment, she is demanding of life, pleasures which neither her lover nor her lover’s wealth can procure for her. In any event, the lover is scarcely in a position to discover the nature of these obstacles, which her woman’y cunning hides from him and his own judgment, falsified by love, prevents him from estimating exactly. They may be compared with those tumours which the doctor succeeds in reducing, but without having traced them to their source. Like them these obstacles remain mysterious but are temporary. Only they last, as a rule, longer than love itself. And as that is not a disinterested passion, the lover who is no longer in love does not seek to know why the woman, neither rich nor virtuous, with whom he was in love refused obstinately for years to let him continue to keep her

    Now the same mystery which often veils from our eyes the reason for a catastrophe, when love is in question, envelops just as frequently the suddenness of certain happy solutions, such as had come to me with Gilberte’s letter. Happy, or at least seemingly happy, for there are few solutions that can really be happy when we are dealing with a sentiment of such a kind that every satisfaction which we can bring to it does no more, as a rule, than dislodge some pain. And yet sometimes a respite is granted us, and we have for a little while the illusion that we are healed

    So far as concerns this letter, at the foot of which Françoise declined to recognise Gilberte’s name, because the elaborate capital ‘G’ leaning against the undotted ‘i’ looked more like an ‘A,’ while the final syllable was indefinitely prolonged by a waving flourish, if we persist in looking for a rational explanation of the sudden reversal of her attitude towards me which it indicated, and which made me so radiantly happy, we may perhaps find that I was to some extent indebted for it to an incident which I should have supposed, on the contrary, to be calculated to ruin me for ever in the sight of the Swann family. A short while back, Bloch had come to see me at a time when Professor Cottard, whom, now that I was following his instructions, we were again calling in, happened to be in my room. As his examination of me was over, and he was sitting with me simply as a visitor because my parents had invited him to stay to dinner, Bloch was allowed to come in. While we were all talking, Bloch having mentioned that he had heard it said that Mme. Swann was very fond of me, by a lady with whom he had been dining the day before, who was herself very intimate with Mme. Swann, I should have liked to reply that he was most certainly mistaken, and to establish the fact (from the same scruple of conscience that had made me proclaim it to M. de Norpois, and for fear of Mme. Swann’s taking me for a liar) that I did not know her and had never spoken to her. But I had not the courage to correct Bloch’s mistake, because I could see quite well that it was deliberate, and that, if he invented something that Mme. Swann could not possibly have said, it was simply to let us know (what he considered flattering to himself, and was not true either) that he had been dining with one of that lady’s friends. And so it fell out that, whereas M. de Norpois, on learning that I did not know but would very much like to know Mme. Swann, had taken great care to avoid speaking to her about me, Cottard, who was her doctor also, having gathered from what he had heard Bloch say that she knew me quite well and thought highly of me, concluded that to remark, when next he saw her, that I was a charming young fellow and a great friend of his could not be of the smallest use to me and would be of advantage to himself, two reasons which made him decide to speak of me to Odette whenever an opportunity arose

    Thus at length I found my way into that abode from which was wafted even on to the staircase the scent that Mme. Swann used, though it was embalmed far more sweetly still by the peculiar, disturbing charm that emanated from the life of Gilberte. The implacable porter, transformed into a benevolent Eumenid, adopted the custom, when I asked him if I might go upstairs, of indicating to me, by raising his cap with a propitious hand, that he gave ear to my prayer. Those windows which, seen from outside, used to interpose between me and the treasures within, which were not intended for me, a polished, distant and superficial stare, which seemed to me the very stare of the Swanns themselves, it fell to my lot, when in the warm weather I had spent a whole afternoon with Gilberte in her room, to open them myself, so as to let in a little air, and even to lean over the sill of one of them by her side, if it was her mother’s ‘at home’ day, to watch the visitors arrive who would often, raising their heads as they stepped out of their carriages, greet me with a wave of the hand, taking me for some nephew of their hostess. At such moments Gilberte’s plaits used to brush my cheek. They seemed to me, in the fineness of their grain, at once natural and supernatural, and in the strength of their constructed tracery, a matchless work of art, in the composition of which had been used the very grass of Paradise. To a section of them, even infinitely minute, what celestial herbary would I not have given as a reliquary. But since I never hoped to obtain an actual fragment of those plaits, if at least I had been able to have their photograph, how far more precious than one of a sheet of flowers traced by Vinci’s pencil! To acquire one of these, I stooped — with friends of the Swanns, and even with photographers — to servilities which did not procure for me what I wanted, but tied me for life to a number of extremely tiresome people

    Gilberte’s parents, who for so long had prevented me from seeing her, now — when I entered the dark hall in which hovered perpetually, more formidable and more to be desired than, at Versailles of old, the apparition of the King, the possibility of my encountering them, in which too, invariably, after butting into an enormous hat-stand with seven branches, like the Candlestick in Holy Writ, I would begin bowing confusedly before a footman, seated among the skirts of his long grey coat upon the wood-box, whom in the dim light I had mistaken for Mme. Swann — Gilberte’s parents, if one of them happened to be passing at the moment of my arrival, so far from seeming annoyed would come and shake hands with a smile, and say:

    “How d’e do?” (They both pronounced it in the same clipped way, which, you may well imagine, once I was back at home, I made an incessant and delightful practice of copying.) “Does Gilberte know you’re here? She does? Then I’ll leave you to her.”

    Better still, the tea-parties themselves to which Gilberte invited her friends, parties which for so long had seemed to me the most insurmountable of the barriers heaped up between her and myself, became now an opportunity for uniting us of which she would inform me in a few lines, written (because I was still a comparative stranger) upon sheets that were always different. One was adorned with a poodle embossed in blue, above a fantastic inscription in English with an exclamation mark after it; another was stamped with an anchor, or with the monogram G. S. preposterously elongated in a rectangle which ran from top to bottom of the page, or else with the name Gilberte, now traced across one corner in letters of gold which imitated my friend’s signature and ended in a flourish, beneath an open umbrella printed in black, now enclosed in a monogram in the shape of a Chinaman’s hat, which contained all the letters of the word in capitals without its being possible to make out a single one of them. At last, as the series of different writing-papers which Gilberte possessed, numerous as it might be, was not unlimited, after a certain number of weeks I saw reappear the sheet that bore (like the first letter she had written me) the motto Per vaim rectam, and over it the man’s head in a helmet, set in a medallion of tarnished silver. And each of them was chosen, on one day rather than another, by virtue of a certain ritual, as I then supposed, but more probably, as I now think, because she tried to remember which of them she had already used, so as never to send the same one twice to any of her correspondents, of those at least whom she took special pains to please, save at the longest possible intervals. As, on account of the different times of their lessons, some of the friends whom Gilberte used to invite to her parties were obliged to leave just as the rest were arriving, while I was still on the stairs I could hear escaping from the hall a murmur of voices which, such was the emotion aroused in me by the imposing ceremony in which I was to take part, long before I had reached the landing, broke all the bonds that still held me to my past life, so that I did not even remember that I was to take off my muffler as soon as I felt too hot, and to keep an eye on the clock so as not to be late in getting home. That staircase, besides, aîl of wood, as they were built about that time in certain houses, in keeping with that Henri II style which had for so long been Odette’s ideal though she was shortly to lose interest in it, and furnished with a placard, to which there was no equivalent at home, on which one read the words: “NOTICE. The lift must not be taken downstairs,” seemed to me a thing so marvellous that I told my parents that it was an ancient staircase brought from ever so far away by M. Swann. My regard for the truth was so great that I should not have hesitated to give them this information even if I had known it to be false, for it alone could enable them to feel for the dignity of the Swanns’ staircase the same respect that I felt myself. It was just as, when one is talking to some ignorant person who cannot understand in what the genius of a great physician consists, it is as well not to admit that he does not know how to cure a cold in the head. But since I had no power of observation, since, as a general rule, I never knew either the name or the nature of things that were before my eyes, and could understand only that when they were connected with the Swanns they must be extraordinary, I was by no means certain that in notifying my parents of the artistic value and remote origin of the staircase I was guilty of falsehood. It did not seem certain; but it must have seemed probable, for I felt myself turn very red when my father interrupted me with: “I know those houses; I have been in one; they are all alike; Swann just has several floors in one; it was Berlier built them all.” He added that he had thought of taking a flat in one of them, but that he had changed his mind, finding that they were not conveniently arranged, and that the landings were too dark. So he said; but I felt instinctively that my mind must make the sacrifices necessary to the glory of the Swanns and to my own happiness, and by a stroke of internal authority, in spite of what I had just heard, I banished for ever from my memory, as a good Catholic banishes Renan’s Vie de Jésus, the destroying thought that their house was just an ordinary flat in which we ourselves might have been living

    Meanwhile on those tea-party days, pulling myself up the staircase step by step, reason and memory already cast off like outer garments, and myself no more now than the sport of the basest reflexes, I would arrive in the zone in which the scent of Mme. Swann greeted my nostrils. I felt that I could already behold the majesty of the chocolate cake, encircled by plates heaped with little cakes, and by tiny napkins of grey damask with figures on them, as required by convention but peculiar to the Swanns. But this unalterable and governed whole seemed, like Kant’s necessary universe, to depend on a supreme act of free will. For when we were all together in Gilberte’s little sitting-room, suddenly she would look at the clock and exclaim:

    “I say! It’s getting a long time since luncheon, and we aren’t having dinner till eight. I feel as if I could eat something. What do you say?”

    And she would make us go into the dining-room, as sombre as the interior of an Asiatic Temple painted by Rembrandt, in which an architectural cake, as gracious and sociable as it was imposing, seemed to be enthroned there in any event, in case the fancy seized Gilberte to discrown it of its chocolate battlements and to hew down the steep brown slopes of its ramparts, baked in the oven like the bastions of the palace of Darius. Better still, in proceeding to the demolition of that Babylonitish pastry, Gilberte did not consider only her own hunger; she inquired also after mine, while she extracted for me from the crumbling monument a whole glazed slab jewelled with scarlet fruits, in the oriental styje. She asked me even at what o’clock my parents were dining, as if I still knew, as if the disturbance that governed me had allowed to persist the sensation of satiety or of hunger, the notion of dinner or the picture of my family in my empty memory and paralysed stomach. Alas, its paralysis was but momentary. The cakes that I took without noticing them, a time would come when I should have to digest them. But that time was still remote. Meanwhile Gilberte was making ‘my’ tea. I went on drinking it indefinitely, whereas a single cup would keep me awake for twenty-four hours. Which explains why my mother used always to say: “What a nuisance it is; he can never go to the Swarms’ without coming home ill.” But was I aware even, when I was at the Swanns’, that it was tea that I was drinking? Had I known, I should have taken it just the same, for even supposing that I had recovered for a moment the sense of the present, that would not have restored to me the memory of the past or the apprehension of the future. My imagination was incapable of reaching to the distant tune in which I might have the idea of going to bed, and the need to sleep

    Gilberte’s girl friends were not all plunged in that state of intoxication in which it is impossible to make up one’s mind. Some of them refused tea! Then Gilberte would say, using a phrase highly fashionable that year: “I can see I’m not having much of a success with my tea!” And to destroy more completely any idea of ceremony, she would disarrange the chairs that were drawn up round the table, with: “We look just like a wedding breakfast. Good lord, what fools servants are!”

    She nibbled her cake, perched sideways upon a cross-legged seat placed at an angle to the table. And then, just as though she could have had all those cakes at her disposal without having first asked leave of her mother, when Mme. Swann, whose ‘day’ coincided as a rule with Gilberte’s tea-parties, had shewn one of her visitors to the door, and came sweeping in, a moment later, dressed sometimes in blue velvet, more often in a black satin gown draped with white lace, she would say with an air of astonishment: “I say, that looks good, what you’ve got there. It makes me quite hungry to see you all eating cake.”

    “But, Mamma, do! We invite you!” Gilberte would answer

    ####

    “Thank you, no, my precious; what would my visitors say? I’ve still got Mme. Trombert and Mme. Cottard and Mme. Bontemps; you know dear Mme. Bontemps never pays very short visits, and she has only just come. What would all those good people say if I never went back to them? If no one else calls, I’ll come in again and have a chat with you (which will be far more amusing) after they’ve all gone. I really think I’ve earned a little rest; I have had forty-five different people to-day, and forty-two of them told me about Gérôme’s picture! But you must come alone one of these days,” she turned to me, “and take ‘your’ tea with Gilberte. She will make it for you just as you like it, as you have it in your own little ‘studio,’” she went on, flying off to her visitors, as if it had been something as familiar to me as my own habits (such as the habit that I should have had of taking tea, had I ever taken it; as for my ‘studio,’ I was uncertain whether I had one or not) that I had come to seek in this mysterious world. “When can you come? To-morrow? We will make you ‘toast’ every bit as good as you get at Colombin’s. No? You are horrid!”— for, since she also had begun to form a salon, she had borrowed Mme. Verdurin’s mannerisms, and notably her tone of petulant autocracy. ‘Toast’ being as incomprehensible to me as ‘Colombin’s,’ this further promise could not add to my temptation. It will appear stranger still, now that everyone uses such expressions — and perhaps even at Combray they are creeping in — that I had not at first understood of whom Mme. Swann was speaking when I heard her sing the praises of our old ‘nurse.’ I did not know any English; I gathered, however, as she went on that the word was intended to denote Françoise. I who, in the Champs-Elysées, had been so terrified of the bad impression that she must make, I now learned from Mme. Swann that it was all the things that Gilberte had told them about my ‘nurse’ that had attracted her husband and her to me. “One feels that she is so devoted to you; she must be nice!” (At once my opinion of Françoise was diametrically changed. By the same token, to have a governess equipped with a waterproof and a feather in her hat no longer appeared quite so essential.) Finally I learned from some words which Mme. Swann let fall with regard to Mme. Blatin (whose good nature she recognised but dreaded her visits) that personal relations with that lady would have been of less value to me than I had supposed, and would not in any way have improved my standing with the Swanns

    If I had now begun to explore, with tremors of reverence and joy the faery domain which, against all probability, had opened to me its hitherto locked approaches, this was still only in my capacity as a friend of Gilberte. The kingdom into which I was received was itself contained within another, more mysterious still, in which Swann and his wife led their supernatural existence and towards which they made their way, after taking my hand in theirs, when they crossed the hall at the same moment as myself but in the other direction. But soon I was to penetrate also to the heart of the Sanctuary. For instance, Gilberte might be out when I called, but M. or Mme. Swann was at home. They would ask who had rung, and on being told that it was myself would send out to ask me to come in for a moment and talk to them, desiring me to use in one way or another, and with this or that object in view, my influence over their daughter. I reminded myself of that letter, so complete, so convincing, which I had written to Swann only the other day, and which he had not deigned even to acknowledge. I marvelled at the impotence of the mind, the reason and the heart to effect the least conversion, to solve a single one of those difficulties which, in the sequel, life, without one’s so much as knowing what steps it has taken, so easily unravels. My new position as the friend of Gilberte, endowed with an excellent influence over her, entitling me now to enjoy the same favours as if, having had as a companion at some school where they had always put me at the head of my class the son of a king, I had owed to that accident the right of informal entry into the palace and to audiences in the throne-room, Swann, with an infinite benevolence and as though he were not over-burdened with glorious occupations, would make me go into his library and there let me for an hour on end respond in stammered monosyllables, timid silences broken by brief and incoherent bursts of courage, to utterances of which my emotion prevented me from understanding a single word; would shew me works of art and books which he thought likely to interest me, things as to which I had no doubt, before seeing them, that they infinitely surpassed in beauty anything that the Louvre possessed or the National Library, but at which I found it impossible to look. At such moments I should have been grateful to Swann’s butler, had he demanded from me my watch, my tie-pin, my boots, and made me sign a deed acknowledging him as my heir: in the admirable words of a popular expression of which, as of the most famous epics, we do not know who was the author, although, like those epics, and with all deference to Wolff and his theory, it most certainly had an author, one of those inventive, modest souls such as we come across every year, who light upon such gems as ‘putting a name to a face,’ though their own names they never let us learn, I did not know what I was doing. All the greater was my astonishment, when my visit was prolonged, at finding to what a zero of realisation, to what an absence of happy ending those hours spent in the enchanted dwelling led me. But my disappointment arose neither from the inadequacy of the works of art that were shewn to me nor from the impossibility of fixing upon them my distracted gaze. For it was not the intrinsic beauty of the objects themselves that made it miraculous for me to be sitting in Swann’s library, it was the attachment to those objects — which might have been the ugliest in the world — of the particular feeling, melancholy and voluptuous, which I had for so many years localised in that room and which still impregnated it; similarly the multitude of mirrors, of silver-backed brushes, of altars to Saint Anthony of Padua, carved and painted by the most eminent artists, her friends, counted for nothing in the feeling of my own unworthiness and of her regal benevolence which was aroused in me when Mme. Swann received me for a moment in her own room, in which three beautiful and impressive creatures, her principal and second and third maids, smilingly prepared for her the most marvellous toilets, and towards which, on the order conveyed to me by the footman in knee-breeches that Madame wished to say a few words to me, I would make my way along the tortuous path of a corridor all embalmed, far and near, by the precious essences which exhaled without ceasing from her dressing-room a fragrance exquisitely sweet

    When Mme. Swann had returned to her visitors, we could still hear her talking and laughing, for even with only two people in the room, and as though she had to cope with all the ‘good friends’ at once, she would raise her voice, ejaculate her words, as she had so often in the ‘little clan’ heard its ‘Mistress’ do, at the moments when she ‘led the conversation.’ The expressions which we have borrowed from other people being those which, for a time at least, we are fondest of using, Mme. Swann used to select at one time those which she had learned from distinguished psople whom her husband had not managed to prevent her from getting to know (it was from them that she derived the mannerism which consists in suppressing the article or demonstrative pronoun, in French, before an adjective qualifying a person’s name), at another time others more plebeian (such as “It’s a mere nothing!” the favourite expression of one of her friends), and used to make room for them in all the stories which, by a habit formed among the ‘little clan,’ she loved to tell about people. She would follow these up automatically with, “I do love that story!” or “Do admit, it’s a verygood story!” which came to her, through her husband, from the Guermantes, whom she did not know

    Mme. Swann had left the dining-room, but her husband, who had just returned home, made his appearance among us in turn.’ “Do you know if your mother is alone, Gilberte?” “No, Papa, she has still some people.” “What, still? At seven o’clock! It’s appalling! The poor woman must be absolutely dead. It’s odious.” (At home I had always heard the first syllable of this word pronounced with a long ‘o,’ like ‘ode,’ but M. and Mme. Swann made it short, as in ‘odd.’) “Just think of it; ever since two o’clock this afternoon!” he went on, turning to me. “And Camille tells me that between four and five he let in at least a dozen people. Did I say a dozen? I believe he told me fourteen. No, a dozen; I don’t remember. When I came home I had quite forgotten it was her ‘day,’ and when I saw all those carriages outside the door I thought there must be a wedding in the house. And just now, while I’ve been in the library for a minute, the bell has never stopped ringing; upon my word, it’s given me quite a headache. And are there a lot of them in there still?” “No; only two.” “Who are they, do you know?” “Mme. Cottard and Mme. Bontemps.” “Oh! the wife of the Chief Secretary to the Minister of Posts.” “I know her husband’s a clerk in some Ministry or other, but I don’t know what he does.” Gilberte assumed a babyish manner

    “What’s that? You silly child, you talk as if you were two years old. What do you mean; ‘a clerk in some Ministry or other’ indeed! He is nothing less than Chief Secretary, chief of the whole show, and what’s more — what on earth am I thinking of? Upon my word, I’m getting as stupid as yourself; he is not the Chief Secretary, he’s the Permanent Secretary.”

    “I don’t know, I’m sure; does that mean a lot, being Permanent Secretary?” answered Gilberte, who never let slip an opportunity of displaying her own indifference to anything that gave her parents cause for vanity. (She may, of course, have considered that she only enhanced the brilliance of such an acquaintance by not seeming to attach any undue importance to it.)

    “I should think it did ‘mean a lot’!” exclaimed Swann, who preferred to this modesty, which might have left me in doubt, a more explicit mode of speech. “Why it means simply that he’s the first man after the Minister. In fact, he’s more important than the Minister, because it is he that does all the work. Besides, it appears that he has immense capacity, a man quite of the first rank, a most distinguished individual. He’s an Officer of the Legion of Honour. A delightful man, he is, and very good-looking too.”

    (This man’s wife, incidentally, had married him against everyone’s wishes and advica because he was a ‘charming creature.’ He had, what may be sufficient to constitute a rare and delicate whole, a fair, silky beard, good features, a nasal voice, powerful lungs and a glass eye.)

    “I may tell you,” he added, turning again to me, “that I am greatly amused to see that lot serving in the present Government, because they are Bontemps of the Bontemps-Chenut family, typical old-fashioned middle-class people, reactionary, clerical, tremendously strait-laced. Your grandfather knew quite well — at least by name and by sight he must have known old Chenut, the father, who never tipped the cabmen more than a ha’penny, though he was a rich enough man for those days, and the Baron Bréau-Chenut. All their money went in the Union Générale smash — you’re too young to remember that, of course — and, gad! they’ve had to get it back as best they could.”

    “He’s the uncle of a little girl who used to come to my lessons, in a class a long way below mine, the famous ‘Albertine.’ She’s certain to be dreadfully ‘fast’ when she’s older, but just now she’s the quaintest spectacle.”

    “She is amazing, this daughter of mine. She knows everyone.”

    “I don’t know her. I only used to see her going about, and hear them calling ‘Albertine’ here, and ‘Albertine’ there. But I do know Mme. Bontemps, and I don’t like her much either.”

    “You are quite wrong; she is charming, pretty, intelligent. In fact, she’s quite clever. I shall go in and say how d’e do to her, and ask her if her husband thinks we’re going to have war, and whether we can rely on King Theodosius. He’s bound to know, don’t you think, since he’s in the counsels of the gods.”

    It was not thus that Swann used to talk in days gone by; but which of us cannot call to mind some royal princess of limited intelligence who let herself be carried off by a footman, and then, ten years later, tried to get back into society, and found that people were not very willing to call upon her; have we not found her spontaneously adopting the language of all the old bores, and, when we referred to some duchess who was at the height of fashion, heard her say: “She came to see me only yesterday,” or “I live a very quiet life.” So that it is superfluous to make a study of manners, since we can deduce them all from psychological laws

    The Swanns shared this eccentricity of people who have not many friends; a visit, an invitation, a mere friendly word from some one ever so little prominent were for them events to which they aspired to give full publicity. If bad luck would have it that the Verdurins were in London when Odette gave a rather smart dinner-party, arrangements were made by which some common friend was to ‘cable’ a report to them across the Channel. Even the complimentary letters and telegrams received by Odette the Swanns were incapable of keeping to themselves. They spoke of them to their friends, passed them from hand to hand. Thus the Swanns’ drawing-room reminded one of a seaside hotel where telegrams containing the latest news are posted up on a board

    Still, people who had known the old Swann not merely outside society, as I had known him, but in society, in that Guermantes set which, with certain concessions to Highnesses and Duchesses, was almost infinitely exacting in the matter of wit and charm, from which banishment was sternly decreed for men of real eminence whom its members found boring or vulgar — such people might have been astonished to observe that their old Swann had ceased to be not only discreet when he spoke of his acquaintance, but difficult when he was called upon to enlarge it. How was it that Mme. Bontemps, so common, so ill-natured, failed to exasperate him? How could he possibly describe her as attractive? The memory of the Guermantes set must, one would suppose, have prevented him; as a matter of fact it encouraged him. There was certainly among the Guermantes, as compared with the great majority of groups in society, taste, indeed a refined taste, but also a snobbishness from which there arose the possibility of a momentary interruption in the exercise of that taste. If it were a question of some one who was not indispensable to their circle, of a Minister for Foreign Affairs, a Republican and inclined to be pompous, or of an Academician who talked too much, their taste would be brought to bear heavily against him, Swann would condole with Mme. de Guermantes on having had to sit next to such people at dinner at one of the Embassies, and they would a thousand times rather have a man of fashion, that is to say a man of the Guermantes kind, good for nothing, but endowed with the wit of the Guermantes, some one who was ‘of the same chapel’ as themselves. Only, a Grand Duchess, a Princess of the Blood, should she dine often with Mme. de Guermantes, would soon find herself enrolled in that chapel also, without having any right to be there, without being at all so endowed. But with the simplicity of people in society, from the moment they had her in their houses they went out of their way to find her attractive, since they were unable to say that it was because she was attractive that they invited her. Swann, coming to the rescue of Mme. de Guermantes, would say to her after the Highness had gone: “After all, she’s not such a bad woman; really, she has quite a sense of the comic. I don’t suppose for a moment that she has mastered the Critique of Pure Reason; still, she is not unattractive.” “Oh, I do so entirely agree with you!” the Duchess would respond. “Besides, she was a little frightened of us all; you will see that she can be charming.” “She is certainly a great deal less devastating than Mme. X——” (the wife of the talkative Academician, and herself a remarkable woman) “who quotes twenty volumes at you.” “Oh, but there isn’t any comparison between them.” The faculty of saying such things as these, and of saying them sincerely, Swann had acquired from the Duchess, and had never lost. He made use of it now with reference to the people who came to his house. He forced himself to distinguish, and to admire in them the qualities that every human being will display if we examine him with a prejudice in his favour, and not with the distaste of the nice-minded; he extolled the merits of Mme. Bon-temps, as he had once extolled those of the Princesse de Parme, who must have been excluded from the Guermantes set if there had not been privileged terms of admission for certain Highnesses, and if, when they presented themselves for election, no consideration had indeed been paid except to wit and charm. We have seen already, moreover, that Swann had always an inclination (which he was now putting into practice, only in a more lasting fashion) to exchange his social position for another which, in certain circumstances, might suit him better. It is only people incapable of analysing, in their perception, what at first sight appears indivisible who believe that one’s position is consolidated with one’s person. One and the same man, taken at successive points in his life, will be found to breathe, at different stages on the social ladder, in atmospheres that do not of necessity become more and more refined; whenever, in any period of our existence, we form or re-form associations with a certain environment, and feel that we can move at ease in it and are made comfortable, we begin quite naturally to make ourselves fast to it by putting out roots and tendrils

    In so far as Mme. Bontemps was concerned, I believe also that Swann, in speaking of her with so much emphasis, was not sorry to think that my parents would hear that she had been to see his wife. To tell the truth, in our house the names of the people whom Mme. Swann was gradually getting to know pricked our curiosity more than they aroused our admiration. At the name of Mme. Trombert, my mother exclaimed: “Ah! That’s a new recruit, and one who will bring in others.” And as though she found a similarity between the somewhat summary, rapid and violent manner in which Mme. Swann acquired her friends, as it were by conquest, and a Colonial expedition, Mamma went on to observe: “Now that the Tromberts have surrendered, the neighbouring tribes will not be long in coming in.” If she had passed Mme. Swann in the street, she would tell us when she came home: “I saw Mme. Swann in all her war-paint; she must have been embarking on some triumphant offensive against the Massachutoes, or the Cingalese, or the Tromberts.” And so with all the new people whom I told her that I had seen in that somewhat composite and artificial society, to which they had often been brought with great difficulty and from widely different surroundings, Mamma would at once divine their origin, and, speaking of them as of trophies dearly bought, would say: “Brought back from an Expedition against the so-and-so!”

    As for Mme. Cottard, my father was astonished that Mme. Swann could find anything to be gained by getting so utterly undistinguished a woman to come to her house, and said: “In spite of the Professor’s position, I must say that I cannot understand it.” Mamma, on the other hand, understood quite well; she knew that a great deal of the pleasure which a woman finds in entering a class of society different from that in which she has previously lived would be lacking if she had no means of keeping her old associates informed of those others, relatively more brilliant, with whom she has replaced them. Therefore, she requires an eye-witness who may be allowed to penetrate this new, delicious world (as a buzzing, browsing insect bores its way into a flower) and will then, as the course of her visits may carry her, spread abroad, or so at least one hopes, with the tidings, a latent germ of envy and of wonder. Mme. Cottard, who might have been created on purpose to fill this part, belonged to that special category in a visiting list which Mamma (who inherited certain facets of her father’s turn of mind) used to call the ‘Tell Sparta’ people. Besides — apart from another reason which did not come to our knowledge until many years later — Mme. Swann, in inviting this good-natured, reserved and modest friend, had no need to fear lest she might be introducing into her drawing-room, on her brilliant ‘days,’ a traitor or a rival. She knew what a vast number of homely blossoms that busy worker, armed with her plume and card-case, could visit in a single afternoon. She knew the creature’s power of dissemination, and, basing her calculations upon the law of probability, was led to believe that almost certainly some intimate of the Verdurins would be bound to hear, within two or three days, how the Governor of Paris had left cards upon her, or that M. Verdurin himself would be told how M. Le Hault de Pressagny, the President of the Horse Show, had taken them, Swann and herself, to the King Theodosius gala; she imagined the Verdurins as informed of these two events, both so flattering to herself and of these alone, because the particular materialisations in which we embody and pursue fame are but few in number, by the default of our own minds which are incapable of imagining at one time all the forms which, none the less, we hope — in a general way — that fame will not fail simultaneously to assume for our benefit

    Mme. Swann had, however, met with no success outside what was called the ‘official world.’ Smart women did not go to her house. It was not the presence there of Republican ‘notables’ that frightened them away. In the days of my early childhood, conservative society was to the last degree worldly, and no ‘good’ house would ever have opened its doors to a Republican. The people who lived in such an atmosphere imagined that the impossibility of ever inviting an ‘opportunist’— still more, a ‘horrid radical’— to their parties was something that would endure for ever, like oil-lamps and horse-drawn omnibuses. But, like a kaleidoscope which is every now and then given a turn, society arranges successively in different orders elements which one would have supposed to be immovable, and composes a fresh pattern. Before I had made my first Communion, ladies on the ‘right side’ in politics had had the stupefaction of meeting, while paying calls, a smart Jewess. These new arrangements of the kaleidoscope are produced by what a philosopher would call a ‘change of criterion.’ The Dreyfus case brought about another, at a period rather later than that in which I began to go to Mme. Swann’s, and the kaleidoscope scattered once again its little scraps of colour. Everything Jewish, even the smart lady herself, fell out of the pattern, and various obscure nationalities appeared in its place. The most brilliant drawing-room in Paris was that of a Prince who was an Austrian and ultra-Catholic. If instead of the Dreyfus case there had come a war with Germany, the base of the kaleidoscope would have been turned in the other direction, and its pattern reversed. The Jews having shewn, to the general astonishment, that they were patriots also, would have kept their position, and no one would have cared to go any more, or even to admit that he had ever gone to the Austrian Prince’s. All this does not, however, prevent the people who move in it from imagining, whenever society is stationary for the moment, that no further change will occur, just as in spite of having witnessed the birth of the telephone they decline to believe in the aeroplane. Meanwhile the philosophers of journalism are at work, castigating the preceding epoch, and not only the kind of pleasures in which it indulged, which seem to them to be the last word in corruption, but even the work of its artists and philosophers, which have no longer the least value in their eyes, as though they were indissolubly linked to the successive moods of fashionable frivolity. The one thing that does not change is that at any and every time it appears that there have been ‘great changes.’ At the time when I went to Mme. Swann’s the Dreyfus storm had not yet broken, and some of the more prominent Jews were extremely powerful. None more so than Sir Rufus Israels, whose wife, Lady Israels, was Swann’s aunt. She had not herself any intimate acquaintance so distinguished as her nephew’s, while he, since he did not care for her, had never much cultivated her society, although he was, so far as was known, her heir. But she was the only one of Swann’s relatives who had any idea of his social position, the others having always remained in the state of ignorance, in that respect, which had long been our own. When, from a family circle, one of its members emigrates into ‘high society’— which to him appears a feat without parallel until after the lapse of a decade he observes that it has been performed in other ways and for different reasons by more than one of the men whom he knew as boys — he draws round about himself a zone of shadow, a terra incognita, which is clearly visible in its minutest details to all those who inhabit it with him, but is darkest night and nothingness to those who may not penetrate it but touch its fringe without the least suspicion of its existence in their midst. There being no news agency to furnish Swann’s lady cousins with intelligence of the people with whom he consorted, it was (before his appalling marriage, of course) with a smile of condescension that they would tell one another, over family dinner-tables, that they had spent a ‘virtuous’ Sunday in going to see ‘cousin Charles,’ whom (regarding him as a ‘poor relation’ who was inclined to envy their prosperity,) they used wittily to name, playing upon the title of Balzac’s story, Le Cousin Bête. Lady Israels, however, was letter-perfect in the names and quality of the people who lavished upon Swann a friendship of which she was frankly jealous. Her husband’s family, which almost equalled the Rothschilds in importance, had for several generations managed the affairs of the Orleans Princes. Lady Israels, being immensely rich, exercised a wide influence, and had employed it so as to ensure that no one whom she knew should be ‘at home’ to Odette. One only had disobeyed her, in secret, the Comtesse de Marsantes. And then, as ill luck would have it, Odette having gone to call upon Mme. de Marsantes, Lady Israels had entered the room almost at her heels. Mme. de Marsantes was on tenter-hooks. With the craven impotence of those who are at liberty to act as they choose, she did not address a single word to Odette, who thus found little encouragement to press further the invasion of a world which, moreover, was not at all that into which she would have liked to be welcomed. In this complete detachment of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, Odette continued to be regarded as the illiterate ‘light woman,’ utterly different from the respectable ladies, ‘well up’ in all the minutest points of genealogy, who endeavoured to quench by reading biographies and memoirs their thirst for the aristocratic relations with which real life had omitted to provide them. And Swann, for his part, continued no doubt to be the lover in whose eyes all these peculiarities of an old mistress would appear lovable or at least inoffensive, for I have often heard his wife profess what were really social heresies, without his attempting (whether from lingering affection for her, loss of regard for society or weariness of the effort to make her perfect) to correct them. It was perhaps also another form of the simplicity which for so long had misled us at Combray, and which now had the effect that, while he continued to know, on his own account at least, many highly distinguished people, he did not make a point, in conversation in his wife’s drawing-room, of our seeming to feel that they were of the smallest importance. They had, indeed, less than ever for Swann, the centre of gravity of his life having been displaced. In any case, Odette’s ignorance of social distinctions was so dense that if the name of the Princesse de Guermantes were mentioned in conversation after that of the Duchess, her cousin, “So those ones are Princes, are they?” she would exclaim; “Why, they’ve gone up a step.” Were anyone to say “the Prince,” in speaking of the Duc de Chartres, she would put him right with, “The Duke, you mean; he is Duc de Chartres, not Prince.” As for the Duc d’Orléans, son of the Comte de Paris: “That’s funny; the son is higher than the father!” she would remark, adding, for she was afflicted with anglomania, “ThoseRoyalties are so dreadfully confusing!”— while to someone who asked her from what province the Guermantes family came she replied, “From the Aisne.”

    But, so far as Odette was concerned, Swann was quite blind, not merely to these deficiencies in her education but to the general mediocrity of her intelligence. More than that; whenever Odette repeated a silly story Swann would sit listening to his wife with a complacency, a merriment, almost an admiration into which some survival of his desire for her must have entered; while in the same conversation, anything subtle, anything deep even that he himself might say would be listened to by Odette with an habitual lack of interest, rather curtly, with impatience, and would at times be sharply contradicted. And we must conclude that this enslavement of refinement by vulgarity is the rule in many households, when we think, conversely, of all the superior women who yield to the blandishments of a boor, merciless in his censure of their most delicate utterances, while they go into ecstasies, with the infinite indulgence of love, over the feeblest of his witticisms. To return to the reasons which prevented Odette, at this period, from making her way into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, it must be observed that the latest turn of the social kaleidoscope had been actuated by a series of scandals. Women to whose houses one had been going with entire confidence had been discovered to be common prostitutes, if not British spies. One would, therefore, for some time to come expect people (so, at least, one supposed) to be, before anything else, in a sound position, regular, settled, accountable. Odette represented simply everything with which one had just severed relations, and was incidentally to renew them at once (for men, their natures not altering from day to day, seek in every new order a continuance of the old) but to renew them by seeking it under another form which would allow one to be innocently taken in, and to believe that it was no longer the same society as before the disaster. However, the scapegoats of that society and Odette were too closely alike. People who move in society are very short-sighted; at the moment in which they cease to have any relations with the Israelite ladies whom they have known, while they are asking themselves how they are to fill the gap thus made in their lives, they perceive, thrust into it as by the windfall of a night of storm, a new lady, an Israelite also; but by virtue of her novelty she is not associated in their minds with her predecessors, with what they are convinced that they must abjure. She does not ask that they shall respect her God. They take her up. There was no question of anti-semitism at the time when I used first to visit Odette. But she was like enough to it to remind people of what they wished, for a while, to avoid

    As for Swann himself, he was still a frequent visitor of several of his former acquaintance, who, of course, were all of the very highest rank. And yet when he spoke to us of the people whom he had just been to see I noticed that, among those whom he had known in the old days, the choice that he made was dictated by the same kind of taste, partly artistic, partly historic, that inspired him as a collector. And remarking that it was often some great lady or other of waning reputation, who interested him because she had been the mistress of Liszt or because one of Balzac’s novels was dedicated to her grandmother (as he would purchase a drawing if Chateaubriand had written about it) I conceived a suspicion that we had, at Combray, replaced one error, that of regarding Swann as a mere stockbroker, who did not go into society, by another, when we supposed him to be one of the smartest men in Paris. To be a friend of the Comte de Paris meant nothing at all. Is not the world full of such ‘friends of Princes,’ who would not be received in any house that was at all ‘exclusive’? Princes know themselves to be princes, and are not snobs; besides, they believe themselves to be so far above everything that is not of their blood royal that great nobles and ‘business men’ appear, in the depths beneath them, to be practically on a level

    But Swann went farther than this; not content with seeking in society, such as it was, when he fastened upon the names which, inscribed upon its roll by the past, were still to be read there, a simple artistic and literary pleasure, he indulged in the slightly vulgar diversion of arranging as it were social nosegays by grouping heterogeneous elements, bringing together people taken at hazard, here, there and everywhere. These experiments in the lighter side (or what was to Swann the lighter side) of sociology did not stimulate an identical reaction, with any regularity, that is to say, in each of his wife’s friends. “I’m thinking of asking the Cottards to meet the Duchesse de Vendôme,” he would laughingly say to Mme. Bontemps, in the appetised tone of an epicure who has thought of, and intends to try the substitution, in a sauce, of cayenne pepper for cloves. But this plan, which was, in fact, to appear quite humorous, in an archaic sense of the word, to the Cottards, had also the power of infuriating Mme. Bontemps. She herself had recently been presented by the Swanns to the Duchesse de Vendôme, and had found this as agreeable as it seemed to her natural. The thought of winning renown from it at the Cottards’, when she related to them what had happened, had been by no means the least savoury ingredient of her pleasure. But like those persons recently decorated who, their investiture once accomplished, would like to see the fountain of honour turned off at the main, Mme. Bontemps would have preferred that, after herself, no one else in her own circle of friends should be made known to the Princess. She denounced (to herself, of course) the licentious taste of Swann who, in order to gratify a wretched aesthetic whim, was obliging her to scatter to the winds, at one swoop, all the dust that she would have thrown in the eyes of the Cottards when she told them about the Duchesse de Vendôme. How was she even to dare to announce to her husband that the Professor and his wife were in their turn to partake of this pleasure, of which she had boasted to him as though it were unique. And yet, if the Cottards could only be made to know that they were being invited not seriously but for the amusement of their host! It is true that the Bontemps had been invited for the same reason, but Swann, having acquired from the aristocracy that eternal ‘Don Juan’ spirit which, in treating with two women of no importance, makes each of them believe that it is she alone who is seriously loved, had spoken to Mme. Bontemps of the Duchesse de Vendôme as of a person whom it was clearly laid down that she must meet at dinner. “Yes, we’re determined to have the Princess here with the Cottards,” said Mme. Swann a few weeks later; “My husband thinks that we might get something quite amusing out of that conjunction.” For if she had retained from the ‘little nucleus’ certain habits dear to Mme. Verdurin, such as that of shouting things aloud so as to be heard by all the faithful, she made use, at the same time, of certain expressions, such as ‘conjunction,’ which were dear to the Guermantes circle, of which she thus felt unconsciously and at a distance, as the sea is swayed by the moon, the attraction, though without being drawn perceptibly closer to it. “Yes, the Cottards and the Duchesse de Vendôme. Don’t you think that might be rather fun?” asked Swann. “I think they’ll be exceedingly ill-assorted, and it can only lead to a lot of bother; people oughtn’t to play with fire, is what I say!” snapped Mme. Bontemps, furious. She and her husband were, all the same, invited, as was the Prince d’Agrigente, to this dinner, which Mme. Bontemps and Cottard had each two alternative ways of describing, according to whom they were telling about it. To one set Mme. Bontemps for her part, and Cottard for his would say casually, when asked who else had been of the party: “Only the Prince d’Agrigente; it was all quite intimate.” But there were others who might, alas, be better informed (once, indeed, some one had challenged Cottard with: “But weren’t the Bontemps there too?” “Oh, I forgot them,” Cottard had blushingly admitted to the tactless questioner whom he ever afterwards classified among slanderers and speakers of evil). For these the Bontemps and Cottards had each adopted, without any mutual arrangement, a version the framework of which was identical for both parties, their own names alone changing places. “Let me see;” Cottard would say, “there were our host and hostess, the Due and Duchesse de Vendôme —” (with a satisfied smile) “Professor and Mme. Cottard, and, upon my soul, heaven only knows how they got there, for they were about as much in keeping as hairs in the soup, M. and Mme. Bontemps!” Mme. Bontemps would recite an exactly similar ‘piece,’ only it was M. and Mme. Bontemps who were named with a satisfied emphasis between the Duchesse de Vendôme and the Prince d’Agrigente, while the ‘also ran,’ whom finally she used to accuse of having invited themselves, and who completely spoiled the party, were the Cottards

    When he had been paying calls Swann would often come home with little time to spare before dinner. At that point in the evening, six o’clock, when in the old days he had felt so wretched, he no longer asked himself what Odette might be about, and was hardly at all concerned to hear that she had people still with her, or had gone out. He recalled at times that he had once, years ago, tried to read through its envelope a letter addressed by Odette to Forcheville. But this memory was not pleasing to him, and rather than plumb the depth of shame that he felt in it he preferred to indulge in a little grimace, twisting up the corners of his mouth and adding, if need be, a shake of the head which signified “What does it all matter?” In truth, he considered now that the hypothesis by which he had often been brought to a standstill in days gone by, according to which it was his jealous imagination alone that blackened what was in reality the innocent life of Odette — that this hypothesis (which after all was beneficent, since, so long as his amorous malady had lasted, it had diminished his sufferings by making them seem imaginary) was not the truth, that it was his jealousy that had seen things in the right light, and that if Odette had loved him better than he supposed, she had deceived him more as well. Formerly, while his sufferings were still keen, he had vowed that, as soon as he should have ceased to love Odette, and so to be afraid either of vexing her or of making her believe that he loved her more than he did, he would afford himself the satisfaction of elucidating with her, simply from his love of truth and as a historical point, whether or not she had had Forcheville in her room that day when he had rung her bell and rapped on her window without being let in, and she had written to Forcheville that it was an uncle of hers who had called. But this so interesting problem, of which he was waiting to attempt the solution only until his jealousy should have subsided, had precisely lost all interest in Swann’s eyes when he had ceased to be jealous. Not immediately, however. He felt no other jealousy now with regard to Odette than what the memory of that day, that afternoon spent in knocking vainly at the little house in the Rue La Pérouse, had continued to excite in him; as though his jealousy, not dissimilar in that respect from those maladies which appear to have their seat, their centre of contagion less in certain persons than in certain places, in certain houses, had had for its object not so much Odette herself as that day, that hour in the irrevocable past when Swann had beaten at every entrance to her house in turn. You would have said that that day, that hour alone had caught and preserved a few last fragments of the amorous personality which had once been Swann’s, and that there alone could he now recapture them. For a long time now it had made no matter to him that Odette had been false to him, and was false still. And yet he had continued for some years to seek out old servants of Odette, so strongly in him persisted the painful curiosity to know whether on that day, so long ago, at six o’clock, Odette had been in bed with Forcheville. Then that curiosity itself had disappeared, without, however, his abandoning his investigations. He continued the attempt to discover what no longer interested him, because his old ego though it had shrivelled to the extreme of decrepitude still acted mechanically, following the course of preoccupations so utterly abandoned that Swann could not now succeed even in forming an idea of that anguish — so compelling once that he had been unable to foresee his ever being delivered from it, that only the death of her whom he loved (death which, as will be shewn later on in this story, by a cruel example, in no way diminishes the sufferings caused by jealousy) seemed to him capable of making smooth the road, then insurmountably barred to him, of his life

    But to bring to light, some day, those passages in the life of Odette to which he owed his sufferings had not been Swann’s only ambition; he had in reserve that also of wreaking vengeance for his sufferings when, being no longer in love with Odette, he should no longer be afraid of her; and the opportunity of gratifying this second ambition had just occurred, for Swann was in love with another woman, a woman who gave him — grounds for jealousy, no, but who did all the same make him jealous, because he was not capable, now, of altering his way of making love, and it was the way he had used with Odette that must serve him now for another. To make Swann’s jealousy revive it was not essential that this woman should be unfaithful, it sufficed that for any reason she was separated from him, at a party for instance, where she was presumably enjoying herself. That was enough to reawaken in him the old anguish, that lamentable and inconsistent excrescence of his love, which held Swann ever at a distance from what she really was, like a yearning to attain the impossible (what this young woman really felt for him, the hidden longing that absorbed her days, the secret places of her heart), for between Swann and her whom he loved this anguish piled up an unyielding mass of already existing suspicions, having their cause in Odette, or in some other perhaps who had preceded Odette, allowing this now ageing lover to know his mistress of the moment only in the traditional and collective phantasm of the ‘woman who made him jealous,’ in which he had arbitrarily incarnated his new love. Often, however, Swann would charge his jealousy with the offence of making him believe in imaginary infidelities; but then he would remember that he had given Odette the benefit of the same argument and had in that been wrong. And so everything that the young woman whom he loved did in those hours when he was not with her appeared spoiled of its innocence in his eyes. But whereas at that other time he had made a vow that if ever he ceased to love her whom he did not then imagine to be his future wife, he would implacably exhibit to her an indifference that would at length be sincere, so as to avenge his pride that had so long been trampled upon by her — of those reprisals which he might now enforce without risk to himself (for what harm could it do him to be taken at his word and deprived of those intimate moments with Odette that had been so necessary to him once), of those reprisals he took no more thought; with his love had vanished the desire to shew that he was in love no longer. And he who, when he was suffering at the hands of Odette, would have looked forward so keenly to letting her see one day that he had fallen to a rival, now that he was in a position to do so took infinite precautions lest his wife should suspect the existence of this new love

    It was not only in those tea-parties, on account of which I had formerly had the sorrow of seeing Gilberte leave me and go home earlier than usual, that I was henceforth to take part, but the engagements that she had with her mother, to go for a walk or to some afternoon party, which by preventing her from coming to the Champs-Elysées had deprived me of her, on those days when I loitered alone upon the lawn or stood before the wooden horses — to these outings M. and Mme. Swann henceforth admitted me, I had a seat in their landau, and indeed it was me that they asked if I would rather go to the theatre, to a dancing lesson at the house of one of Gilberte’s friends, to some social gathering given by friends of her parents (what Odette called ‘a little meeting’) or to visit the tombs at Saint-Denis

    On days when I was going anywhere with the Swanns I would arrive at the house in time for déjeuner, which Mme. Swann called ‘le lunch’; as one was not expected before half-past twelve, while my parents in those days had their meal at a quarter past eleven, it was not until they had risen from the table that I made my way towards that sumptuous quarter, deserted enough at any hour, but more particularly just then, when everyone had gone indoors. Even on winter days of frost, if the weather held, tightening every few minutes the knot of a gorgeous necktie from Charvet’s and looking to see that my varnished boots were not getting dirty, I would roam to and fro among the avenues, waiting until twenty-seven minutes past the hour. I could see from afar in the Swanns’ little garden-plot the sunlight glittering like hoar frost from the bare-boughed trees. It is true that the garden boasted but a pair of them. The unusual hour presented the scene in a new light. Into these pleasures of nature (intensified by the suppression of habit and indeed by my physical hunger) the thrilling prospect of sitting down to luncheon with Mme. Swann was infused; it did not diminish them, but taking command of them trained them to its service; so that if, at this hour when ordinarily I did not perceive them, I seemed now to be discovering the fine weather, the cold, the wintry sunlight, it was all as a sort of preface to the creamed eggs, as a patina, a cool and coloured glaze applied to the decoration of that mystic chapel which was the habitation of Mme. Swann, and in the heart of which there were, by contrast, so much warmth, so many scents and flowers

    At half-past twelve I would finally make up my mind to enter that house which, like an immense Christmas stocking, seemed ready to bestow upon me supernatural delights. (The French name ‘Noël’ was, by the way, unknown to Mme. Swann and Gilberte, who had substituted for it the English ‘Christmas,’ and would speak of nothing but ‘Christmas pudding,’ what people had given them as ‘Christmas presents’ and of going away — the thought of which maddened me with grief —‘for Christmas.’ At home even, I should have thought it degrading to use the word ‘Noël,’ and always said ‘Christmas,’ which my father considered extremely silly.)

    I encountered no one at first but a footman who after leading me through several large drawing-rooms shewed me into one that was quite small, empty, its windows beginning to dream already in the blue light of afternoon; I was left alone there in the company of orchids, roses and violets, which, like people who are kept waiting in a room beside you but do not know you, preserved a silence which their individuality as living things made all the more impressive, and received coldly the warmth of a glowing fire of coals, preciously displayed behind a screen of crystal, in a basin of white marble over which it spilled, now and again, its perilous rubies

    I had sat down, but I rose hurriedly on hearing the door opened; it was only another footman, and then a third, and the minute result chat their vainly alarming entrances and exits achieved was to put a little more coal on the fire or water in the vases. They departed, I found myself alone, once that door was shut which Mme. Swann was surely soon going to open. Of a truth, I should have been less ill at ease in a magician’s cave than in this little waiting-room where the fire appeared to me to be performing alchemical transmutations as in Klingsor’s laboratory. Footsteps sounded afresh, I did not rise, it was sure to be just another footman; it was M. Swann. “What! All by yourself? What is one to do; that poor wife of mine has never been able to remember what time means! Ten minutes to one. She gets later every day. And you’ll see, she will come sailing in without the least hurry, and imagine she’s in heaps of time.” And as he was still subject to neuritis, and as he was becoming a trifle ridiculous, the fact of possessing so unpunctual a wife, who came in so late from the Bois, forgot everything at her dressmaker’s and was never in time for luncheon made Swann anxious for his digestion but flattered his self-esteem

    He shewed me his latest acquisitions and explained their interest to me, but my emotion, added to the unfamiliarity of being still without food at this hour, sweeping through my mind left it void, so that while able to speak I was incapable of hearing. Anyhow, so far as the works of art in Swann’s possession were concerned, it was enough for me that they were contained in his house, formed a part there of the delicious hour that preceded luncheon. The Gioconda herself might have appeared there without giving me any more pleasure than one of Mme. Swann’s indoor gowns, or her scent bottles

    I continued to wait, alone or with Swann, and often with Gilberte, come in to keep us company. The arrival of Mme. Swann, prepared for me by all those majestic apparitions, must (so it seemed to me) be something truly immense. I strained my ears to catch the slightest sound. But one never finds quite as high as one has been expecting a cathedral, a wave in a storm, a dancer’s leap in the air; after those liveried footmen, suggesting the chorus whose processional entry upon the stage leads up to and at the same time diminishes the final appearance of the queen, Mme. Swann, creeping furtively in, with a little otter-skin coat, her veil lowered to cover a nose pink-tipped by the cold, did not fulfil the promises lavished, while I had been waiting, upon my imagination

   But if she had stayed at home all morning, when she arrived in the drawing-room she would be clad in a wrapper of crêpe-de-Chine, brightly coloured, which seemed to me more exquisite than any of her dresses

    Sometimes the Swanns decided to remain in the house all afternoon, and then, as we had had luncheon so late, very soon I must watch setting, beyond the garden-wall, the sun of that day which had seemed to me bound to be different from other days; then in vain might the servants bring in lamps of every size and shape, burning each upon the consecrated altar of a console, a card-table, a corner-cupboard, a bracket, as though for the celebration of some strange and secret rite; nothing extraordinary transpired in the conversation, and I went home disappointed, as one often is in one’s childhood after the midnight mass

    But my disappointment was scarcely more than mental. I was radiant with happiness in this house where Gilberte, when she was still not with us, was about to appear and would bestow on me in a moment, and for hours to come, her speech, her smiling and attentive gaze, just as I had caught it, that first time, at Combray. At the most I was a trifle jealous when I saw her so often disappear into vast rooms above, reached by a private staircase. Obliged myself to remain in the drawing-room, like a man in love with an actress who is confined to his stall ‘in front’ and wonders anxiously what is going on behind the scenes, in the green-room, I put to Swann, with regard to this other part of the house questions artfully veiled, but in a tone from which I could not quite succeed in banishing the note of uneasiness. He explained to me that the place to which Gilberte had gone was the linen-room, offered himself to shew it to me, and promised me that whenever Gilberte Had occasion to go there again he would insist upon her taking me with her. By these last words and the relief which they brought me Swann at once annihilated for me one of those terrifying interior perspectives at the end of which a woman with whom we are in love appears so remote. At that moment I felt for him an affection which I believed to be deeper than my affection for Gilberte. For he, being the master over his daughter, was giving her to me, whereas she, she withheld herself now and then, I had not the same direct control over her as I had indirectly through Swann. Besides, it was she whom I loved and could not, therefore look upon without that disturbance, without that desire for something more which destroys in us, in the presence of one whom we love, the sensation of loving

    As a rule, however, we did not stay indoors, we went out. Sometimes, before going to dress, Mme. Swann would sit down at the piano. Her lovely hands, escaping from the pink, or white, or, often, vividly coloured sleeves of her crêpe-de-Chine wrapper, drooped over the keys with that same melancholy which was in her eyes but was not in her heart. It was on one of those days that she happened to play me the part of Vinteuil’s sonata that contained the little phrase of which Swann had been so fond. But often one listens and hears nothing, if it is a piece of music at all complicated to which one is listening for the first time. And yet when, later on, this sonata had been played over to me two or three times I found that I knew it quite well. And so it is not wrong to speak of hearing a thing for the first time. If one had indeed, as one supposes, received no impression from the first hearing, the second, the third would be equally ‘first hearings’ and there would be no reason why one should understand it any better after the tenth. Probably what is wanting, the first time, is not comprehension but memory. For our memory, compared to the complexity of the impressions which it has to face while we are listening, is infinitesimal, as brief as the memory of a man who in his sleep thinks of a thousand things and at once forgets them, or as that of a man in his second childhood who cannot recall, a minute afterwards, what one has just been saying to him. Of these multiple impressions our memory is not capable of furnishing us with an immediate picture. But that picture gradually takes shape, and, with regard to works which we have heard more than once, we are like the schoolboy who has read several times over before going to sleep a lesson which he supposed himself not to know, and finds that he can repeat it by heart next morning. It was only that I had not, until then, heard a note of the sonata, whereas Swann and his wife could make out a distinct phrase that was as far beyond the range of my perception as a name which one endeavours to recall and in place of which one discovers only a void, a void from which, an hour later, when one is not thinking about them, will spring of their own accord, in one continuous flight, the syllables that one has solicited in vain. And not only does one not seize at once and retain an impression of works that are really great, but even in the content of any such work (as befell me in the case of Vinteuil’s sonata) it is the least valuable parts that one at first perceives. Thus it was that I was mistaken not only in thinking that this work held nothing further in store for me (so that for a long time I made no effort to hear it again) from the moment in which Mme. Swann had played over to me its most famous passage; I was in this respect as stupid as people are who expect to feel no astonishment when they stand in Venice before the front of Saint Mark’s, because photography has already acquainted them with the outline of its domes. Far more than that, even when I had heard the sonata played from beginning to end, it remained almost wholly invisible to me, like a monument of which its distance or a haze in the atmosphere allows us to catch but a faint and fragmentary glimpse. Hence the depression inseparable from one’s knowledge of such works, as of everything that acquires reality in time. When the least obvious beauties of Vinteuil’s sonata were revealed to me, already, borne by the force of habit beyond the reach of my sensibility, those that I had from the first distinguished and preferred in it were beginning to escape, to avoid me. Since I was able only in successive moments to enjoy all the pleasures that this sonata gave me, I never possessed it in its entirety: it was like life itself. But, less disappointing than life is, great works of art do not begin by giving us all their best. In Vinteuil’s sonata the beauties that one discovers at once are those also of which one most soon grows tired, and for the same reason, no doubt, namely that they are less different from what one already knows. But when those first apparitions have withdrawn, there is left for our enjoyment some passage which its composition, too new and strange to offer anything but confusion to our mind, had made indistinguishable and so preserved intact; and this, which we have been meeting every day and have not guessed it, which has thus been held in reserve for us, which by the sheer force of its beauty has become invisible and has remained unknown, this comes to us last of all. But this also must be the last that we shall relinquish. And we shall love it longer than the rest because we have taken longer to get to love it. The time, moreover, that a person requires — as I required in the matter of this sonata — to penetrate a work of any depth is merely an epitome, a symbol, one might say, of the years, the centuries even that must elapse before the public can begin to cherish a masterpiece that is really new. So that the man of genius, to shelter himself from the ignorant contempt of the world, may say to himself that, since one’s contemporaries are incapable of the necessary detachment, works written for posterity should be read by posterity alone, like certain pictures which one cannot appreciate when one stands too close to them. But, as it happens, any such cowardly precaution to avoid false judgments is doomed to failure; they are inevitable. The reason for which a work of genius is not easily admired from the first is that the man who has created it is extraordinary, that few other men resemble him. It was Beethoven’s Quartets themselves (the Twelfth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth) that devoted half a century to forming, fashioning and enlarging a public for Beethoven’s Quartets, marking in this way, like every great work of art, an advance if not in artistic merit at least in intellectual society, largely composed to-day of what was not to be found when the work first appeared, that is to say of persons capable of enjoying it. What artists call posterity is the posterity of the work of art. It is essential that the work (leaving out of account, for brevity’s sake, the contingency that several men of genius may at the same time be working along parallel lines to create a more instructed public in the future, a public from which other men of genius shall reap the benefit) shall create its own posterity. For if the work were held in reserve, were revealed only to posterity, that audience, for that particular work, would be not posterity but a group of contemporaries who were merely living half-a-century later in time. And so it is essential that the artist (and this is what Vinteuil had done), if he wishes his work to be free to follow its own course, shall launch it, wherever he may find sufficient depth, confidently outward bound towards the future. And yet this interval of time, the true perspective in which to behold a work of art, if leaving it out of account is the mistake made by bad judges, taking it into account is at times a dangerous precaution of the good. No doubt one can easily imagine, by an illusion similar to that which makes everything on the horizon appear equidistant, that all the revolutions which have hitherto occurred in painting or in music did at least shew respect for certain rules, whereas that which immediately confronts us, be it impressionism, a striving after discord, an exclusive use of the Chinese scale, cubism, futurism or what you will, differs outrageously from all that have occurred before. Simply because those that have occurred before we are apt to regard as a whole, forgetting that a long process of assimilation has melted them into a continuous substance, varied of course but, taking it as a whole, homogeneous, in which Hugo blends with Molière. Let us try to imagine the shocking incoherence that we should find, if we did not take into account the future, and the changes that it must bring about, in a horoscope of our own riper years, drawn and presented to us in our youth. Only horoscopes are not always accurate, and the necessity, when judging a work of art, of including the temporal factor in the sum total of its beauty introduces, to our way of thinking, something as hazardous, and consequently as barren of interest, as every prophecy the non-fulfilment of which will not at all imply any inadequacy on the prophet’s part, for the power to summon possibilities into existence or to exclude them from it is not necessarily within the competence of genius; one may have had genius and yet not have believed in the future of railways or of flight, or, although a brilliant psychologist, in the infidelity of a mistress or of a friend whose treachery persons far less gifted would have foreseen

    If I did not understand the sonata, it enchanted me to hear Mme. Swann play. Her touch appeared to me (like her wrappers, like the scent of her staircase, her cloaks, her chrysanthemums) to form part of an individual and mysterious whole, in a world infinitely superior to that in which the mind is capable of analysing talent. “Attractive, isn’t it, that Vinteuil sonata?” Swann asked me. “The moment when night is darkening among the trees, when the arpeggios of the violin call down a cooling dew upon the earth. You must admit that it is rather charming; it shews all the static side of moonlight, which is the essential part. It is not surprising that a course of radiant heat such as my wife is taking, should act on the muscles, since moonlight can prevent the leaves from stirring. That is what he expresses so well in that little phrase, the Bois de Boulogne plunged in a cataleptic trance. By the sea it is even more striking, because you have there the faint response of the waves, which, of course, you can hear quite distinctly, since nothing else dares to move. In Paris it is the other way; at the most, you may notice unfamiliar lights among the old buildings, the sky brightened as though by a colourless and harmless conflagration, that sort of vast variety show of which you get a hint here and there. But in Vinteuil’s little phrase, and in the whole sonata for that matter, it is not like that; the scene is laid in the Bois; in the gruppetto you can distinctly hear a voice saying: ‘I can almost see to read the paper!’” These words from Swann might have falsified, later on, my impression of the sonata, music being too little exclusive to inhibit absolutely what other people suggest that we should find in it. But I understood from other words which he let fall that this nocturnal foliage was simply that beneath whose shade in many a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris he had listened on many an evening to the little phrase. In place of the profound significance that he had so often sought in it, what it recalled now to Swann were the leafy boughs, arranged, wreathed, painted round about it (which it gave him the desire to see again because it seemed to him to be their inner, their hidden self, as it were their soul); was the whole of one spring season which he had not been able to enjoy before, not having had — feverish and moody as he then was — enough strength of body and mind for its enjoyment, which, as one puts by for an invalid the dainties that he has not been able to eat, it had kept in store for him. The charm that he had been made to feel by certain evenings in the Bois, a charm of which Vinteuil’s sonata served to remind him, he could not have recaptured by questioning Odette, although she, as well as the little phrase, had been his companion there. But Odette had been merely his companion, by his side, not (as the phrase had been) within him, and so had seen nothing — nor would she, had she been a thousand times as comprehending, have seen anything of that vision which for no one among us (or at least I was long under the impression that this rule admitted no exception) can be made externally visible. “It is rather charming, don’t you think,” Swann continued, “that sound can give a reflection, like water, or glass. It is curious, too, that Vinteuil’s phrase now shews me only the things to which I paid no attention then. Of my troubles, my loves of those days it recalls nothing, it has altered all my values.” “Charles, I don’t think that’s very polite to me, what you’re saying.” “Not polite? Really, you women are superb! I was simply trying to explain to this young man that what the music shews — to me, at least — is not for a moment ‘Free-will’ or ‘In Tune with the Infinite,’ but shall we say old Verdurin in his frock coat in the palm-house at the Jardin d’Acclimatation. Hundreds of times, without my leaving this room, the little phrase has carried me off to dine with it at Armenonville. Gad, it is less boring, anyhow, than having to go there with Mme. de Cambremer.” Mme. Swann laughed. “That is a lady who is supposed to have been violently in love with Charles,” she explained, in the same tone in which, shortly before, when we were speaking of Vermeer of Delft, of whose existence I had been surprised to find her conscious, she had answered me with: “I ought to explain that M. Swann was very much taken up with that painter at the time he was courting me. Isn’t that so, Charles dear?” “You’re not to start saying things about Mme. de Cambremer!” Swann checked her, secretly flattered. “But I’m only repeating what I’ve been told. Besides, it seems that she’s an extremely clever woman; I don’t know her myself. I believe she’s very pushing, which surprises me rather in a clever woman. But everyone says that she was quite mad about you; there’s no harm in repeating that.” Swann remained silent as a deaf-mute which was in a way a confirmation of what she had said, and a proof of his own fatuity. “Since what I’m playing reminds you of the Jardin d’Acclimatation,” his wife went on, with a playful semblance of being offended, “we might take him there some day in the carriage, if it would amuse him. It’s lovely there just now, and you can recapture your fond impressions! Which reminds me, talking of the Jardin d’Acclimatation, do you know, this young man thought that we were devotedly attached to a person whom I cut, as a matter of fact, whenever I possibly can, Mme. Blatin! I think it is rather crushing for us, that she should be taken for a friend of ours. Just fancy, dear Dr. Cottard, who never says a harsh word about anyone, declares that she’s positively contagious.” “A frightful woman! The one thing to be said for her is that she is exactly like Savonarola. She is the very image of that portrait of Savonarola, by Fra Bartolomeo.” This mania which Swann had for finding likenesses to people in pictures was defensible, for even what we call individual expression is — as we so painfully discover when we are in love and would fain believe in the unique reality of the beloved — something diffused and general, which can be found existing at different periods. But if one had listened to Swann, the processions of the Kings of the East, already so anachronistic when Benozzo Gozzoli introduced in their midst various Medici, would have been even more so, since they would have included the portraits of a whole crowd of men, contemporaries not of Gozzoli but of Swann, subsequent, that is to say not only by fifteen centuries to the Nativity but by four more to the painter himself. There was not missing from those trains, according to Swann, a single living Parisian of any note, any more than there was from that act in one of Sardou’s plays, in which, out of friendship for the author and for the leading lady, and also because it was the fashion, all the best known men in Paris, famous doctors, politicians, barristers, amused themselves, each on a different evening, by ‘walking on.’ “But what has she got to do with the Jardin d’Acclimatation?” “Everything!” “What? You don’t suggest that she’s got a sky-blue behind, like the monkeys?” “Charles, you really are too dreadful! I was thinking of what the Cingalese said to her. Do tell him, Charles; it really is a gem.” “Oh, it’s too silly. You know, Mme. Blatin loves asking people questions, in a tone which she thinks friendly, but which is really overpowering.” “What our good friends on the Thames call ‘patronising,’” interrupted Odette. “Exactly. Well, she went the other day to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, where they have some blackamoors — Cingalese, I think I heard my wife say; she is much ‘better up’ in ethnology than I am.” “Now, Charles, you’re not to make fun of poor me.”

    “I’ve no intention of making fun, I assure you. Well, to continue, she went up to one of these black fellows with ‘Good morning, nigga!’ . . . ” “Oh, it’s too absurd!” “Anyhow, this classification seems to have displeased the black. ‘Me nigga,’ he shouted (quite furious, don’t you know), to Mme. Blatin, ‘me nigga; you, old cow!’” “I do think that’s so delightful! I adore that story. Do say it’s a good one. Can’t you see old Blatin standing there, and hearing him: ‘Me nigga; you, old cow’?” I expressed an intense desire to go there and see these Cingalese, one of whom had called Mme. Blatin an old cow. They did not interest me in the least. But I reflected that in going to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, and again on our way home, we should pass along that Allée des Acacias in which I had loved so, once, to gaze on Mme. Swann, and that perhaps Coquelin’s mulatto friend, to whom I had never managed to exhibit myself in the act of saluting her, would see me there, seated at her side, as the victoria swept by

    During those minutes in which Gilberte, having gone to ‘get ready,’ was not in the room with us, M. and Mme. Swann would take delight in revealing to me all the rare virtues of their child. And everything that I myself observed seemed to prove the truth of what they said. I remarked that, as her mother had told me, she had not only for her friends but for the servants, for the poor, the most delicate attentions carefully thought out, a desire to give pleasure, a fear of causing annoyance, translated into all sorts of trifling actions which must often have meant great inconvenience to her. She had done some ‘work’ for our stall-keeper in the Champs-Elysées, and went out in the snow to give it to her with her own hands, so as not to lose a day. “You have no idea how kind-hearted she is, she won’t let it be seen,” her father assured me. Young as she was, she appeared far more sensible already than her parents. When Swann boasted of his wife’s grand friends Gilberte would turn away, and remain silent, but without any air of reproaching him, for it seemed inconceivable to her that her father could be subjected to the slightest criticism. One day, when I had spoken to her of Mlle. Vinteuil, she said to me:

    “I shall never know her, for a very good reason, and that is that she was not nice to her father, by what one hears, she gave him a lot of trouble. You can’t understand that any more than I, can you; I’m sure you could no more live without your papa than I could, which is quite natural after all. How can one ever forget a person one has loved all one’s life?”

    And once when she was making herself particularly endearing to Swann, as I mentioned this to her when he was out of the room:

    “Yes, poor Papa, it is the anniversary of his father’s death, just now. You can understand what he must be feeling; you do understand, don’t you; you and I feel the same about things like that. So I just try to be a little less naughty than usual.” “But he doesn’t ever think you naughty. He thinks you’re quite perfect.” “Poor Papa, that’s because he’s far too good himself.”

    But her parents were not content with singing the praises of Gilberte — that same Gilberte, who, even, before I had set eyes on her, used to appear to me standing before a church, in a landscape of the He de France, and later, awakening in me not dreams now but memories, was embowered always in a hedge of pink hawthorn, in the little lane that I took when I was going the Méséglise way. Once when I had asked Mme. Swann (and had made an effort to assume the indifferent tone of a friend of the family, curious to know the preferences of a child), which among all her playmates Gilberte liked the best, Mme. Swann replied: “But you ought to know a great deal better than I do. You are in her confidence, her great favourite, her ‘chum,’ as the English say.”

    It appears that in a coincidence as perfect as this was, when reality is folded over to cover the ideal of which we have so long been dreaming, it completely hides that ideal, absorbing it in itself, as when two geometrical figures that are congruent are made to coincide, so that there is but one, whereas we would rather, so as to give its full significance to our enjoyment, preserve for all those separate points of our desire, at the very moment in which we succeed in touching them, and so as to be quite certain that they are indeed themselves, the distinction of being intangible. And our thought cannot even reconstruct the old state so as to confront the new with it, for it has no longer a clear field: the acquaintance that we have made, the memory of those first, unhoped-for moments, the talk to which we have listened are there now to block the passage of our consciousness, and as they control the outlets of our memory far more than those of our imagination, they react more forcibly upon our past, which we are no longer able to visualise without taking them into account, than upon the form, still unshaped, of our future. I had been able to believe, year after year, that the right to visit Mme. Swann was a vague and fantastic privilege to which I should never attain; after I had spent a quarter of an hour in her drawing-room, it was the period in which I did not yet know her that was become fantastic and vague like a possibility which the realisation of an alternative possibility has made impossible. How was I ever to dream again of her dining-room as of an inconceivable place, when I could not make the least movement in my mind without crossing the path of that inextinguishable ray cast backwards to infinity, even ino my own most distant past, by the lobster à l’Américaine which I had just been eating? And Swann must have observed in his own case a similar phenomenon; for this house in which he entertained me might be regarded as the place into which had flowed, to coincide and be lost in one another, not only the ideal dwelling that my imagination had constructed, but another still, that which his jealous love, as inventive as any fantasy of mine, had so often depicted to him, that dwelling common to Odette and himself which had appeared so inaccessible once, on evenings when Odette had taken him home with Forcheville to drink orangeade with her; and what had flowed in to be absorbed, for him, in the walls and furniture of the dining-room in which we now sat down to luncheon was that unhoped-for paradise in which, in the old days, he could not without a pang imagine that he would one day be saying to their butler those very words, “Is Madame ready yet?” which I now heard him utter with a touch of impatience mingled with self-satisfaction. No more than, probably, Swann himself could I succeed in knowing my own happiness, and when Gilberte once broke out: “Who would ever have said that the little girl you watched playing prisoners’ base, without daring to speak to her, would one day be your greatest friend, and you would go to her house whenever you liked?” she spoke of a change the occurrence of which I could verify only by observing it from without, finding no trace of it within myself, for it was composed of two separate states on both of which I could not, without their ceasing to be distinct from one another, succeed in keeping my thoughts fixed at one and the same time

    And yet this house, because it had been so passionately desired by Swann, must have kept for him some of its attraction, if I was to judge by myself for whom it had not lost all its mystery. That singular charm in which I had for so long supposed the life of the Swanns to be bathed I had not completely exorcised from their house on making my own way into it; I had made it, that charm, recoil, overpowered as it must be by the sight of the stranger, the pariah that I had been, to whom now Mme. Swann pushed forward graciously for him to sit in it an armchair exquisite, hostile, scandalised; but all round me that charm, in my memory, I can still distinguish. Is it because, on those days on which M. and Mme. Swann invited me to luncheon, to go out afterwards with them and Gilberte, I imprinted with my gaze — while I sat waiting for them there alone — on the carpet, the sofas, the tables, the screens, the pictures, the idea engraved upon my mind that Mme. Swann, or her husband, or Gilberte was about to enter the room? Is it because those objects have dwelt ever since in my memory side by side with the Swanns, and have gradually acquired something of their personal character? Is it because, knowing that the Swanns passed their existence among all those things, I made of all of them as it were emblems of the private lives, of those habits of the Swanns from which I had too long been excluded for them not to continue to appear strange to me, even when I was allowed the privilege of sharing in them? However it may be, always when I think of that drawing-room which Swann (not that the criticism implied on his part any intention to find fault with his wife’s taste) found so incongruous — because, while it was still planned and carried out in the style, half conservatory, half studio, which had been that of the rooms in which he had first known Odette, she had, none the less, begun to replace in its medley a quantity of the Chinese ornaments, which she now felt to be rather gimcrack, a trifle dowdy, by a swarm of little chairs and stools and things upholstered in old Louis XIV silks; not to mention the works of art brought by Swann himself from his house on the Quai d’Orléans — it has kept in my memory, on the contrary, that composite, heterogeneous room, a cohesion, a unity, an individual charm never possessed even by the most complete, the least spoiled of such collections that the past has bequeathed to us, or the most modern, alive and stamped with the imprint of a living personality; for we alone can, by our belief that they have an existence of their own, give to certain of the things that we see a soul which they afterwards keep, which they develop in our minds. All the ideas that I had formed of the hours, different from those that exist for other men, passed by the Swanns in that house which was to their life what the body is to the soul, and must give expression to its singularity, all those ideas were rearranged, amalgamated — equally disturbing and indefinite throughout — in the arrangement of the furniture, the thickness of the carpets, the position of the windows, the ministrations of the servants. When, after luncheon, we went in the sunshine to drink our coffee in the great bay window of the drawing-room, while Mme. Swann was asking me how many lumps of sugar I took, it was not only the silk-covered stool which she pushed towards me that emitted, with the agonising charm that I had long ago felt — first among the pink hawthorn and then beside the clump of laurels — in the name of Gilberte, the hostility that her parents had shewn to me, which this little piece of furniture seemed to have so well understood, to have so completely shared that I felt myself unworthy, and found myself almost reluctant to set my feet on its defenceless cushion; a personality, a soul was latent there which linked it secretly to the light of two o’clock in the afternoon, so different from any other light, in the gulf in which there played about our feet its sparkling tide of gold out of which the bluish crags of sofas and vaporous carpet beaches emerged like enchanted islands; and there was nothing, even to the painting by Rubens hung above the chimney-piece, that was not endowed with the same quality and almost the same intensity of charm as the laced boots of M. Swann, and that hooded cape, the like of which I had so dearly longed to wear, whereas now Odette would beg her husband to go and put on another, so as to appear more smart, whenever I did them the honour of driving out with them. She too went away to change her dress — not heeding my protestations that no ‘outdoor’ clothes could be nearly so becoming as the marvellous garment of crêpe-de-Chine or silk, old rose, cherry-coloured, Tiepolo pink, white, mauve, green, red or yellow, plain or patterned, in which Mme. Swann had sat down to luncheon and which she was now going to take off. When I assured her that she ought to go out in that costume, she laughed, either in scorn of my ignorance or from delight in my compliment. She apologised for having so many wrappers, explaining that they were the only kind of dress in which she felt comfortable, and left us, to go and array herself in one of those regal toilets which imposed their majesty on all beholders, and yet among which I was sometimes summoned to decide which of them I preferred that she should put on

    In the Jardin d’Acclimatation, how proud I was when we had left the carriage to be walking by the side of Mme. Swann! While she strolled carelessly on, letting her cloak stream on the air behind her, I kept eyeing her with an admiring gaze to which she coquettishly responded in a lingering smile. And now, were we to meet one or other of Gilberte’s friends, boy or girl, who saluted us from afar, I would in my turn be looked upon by them as one of those happy creatures whose lot I had envied, one of those friends of Gilberte who knew her family and had a share in that other part of her life, the part which was not spent in the Champs-Elysées

    Often upon the paths of the Bois or the Jardin we passed, we were greeted by some great lady who was Swann’s friend, whom he perchance did not see, so that his wife must rally him with a “Charles! Don’t you see Mme. de Montmorency?” And Swann, with that amicable smile, bred of a long and intimate friendship, bared his head, but with a slow sweeping gesture, with a grace peculiarly his own. Sometimes the lady would stop, glad of an opportunity to shew Mme. Swann a courtesy which would involve no tiresome consequences, by which they all knew that she would never seek to profit, so thoroughly had Swann trained her in reserve. She had none the less acquired all the manners of polite society, and however smart, however stately the lady might be, Mme. Swann was invariably a match for her; halting for a moment before the friend whom her husband had recognised and was addressing, she would introduce us, Gilberte and myself, with so much ease of manner, would remain so free, so tranquil in her exercise of courtesy, that it would have been hard to say, looking at them both, which of the two was the aristocrat. The day on which we went to inspect the Cingalese, on our way home we saw coming in our direction, and followed by two others who seemed to be acting as her escort, an elderly but still attractive woman cloaked in a dark mantle and capped with a little bonnet tied beneath her chin with a pair of ribbons. “Ah! Here is someone who will interest you!” said Swann. The old lady, who had come within a few yards of us, now smiled at us with a caressing sweetness. Swann doffed his hat. Mme. Swann swept to the ground in a curtsey and made as if to kiss the hand of the lady, who, standing there like a Winterhalter portrait, drew her up again and kissed her cheek. “There, there; will you put your hat on, you!” she scolded Swann in a thick and almost growling voice, speaking like an old and familiar friend. “I am going to present you to Her Imperial Highness,” Mme. Swann whispered. Swann drew me aside for a moment while his wife talked of the weather and of the animals recently added to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, with the Princess. “That is the Princesse Mathilde,” he told me; “you know who’ I mean, the friend of Flaubert, Sainte-Beuve, Dumas. Just fancy, she’s the niece of Napoleon I. She had offers of marriage from Napoleon III and the Emperor of Russia. Isn’t that interesting? Talk to her a little. But I hope she won’t keep us standing here for an hour! . . . I met Taine the other day,” he went on, addressing the Princess, “and he told me that your Highness was vexed with him.” “He’s behaved like a perfect peeg!” she said gruffly, pronouncing the word cochon as though she referred to Joan of Arc’s contemporary, Bishop Cauchon. “After his article on the Emperor I left my card on him with p. p. c. on it.” I felt the surprise that one feels on opening the Correspondence of that Duchesse d’Orléans who was by birth a Princess Palatine. And indeed Princesse Mathilde, animated by sentiments so entirely French, expressed them with a straightforward bluntness that recalled the Germany of an older generation, and was inherited, doubtless, from her Wuerttemberg mother. This somewhat rude and almost masculine frankness she softened, as soon as she began to smile, with an Italian languor. And the whole person was clothed in a dress so typically ‘Second Empire’ that — for all that the Princess wore it simply and solely, no doubt, from attachment to the fashions that she had loved when she was young — she seemed to have deliberately planned to avoid the slightest discrepancy in historic colour, and to be satisfying the expectations of those who looked to her to evoke the memory of another age. I whispered to Swann to ask her whether she had known Musset. “Very slightly, sir,” was the answer, given in a tone which seemed to feign annoyance at the question, and of course it was by way of a joke that she called Swann ‘Sir,’ since they were intimate friends. “I had him to dine once. I had invited him for seven o’clock. At half-past seven, as he had not appeared, we sat down to dinner. He arrived at eight, bowed to me, took his seat, never opened his lips, went off after dinner without letting me hear the sound of his voice. Of course, he was dead drunk. That hardly encouraged me to make another attempt.” We were standing a little way off, Swann and I. “I hope this little audience is not going to last much longer,” he muttered, “the soles of my feet are hurting. I cannot think why my wife keeps on making conversation. When we get home it will be she that complains of being tired, and she knows I simply cannot go on standing like this.” For Mme. Swann, who had had the news from Mme. Bontemps, was in the course of telling the Princess that the Government, having at last begun to realise the depth of its depravity, had decided to send her an invitation to be present on the platform in a few days’ time, when the Tsar Nicholas was to visit the Invalides. But the Princess who, in spite of appearances, in spite of the character of her circle, which consisted mainly of artists and literary people, had remained at heart and shewed herself, whenever she had to take action, the niece of Napoleon, replied: “Yes, Madame, I received it this morning, and I sent it back to the Minister, who must have had it by now. I told him that I had no need of an invitation to go to the Invalides. If the Government desires my presence there, it will not be on the platform, it will be in our vault, where the Emperor’s tomb is. I have no need of a card to admit me there. I have my keys. I go in and out when I choose. The Government has only to let me know whether it wishes me to be present or not. But if I do go to the Invalides, it will be down below there or nowhere at all.” At that moment we were saluted, Mme. Swann and I, by a young man who greeted her without stopping, and whom I was not aware that she knew; it was Bloch. I inquired about him, and was told that he had been introduced to her by Mme. Bontemps, and that he was employed in the Minister’s secretariat, which was news to me. Anyhow, she could not have seen him often — or perhaps she had not cared to utter the name, hardly ‘smart’ enough for her liking, of Bloch, for she told me that he was called M. Moreul. I assured her that she was mistaken, that his name was Bloch. The Princess gathered up the train that flowed out behind her, while Mme. Swann gazed at it with admiring eyes. “It is only a fur that the Emperor of Russia sent me,” she explained, “and as I have just been to see him I put it on, so as to shew him that I’d managed to have it made up as a mantle.” “I hear that Prince Louis has joined the Russian Army; the Princess will be very sad at losing him,” went on Mme. Swann, not noticing her husband’s signals of distress. “That was a fine thing to do. As I said to him, ‘Just because there’s been a soldier, before, in the family, that’s no reason!’” replied the Princess, alluding with this abrupt simplicity to Napoleon the Great. But Swann could hold out no longer. “Ma’am, it is I that am going to play the Prince, and ask your permission to retire; but, you see, my wife has not been so well, and I do not like her to stand still for any time.” Mme. Swann curtseyed again, and the Princess conferred upon us all a celestial smile, which she seemed to have summoned out of the past, from among the graces of her girlhood, from the evenings at Compiègne, a smile which glided, sweet and unbroken, over her hitherto so sullen face; then she went on her way, followed by the two ladies in waiting, who had confined themselves, in the manner of interpreters, of children’s or invalids’ nurses, to punctuating our conversation with insignificant sentences and superfluous explanations. “You should go and write your name in her book, one day this week,” Mme. Swann counselled me. “One doesn’t leave cards upon these ‘Royalties,’ as the English call them, but she will invite you to her house if you put your name down.”

    Sometimes in those last days of winter we would go, before proceeding on our expedition, into one of the small picture-shows that were being given at that time, where Swann, as a collector of mark, was greeted with special deference by the dealers in whose galleries they were held. And in that still wintry weather the old longing to set out for the South of France and Venice would be reawakened in me by those rooms in which a springtime, already well advanced, and a blazing sun cast violet shadows upon the roseate Alpilles and gave the intense transparency of emeralds to the Grand Canal. If the weather were inclement, we would go to a concert or a theatre, and afterwards to one of the fashionable tearooms. There, whenever Mme. Swann had anything to say to me which she did not wish the people at the next table, or even the waiters who brought our tea, to understand, she would say it in English, as though that had been a secret language known to our two selves alone. As it happened everyone in the place knew English — I only had not yet learned the language, and was obliged to say so to Mme. Swann in order that she might cease to make, on the people who were drinking tea or were serving us with it, remarks which I guessed to be uncomplimentary without either my understanding or the person referred to losing a single word

    Once, in the matter of an afternoon at the theatre, Gilberte gave me a great surprise. It was precisely the day of which she had spoken to me some time back, on which fell the anniversary of her grandfather’s death. We were to go, she and I, with her governess, to hear selections from an opera, and Gilberte had dressed with a view to attending this performance, and wore the air of indifference with which she was in the habit of treating whatever we might be going to do, with the comment that it might be anything in the world, no matter what, provided that it amused me and had her parents’ approval. Before luncheon, her mother drew us aside to tell us that her father was vexed at the thought of our going to a theatre on that day. This seemed to me only natural. Gilberte remained impassive, but grew pale with an anger which she was unable to conceal; still she uttered not a word. When M. Swann joined us his wife took him to the other end of the room and said something in his ear. He called Gilberte, and they went together into the next room. We could hear their raised voices. And yet I could not bring myself to believe that Gilberte, so submissive, so loving, so thoughtful, would resist her father’s appeal, on such a day and for so trifling a matter. At length Swann reappeared with her, saying: “You heard what I said. Now you may do as you like.”

    Gilberte’s features remained compressed in a frown throughout luncheon, after which we retired to her room. Then suddenly, without hesitating and as though she had never at any point hesitated over her course of action: “Two o’clock!” she exclaimed. “You know the concert begins at half past.” And she told her governess to make haste

    “But,” I reminded her, “won’t your father be cross with you?”

    “Not the least little bit!”

    “Surely, he was afraid it would look odd, because of the anniversary.”

    “What difference can it make to me what people think? I think it’s perfectly absurd to worry about other people in matters of sentiment. We feel things for ourselves, not for the public. Mademoiselle has very few pleasures; she’s been looking forward to going to this concert. I am not going to deprive her of it just to satisfy public opinion.”

    “But, Gilberte,” I protested, taking her by the arm, “it is not to satisfy public opinion, it is to please your father.”

    “You are not going to pass remarks upon my conduct, I hope,” she said sharply, plucking her arm away

    * * *

    A favour still more precious than their taking me with them to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, the Swanns did not exclude me even from their friendship with Bergotte, which had been at the root of the attraction that I had found in them when, before I had even seen Gilberte, I reflected that her intimacy with that godlike elder would have made her, for me, the most passionately enthralling of friends, had not the disdain that I was bound to inspire in her forbidden me to hope that she would ever take me, in his company, to visit the towns that he loved. And lo, one day, came an invitation from Mme. Swann to a big luncheon-party. I did not know who else were to be the guests. On my arrival I was disconcerted, as I crossed the hall, by an alarming incident. Mme. Swann seldom missed an opportunity of adopting any of those customs which pass as fashionable for a season, and then, failing to find support, are speedily abandoned (as, for instance, many years before, she had had her ‘private hansom,’ or now had, printed in English upon a card inviting you to luncheon, the words, ‘To meet,’ followed by the name of some more or less important personage). Often enough these usages implied nothing mysterious and required no initiation. Take, for instance, a minute innovation of those days, imported from England; Odette had made her husband have some visiting cards printed on which the name Charles Swann was preceded by ‘Mr.’. After the first visit that I paid her, Mme. Swann had left at my door one of these ‘pasteboards,’ as she called them. No one had ever left a card on me before; I felt at once so much pride, emotion, gratitude that, scraping together all the money I possessed, I ordered a superb basket of camellias and had it sent to Mme. Swann. I implored my father to go and leave a card on her, but first, quickly, to have some printed on which his name should bear the prefix ‘Mr.’. He vouchsafed neither of my prayers; I was in despair for some days, and then asked myself whether he might not after all have been right. But this use of ‘Mr.,’ if it meant nothing, was at least intelligible. Not so with another that was revealed to me on the occasion of this luncheon-party, but revealed without any indication of its purport. At the moment when I was about to step from the hall into the drawing-room the butler handed me a thin, oblong envelope upon which my name was inscribed. In my surprise I thanked him; but I eyed the envelope with misgivings. I no more knew what I was expected to do with it than a foreigner knows what to do with one of those little utensils that they lay by his place at a Chinese banquet. I noticed that it was gummed down; I was afraid of appearing indiscreet, were I to open it then and there; and so I thrust it into my pocket with an air of knowing all about it. Mme. Swann had written to me a few days before, asking me to come to luncheon with ‘just a few people.’ There were, however, sixteen of us, among whom I never suspected for a moment that I was to find Bergotte. Mme. Swann, who had already ‘named’ me, as she called it, to several of her guests, suddenly, after my name, in the same tone that she had used in uttering it (in fact, as though we were merely two of the guests at her party, who ought each to feel equally flattered on meeting the other), pronounced that of the sweet Singer with the snowy locks. The name Bergotte made me jump like the sound of a revolver fired at me point blank, but instinctively, for appearance’s sake, I bowed; there, straight in front of me, as by one of those conjurers whom we see standing whole and unharmed, in their frock coats, in the smoke of a pistol shot out of which a pigeon has just fluttered, my salute was returned by a young common little thick-set peering person, with a red nose curled like a snail-shell and a black tuft on his chin. I was cruelly disappointed, for what had just vanished in the dust of the explosion was not only the feeble old man, of whom no vestige now remained; there was also the beauty of an immense work which I had contrived to enshrine in the frail and hallowed organism that I had constructed, like a temple, expressly for itself, but for which no room was to be found in the squat figure, packed tight with blood-vessels, bones, muscles, sinews, of the little man with the snub nose and black beard who stood before me. All the Bergotte whom I had slowly and delicately elaborated for myself, drop by drop, like a stalactite, out of the transparent beauty of his books, ceased (I could see at once) to be of any use, the moment I was obliged to include in him the snail-shell nose and to utilise the little black beard; just as we must reject as worthless the solution of a problem the terms of which we have not read in full, having failed to observe that the total must amount to a specified figure. The nose and beard were elements similarly ineluctable, and all the more aggravating in that, while forcing me to reconstruct entirely the personage of Bergotte, they seemed further to imply, to produce, to secrete incessantly a certain quality of mind, alert and self-satisfied, which was not in the picture, for such a mind had no connexion whatever with the sort of intelligence that was diffused throughout those books, so intimately familiar to me, which were permeated by a gentle and godlike wisdom. Starting from them, I should never have arrived at that snail-shell nose; but starting from the nose, which did not appear to be in the slightest degree ashamed of itself, but stood out alone there like a grotesque ornament fastened on his face, I must proceed in a diametrically opposite direction from the work of Bergotte, I must arrive, it would seem, at the mentality of a busy and preoccupied engineer, of the sort who when you accost him in the street thinks it correct to say: “Thanks, and you?” before you have actually inquired of them how they are, or else, if you assure them that you have been charmed to make their acquaintance, respond with an abbreviation which they imagine to be effective, intelligent and up-to-date, inasmuch as it avoids any waste of precious time on vain formalities: “Same here!” Names are, no doubt, but whimsical draughtsmen, giving us of people as well as of places sketches so little like the reality that we often experience a kind of stupor when we have before our eyes, in place of the imagined, the visible world (which, for that matter, is not the true world, our senses being little more endowed than our imagination with the art of portraiture, so little, indeed, that the final and approximately lifelike pictures which we manage to obtain of reality are at least as different from the visible world as that was from the imagined). But in Bergotte’s case, my preconceived idea of him from his name troubled me far less than my familiarity with his work, to which I was obliged to attach, as to the cord of a balloon, the man with the little beard, without knowing whether it would still have the strength to raise him from the ground. It seemed quite clear, however, that it really was he who had written the books that I had so greatly enjoyed, for Mme. Swann having thought it incumbent upon her to tell him of my admiration for one of these, he shewed no surprise that she should have mentioned this to him rather than to any other of the party, nor did he seem to regard her action as due to a misapprehension, but, swelling out the frock coat which he had put on in honour of all these distinguished guests with a body distended in anticipation of the coming meal, while his mind was completely occupied by other, more real and more important considerations, it was only as at some finished episode in his early life, as though one had made an illusion to a costume of the Duc de Guise which he had worn, one season, at a fancy dress ball, that he smiled as he bore his mind back to the idea of his books; which at once began to fall in my estimation (dragging down with them the whole value of Beauty, of the world, of life itself), until they seemed to have been merely the casual amusement of a man with a little beard. I told myself that he must have taken great pains over them, but that, if he had lived upon an island surrounded by beds of pearl-oysters, he would instead have devoted himself to, and would have made a fortune out of, the pearling trade. His work no longer appeared to me so inevitable. And then I asked myself whether originality did indeed prove that great writers were gods, ruling each one over a kingdom that was his alone, or whether all that was not rather make-believe, whether the differences between one man’s book and another’s were not the result of their respective labours rather than the expression of a radical and essential difference between two contrasted personalities

    Meanwhile we had taken our places at the table. By the side of my plate I found a carnation, the stalk of which was wrapped in silver paper. It embarrassed me less than the envelope that had been handed to me in the hall, which, however, I had completely forgotten. This custom, strange as it was to me, became more intelligible when I saw all the male guests take up the similar carnations that were lying by their plates and slip them into the buttonholes of their coats. I did as they had done, with the air of spontaneity that a free-thinker assumes in church, who is not familiar with the order of service but rises when everyone else rises and kneels a moment after everyone else is on his knees. Another usage, equally strange to me but less ephemeral, disquieted me more. On the other side of my plate was a smaller plate, on which was heaped a blackish substance which I did not then know to be caviare. I was ignorant of what was to be done with it but firmly determined not to let it enter my mouth

    Bergotte was sitting not far from me and I could hear quite well everything that he said. I understood then the impression that M. de Norpois had formed of him. He had indeed a peculiar ‘organ’; there is nothing that so much alters the material qualities of the voice as the presence of thought behind what one is saying; the resonance of one’s diphthongs, the energy of one’s labials are profoundly affected — in fact, one’s whole way of speaking. His seemed to me to differ entirely from his way of writing, and even the things that he said from those with which he filled his books. But the voice issues from behind a mask through which it is not powerful enough to make us recognise, at first sight, a face which we have seen uncovered in the speaker’s literary style. At certain pobts in the conversation, when Bergotte, by force of habit, began to talk in a way which no one but M. de Norpois would have thought affected or unpleasant, it was a long time before I discovered an exact correspondence with the parts of his books in which his form became so poetic and so musical. At those points I could see in what he was saying a plastic beauty independent of whatever his sentences might mean, and as human speech reflects the human soul, though without expressing it as does literary style, Bergotte appeared almost to be talking nonsense, intoning certain words and, if he were secretly pursuing, beneath them, a single image, stringing them together uninterruptedly on one continuous note, with a wearisome monotony. So that a pretentious, emphatic and monotonous opening was a sign of the rare aesthetic value of what he was saying, and an effect, in his conversation, of the same power which, in his books, produced that harmonious flow of imagery. I had had all the more difficulty in discovering this at first since what he said at such moments, precisely because it was the authentic utterance of Bergotte, had not the appearance of being Bergotte’s. It was an abundant crop of clearly defined ideas, not included in that ‘Bergotte manner’ which so many story-tellers had appropriated to themselves; and this dissimilarity was probably but another aspect — made out with difficulty through the stream of conversation, as an eclipse is seen through a smoked glass — of the fact that when one read a page of Bergotte it was never just what would have been written by any of those lifeless imitators who, nevertheless, in newspapers and in books, adorned their prose with so many ‘Bergottish’ images and ideas. This difference in style arose from the fact that what was meant by ‘Bergottism’ was, first and foremost, a priceless element of truth hidden in the heart of everything, whence it was extracted by that great writer, by virtue of his genius, and that this extraction, and not simply the perpetration of ‘Bergottisms,’ was my sweet Singer’s aim in writing. Though, it must be added, he continued to perpetrate them in spite of himself, and because he was Bergotte, so that, in one sense, every fresh beauty in his work was the little drop of Bergotte buried at the heart of a thing which he had distilled from it. But if, for that reason, each of those beauties was related to all the rest, and had a ‘family likeness,’ yet each remained separate and individual, as was the act of discovery that had brought it to the light of day; new, and consequently different from what was called the Bergotte manner, which was a loose synthesis of all the ‘Bergottisms’ already invented and set forth by him in writing, with no indication by which men who lacked genius might forecast what would be his next discovery. So it is with all great writers, the beauty of their language is as incalculable as that of a woman whom we have never seen; it is creative, because it is applied to an external object of which, and not of their language or its beauty, they are thinking, to which they have not yet given expression. An author of memorials of our time, wishing to write without too obviously seeming to be writing like Saint-Simon, might, on occasion, give us the first line of his portrait of Villars: “He was a rather tall man, dark . . . with an alert, open, expressive physiognomy,” but what law of determinism could bring him to the discovery of Saint-Simon’s next line, which begins with “and, to tell the truth, a trifle mad”? The true variety is in this abundance of real and unexpected elements, in the branch loaded with blue flowers which thrusts itself forward, against all reason, from the spring hedgerow that seemed already overcharged with blossoms, whereas the purely formal imitation of variety (and one might advance the same argument for all the other qualities of style) is but a barren uniformity, that is to say the very antithesis of variety, and cannot, in the work of imitators, give the illusion or recall other examples of variety save to a reader who has not acquired the sense of it from the masters themselves

    And so — just as Bergotte’s way of speaking would no doubt have been charming if he himself had been merely an amateur repeating imitations of Bergotte, whereas it was attached to the mind of Bergotte, at work and in action, by essential ties which the ear did not at once distinguish — so it was because Bergotte applied that mind with precision to the reality which pleased him that his language had in it something positive, something over-rich, disappointing those who expected to hear him speak only of the ‘eternal torrent of forms,’ and of the ‘mystic thrills of beauty.’ Moreover the quality, always rare and new, of what he wrote was expressed in his conversation by so subtle a manner of approaching a question, ignoring every aspect of it that was already familiar, that he appeared to be seizing hold of an unimportant detail, to be quite wrong about it, to be speaking in paradox, so that his ideas seemed as often as not to be in confusion, for each of us finds lucidity only in those ideas which are in the same state of confusion as his own. Besides, as all novelty depends upon the elimination, first, of the stereotyped attitude to which we have grown accustomed, and which has seemed to us to be reality itself, every new conversation, as well as all original painting and music, must always appear laboured and tedious. It is founded upon figures of speech with which we are not familiar, the speaker appears to us to be talking entirely in metaphors; and this wearies us, and gives us the impression of a want of truth. (After all, the old forms of speech must in their time have been images difficult to follow when the listener was not yet cognisant of the universe which they depicted. But he has long since decided that this must be the real universe, and so relies confidently upon it.) So when Bergotte — and his figures appear simple enough to-day — said of Cottard that he was a mannikin in a bottle, always trying to rise to the surface, and of Brichot that “to him even more than to Mme. Swann the arrangement of his hair was a matter for anxious deliberation, because, in his twofold preoccupation over his profile and his reputation, he had always to make sure that it was so brushed as to give him the air at once of a lion and of a philosopher,” one immediately felt the strain, and sought a foothold upon something which one called more concrete, meaning by that more ordinary. These unintelligible words, issuing from the mask that I had before my eyes, it was indeed to the writer whom I admired that they must be attributed, and yet they could not have been inserted among his books, in the form of a puzzle set in a series of different puzzles, they occupied another plane and required a transposition by means of which, one day, when I was repeating to myself certain phrases that I had heard Bergotte use, I discovered in them the whole machinery of his literary style, the different elements of which I was able to recognise and to name in this spoken discourse which had struck me as being so different

    >From a less immediate point of view the special way, a little too meticulous, too intense, that he had of pronouncing certain words, certain adjectives which were constantly recurring in his conversation, and which he never uttered without a certain emphasis, giving to each of their syllables a separate force and intoning the last syllable (as for instance the word visage, which he always used in preference to figure, and enriched with a number of superfluous v’s and s’s and g’s, which seemed all to explode from his outstretched palm at such moments) corresponded exactly to the fine passages in which, in his prose, he brought those favourite words into the light, preceded by a sort of margin and composed in such a way in the metrical whole of the phrase that the reader was obliged, if he were not to make a false quantity, to give to each of them its full value. And yet one did not find in the speech of Bergotte a certain luminosity which in his books, as in those of some other writers, often modified in the written phrase the appearance of its words. This was doubtless because that light issues from so profound a depth that its rays do not penetrate to our spoken words in the hours in which, thrown open to others by the act of conversation, we are to a certain extent closed against ourselves. In this respect, there were more intonations, there was more accent in his books than in his talk; an accent independent of the beauty of style, which the author himself has possibly not perceived, for it is not separable from his most intimate personality. It was this accent which, at the moments when, in his books, Bergotte was entirely natural, gave a rhythm to the words — often at such times quite insignificant — that he wrote. This accent is not marked on the printed page, there is nothing there to indicate it, and yet it comes of its own accord to his phrases, one cannot pronounce them in any other way, it is what was most ephemeral and at the same time most profound in the writer, and it is what will bear witness to his true nature, what will say whether, despite all the austerity that he has expressed he was gentle, despite all his sensuality sentimental

    Certain peculiarities of elocution, faint traces of which were to be found in Bergotte’s conversation, were not exclusively his own; for when, later on, I came to know his brothers and sisters, I found those peculiarities much more accentuated in their speech. There was something abrupt and harsh in the closing words of a light and spirited utterance, something faint and dying at the end of a sad one. Swann, who had known the Master as a boy, told me that in those days one used to hear on his lips, just as much as on his brothers’ and sisters’, those inflexions, almost a family type, shouts of violent merriment interspersed with murmurings of a long-drawn melancholy, and that in the room in which they all played together he used to perform his part, better than any of them, in their symphonies, alternately deafening and subdued. However characteristic it may be, the sound that escapes from human lips is fugitive and does not survive the speaker. But it was not so with the pronunciation of the Bergotte family. For if it is difficult ever to understand, even in the Meistersinger, how an artist can invent music by listening to the twittering of birds, yet Bergotte had transposed and fixed in his written language that manner of dwelling on words which repeat themselves in shouts of joy, or fall, drop by drop, in melancholy sighs. There are in his books just such closing phrases where the accumulated sounds are prolonged (as in the last chords of the overture of an opera which cannot come to an end, and repeats several times over its supreme cadence before the conductor finally lays down his baton), in which, later on, I was to find a musical equivalent for those phonetic ‘brasses’ of the Bergotte family. But in his own case, from the moment in which he transferred them to his books, he ceased instinctively to make use of them in his speech. From the day on which he had begun to write — all the more markedly, therefore, in the later years in which I first knew him — his voice had lost this orchestration for ever

    These young Bergottes — the future writer and his brothers and sisters — were doubtless in no way superior, far from it, to other young people, more refined, more intellectual than themselves, who found the Bergottes rather ‘loud that is to say a trifle vulgar, irritating one by the witticisms which characterised the tone, at once pretentious and puerile, of their household. But genius, and even what is only great talent, springs less from seeds of intellect and social refinement superior to those of other people than from the faculty of transposing, and so transforming them. To heat a liquid over an electric lamp one requires to have not the strongest lamp possible, but one of which the current can cease to illuminate, can be diverted so as instead of light to give heat. To mount the skies it is not necessary to have the most powerful of motors, one must have a motor which, instead of continuing to run along the earth’s surface, intersecting with a vertical line the horizontal which it began by following, is capable of converting its speed into ascending force. Similarly the men who produce works of genius are not those who live in the most delicate atmosphere, whose conversation is most brilliant or their culture broadest, but those who have had the power, ceasing in a moment to live only for themselves, to make use of their personality as of a mirror, m such a way that their life, however unimportant it may be socially, and even, in a sense, intellectually speaking, is reflected by it, genius consisting in the reflective power of the writer and not in the intrinsic quality of the scene reflected. The day on which young Bergotte succeeded in shewing to the world of his readers the tasteless household in which he had passed his childhood, and the not very amusing conversations between himself and his brothers, on that day he climbed far above the friends of his family, more intellectual and more distinguished than himself; they in their fine Rolls Royces might return home expressing due contempt for the vulgarity of the Bergottes; but he, with his modest engine which had at last left the ground, he soared above their heads

    But there were other characteristics of his elocution which it was not with the members of his family, but with certain contemporary writers, that he must share. Younger men, who were beginning to repudiate him as a master and disclaimed any intellectual affinity to him in themselves, displayed their affinity without knowing it when they made use of the same adverbs, the same prepositions that he incessantly repeated, when they constructed their sentences in the same way, spoke in the same quiescent, lingering tone, by a reaction from the eloquent, easy language of an earlier generation. Perhaps these young men — we shall come across some of whom this may be said — had never known Bergotte. But his way of thinking, inoculated into them, had led them to those alterations of syntax and of accent which bear a necessary relation to originality of mind. A relation which, incidentally, requires to be traced. Thus Bergotte, if he owed nothing to any man for his manner of writing, derived his manner of speaking from one of his early associates, a marvellous talker to whose ascendancy he had succumbed, whom he imitated, unconsciously, in his conversation, but who himself, being less gifted, had never written any really outstanding book. So that if one had been in quest of originality in speech, Bergotte must have been labelled a disciple, a writer at second-hand, whereas, influenced by his friend only so far as talk went, he had been original and creative in his writings. Doubtless again, so as to distinguish himself from the previous generation, too fond as it had been of abstractions, of weighty commonplaces, when Bergotte wished to speak favourably of a book, what he would bring into prominence, what he would quote with approval would always be some scene that furnished the reader with an image, some picture that had no rational significance. “Ah, yes!” he would exclaim, “it is quite admirable! There is a little girl in an orange shawl. It is excellent!” or again, “Oh, yes, there is a passage in which there is a regiment marching along the street; yes, it is excellent!” As for style, he was not altogether of his time (though he remained quite exclusively of his race, abominating Tolstoy, George Eliot, Ibsen and Dostoievsky), for the word that always came to his lips when he wished to praise the style of any writer was ‘mild.’ “Yes, you know I like Chateaubriand better in Atalathan in René; he seems to me to be ‘milder.’” He said the word like a doctor who, when his patient assures him that milk will give him indigestion, answers, “But, you know, it’s very ‘mild’.” And it is true that there was in Bergotte’s style a kind of harmony similar to that for which the ancients used to praise certain of their orators in terms which we now find it hard to understand, accustomed as we are to our own modern tongues in which effects of that kind are not sought

    He would say also, with a shy smile, of pages of his own for which some one had expressed admiration: “I think it is more or less true, more or less accurate; it may be of some value perhaps,” but he would say this simply from modesty, as a woman to whom one has said that her dress, or her daughter, is charming replies, “It is comfortable,” or “She is a good girl.” But the constructive instinct was too deeply implanted in Bergotte for him not to be aware that the sole proof that he had built usefully and on the lines of truth lay in the pleasure that his work had given, to himself first of all and afterwards to his readers. Only many years later, when he no longer had any talent, whenever he wrote anything with which he was not satisfied, so as not to have to suppress it, as he ought to have done, so as to be able to publish it with a clear conscience he would repeat, but to himself this time: “After all, it is more or less accurate, it must be of some value to the country.” So that the phrase murmured long ago among his admirers by the insincere voice of modesty came in the end to be whispered in the secrecy of his heart by the uneasy tongue of pride. And the same words which had served Bergotte as an unwanted excuse for the excellence of his earliest works became as it were an ineffective consolation to him for the hopeless mediocrity of the latest

    A kind of austerity of taste which he had, a kind of determination to write nothing of which he could not say that it was ‘mild,’ which had made people for so many years regard him as a sterile and precious artist, a chiseller of exquisite trifles, was on the contrary the secret of his strength, for habit forms the style of the writer just as much as the character of the man, and the author who has more than once been patient to attain, in the expression of his thoughts, to a certain kind of attractiveness, in so doing lays down unalterably the boundaries of his talent, just as if he yields too often to pleasure, to laziness, to the fear of being put to trouble, he will find himself describing in terms which no amount of revision can modify, the forms of his own vices and the limits of his virtue

    If, however, despite all the analogies which I was to perceive later on between the writer and the man, I had not at first sight, in Mme. Swann’s drawing-room, believed that this could be Bergotte, the author of so many divine books, who stood before me, perhaps I was not altogether wrong, for he himself did not, in the strict sense of the word, ‘believe’ it either. He did not believe it because he shewed a great assiduity in the presence of fashionable people (and yet he was not a snob), of literary men and journalists who were vastly inferior to himself. Of course he had long since learned, from the suffrage of his readers, that he had genius, compared to which social position and official rank were as nothing. He had learned that he had genius, but he did not believe it because he continued to simulate deference towards mediocre writers in order to succeed, shortly, in becoming an Academician, whereas the Academy and the Faubourg Saint-Germain have no more to do with that part of the Eternal Mind which is the author of the works of Bergotte than with the law of causality or the idea of God. That also he knew, but as a kleptomaniac knows, without profiting by the knowledge, that it is wrong to steal. And the man with the little beard and snail-shell nose knew and used all the tricks of the gentleman who pockets your spoons, in his efforts to reach the coveted academic chair, or some duchess or other who could dispose of several votes at the election, but while on his way to them he would endeavour to make sure that no one who would consider the pursuit of such an object a vice in him should see what he was doing. He was only half-successful; one could hear, alternating with the speech of the true Bergotte, that of the other Bergotte, ambitious, utterly selfish, who thought it not worth his while to speak of any but his powerful, rich or noble friends, so as to enhance his own position, he who in his books, when he was really himself, had so well portrayed the charm, pure as a mountain spring, of poverty

    As for those other vices to which M. de Norpois had alluded, that almost incestuous love, which was made still worse, people said, by a want of delicacy in the matter of money, if they contradicted, in a shocking manner, the tendency of his latest novels, in which he shewed everywhere a regard for what was right and proper so painfully rigid that the most innocent pleasures of their heroes were poisoned by it, and that even the reader found himself turning their pages with a sense of acute discomfort, and asked himself whether it was possible to go on living even the quietest of lives, those vices did not at all prove, supposing that they were fairly imputed to Bergotte, that his literature was a lie and all his sensitiveness mere play-acting. Just as in pathology certain conditions similar in appearance are due, some to an excess, others to an insufficiency of tension, of secretion and so forth, so there may be vice arising from supersensitiveness just as much as from the lack of it. Perhaps it is only in really vicious lives that the moral problem can arise in all its disquieting strength. And of this problem the artist finds a solution in the terms not of his own personal life but of what is for him the true life, a general, a literary solution. As the great Doctors of the Church began often, without losing their virtue, by acquainting themselves with the sins of all mankind, out of which they extracted their own personal sanctity, so great artists often, while being thoroughly wicked, make use of their vices in order to arrive at a conception of the moral law that is binding upon us all. It is the vices (or merely the weaknesses and follies) of the circle in which they live, the meaningless conversation, the frivolous or shocking lives of their daughters, the infidelity of their wives, or their own misdeeds that writers have most often castigated in their books, without, however, thinking it necessary to alter their domestic economy or to improve the tone of their households. And this contrast had never before been so striking as it was in Bergotte’s time, because, on the one hand, in proportion as society grew more corrupt, our notions of morality were increasingly exalted, while on the other hand the public were now told far more than they had ever hitherto known about the private lives of literary men; and on certain evenings in the theatre people would point out the author whom I had so greatly admired at Combray, sitting at the back of a box the mere composition of which seemed an oddly humorous, or perhaps keenly ironical commentary upon — a brazen-faced denial of — the thesis which he had just been maintaining in his latest book. Not that anything which this or that casual informant could tell me was of much use in helping me to settle the question of the goodness or wickedness of Bergotte. An intimate friend would furnish proofs of his hardheartedness; then a stranger would cite some instance (touching, since he had evidently wished it to remain hidden) of his real depth of feeling. He had behaved cruelly to his wife. But in a village inn, where he had gone to spend the night, he had stayed on to watch over a poor woman who had tried to drown herself, and when he was obliged to continue his journey had left a large sum of money with the landlord, so that he should not turn the poor creature out, but see that she got proper attention. Perhaps the more the great writer was developed in Bergotte at the expense of the little man with the beard, so much the more his own personal life was drowned in the flood of all the lives that he imagined, until he no longer felt himself obliged to perform certain practical duties, for which he had substituted the duty of imagining those other lives. But at the same time, because he imagined the feelings of others as completely as if they had been his own, whenever he was obliged, for any reason, to talk to some person who had been unfortunate (that is to say in a casual encounter) he would, in doing so, take up not his own personal standpoint but that of the sufferer himself, a standpoint in which he would have been horrified by the speech of those who continued to think of their own petty concerns in the presence of another’s grief. With the result that he gave rise everywhere to justifiable rancour and to undying gratitude

    Above all, he was a man who in his heart of hearts loved nothing really except certain images and (like a miniature set in the floor of a casket) the composing and painting of them in words. For a trifle that some one had sent him, if that trifle gave him the opportunity of introducing one or two of these images, he would be prodigal in the expression of his gratitude, while shewing none whatever for an expensive present. And if he had had to plead before a tribunal, he would inevitably have chosen his words not for the effect that they might have on the judge but with an eye to certain images which the judge would certainly never have perceived

    That first day on which I met him with Gilberte’s parents, I mentioned to Bergotte that I had recently been to hear Berma in Phèdre; and he told me that in the scene in which she stood with her arm raised to the level of her shoulder — one of those very scenes that had been greeted with such applause — she had managed to suggest with great nobility of art certain classical figures which, quite possibly, she had never even seen, a Hesperid carved in the same attitude upon a metope at Olympia, and also the beautiful primitive virgins on the Erechtheum

    “It may be sheer divination, and yet I fancy that she visits the museums. It would be interesting to ‘establish’ that.” (‘Establish’ was one of those regular Bergotte expressions, and one which various young men who had never met him had caught from him, speaking like him by some sort of telepathic suggestion.)

    “Do you mean the Cariatides?” asked Swann

    “No, no,” said Bergotte, “except in the scene where she confesses her passion to Oenone, where she moves her hand exactly like Hegeso on the stele in the Ceramic, it is a far more primitive art that she revives. I was referring to the Korai of the old Erechtheum, and I admit that there is perhaps nothing quite so remote from the art of Racine, but there are so many things already in Phèdre, . . . that one more . . . Oh, and then, yes, she is really charming, that little sixth century Phaedra, the rigidity of the arm, the lock of hair ‘frozen into marble,’ yes, you know, it is wonderful of her to have discovered all that. There is a great deal more antiquity in it than in most of the books they are labelling ‘antique’ this year.”

    As Bergotte had in one of his volumes addressed a famous invocation to these archaic statues, the words that he was now uttering were quite intelligible to me and gave me a fresh reason for taking an interest in Berma’s acting. I tried to picture her again in my mind, as she had looked in that scene in which I remembered that she had raised her arm to the level of her shoulder. And I said to myself, “There we have the Hesperid of Olympia; there we have the sister of those adorable suppliants on the Acropolis; there is indeed nobility in art!” But if these considerations were to enhance for me the beauty of Berma’s gesture, Bergotte should have put them into my head before the performance. Then, while that attitude of the actress was actually existing in flesh and blood before my eyes, at that moment in which the thing that was happening had still the substance of reality, I might have tried to extract from it the idea of archaic sculpture. But of Berma in that scene all that I retained was a memory which was no longer liable to modification, slender as a picture which lacks that abundant perspective of the present tense where one is free to delve and can always discover something new, a picture to which one cannot retrospectively give a meaning that is not subject to verification and correction from without. At this point Mme. Swann joined in the conversation, asking me whether Gilberte had remembered to give me what Bergotte had written aboutPhèdre, and adding, “My daughter is such a scatter-brain!” Bergotte smiled modestly and protested that they were only a few pages, of no importance. “But it is perfectly charming, that little pamphlet, that little ‘tract’ of yours!” Mme. Swann assured him, to shew that she was a good hostess, to make the rest of us think that she had read Bergotte’s essay, and also because she liked not merely to flatter Bergotte, but to make a selection for herself out of what he wrote, to control his writing. And it must be admitted that she did inspire him, though not in the way that she supposed. But when all is said there is, between what constituted the smartness of Mme. Swann’s drawing-room and a whole side of Bergotte’s work, so close a correspondence that either of them might serve among elderly men to-day, as a commentary upon the other

    I let myself go in telling him what my impressions had been. Often Bergotte disagreed, but he allowed me to go on talking. I told him that I had liked the green light which was turned on when Phaedra raised her arm. “Ah! The designer will be glad to hear that; he is a real artist. I shall tell him you liked it, because he is very proud of that effect. I must say, myself, that I do not care for it very much, it drowns everything in a sort of aqueous vapour, little Phaedra standing there looks too like a branch of coral on the floor of an aquarium. You will tell me, of course, that it brings out the cosmic aspect of the play. That is quite true. All the same, it would be more appropriate if the scene were laid in the Court of Neptune. Oh yes, of course, I know the Vengeance of Neptune does come into the play. I don’t suggest for a moment that we should think only of Port-Royal, but after all the story that Racine tells us is not the ‘Loves of the Sea-Urchins.’ Still, it is what my friend wished to have, and it is very well done, right or wrong, and it’s really quite pretty when you come to look at it. Yes, so you liked that, did you; you understood what it meant, of course; we feel the same about it, don’t we, really; it is a trifle unbalanced, what he’s done, you agree with me, but on the whole it is very clever of him.” And so, when Bergotte had to express an opinion which was the opposite of my own, he in no way reduced me to silence, to the impossibility of framing any reply, as M. de Norpois would have done. This does not prove that Bergotte’s opinions were of less value than the Ambassador’s; far from it. A powerful idea communicates some of its strength to him who challenges it. Being itself a part of the riches of the universal Mind, it makes its way into, grafts itself upon the mind of him whom it is employed to refute, slips in among the ideas already there, with the help of which, gaining a little ground, he completes and corrects it; so that the final utterance is always to some extent the work of both parties to a discussion. It is to ideas which are not, properly speaking, ideas at all, to ideas which, founded upon nothing, can find no support, no kindred spirit among the ideas of the adversary, that he, grappling with something which is not there, can find no word to say in answer. The arguments of M. de Norpois (in the matter of art) were unanswerable simply because they were without reality

    Since Bergotte did not sweep aside my objections, I confessed to him that they had won the scorn of M. de Norpois. “But he’s an old parrot!” was the answer. “He keeps on pecking you because he imagines all the time that you’re a piece of cake, or a slice of cuttle-fish.” “What’s that?” asked Swann. “Are you a friend of Norpois?” “He’s as dull as a wet Sunday,” interrupted his wife, who had great faith in Bergotte’s judgment, and was no doubt afraid that M. de Norpois might have spoken ill of her to us. “I tried to make him talk after dinner; I don’t know if it’s his age or his indigestion, but I found him too sticky for words. I really thought I should have to ‘dope’ him.” “Yes, isn’t he?” Bergotte chimed in. “You see, he has to keep his mouth shut half the time so as not to use up all the stock of inanities that hold his shirt-front down and his white waistcoat up.” “I think that Bergotte and my wife are both very hard on him,” came from Swann, who took the ‘line,’ in his own house, of a plain, sensible man. “I quite see that Norpois cannot interest you very much, but from another point of view,” (for Swann made a hobby of collecting scraps of ‘real life’) “he is quite remarkable, quite a remarkable instance of a lover. When he was Secretary at Rome,” he went on, after making sure that Gilberte could not hear him, “he had, here in Paris, a mistress with whom he was madly in love, and he found time to make the double journey every week, so as to see her for a couple of hours. She was, as it happens, a most intelligent woman, and is quite attractive to this day; she is a dowager now. And he has had any number of others since then. I’m sure I should have gone stark mad if the woman I was in love with lived in Paris and I was kept shut up in Rome. Nervous men ought always to love, as the lower orders say, ‘beneath’ them, so that their women have a material inducement to do what they tell them.” As he spoke, Swann realised that I might be applying this maxim to himself and Odette, and as, even among superior beings, at the moment when you and they seem to be soaring together above the plane of life, their personal pride is still basely human, he was seized by a violent ill-will towards me. But this was made manifest only in the uneasiness of his glance. He said nothing more to me at the time. Not that this need surprise us. When Racine (according to a story the truth of which has been exploded, though the theme of it may be found recurring every day in Parisian life) made an illusion to Scarron in front of Louis XIV, the most powerful monarch on earth said nothing to the poet that evening. It was on the following day, only, that he fell

    But as a theory requires to be stated as a whole, Swann, after this momentary irritation, and after wiping his eyeglass, finished saying what was in his mind in these words, words which were to assume later on in my memory the importance of a prophetic warning, which I had not had the sense to take: “The danger of that kind of love, however, is that the woman’s subjection calms the man’s jealousy for a time but also makes it more exacting. After a little he will force his mistress to live like one of those prisoners whose cells they keep lighted day and night, to prevent their escaping. And that generally ends in trouble.”

    I reverted to M. de Norpois. “You must never trust him; he has the most wicked tongue!” said Mme. Swann in an accent which seemed to me to indicate that M. de Norpois had been ‘saying things’ about her, especially as Swann looked across at his wife with an air of rebuke, as though to stop her before she went too far

    Meanwhile Gilberte, who had been told to go and get ready for our drive, stayed to listen to the conversation, and hovered between her mother and her father, leaning affectionately against his shoulder. Nothing, at first sight, could be in greater contrast to Mme. Swann, who was dark, than this child with her red hair and golden skin. But after looking at them both for a moment one saw in Gilberte many of the features — for instance, the nose cut short with a sharp, unfaltering decision by the unseen sculptor whose chisel repeats its work upon successive generations — the expression, the movements of her mother; to take an illustration from another form of art, she made one think of a portrait that was not a good likeness of Mme. Swann, whom the painter, to carry out some whim of colouring, had posed in a partial disguise, dressed to go out to a party in Venetian ‘character.’ And as not merely was she wearing a fair wig, but every atom of a swarthier complexion had been discharged from her flesh which, stripped of its veil of brownness, seemed more naked, covered simply in rays of light shed by an internal sun, this ‘make-up’ was not just superficial but was incarnate in her; Gilberte had the appearance of embodying some fabulous animal or of having assumed a mythological disguise. This reddish skin was so exactly that of her father that nature seemed to have had, when Gilberte was being created, to solve the problem of how to reconstruct Mme. Swann piecemeal, without any material at her disposal save the skin of M. Swann. And nature had utilised this to perfection, like a master carver who makes a point of leaving the grain, the knots of his wood in evidence. On Gilberte’s face, at the corner of a perfect reproduction of Odette’s nose, the skin was raised so as to preserve intact the two beauty spots of M. Swann. It was a new variety ot Mme. Swann that was thus obtained, growing there by her side like a white lilac-tree beside a purple. At the same time it did not do to imagine the boundary line between these two likenesses as definitely fixed. Now and then, when Gilberte smiled, one could distinguish the oval of her father’s cheek upon her mother’s face, as though some one had mixed them together to see what would result from the blend; this oval grew distinct, as an embryo grows into a living shape, it lengthened obliquely, expanded, and a moment later had disappeared. In Gilberte’s eyes there was the frank and honest gaze of her father; this was how she had looked at me when she gave me the agate marble and said, “Keep it, to remind yourself of our friendship.” But were one to put a question to Gilberte, to ask her what she had been doing, then one saw in those same eyes the embarrassment, the uncertainty, the prevarication, the misery that Odette used in the old days to shew, when Swann asked her where she had been and she gave him one of those lying answers which, in those days, drove the lover to despair and now made him abruptly change the conversation, as an incurious and prudent husband. Often in the Champs-Elysées I was disturbed by seeing this look on Gilberte’s face. But as a rule my fears were unfounded. For in her, a purely physical survival of her mother, this look (if nothing else) had ceased to have any meaning. It was when she had been to her classes, when she must go home for some lesson, that Gilberte’s pupils executed that movement which, in time past, in the eyes of Odette, had been caused by the fear of disclosing that she had, during the day, opened the door to one of her lovers, or was — at that moment in a hurry to be at some trysting-place. So one could see the two natures of M. and Mme. Swann ebb and flow, encroaching alternately one upon the other in the body of this Mélusine

    It is, of course, common knowledge that a child takes after both its-father and its mother. And yet the distribution of the merits and defects which it inherits is so oddly planned that, of two good qualities which seemed inseparable in one of the parents you will find but one in the child, and allied to that very fault in the other parent which seemed most irreconcilable with it. Indeed, the incarnation of a good moral quality in an incompatible physical blemish is often one of the laws of filial resemblance. Of two sisters, one will combine with the proud bearing of her father the mean little soul of her mother; the other, abundantly endowed with the paternal intelligence, will present it to the world in the aspect which her mother has made familiar; her mother’s shapeless nose and scraggy bosom are become the bodily covering of talents which you had learned to distinguish beneath a superb presence. With the result that of each of the sisters one can say with equal justification that it is she who takes more after one or other of her parents. It is true that Gilberte was an only child, but there were, at the least, two Gilbertes. The two natures, her father’s and her mother’s, did more than just blend themselves in her; they disputed the possession of her — and yet one cannot exactly say that, which would let it be thought that a third Gilberte was in the meantime suffering by being the prey of the two others. Whereas Gilberte was alternately one and the other, and at any given moment no more than one of the two, that is to say incapable, when she was not being good, of suffering accordingly, the better Gilberte not being able at the time, on account of her momentary absence, to detect the other’s lapse from virtue. And so the less good of the two was free to enjoy pleasures of an ignoble kind. When the other spoke to you from the heart of her father, she held broad views, you would have liked to engage with her upon a fine and beneficent enterprise; you told her so, but, just as your arrangements were being completed, her mother’s heart would already have resumed its control; hers was the voice that answered; and you were disappointed and vexed — almost baffled, as in the face of a substitution of one person for another — by an unworthy thought, an insincere laugh, in which Gilberte saw no harm, for they sprang from what she herself at that moment was. Indeed, the disparity was at times so great between these two Gilbertes that you asked yourself, though without finding an answer, what on earth you could have said or done to her, last time, to find her now so different. When she herself had arranged to meet you somewhere, not only did she fail to appear, and offer no excuse afterwards, but, whatever the influence might have been that had made her change her mind, she shewed herself in so different a character when you did meet her that you might well have supposed that, taken in by a likeness such as forms the plot of theMenaechmi, you were now talking to some one not the person who had so politely expressed her desire to see you, had she not shewn signs of an ill-humour which revealed that she felt herself to be in the wrong, and wished to avoid the necessity of an explanation

    “Now then, run along and get ready; you’re keeping us waiting,” her mother reminded her

    “I’m so happy here with my little Papa; I want to stay just for a minute,” replied Gilberte, burying her head beneath the arm of her father, who passed his fingers lovingly through her bright hair

    Swann was one of those men who, having lived for a long time amid the illusions of love, have seen the prosperity that they themselves brought to numberless women increase the happiness of those women without exciting in them any gratitude, any tenderness towards their benefactors; but in their child they believe that they can feel an affection which, being incarnate in their own name, will enable them to remain in the world after their death. When there should no longer be any Charles Swann, there would still be a Mlle. Swann, or a Mme. something-else, néeSwann, who would continue to love the vanished father. Indeed, to love him too well, perhaps, Swann may have been thinking, for he acknowledged Gilberte’s caress with a “Good girl!” in that tone, made tender by our apprehension, to which, when we think of the future, we are prompted by the too passionate affection of a creature who is destined to survive us. To conceal his emotion, he joined in our talk about Berma. He pointed out to me, but in a detached, a listless tone, as though he wished to remain to some extent unconcerned in what he was saying, with what intelligence, with what an astonishing fitness the actress said to Oenone, “You knew it!” He was right. That intonation at least had a value that was really intelligible, and might therefore have satisfied my desire to find incontestable reasons for admiring Berma. But it was by the very fact of its clarity that it did not at all content me. Her intonation was so ingenious, so definite in intention and in its meaning, that it seemed to exist by itself, so that any intelligent actress might have learned to use it. It was a fine idea; but whoever else should conceive it as fully must possess it equally. It remained to Berma’s credit that she had discovered it, but is one entitled to use the word ‘discover’ when the object in question is something that would not be different if one had been given it, something that does not belong essentially to one’s own nature seeing that some one else may afterwards reproduce it?

    “Upon my soul, your presence among us does raise the tone of the conversation!” Swann observed to me, as though to excuse himself to Bergotte; for he had formed the habit, in the Guermantes set, of entertaining great artists as if they were just ordinary friends whom one seeks only to make eat the dishes that they like, play the games, or, in the country, indulge in whatever form of sport they please. “It seems to me that we’re talking a great deal of art,” he went on. “But it’s so nice, I do love it!” said Mme. Swann, throwing me a look of gratitude, as well from good nature as because she had not abandoned her old aspirations towards a more intellectual form of conversation. After this it was to others of the party, and principally to Gilberte, that Bergotte addressed himself. I had told him everything that I felt with a freedom which had astonished me, and was due to the fact that, having acquired with him, years before (in the course of all those hours of solitary reading, in which he was to me merely the better part of myself), the habit of sincerity, of frankness, of confidence, I was less frightened by him than by a person with whom I should have been talking for the first time. And yet, for the same reason, I was greatly disturbed by the thought of the impression that I must have been making on him, the contempt that I had supposed he would feel for my ideas dating not from that afternoon but from the already distant time in which I had begun to read his books in our garden at Combray. And yet I ought perhaps to have reminded myself that, since it was in all sincerity, abandoning myself to the train of my thoughts, that I had felt, on the one hand, so intensely in sympathy with the work of Bergotte and on the other hand, in the theatre, a disappointment the reason of which I did not know, those two instinctive movements which had both carried me away could not be so very different from one another, but must be obedient to the same laws; and that that mind of Bergotte which I had loved in his books could not be anything entirely foreign and hostile to my disappointment and to my inability to express it. For my intelligence must be a uniform thing, perhaps indeed there exists but a single intelligence, in which everyone in the world participates, towards which each of us from the position of his own separate body turns his eyes, as in a theatre where, if everyone has his own separate seat, there is on the other hand but a single stage. Of course, the ideas which I was tempted to seek to disentangle were probably not those whose depths Bergotte usually sounded in his books. But if it were one and the same intelligence which we had, he and I, at our disposal, he must, when he heard me express those ideas, be reminded of them, cherish them, smile upon them, keeping probably, in spite of what I supposed, before his mind’s eye a whole world of intelligence other than that an excerpt of which had passed into his books, an excerpt upon which I had based my imagination of his whole mental universe. Just as priests, having the widest experience of the human heart, are best able to pardon the sins which they do not themselves commit, so genius, having the widest experience of the human intelligence, can best understand the ideas most directly in opposition to those which form the foundation of its own writings. I ought to have told myself all this (though, for that matter, it was none too consoling a thought, for the benevolent condescension of great minds has as a corollary the incomprehension and hostility of small; and one derives far less happiness from the friendliness of a great writer, which one finds expressed, failing a more intimate association, in his books, than suffering from the hostility of a woman whom one did not choose for her intelligence but cannot help loving). I ought to have told myself all this, but I did not; I was convinced that I had appeared a fool to Bergotte, when Gilberte whispered in my ear:

    “You can’t think how delighted I am, because you have made a conquest of my great friend Bergotte. He’s been telling Mamma that he found you extremely intelligent.”

    “Where are we going?” I asked her. “Oh, wherever you like; you know, it’s all the same to me.” But since the incident that had occurred on the anniversary of her grandfather’s death I had begun to ask myself whether Gilberte’s character was not other than I had supposed, whether that indifference to what was to be done, that wisdom, that calm, that gentle and constant submission did not indeed conceal passionate longings which her self-esteem would not allow to be visible and which she disclosed only by her sudden resistance whenever by any chance they were frustrated. As Bergotte lived in the same neighbourhood as my parents, we left the house together; in the carriage he spoke to me of my health. “Our friends were telling me that you had been ill. I am very sorry. And yet, after all, I am not too sorry, because I can see quite well that you are able to enjoy the pleasures of the mind, and they are probably what mean most to you, as to everyone who has known them.”

    Alas, what he was saying, how little, I felt, did it apply to myself, whom all reasoning, however exalted it might be, left cold, who was happy only in moments of pure idleness, when I was comfortable and well; I felt how purely material was everything that I desired in life, and how easily I could dispense with the intellect. As I made no distinction among my pleasures between those that came to me from different sources, of varying depth and permanence, I was thinking, when the moment came to answer him, that I should have liked an existence in which I was on intimate terms with the Duchesse de Guermantes, and often came across, as in the old toll-house in the Champs-Elysées, a chilly smell that would remind me of Combray. But in this ideal existence which I dared not confide to him the pleasures of the mind found no place

    “No, sir, the pleasures of the mind count for very little with me; it is not them that I seek after; indeed I don’t even know that I have ever tasted them.”

    “You really think not?” he replied. “Well, it may be, no, wait a minute now, yes, after all that must be what you like best, I can see it now clearly, I am certain of it.”

    As certainly, he did not succeed in convincing me; and yet I was already feeling happier, less restricted. After what M. de Norpois had said to me, I had regarded my moments of dreaming, of enthusiasm, of self-confidence as purely subjective and barren of truth. But according to Bergotte, who appeared to understand my case, it seemed that it was quite the contrary, that the symptom I ought to disregard was, in fact, my doubts, my disgust with myself. Moreover, what he had said about M. de Norpois took most of the sting out of a sentence from which I had supposed that no appeal was possible

    “Are you being properly looked after?” Bergotte asked me. “Who is treating you?” I told him that I had seen, and should probably go on seeing, Cottard. “But that’s not at all the sort of man you want!” he told me. “I know nothing about him as a doctor. But I’ve met him at Mme. Swann’s. The man’s an imbecile. Even supposing that that doesn’t prevent his being a good doctor, which I hesitate to believe, it does prevent his being a good doctor for artists, for men of intelligence. People like you must have suitable doctors, I would almost go so far as to say treatment and medicines specially adapted to themselves. Cottard will bore you, and that alone will prevent his treatment from having any effect. Besides, the proper course of treatment cannot possibly be the same for you as for any Tom, Dick or Harry. Nine tenths of the ills from which intelligent people suffer spring from their intellect. They need at least a doctor who understands their disease. How do you expect that Cottard should be able to treat you, he has made allowances for the difficulty of digesting sauces, for gastric trouble, but he has made no allowance for the effect of reading Shakespeare. So that his calculations are inaccurate in your case, the balance is upset; you see, always the little bottle-imp bobbing up again. He will find that you have a dilated stomach; he has no need to examine you for it, since he has it already in his eye. You can see it there, reflected in his glasses.” This manner of speaking tired me greatly; I said to myself, with the stupidity of common sense: “There is no more any dilated stomach reflected in Professor Cottard’s glasses than there are inanities stored behind the white waistcoat of M. de Norpois.” “I should recommend you, instead,” went on Bergotte, “to consult Dr. du Boulbon, who is quite an intelligent man.” “He is a great admirer of your books,” I replied. I saw that Bergotte knew this, and I decided that kindred spirits soon come together, that one has few really ‘unknown friends.’ What Bergotte had said to me with respect to Cottard impressed me, while running contrary to everything that I myself believed. I was in no way disturbed by finding my doctor a bore; I expected of him that, thanks to an art the laws of which were beyond me, he should pronounce on the subject of my health an infallible oracle, after consultation of my entrails. And I did not at all require that, with the aid of an intellect, in which I easily outstripped him, he should seek to understand my intellect, which I pictured to myself merely as a means, of no importance in itself, of trying to attain to certain external verities. I doubted greatly whether intellectual people required a different form of hygiene from imbeciles, and I was quite prepared to submit myself to the latter kind. “I’ll tell you who does need a good doctor, and that is our friend Swann,” said Bergotte. And on my asking whether he was ill, “Well, don’t you see, he’s typical of the man who has married a whore, and has to swallow a hundred serpents every day, from women who refuse to meet his wife, or men who were there before him. You can see them in his mouth, writhing. Just look, any day you’re there, at the way he lifts his eyebrows when he comes in, to see who’s in the room.” The malice with which Bergotte spoke thus to a stranger of the friends in whose house he had so long been received as a welcome guest was as new to me as the almost amorous tone which, in that house, he had constantly been adopting to speak to them. Certainly a person like my great-aunt, for instance, would have been incapable of treating any of us with that politeness which I had heard Bergotte lavishing upon Swann. Even to the people whom she liked, she enjoyed saying disagreeable things. But behind their backs she would never have uttered a word to which they might not have listened. There was nothing less like the social ‘world’ than our society at Combray. The Swanns’ house marked a stage on the way towards it, towards its inconstant tide. If they had not yet reached the open sea, they were certainly in the lagoon. “This is all between ourselves,” said Bergotte as he left me outside my own door. A few years later I should have answered: “I never repeat things.” That is the ritual phrase of society, from which the slanderer always derives a false reassurance. It is what I should have said then and there to Bergotte, for one does not invent all one’s speeches, especially when one is acting merely as a card in the social pack. But I did not yet know the formula. What my great-aunt, on the other hand, would have said on a similar occasion was: “If you don’t wish it to be repeated, why do you say it?” That is the answer of the unsociable, of the quarrelsome. I was nothing of that sort: I bowed my head in silence

    Men of letters who were in my eyes persons of considerable importance had had to plot for years before they succeeded in forming with Bergotte relations which continued to the end to be but dimly literary, and never emerged beyond the four walls of his study, whereas I, I had now been installed among the friends of the great writer, at the first attempt and without any effort, like a man who, instead of standing outside in a crowd for hours in order to secure a bad seat in a theatre, is shewn in at once to the best, having entered by a door that is closed to the public. If Swann had thus opened such a door to me, it was doubtless because, just as a king finds himself naturally inviting his children’s friends into the royal box, or on board the royal yacht, so Gilberte’s parents received their daughter’s friends among all the precious things that they had in their house, and the even more precious intimacies that were enshrined there. But at that time I thought, and perhaps was right in thinking, that this friendliness on Swann’s part was aimed indirectly at my parents. I seemed to remember having heard once at Combray that he had suggested to them that, in view of my admiration for Bergotte, he should take me to dine with him, and that my parents had declined, saying that I was too young, and too easily excited to ‘go out’ yet. My parents, no doubt, represented to certain other people (precisely those who seemed to me the most marvellous) something quite different from what they were to me, so that, just as when the lady in pink had paid my father a tribute of which he had shewn himself so unworthy, I should have wished them to understand what an inestimable present I had just received, and to testify their gratitude to that generous and courteous Swann who had offered it to me, or to them rather, without seeming any more to be conscious of its value than is, in Luini’s fresco, the charming Mage with the arched nose and fair hair, to whom, it appeared, Swann had at one time been thought to bear a striking resemblance

    Unfortunately, this favour that Swann had done me, which, as I entered the house, before I had even taken off my greatcoat, I reported to my parents, in the hope that it would awaken in their hearts an emotion equal to my own, and would determine them upon some immense and decisive act of politeness towards the Swanns, did not appear to be greatly appreciated by them. “Swann introduced you to Bergotte? An excellent friend for you, charming society!” cried my father, ironically. “It only wanted that!” Alas, when I had gone on to say that Bergotte was by no means inclined to admire M. de Norpois:

    “I dare say!” retorted my father. “That simply proves that he’s a foolish and evil-minded fellow. My poor boy, you never had much common sense, still, I’m sorry to see you fall among a set that will finish you off altogether.”

    Already the mere fact of my frequenting the Swanns had been far from delighting my parents. This introduction to Bergotte seemed to them a fatal but natural consequence of an original mistake, namely their own weakness in controlling me, which my grandfather would have called a ‘want of circumspection.’ I felt that I had only, in order to complete their ill humour, to tell them that this perverse fellow who did not appreciate M. de Norpois had found me extremely intelligent. For I had observed that whenever my father decided that anyone, one of my school friends for instance, was going astray — as I was at that moment — if that person had the approval of somebody whom my father did not rate high, he would see in this testimony the confirmation of his own stern judgment. The evil merely seemed to him more pronounced. I could hear him already exclaiming, “Of course, it all hangs together,” an expression that terrified me by the vagueness and vastness of the reforms the introduction of which into my quiet life it seemed to threaten. But since, were I not to tell them what Bergotte had said of me, even then nothing could efface the impression my parents had formed, that this should be made slightly worse mattered little. Besides, they seemed to me so unfair, so completely mistaken, that not only had I not any hope, I had scarcely any desire to bring them to a more equitable point of view. At the same time, feeling, as the words came from my lips, how alarmed they would be by the thought that I had found favour in the sight of a person who dismissed clever men as fools and had earned the contempt of all decent people, praise from whom, since it seemed to me a thing to be desired, would only encourage me in wrongdoing, it was in faltering tones and with a slightly shamefaced air that, coming to the end of my story, I flung them the bouquet of: “He told the Swanns that he had found me extremely intelligent.” Just as a poisoned dog, in a field, rushes, without knowing why, straight to the grass which is the precise antidote to the toxin that he has swallowed, so I, without in the least suspecting it, had said the one thing in the world that was capable of overcoming in my parents this prejudice with respect to Bergotte, a prejudice which all the best reasons that I could have urged, all the tributes that I could have paid him, must have proved powerless to defeat. Instantly the situation changed

    “Oh! He said that he found you intelligent,” repeated my mother. “I am glad to hear that, because he is a man of talent.”

    “What! He said that, did he?” my father joined in. “I don’t for a moment deny his literary distinction, before which the whole world bows; only it is a pity that he should lead that scarcely reputable existence to which old Norpois made a guarded allusion, when he was here,” he went on, not seeing that against the sovran virtue of the magic words which I had just repeated the depravity of Bergotte’s morals was little more able to contend than the falsity of his judgment

    But, my dear,” Mamma interrupted, “we’ve no proof that it’s true. People say all sorts of things. Besides M. de Norpois may have the most perfect manners in the world, but he’s not always very good-natured, especially about people who are not exactly his sort.”

    “That’s quite true; I’ve noticed it myself,” my father admitted

    “And then, too, a great deal ought to be forgiven Bergotte, since he thinks well of my little son,” Mamma went on, stroking my hair with her fingers and fastening upon me a long and pensive gaze

    My mother had not, indeed, awaited this verdict from Bergotte before telling me that I might ask Gilberte to tea whenever I had friends coming. But I dared not do so for two reasons. The first was that at Gilberte’s there was never anything else to drink but tea. Whereas at home Mamma insisted on there being a pot of chocolate as well. I was afraid that Gilberte might regard this as ‘common’; and so conceive a great contempt for us. The other reason was a formal difficulty, a question of procedure which I could never succeed in settling. When I arrived at Mme. Swann’s she used to ask me: “And how is your mother?” I had made several overtures to Mamma to find out whether she would do the same when Gilberte came to us, a point which seemed to me more serious than, at the Court of Louis XIV, the use of ‘Monseigneur.’ But Mamma would not hear of it for a moment

    “Certainly not. I do not know Mme. Swann.”

    “But neither does she know you.”

    “I never said she did, but we are not obliged to behave in exactly the same way about everything. I shall find other ways of being civil to Gilberte than Mme. Swann has with you.”

    But I was unconvinced, and preferred not to invite Gilberte

    Leaving my parents, I went upstairs to change my clothes and on emptying my pockets came suddenly upon the envelope which the Swanns’ butler had handed me before shewing me into the drawing-room. I was now alone. I opened it; inside was a card on which I was told the name of the lady whom I ought to have ‘taken in’ to luncheon

    It was about this period that Bloch overthrew my conception of the world and opened for me fresh possibilities of happiness (which, for that matter, were to change later on into possibilities of suffering), by assuring me that, in contradiction of all that I had believed at the time of my walks along the Méséglise way, women never asked for anything better than to make love. He added to this service a second, the value of which I was not to appreciate until much later; it was he who took me for the first time into a disorderly house. He had indeed told me that there were any number of pretty women whom one might enjoy. But I could see them only in a vague outline for which those houses were to enable me to substitute actual human features. So that if I owed to Bloch — for his ‘good tidings’ that beauty and the enjoyment of beauty were not inaccessible things, and that we have acted foolishly in renouncing them for all time — a debt of gratitude of the same kind that we owe to an optimistic physician or philosopher who has given us reason to hope for length of days in this world and not to be entirely cut off from it when we shall have passed beyond the veil, the houses of assignation which I began to frequent some years later — by furnishing me with specimens of beauty, by allowing me to add to the beauty of women that element which we are powerless to invent, which is something more than a mere summary of former beauties, that present indeed divine, the one present that we cannot bestow upon ourselves, before which faint and fail all the logical creations of our intellect, and which we can seek from reality alone: an individual charm — deserved to be ranked by me with those other benefactors more recent in origin but of comparable utility (before finding which we used to imagine without any warmth the seductive charms of Mantegna, of Wagner, of Siena, by studying other painters, hearing other composers, visiting other cities): namely illustrated editions of the history of painting, symphonic concerts and handbooks to ‘Mediaeval Towns.’ But the house to which Bloch led me (and which he himself, for that matter, had long ceased to visit), was of too humble a grade, its denizens were too inconspicuous and too little varied to be able to satisfy my old or to stimulate new curiosities. The mistress of this house knew none of the women with whom one asked her to negotiate, and was always suggesting others whom one did not want. She boasted to me of one in particular, one of whom, with a smile full of promise (as though this had been a great rarity and a special treat) she would whisper: “She is a Jewess! Doesn’t that make you want to?” (That, by the way, was probably why the girl’s name was Rachel.) And with a silly and affected excitement which, she hoped, would prove contagious, and which ended in a hoarse gurgle, almost of sensual satisfaction: “Think of that, my boy, a Jewess! Wouldn’t that be lovely? Rrrr!” This Rachel, of whom I caught a glimpse without her seeing me, was dark and not good looking, but had an air of intelligence, and would pass the tip of her tongue over her lips as she smiled, with a look of boundless impertinence, at the ‘boys’ who were introduced to her and whom I could hear making conversation. Her small and narrow face was framed in short curls of black hair, irregular as though they were outlined in pen-strokes upon a wash-drawing in Indian ink. Every evening I promised the old woman who offered her to me with a special insistence, boasting of her superior intelligence and her education, that I would not fail to come some day on purpose to make the acquaintance of Rachel, whom I had nicknamed “Rachel when from the Lord.” But the first evening I had heard her, as she was leaving the house, say to the mistress: “That’s settled then; I shall be free to-morrow, if you have anyone you won’t forget to send for me.”

    And these words had prevented me from recognising her as a person because they had made me classify her at once in a general category of women whose habit, common to all of them, was to come there in the evening to see whether there might not be a louis or two to be earned. She would simply vary her formula, saying indifferently: “If you want me” or “If you want anybody.”

    The mistress, who was not familiar with Halévy’s opera, did not know why I always called the girl “Rachel when from the Lord.” But failure to understand a joke has never yet made anyone find it less amusing, and it was always with a whole-hearted laugh that she would say to me:

    “Then there’s nothing doing to-night? When am I going to fix you up with ‘Rachel when from the Lord’? Why do you always say that, ‘Rachel when from the Lord’? Oh, that’s very smart, that is. I’m going to make a match of you two. You won’t be sorry for it, you’ll see.”

    Once I was just making up my mind, but she was ‘in the press,’ another time in the hands of the hairdresser, an elderly gentleman who never did anything for the women except pour oil on their loosened hair and then comb it. And I grew tired of waiting, even though several of the humbler frequenters of the place (working girls, they called themselves, but they always seemed to be out of work), had come to mix drinks for me and to hold long conversations to which, despite the gravity of the subjects discussed, the partial or total nudity of the speakers gave an attractive simplicity. I ceased moreover to go to this house because, anxious to present a token of my good-will to the woman who kept it and was in need of furniture, I had given her several pieces, notably a big sofa, which I had inherited from my aunt Léonie. I used never to see them, for want of space had prevented my parents from taking them in at home, and they were stored in a warehouse. But as soon as I discovered them again in the house where these women were putting them to their own uses, all the virtues that one had imbibed in the air of my aunt’s room at Combray became apparent to me, tortured by the cruel contact to which I had abandoned them in their helplessness! Had I outraged the dead, I should not have suffered such remorse. I returned no more to visit their new mistress, for they seemed to me to be alive, and to be appealing to me, like those objects, apparently inanimate, in a Persian fairy-tale, in which are embodied human souls that are undergoing martyrdom and plead for deliverance. Besides, as our memory presents things to us, as a rule, not in their chronological sequence but as it were by a reflexion in which the order of the parts is reversed, I remembered only long afterwards that it was upon that same sofa that, many years before, I had tasted for the first time the sweets of love with one of my girl cousins, with whom I had not known where to go until she somewhat rashly suggested our taking advantage of a moment in which aunt Léonie had left her room

    A whole lot more of my aunt Léonie’s things, and notably a magnificent set of old silver plate, I sold, in spite of my parents’ warnings, so as to have more money to spend, and to be able to send more flowers to Mme. Swann who would greet me, after receiving an immense basket of orchids, with: “If I were your father, I should have you up before the magistrate for this.” How was I to suppose that one day I might regret more than anything the loss of my silver plate, and rank certain other pleasures more highly than that (which would have shrunk perhaps into none at all) of bestowing favours upon Gilberte’s parents. Similarly, it was with Gilberte in my mind, and so as not to be separated from her, that I had decided not to enter a career of diplomacy abroad. It is always thus, impelled by a state of mind which is destined not to last, that we make our irrevocable decisions. I could scarcely imagine that that strange substance which was housed in Gilberte, and from her permeated her parents and her home, leaving me indifferent to all things else, could be liberated from her, could migrate into another person. The same substance, unquestionable, and yet one that would have a wholly different effect on me. For a single malady goes through various evolutions, and a delicious poison can no longer be taken with the same impunity when, with the passing of the years, the heart’s power of resistance has diminished

    My parents meanwhile would have liked to see the intelligence that Bergotte had discerned in me made manifest in some remarkable achievement. When I still did not know the Swanns I thought that I was prevented from working by the state of agitation into which I was thrown by the impossibility of seeing Gilberte when I chose. But, now that their door stood open to me, scarcely had I sat down at my desk than I would rise and run to them. And after I had left them and was at home again, my isolation was only apparent, my mind was powerless to swim against the stream of words on which I had allowed myself mechanically to be borne for hours on end. Sitting alone, I continued to fashion remarks such as might have pleased or amused the Swanns, and to make this pastime more entertaining I myself took the parts of those absent players, I put to myself imagined questions, so chosen that my brilliant epigrams served merely as happy answers to them. Though conducted in silence, this exercise was none the less a conversation and not a meditation, my solitude a mental society in which it was not I myself but other imaginary speakers who controlled my choice of words, and in which I felt as I formulated, in place of the thoughts that I believed to be true, those that came easily to my mind, and involved no introspection from without, that kind of pleasure, entirely passive, which sitting still affords to anyone who is burdened with a sluggish digestion

    Had I been less firmly resolved upon setting myself definitely to work, I should perhaps have made an effort to begin at once. But since my resolution was explicit, since within twenty-four hours, in the empty frame of that long morrow in which everything was so well arranged because I myself had not yet entered it, my good intentions would be realised without difficulty, it was better not to select an evening on which I was ill-disposed for a beginning for which the following days were not, alas, to shew themselves any more propitious. But I was reasonable. It would have been puerile, on the part of one who had waited now for years, not to put up with a postponement of two or three days. Confident that by the day after next I should have written several pages, I said not a word more to my parents of my decision; I preferred to remain patient for a few hours and then to bring to a convinced and comforted grandmother a sample of work that was already under way. Unfortunately the morrow was not that vast, external day to which I in my fever had looked forward. When it drew to a close, my laziness and my painful struggle to overcome certain internal obstacles had simply lasted twenty-four hours longer. And at the end of several days, my plans not having matured, I had no longer the same hope that they would be realised at once, no longer the courage, therefore, to subordinate everything else to their realisation: I began again to keep late hours, having no longer, to oblige me to go to bed early on any evening, the certain hope of seeing my work begun next morning. I needed, before I could recover my creative energy, several days of relaxation, and the only time that my grandmother ventured, in a gentle and disillusioned tone, to frame the reproach: “Well, and that work of yours; aren’t we even to speak of it now?” I resented her intrusion, convinced that in her inability to see that my mind was irrevocably made up, she had further and perhaps for a long time postponed the execution of my task, by the shock which her denial of justice to me had given my nerves, since until I had recovered from that shock I should not feel inclined to begin my work. She felt that her scepticism had charged blindly into my intention. She apologised, kissing me: “I am sorry; I shall not say anything again,” and, so that I should not be discouraged, assured me that, from the day on which I should be quite well again, the work would come of its own accord from my superfluity of strength

    Besides, I said to myself, in spending all my time with the Swanns, am I not doing exactly what Bergotte does? To my parents it seemed almost as though, idle as I was, I was leading, since it was spent in the same drawing-room with a great writer, the life most favourable to the growth of talent. And yet the assumption that anyone can be dispensed from having to create that talent for himself, from within himself, and can acquire it from some one else, is as impossible as it would be to suppose that a man can keep himself in good health, in spite of neglecting all the rules of hygiene and of indulging in the worst excesses, merely by dining out often in the company of a physician. The person, by the way, who was most completely taken in by this illusion, which misled me as well as my parents, was Mme. Swann. When I explained to her that I was unable to come, that I must stay at home and work, she looked as though she were thinking that I made a great fuss about nothing, that there was something foolish as well as ostentatious in what I had said

    “But Bergotte is coming, isn’t he? Do you mean that you don’t think it good, what he writes? It will be better still, very soon,” she went on, “for he is more pointed, he concentrates more in newspaper articles than in his books, where he is apt to spread out too much. I’ve arranged that in future he’s to do the leading articles in the Figaro. He’ll be distinctly the ‘right man in the right place’ there.” And, finally, “Come! He will tell you, better than anyone, what you ought to do.”

    And so, just as one invites a gentleman ranker to meet his colonel, it was in the interests of my career, and as though masterpieces of literature arose out of ‘getting to know” people, that she told me not to fail to come to dinner with her next day, to meet Bergotte

    And so there was not from the Swanns any more than from my parents, that is to say from those who, at different times, had seemed bound to place obstacles in my way, any further opposition to that pleasant existence in which I might see Gilberte as often as I chose, with enjoyment if not with peace of mind. There can be no peace of mind in love, since the advantage one has secured is never anything but a fresh starting-point for further desires. So long as I had not been free to go to her, having my eyes fixed upon that inaccessible goal of happiness, I could not so much as imagine the fresh grounds for anxiety that lay in wait for me there. Once the resistance of her parents was broken, and the problem solved at last, it began to set itself anew, and always in different terms. Each evening, on arriving home, I reminded myself that I had things to say to Gilberte of prime importance, things upon which our whole friendship hung, and these things were never the same. But at least I was happy, and no further menace arose to threaten my happiness. One was to appear, alas, from a quarter in which I had never detected any peril, namely from Gilberte and myself. And yet I ought to have been tormented by what, on the contrary, reassured me, by what I mistook for happiness. We are, when we love, in an abnormal state, capable of giving at once to an accident, the most simple to all appearance and one that may at any moment occur, a serious-aspect which that accident by itself would not bear. What makes us so happy is the presence in our heart of an unstable element which we are perpetually arranging to keep in position, and of which we cease almost to be aware so long as it is not displaced. Actually, there is in love a permanent strain of suffering which happiness neutralises, makes conditional only, procrastinates, but which may at any moment become what it would long since have been had we not obtained what we were seeking, sheer agony

    On several occasions I felt that Gilberte was anxious to put off my visits. It is true that when I was at all anxious to see her I had only to get myself invited by her parents who were increasingly persuaded of my excellent influence over her. “Thanks to them,” I used to think, “my love is running no risk; the moment I have them on my side, I can set my mind at rest; they have full authority over Gilberte.” Until, alas, I detected certain signs of impatience which she allowed to escape her when her father made me come to the house, almost against her will, and asked myself whether what I had regarded as a protection for my happiness was not in fact the secret reason why that happiness could not endure

    The last time that I called to see Gilberte, it was raining; she had been asked to a dancing lesson in the house of some people whom she knew too slightly to be able to take me there with her. In view of the dampness of the air I had taken rather more caffeine than usual. Perhaps on account of the weather, or because she had some objection to the house in which this party was being given, Mme. Swann, as her daughter was leaving the room, called her back in the sharpest of tones: “Gilberte!” and pointed to me, to indicate that I had come there to see her and that she ought to stay with me. This ‘Gilberte!’ had been uttered, or shouted rather, with the best of intentions towards myself, but from the way in which Gilberte shrugged her shoulders as she took off her outdoor clothes I divined that her mother had unwittingly hastened the gradual evolution, which until then it had perhaps been possible to arrest, which was gradually drawing away from me my friend. “You don’t need to go out dancing every day,” Odette told her daughter, with a sagacity acquired, no doubt, in earlier days, from Swann. Then, becoming once more Odette, she began speaking to her daughter in English. At once it was as though a wall had sprung up to hide from me a part of the life of Gilberte, as though an evil genius had spirited my friend far away. In a language that we know, we have substituted for the opacity of sounds, the perspicuity of ideas. But a language which we do not know is a fortress sealed, within whose walls she whom we love is free to play us false, while we, standing without, desperately alert in our impotence, can see, can prevent nothing. So this conversation in English, at which, a month earlier, I should merely have smiled, interspersed with a few proper names in French which did not fail to accentuate, to give a point to my uneasiness, had, when conducted within a few feet of me by two motionless persons, the same degree of cruelty, left me as much abandoned and alone as the forcible abduction of my companion. At length Mme. Swann left us. That day, perhaps from resentment against myself, the unwilling cause of her not going out to enjoy herself, perhaps also because, guessing her to be angry with me, I was precautionally colder than usual with her, the face of Gilberte, divested of every sign of joy, bleak, bare, pillaged, seemed all afternoon to be devoting a melancholy regret to the pas-de-quatre in which my arrival had prevented her from going to take part, and to be defying every living creature, beginning with myself, to understand the subtle reasons that had determined in her a sentimental attachment to the boston. She confined herself to exchanging with me, now and again, on the weather, the increasing violence of the rain, the fastness of the clock, a conversation punctuated with silences and monosyllables, in which I lashed myself on, with a sort of desperate rage, to the destruction of those moments which we might have devoted to friendship and happiness. And on each of our remarks was stamped, as it were, a supreme harshness, by the paroxysm of their stupefying unimportance, which at the same time consoled me, for it prevented Gilberte from being taken in by the banality of my observations and the indifference of my tone. In vain was my polite: “I thought, the other day, that the clock was slow, if anything”; she evidently understood me to mean: “How tiresome you are being!” Obstinately as I might protract, over the whole length of that rain-sodden afternoon, the dull cloud of words through which no fitful ray shone, I knew that my coldness was not so unalterably fixed as I pretended, and that Gilberte must be fully aware that if, after already saying it to her three times, I had hazarded a fourth repetition of the statement that the evenings were drawing in, I should have had difficulty in restraining myself from bursting into tears. When she was like that, when no smile filled her eyes or unveiled her face, I cannot describe the devastating monotony that stamped her melancholy eyes and sullen features. Her face, grown almost livid, reminded me then of those dreary beaches where the sea, ebbing far out, wearies one with its faint shimmering, everywhere the same, fixed in an immutable and low horizon. At length, as I saw no sign in Gilberte of the happy change for which I had been waiting now for some hours, I told her that she was not being nice. “It is you that are not being nice,” was her answer. “Oh, but surely ——!” I asked myself what I could have done, and, finding no answer, put the question to her. “Naturally, you think yourself nice!” she said to me with a laugh, and went on laughing. Whereupon I felt all the anguish that there was for me in not being able to attain to that other, less perceptible, plane of her mind which her laughter indicated. It seemed, that laughter, to mean: “No, no, I’m not going to let myself be moved by anything that you say, I know you’re madly in love with me, but that leaves me neither hot nor cold, for I don’t care a rap for you.” But I told myself that, after all, laughter was not a language so well defined that I could be certain of understanding what this laugh really meant. And Gilberte’s words were affectionate. “But how am I not being nice?” I asked her. “Tell me; I will do anything you want.” “No; that wouldn’t be any good. I can’t explain.” For a moment I was afraid that she thought that I did not love her, and this was for me a fresh agony, no less keen, but one that required treatment by a different conversational method. “If you knew how much you were hurting me you would tell me.” But this pain which, had she doubted my love for her, must have rejoiced her, seemed instead to make her more angry. Then, realising my mistake, making up my mind to pay no more attention to what she said, letting her (without bothering to believe her) assure me: “I do love you, indeed I do; you will see one day,” (that day on which the guilty are convinced that their innocence will be made clear, and which, for some mysterious reason, never happens to be the day on which their evidence is taken), I had the courage to make a sudden resolution not to see her again, and without telling her of it yet since she would not have believed me

    Grief that is caused one by a person with whom one is in love can be bitter, even when it is interpolated among preoccupations, occupations, pleasures in which that person is not directly involved and from which our attention is diverted only now and again to return to it. But when such a grief has its birth — as was now happening — at a moment when the happiness of seeing that person fills us to the exclusion of all else, the sharp depression that then affects our spirits, sunny hitherto, sustained and calm, lets loose in us a raging tempest against which we know not whether we are capable of struggling to the end. The tempest that was blowing in my heart was so violent that I made my way home baffled, battered, feeling that I could recover my breath only by retracing my steps, by returning, upon whatever pretext, into Gilberte’s presence. But she would have said to herself: “Back again! Evidently I can go to any length with him; he will come back every time, and the more wretched he is when he leaves me the more docile he’ll be.” Besides, I was irresistibly drawn towards her in thought, and those alternative orientations, that mad careering between them of the compass-needle within me, persisted after I had reached home, and expressed themselves in the mutually contradictory letters to Gilberte which I began to draft

    I was about to pass through one of those difficult crises which we generally find that we have to face at various stages in life, and which, for all that there has been no change in our character, in our nature (that nature which itself creates our loves, and almost creates the women whom we love, even to their faults), we do not face in the same way on each occasion, that is to say at every age. At such moments our life is divided, and so to speak distributed over a pair of scales, in two counterpoised pans which between them contain it all. In one there is our desire not to displease, not to appear too humble to the creature whom we love without managing to understand her, but whom we find it more convenient at times to appear almost to disregard, so that she shall not have that sense of her own indis-pensability which may turn her from us; in the other scale there is a feeling of pain — and one that is not localised and partial only — which cannot be set at rest unless, abandoning every thought of pleasing the woman and of making her believe that we can dispense with her, we go at once to find her. When we withdraw from the pan in which our pride lies a small quantity of the will-power which we have weakly allowed to exhaust itself with increasing age, when we add to the pan that holds our suffering a physical pain which we have acquired and have let grow, then, instead of the courageous solution that would have carried the day at one-and-twenty, it is the other, grown too heavy and insufficiently balanced, that crushes us down at fifty. All the more because situations, while repeating them-.selves, tend to alter, and there is every likelihood that, in middle life or in old age, we shall have had the grim satisfaction of complicating our love by an intrusion of habit which adolescence, repressed by other demands upon it, less master of itself, has never known

    I had just written Gilberte a letter in which I allowed the tempest of my wrath to thunder, not however without throwing her the lifebuoy of a few words disposed as though by accident on the page, by clinging to which my friend might be brought to a reconciliation; a moment later, the wind having changed, they were phrases full of love that I addressed to her, chosen for the sweetness of certain forlorn expressions, those ‘nevermores’ so touching to those who pen them, so wearisome to her who will have to read them, whether she believe them to be false and translate ‘nevermore’ by ‘this very evening, if you want me,’ or believe them to be true and so to be breaking the news to her of one of those final separations which make so little difference to our lives when the other person is one with whom we are not in love. But since we are incapable, while we are in love, of acting as fit predecessors of the next persons whom we shall presently have become, and who will then be in love no longer, how are we to imagine the actual state of mind of a woman whom, even when we are conscious that we are of no account to her, we have perpetually represented in our musings as uttering, so as to lull us into a happy dream or to console us for a great sorrow, the same speeches that she would make if she loved us. When we come to examine the thoughts, the actions of a woman whom we love, we are as completely at a loss as must have been, face to face with the phenomena of nature, the world’s first natural philosophers, before their science had been elaborated and had cast a ray of light over the unknown. Or, worse still, we are like a person in whose mind the law of causality barely exists, a person who would be incapable, therefore, of establishing any connexion between one phenomenon and another, to whose eyes the spectacle of the world would appear unstable as a dream. Of course I made efforts to emerge from this incoherence, to find reasons for things. I tried even to be ‘objective’ and, to that end, to bear well in mind the disproportion that existed between the importance which Gilberte had in my eyes and that, not only which I had in hers, but which she herself had in the eyes of other people, a disproportion which, had I failed to remark it, would have involved my mistaking mere friendliness on my friend’s part for a passionate avowal, and a grotesque and debasing display on my own for the simple and graceful movement with which we are attracted towards a pretty face. But I was afraid also of falling into the contrary error, in which I should have seen in Gilberte’s unpunctuality in keeping an appointment an irremediable hostility. I tried to discover between these two perspectives, equally distorting, a third which would enable me to see things as they really were; the calculations I was obliged to make with that object helped to take my mind off my sufferings; and whether in obedience to the laws of arithmetic or because I had made them give me the answer that I desired, I made up my mind that next day I would go to the Swanns’, happy, but happy in the same way as people who, having long been tormented by the thought of a journey which they have not wished to make, go no farther than to the station and return home to unpack their boxes. And since, while one is hesitating, the bare idea of a possible resolution (unless one has rendered that idea sterile by deciding that one will make no resolution) develops, like a seed in the ground, the lineaments, every detail of the emotions that will be born from the performance of the action, I told myself that it had been quite absurd of me to be as much hurt by the suggestion that I should not see Gilberte again as if I had really been about to put that suggestion into practice, and that since, on the contrary, I was to end by returning to her side, I might have saved myself the expense of all those vain longings and painful acceptances. But this resumption of friendly relations lasted only so long as it took me to reach the Swanns’; not because their butler, who was really fond of me, told me that Gilberte had gone out (a statement the truth of which was confirmed, as it happened, the same evening, by people who had seen her somewhere), but because of the manner in which he said it. “Sir, the young lady is not at home; I can assure you, sir, that I am speaking the truth. If you wish to make any inquiries I can fetch the young lady’s maid. You know very well, sir, that I would do everything in my power to oblige you, and that if the young lady was at home I would take you to her at once.” These words being of the only kind that is really important, that is to say spontaneous, the kind that gives us a radiograph shewing the main points, at any rate, of the unimaginable reality which would be wholly concealed beneath a prepared speech, proved that in Gilberte’s household there was an impression that I bothered her with my visits; and so, scarcely had the man uttered them before they had aroused in me a hatred of which I preferred to make him rather than Gilberte the victim; he drew upon his own head all the angry feelings that I might have had for my friend; freed from these complications, thanks to his words, my love subsisted alone; but his words had, at the same time, shewn me that I must cease for the present to attempt to see Gilberte. She would be certain to write to me, to apologise. In spite of which, I should not return at once to see her, so as to prove to her that I was capable of living without her. Besides, once I had received her letter, Gilberte’s society was a thing with which I should be more easily able to dispense for a time, since I should be certain of finding her ready to receive me whenever I chose. All that I needed in order to support with less pain the burden of a voluntary separation was to feel that my heart was rid of the terrible uncertainty whether we were not irreconcilably sundered, whether she had not promised herself to another, left Paris, been taken away by force. The days that followed resembled the first week of that old New Year which I had had to spend alone, without Gilberte. But when that week had dragged to its end, then for one thing my friend would be coming again to the Champs-Elysées, I should be seeing her as before; I had been sure of that; for another thing, I had known with no less certainty that so long as the New Year holidays lasted it would not be worth my while to go to the Champs-Elysées, which meant that during that miserable week, which was already ancient history, I had endured my wretchedness with a quiet mind because there was blended in it neither fear nor hope. Now, on the other hand, it was the latter of these which, almost as much as my fear of what might happen, rendered intolerable the burden of my grief. Not having had any letter from Gilberte that evening, I had attributed this to her carelessness, to her other occupations, I did not doubt that I should find something from her in the morning’s post. This I awaited, every day, with a beating heart which subsided, leaving me utterly prostrate, when I had found in it only letters from people who were not Gilberte, or else nothing at all, which was no worse, the proofs of another’s friendship making all the more cruel those of her indifference. I transferred my hopes to the afternoon post. Even between the times at which letters were delivered I dared not leave the house, for she might be sending hers by a messenger. Then, the time coming at last when neither the postman nor a footman from the Swanns’ could possibly appear that night, I must procrastinate my hope of being set at rest, and thus, because I believed that my sufferings were not destined to last, I was obliged, so to speak, incessantly to renew them. My disappointment was perhaps the same, but instead of just uniformly prolonging, as in the old days, an initial emotion, it began again several times daily, starting each time with an emotion so frequently renewed that it ended — it, so purely physical, so instantaneous a state — by becoming stabilised, so consistently that the strain of waiting having hardly time to relax before a fresh reason for waiting supervened, there was no longer a single minute in the day in which I was not in that state of anxiety which it is so difficult to bear even for an hour. So my punishment was infinitely more cruel than in those New Year holidays long ago, because this time there was in me, instead of the acceptance, pure and simple, of that punishment, the hope, at every moment, of seeing it come to an end. And yet at this state of acceptance I ultimately arrived; then I understood that it must be final, and I renounced Gilberte for ever, in the interests of my love itself and because I hoped above all that she would not retain any contemptuous memory of me. Indeed, from that moment, so that she should not be led to suppose any sort of lover’s spite on my part, when she made appointments for me to see her I used often to accept them and then, at the last moment, write to her that I was prevented from coming, but with the same protestations of my disappointment that I should have made to anyone whom I had not wished to see. These expressions of regret, which we keep as a rule for people who do not matter, would do more, I imagined, to persuade Gilberte of my indifference than would the tone of indifference which we affect only to those whom we love. When, better than by mere words, by a course of action indefinitely repeated, I should have proved to her that I had no appetite for seeing her, perhaps she would discover once again an appetite for seeing me. Alas! I was doomed to failure; to attempt, by ceasing to see her, to reawaken in her that inclination to see me was to lose her for ever; first of all, because, when it began to revive, if I wished it to last I must not give way to it at once; besides, the most agonising hours would then have passed; it was at this very moment that she was indispensable to me, and I should have liked to be able to warn her that what presently she would have to assuage, by the act of seeing me again, would be a grief so far diminished as to be no longer (what a moment ago it would still have been), nor the thought of putting an end to it, a motive towards surrender, reconciliation, further meetings. And then again, later on, when I should at last be able safely to confess to Gilberte (so far would her liking for me have regained its strength) my liking for her, the latter, not having been able to resist the strain of so long a separation, would have ceased to exist; Gilberte would have become immaterial to me. I knew this, but I could not explain it to her; she would have assumed that if I was pretending that I should cease to love her if I remained for too long without seeing her, that was solely in order that she might summon me back to her at once. In the meantime, what made it easier for me to sentence myself to this separation was the fact that (in order to make it quite clear to her that despite my protestations to the contrary it was my own free will and not any conflicting engagement, not the state of my health that prevented me from seeing her), whenever I knew beforehand that Gilberte would not be in the house, was going out somewhere with a friend and would not be home for dinner, I went to see Mme. Swann who had once more become to me what she had been at the time when I had such difficulty in seeing her daughter and (on days when the latter was not coming to the Champs-Elysées) used to repair to the Allée des Acacias. In this way I should be hearing about Gilberte, and could be certain that she would in due course hear about me, and in terms which would shew her that I was not interested in her. And I found, as all those who suffer find, that my melancholy condition might have been worse. For being free at any time to enter the habitation in which Gilberte dwelt, I constantly reminded myself, for all that I was firmly resolved to make no use of that privilege, that if ever my pain grew too sharp there was a way of making it cease. I was not unhappy, save only from day to day. And even that is an exaggeration. How many times in an hour (but now without that anxious expectancy which had strained every nerve of me in the first weeks after our quarrel, before I had gone again to the Swanns’) did I not repeat to myself the words of the letter which, one day soon, Gilberte would surely send, would perhaps even bring to me herself. The perpetual vision of that imagined happiness helped me to endure the desolation of my real happiness. With women who do not love Us, as with the ‘missing,’ the knowledge that there is no hope left does not prevent our continuing to wait for news. We live on tenterhooks, starting at the slightest sound; the mother whose son has gone to sea on some perilous voyage of discovery sees him in imagination every moment, long after the fact of his having perished has been established, striding into the room, saved by a miracle and in the best of health. And this strain of waiting, according to the strength of her memory and the resistance of her bodily organs, either helps her on her journey through the years, at the end of which she will be able to endure the knowledge that her son is no more, to forget gradually and to survive his loss, or else it kills her

    On the other hand, my grief found consolation in the idea that my love must profit by it. Each visit that I paid to Mme. Swann without seeing Gilberte was a cruel punishment, but I felt that it correspondingly enhanced the idea that Gilberte had of me

    Besides, if I always took care, before going to see Mme. Swann, that there should be no risk of her daughter’s appearing, that arose, it is true, from my determination to break with her, but no less perhaps from that hope of reconciliation which overlay my intention to renounce her (very few of such intentions are absolute, at least in a continuous form, in this human soul of ours, one of whose laws, confirmed by the unlooked-for wealth of illustration that memory supplies, is intermittence), and hid from me all that in it was unbearably cruel. As for that hope, I saw clearly how far it was chimerical. I was like a pauper who moistens his dry crust with fewer tears if he assures himself that, at any moment, a total stranger is perhaps going to leave him the whole of his fortune. We are all of us obliged, if we are to make reality endurable, to nurse a few little follies in ourselves. Now my hope remained more intact — while at the same time our separation became more effectual — if I refrained from meeting Gilberte. If I had found myself face to face with her in her mother’s drawing-room, we might perhaps have uttered irrevocable words which would have rendered our breach final, killed my hope and, on the other hand, by creating a fresh anxiety, reawakened my love and made resignation harder

    Ever so long ago, before I had even thought of breaking with her daughter, Mme. Swann had said to me: “It is all very well your coming to see Gilberte; I should like you to come sometimes for my sake, not to my ‘kettledrums,’ which would bore you because there is such a crowd, but on the other days, when you will always find me at home if you come fairly late.” So that I might be thought, when I came to see her, to be yielding only after a long resistance to a desire which she had expressed in the past. And very late in the afternoon, when it was quite dark, almost at the hour at which my parents would be sitting down to dinner, I would set out to pay Mme. Swann a visit, in the course of which I knew that I should not see Gilberte, and yet should be thinking only of her. In that quarter, then looked upon as remote, of a Paris darker than Paris is to-day, where even in the centre there was no electric light in the public thoroughfares and very little in private houses, the lamps of a drawing-room situated on the ground level, or but slightly raised above it, as were the rooms in which Mme. Swann generally received her visitors, were enough to lighten the street, and to make the passer-by raise his eyes, connecting with their glow, as with its apparent though hidden cause, the presence outside the door of a string of smart broughams. This passer-by was led to believe, not without a certain emotion, that a modification had been effected in this mysterious cause, when he saw one of the carriages begin to move; but it was merely a coachman who, afraid of his horses’ catching cold, started them now and again on a brisk walk, all the more impressive because the rubber-tired wheels gave the sound of their hooves a background of silence from which it stood out more distinct and more explicit

    The ‘winter-garden,’ of which in those days the passer-by generally caught a glimpse, in whatever street he might be walking, if the drawing-room did not stand too high above the pavement, is to be seen to-day only in photogravures in the gift-books of P. J. Stahl, where, in contrast to the infrequent floral decorations of the Louis XVI drawing-rooms now in fashion — a single rose or a Japanese iris in a long-necked vase of crystal into which it would be impossible to squeeze a second — it seems, because of the profusion of indoor plants which people had then, and of the absolute want of style in their arrangement, as though it must have responded in the ladies whose houses it adorned to some living and delicious passion for botany rather than to any cold concern for lifeless decoration. It suggested to one, only on a larger scale, in the houses of those days, those tiny, portable hothouses laid out on New Year’s morning beneath the lighted lamp — for the children were always too impatient to wait for daylight — among all the other New Year’s presents but the loveliest of them all, consoling them with its real plants which they could tend as they grew for the bareness of the winter soil; and even more than those little houses themselves, those winter-gardens were like the hothouse that the children could see there at the same time, portrayed in a delightful book, another of their presents, and one which, for all that it was given not to them but to Mlle. Lili, the heroine of the story, enchanted them to such a pitch that even now, when they are almost old men and women, they ask themselves whether, in those fortunate years, winter was not the loveliest of the seasons. And inside there, beyond the winter-garden, through the various kinds of arborescence which from the street made the lighted window appear like the glass front of one of those children’s playthings, pictured or real, the passer-by, drawing himself up on tiptoe, would generally observe a man in a frock coat, a gardenia or a carnation in his buttonhole, standing before a seated lady, both vaguely outlined, like two intaglios cut in a topaz, in the depths of the drawing-room atmosphere clouted by the samovar — then a recent importation — with steam which may very possibly be escaping from it still to-day, but to which, if it does, we are grown so accustomed now that no one notices it. Mme. Swann attached great importance to her ‘tea’; she thought that she shewed her originality and expressed her charm when she said to a man, “You will find me at home any day, fairly late; come to tea!” so that she allowed a sweet and delicate smile to accompany the words which she pronounced with a fleeting trace of English accent, and which her listener duly noted, bowing solemnly in acceptance, as though the invitation had been something important and uncommon which commanded deference and required attention. There was another reason, apart from those given already, for the flowers’ having more than a merely ornamental part in Mme. Swann’s drawing-room, and this reason pertained not to the period, but, in some degree, to the former life of Odette. A great courtesan, such as she had been, lives largely for her lovers, that is to say at home, which means that she comes in time to live for her home. The things that one sees in the house of a ‘respectable’ woman, things which may of course appear to her also to be of importance, are those which are in any event of the utmost importance to the courtesan. The culminating point of her day is not the moment in which she dresses herself for all the world to see, but that in which she undresses herself for a man. She must be as smart in her wrapper, in her nightgown, as in her outdoor attire. Other women display their jewels, but as for her, she lives in the intimacy of her pearls. This kind of existence imposes on her as an obligation and ends by giving her a fondness for luxury which is secret, that is to say which comes near to being disinterested. Mme. Swann extended this to include her flowers. There was always beside her chair an immense bowl of crystal filled to the brim with Parma violets or with long white daisy-petals scattered upon the water, which seemed to be testifying, in the eyes of the arriving guest, to some favourite and interrupted occupation, such as the cup of tea which Mme. Swann would, for her own amusement, have been drinking there by herself; an occupation more intimate still and more mysterious, so much so that one felt oneself impelled to apologise on seeing the flowers exposed there by her side, as one would have apologised for looking at the title of the still open book which would have revealed to one what had just been read by — and so, perhaps, what was still in the mind of Odette. And unlike the book the flowers were living things; it was annoying, when one entered the room to pay Mme. Swann a visit, to discover that she was not alone, or if one came home with her not to find the room empty, so prominent a place in it, enigmatic and intimately associated with hours in the life of their mistress of which one knew nothing, did those flowers assume which had not been made ready for Odette’s visitors but, as it were, forgotten there by her, had held and would hold with her again private conversations which one was afraid of disturbing, the secret of which one tried in vain to read, fastening one’s eyes on the moist purple, the still liquid water-colour of the Parma violets. By the end of October Odette would begin to come home with the utmost punctuality for tea, which was still known, at that time, as ‘five-o’clock tea,’ having once heard it said, and being fond of repeating that if Mme. Verdurin had been able to form a salon it was because people were always certain of finding her at home at the same hour. She imagined that she herself had one also, of the same kind, but freer, senza rigore as she used to say. She saw herself figuring thus as a sort of Lespinasse, and believed that she had founded a rival salon by taking from the du Defiant of the little group several of her most attractive men, notably Swann himself, who had followed her in her secession and into her retirement, according-to a version for which one can understand that she had succeeded in gaining credit among her more recent friends, ignorant of what had passed, though without convincing herself. But certain favourite parts are played by us so often before the public and rehearsed so carefully when we are alone that we find it easier to refer to their fictitious testimony than to that of a reality which we have almost entirely forgotten. On days on which Mme. Swann had not left the house, one found her in a wrapper of crêpe-de-Chine, white as the first snows of winter, or, it might be, in one of those long pleated garments of moussettne-de-soie, which seemed nothing more than a shower of white or rosy petals, and would be regarded to-day as hardly suitable for winter, though quite wrongly. For these light fabrics and soft colours gave to a woman — in the stifling warmth of the drawing-rooms of those days, with their heavily curtained doors, rooms of which the most effective thing that the society novelists of the time could find to say was that they were ‘exquisitely cushioned’— the same air of coolness that they gave to the roses which were able to stay in the room there by her side, despite the winter, in the glowing flesh tints of their nudity, as though it were already spring. By reason of the muffling of all sound in the carpets, and of the remoteness of her cosy retreat, the lady of the house, not being apprised of your entry as she is to-day, would continue to read almost until you were standing before her chair, which enhanced still further that sense of the romantic, that charm of a sort of secret discovery, which we find to-day in the memory of those gowns, already out of fashion even then, which Mme. Swann was perhaps alone in not having discarded, and which give us the feeling that the woman who wore them must have been the heroine of a novel because most of us have scarcely set eyes on them outside the pages of certain of Henry Gréville’s tales. Odette had, at this time, in her drawing-room, when winter began, chrysanthemums of enormous size and a variety of colours such as Swann, in the old days, certainly never saw in her drawing-room in the Rue La Pérouse. My admiration for them — when I went to pay Mme. Swann one of those melancholy visits during which, prompted by my sorrow, I discovered in her all the mystical poetry of her character as the mother of that Gilberte to whom she would say on the morrow: “Your friend came to see me yesterday,”— sprang, no doubt, from my sense that, rose-pale like the Louis XIV silk that covered her chairs, snow-white like her crêpe-de-Chine wrapper, or of a metallic red like her samovar, they superimposed upon the decoration of the room another, a supplementary scheme of decoration, as rich, as delicate in its colouring, but one which was alive and would last for a few days only. But I was touched to find that these chrysanthemums appeared less ephemeral than, one might almost say, lasting, when I compared them with the tones, as pink, as coppery, which the setting sun so gorgeously displays amid the mists of a November afternoon, and which, after seeing them, before I had entered the house, fade from the sky, I found again inside, prolonged, transposed on to the flaming palette of the flowers. Like the fires caught and fixed by a great colourist from the impermanence of the atmosphere and the sun, so that they should enter and adorn a human dwelling, they invited me, those chrysanthemums, to put away all my sorrows and to taste with a greedy rapture during that ‘tea-time’ the too fleeting joys of November, of which they set ablaze all around me the intimate and mystical glory. Alas, it was not in the conversations to which I must listen that I could hope to attain to that glory; they had but little in common with it. Even with Mme. Cottard, and although it was growing late, Mme. Swann would assume her most caressing manner to say: “Oh, no, it’s not late, really; you mustn’t look at the clock; that’s not the right time; it’s stopped; you can’t possibly have anything else to do now, why be in such a hurry?” as she pressed a final tartlet upon the Professor’s wife, who was gripping her card-case in readiness for flight

    “One simply can’t tear oneself away from this house!” observed Mme. Bontemps to Mme. Swann, while Mme. Cottard, in her astonishment at hearing her own thought put into words, exclaimed: “Why, that’s just what I always say myself, what I tell my own little judge, in the court of conscience!” winning the applause of the gentlemen from the Jockey Club, who had been profuse in their salutations, as though confounded at such an honour’s being done them, when Mme. Swann had introduced them to this common and by no means attractive little woman, who kept herself, when confronted with Odette’s brilliant friends, in reserve, if not on what she herself called ‘the defensive,’ for she always used stately language to describe the simplest happenings. “I should never have suspected it,” was Mme. Swann’s comment, “three Wednesdays running you’ve played me false.” “That’s quite true, Odette; it’s simply ages, it’s an eternity since I saw you last. You see, I plead guilty; but I must tell you,” she went on with a vague suggestion of outraged modesty, for although a doctor’s wife she would never have dared to speak without periphrasis of rheumatism or of a chill on the kidneys,” that I have had a lot of little troubles. As we all have, I dare say. And besides that I’ve had a crisis among my masculine domestics. I’m sure, I’m no more imbued with a sense of my own authority than most ladies; still I’ve been obliged, just to make an example you know, to give my Vatel notice; I believe he was looking out anyhow for a more remunerative place. But his departure nearly brought about the resignation of my entire ministry. My own maid refused to stay in the house a moment longer; oh, we have had some Homeric scenes. However I held fast to the reins through thick and thin; the whole affair’s been a perfect lesson, which won’t be lost on me, I can tell you. I’m afraid I’m boring you with all these stories about servants, but you know as well as I do what a business it is when one is obliged to set about rearranging one’s household

    “Aren’t we to see anything of your delicious child?” she wound up. “No, my delicious child is dining with a friend,” replied Mme. Swann, and then, turning to me: “I believe she’s written to you, asking you to come and see her to-morrow. And your babies?” she went on to Mme. Cottard. I breathed a sigh of relief. These words by which Mme. Swann proved to me that I oould see Gilberte whenever I chose gave me precisely the comfort which I had come to seek, and which at that time made my visits to Mme. Swann so necessary. “No, I’m afraid not; I shall write to her, anyhow, this evening. Gilberte and I never seem to see one another now,” I added, pretending to attribute our separation to some mysterious agency, which gave me a further illusion of being in love, supported as well by the affectionate way in which I spoke of Gilberte and she of me. “You know, she’s simply devoted to you,” said Mme. Swann. “Really, you won’t come to-morrow?” Suddenly my heart rose on wings; the thought had just struck me —“After all, why shouldn’t I, since it’s her own mother who suggests it?” But with the thought I fell back into my old depression. I was afraid now lest, when she saw me again, Gilberte might think that my indifference of late had been feigned, and it seemed wiser to prolong our separation. During these asides Mme. Bontemps had been complaining of the insufferable dulness of politicians’ wives, for she pretended to find everyone too deadly or too stupid for words, and to deplore her husband’s official position. “Do you mean to say you can shake hands with fifty doctors’ wives, like that, one after the other?” she exclaimed to Mme. Cottard, who, unlike her, was full of the kindest feelings for everybody and of determination to do her duty in every respect. “Ah! you’re a law-abiding woman! You see, in my case’, at the Ministry, don’t you know, I simply have to keep it up, of course. It’s too much for me, I can tell you; you know what those officials’ wives are like, it’s all I can do not to put my tongue out at them. And my niece Albertine is just like me. You really wouldn’t believe the impudence that girl has. Last week, on my ‘day,’ I had the wife of the Under Secretary of State for Finance, who told us that she knew nothing at all about cooking. ‘But surely, ma’am,’ my niece chipped in with her most winning smile, ‘you ought to know everything about it, after all the dishes your father had to wash.’” “Oh, I do love that story; I think it’s simply exquisite!” cried Mme. Swann. “But certainly on the Doctor’s consultation days you should make a point of being ‘at home,’ among your flowers and books and all your pretty things,” she urged Mme. Cottard. “Straight out like that! Bang! Right in the face; bang! She made no bones about it, I can tell you! And she’d never said a word to me about it, the little wretch; she’s as cunning as a monkey. You are lucky to be able to control yourself; I do envy people who can hide what is in their minds.” “But I’ve no need to do that, Mme. Bontemps, I’m not so hard to please,” Mme. Cottard gently expostulated. “For one thing, I’m not in such a privileged position,” she went on, slightly raising her voice as was her custom, as though she were underlining the point of her remark, whenever she slipped into the conversation any of those delicate courtesies, those skilful flatteries which won her the admiration and assisted the career of her husband. “And besides I’m only too glad to do anything that can be of use to the Professor.”

    “But, my dear, it isn’t what one’s glad to do; it’s what one is able to do! I expect you’re not nervous. Do you know, whenever I see the War Minister’s wife making faces, I start copying her at once. It’s a dreadful thing to have a temperament like mine.”

    “To be sure, yes,” said Mme. Cottard, “I’ve heard people say that she had a twitch; my husband knows someone else who occupies a very high position, and it’s only natural, when gentlemen get talking together . . . ”

    “And then, don’t you know, it’s just the same with the Chief of the Registry; he’s a hunchback. Whenever he comes to see me, before he’s been in the room five minutes my fingers are itching to stroke his hump. My husband says I’ll cost him his place. What if I do! A fig for the Ministry! Yes, a fig for the Ministry! I should like to have that printed as a motto on my notepaper. I can see I am shocking you; you’re so frightfully proper, but I must say there’s nothing amuses me like a little devilry now and then. Life would be dreadfully monotonous without it.” And she went on talking about the Ministry all the time, as though it had been Mount Olympus. To change the conversation, Mme. Swann turned to Mme. Cottard: “But you’re looking very smart to-day. Redfern fecit?”

    “No, you know, I always swear by Rauthnitz. Besides, it’s only an old thing I’ve had done up.” “Not really! It’s charming!”

    “Guess how much. . . . No, change the first figure!”

    “You don’t say so! Why, that’s nothing; it’s given away! Three times that at least, I should have said.” “You see how history comes to be written,” apostrophised the doctor’s wife. And pointing to a neck-ribbon which had been a present from Mme. Swann: “Look, Odette! Do you recognise this?”

    Through the gap between a pair of curtains a head peeped with ceremonious deference, making a playful pretence of being afraid of disturbing the party; it was Swann. “Odette, the Prince d’Agrigente is with me in the study. He wants to know if he may pay his respects to you. What am I to tell him?” “Why, that I shall be delighted,” Odette would reply, secretly flattered, but without losing anything of the composure which came to her all the more easily since she had always, even in her ‘fast’ days, been accustomed to entertain men of fashion. Swann disappeared to deliver the message, and would presently return with the Prince, unless in the meantime Mme. Verdurin had arrived. When he married Odette Swann had insisted on her ceasing to frequent the little clan. (He had several good reasons for this stipulation, though, had he had none, he would have made it just the same in obedience to a law of ingratitude which admits no exception, and proves that every ‘go-between’ is either lacking in foresight or else singularly disinterested.) He had conceded only that Odette and Mme. Verdurin might exchange visits once a year, and even this seemed excessive to some of the ‘faithful,’ indignant at the insult offered to the ‘Mistress’ who for so many years had treated Odette and even Swann himself as the spoiled children of her house. For if it contained false brethren who ‘failed’ upon certain evenings in order that they might secretly accept an invitation from Odette, ready, in the event of discovery, with the excuse that they were anxious to meet Bergotte (although the Mistress assured them that he never went to the Swanns’, and even if he did, had no vestige of talent, really — in spite of which she was making the most strenuous efforts, to quote one of her favourite expressions, to ‘attract’ him), the little group had its ‘die-hards’ also. And these, though ignorant of those conventional refinements which often dissuade people from the extreme attitude one would have liked to see them adopt in order to annoy some one else, would have wished Mme. Verdurin, but had never managed to prevail upon her, to sever all connection with Odette, and thus deprive Odette of the satisfaction of saying, with a mocking laugh: “We go to the Mistress’s very seldom now, since the Schism. It was all very well while my husband was still a bachelor, but when one is married, you know, it isn’t always so easy. . . . If you must know, M. Swann can’t abide old Ma Verdurin, and he wouldn’t much like the idea of my going there regularly, as I used to. And I, as a dutiful spouse, don’t you see . . .?” Swann would accompany his wife to their annual evening there but would take care not to be in the room when Mme. Verdurin came to call. And so, if the ‘Mistress’ was in the drawing-room, the Prince d’Agrigente would enter it alone. Alone, too, he was presented to her by Odette, who preferred that Mme. Verdurin should be left in ignorance of the names of her humbler guests, and so might, seeing more than one strange face in the room, be led to believe that she was mixing with the cream of the aristocracy, a device which proved so far successful that Mme. Verdurin said to her husband, that evening, with profound contempt: “Charming people, her friends! I met all the fine flower of the Reaction!” Odette was living, with respect to Mme. Verdurin, under a converse illusion. Not that the latter’s salon had ever begun, at that time, to develop into what we shail one day see it to have become. Mme. Verdurin had not yet reached the period of incubation in which one dispenses with one’s big parties, where the few brilliant specimens recently acquired would be lost in too numerous a crowd, and prefers to wait until the generative force of the ten righteous whom one has succeeded in attracting shall have multiplied those ten seventyfold. As Odette was not to be long now in doing, Mme. Verdurin did indeed entertain the idea of ‘Society’ as her final objective, but her zone of attack was as yet so restricted, and moreover so remote from that in which Odette had some chance of arriving at an identical goal, of breaking the line of defence, that the latter remained absolutely ignorant of the strategic plans which the ‘Mistress’ was elaborating. And it was with the most perfect sincerity that Odette, when anyone spoke to her of Mme. Verdurin as a snob, would answer, laughing, “Oh, no, quite the opposite! For one thing, she never gets a chance of being a snob; she doesn’t know anyone. And then, to do her justice, I must say that she seems quite pleased not to know anyone. No, what she likes are her Wednesdays, and people who talk well.” And in her heart of hearts she envied Mme. Verdurin (for all that she did not despair of having herself, in so eminent a school, succeeded in acquiring them) those arts to which the ‘Mistress’ attached such paramount importance, albeit they did but discriminate, between shades of the Non-existent, sculpture the void, and were, properly speaking, the Arts of Nonentity: to wit those, in the lady of a house, of knowing how to ‘bring people together,’ how to ‘group,’ to ‘draw out,’ to ‘keep in the background,’ to act as a ‘connecting link.’

    In any case, Mme. Swann’s friends were impressed when they saw in her house a lady of whom they were accustomed to think only as in her own, in an inseparable setting of her guests, amid the whole of her little group which they were astonished to behold thus suggested, summarised, assembled, packed into a single armchair in the bodily form of the ‘Mistress,’ the hostess turned visitor, muffled in her cloak with its grebe trimming, as shaggy as the white skins that carpeted that drawing-room embowered in which Mme. Verdurin was a drawing-room in herself. The more timid among the women thought it prudent to retire, and using the plural, as people do when they mean to hint to the rest of the room that it is wiser not to tire a convalescent who is out of bed for the first time: “Odette,” they murmured, “we are going to leave you.” They envied Mme. Cottard, whom the ‘Mistress’ called by her Christian name. “Can I drop you anywhere?” Mme. Verdurin asked her, unable to bear the thought that one of the faithful was going to remain behind instead of following her from the room. “Oh, but this lady has been so very kind as to say, she’ll take me,” replied Mme. Cottard, not wishing to appear to be forgetting, when approached by a more illustrious personage, that she had accepted the offer which Mme. Bontémps had made of driving her home behind her cockaded coachman. “I must say that I am always specially grateful to the friends who are so kind as to take me with them in their vehicles. It is a regular godsend to me, who have no Automedon.” “Especially,” broke in the ‘Mistress,’ who felt that she must say something, since she knew Mme. Bontémps slightly and had just invited her to her Wednesdays, “as at Mme. de Crécy’s house you’re not very near home. Oh, good gracious, I shall never get into the way of saying Mme. Swann!” It was a recognised pleasantry in the little clan, among those who were not overendowed with wit, to pretend that they could never grow used to saying ‘Mme. Swann.’ “I have been so accustomed to saying Mme. de Crécy that I nearly went wrong again!” Only Mme. Verdurin, when she spoke to Odette, was not content with the nearly, but went wrong on purpose. “Don’t you feel afraid, Odette, living out in the wilds like this? I’m sure I shouldn’t feel at all comfortable, coming home after dark. Besides, it’s so damp. It can’t be at all good for your husband’s eczema. You haven’t rats in the house, I hope!” “Oh, dear no. What a horrid idea!” “That’s a good thing; I was told you had. I’m glad to know it’s not true, because I have a perfect horror of the creatures, and I should never have come to see you again. Goodbye, my dear child, we shall meet again soon; you know what a pleasure it is to me to see you. You don’t know how to put your chrysanthemums in water,” she went on, as she prepared to leave the room, Mme. Swann having risen to escort her. “They are Japanese flowers; you must arrange them the same way as the Japanese.” “I do not agree with Mme. Verdurin, although she is the Law and the Prophets to me in all things! There’s no one like you, Odette, for finding such lovely chrysanthemums, or chrysanthema rather, for it seems that’s what we ought to call them now,” declared Mme. Cottard as soon as the ‘Mistress’ had shut the door behind her. “Dear Mme. Verdurin is not always very kind about other people’s flowers,” said Odette sweetly. “Whom do you go to, Odette,” asked Mme. Cottard, to forestall any further criticism of the ‘Mistress.’ “Lemaître? I must confess, the other day in Lemaître’s window I saw a huge, great pink bush which made me do something quite mad.” But modesty forbade her to give any more precise details as to the price of the bush, and she said merely that the Professor, “and you know, he’s not at all a quicktempered man,” had ‘waved his sword in the air’ and told her that she “didn’t know what money meant.” “No, no, I’ve no regular florist except Debac.” “Nor have I,” said Mme. Cottard, “but I confess that I am unfaithful to him now and then with Lachaume.” “Oh, you forsake him for Lachaume, do you; I must tell Debac that,” retorted Odette, always anxious to shew her wit, and to lead the conversation in her own house, where she felt more at her ease than in the little clan. “Besides, Lachaume is really becoming too dear; his prices are quite excessive, don’t you know; I find his prices impossible!” she added, laughing

    Meanwhile Mme. Bontemps, who had been heard a hundred times to declare that nothing would induce her to go to the Verdurins’, delighted at being asked to the famous Wednesdays, was planning in her own mind how she could manage to attend as many of them as possible. She was not’ aware that Mme. Verdurin liked people not to miss a single one; also she was one of those people whose company is but little sought, who, when a hostess invites them to a series of parties, do not accept and go to them without more ado, like those who know that it is always a pleasure to see them, whenever they have a moment to spare and feel inclined to go out; people of her type deny themselves it may be the first evening and the third, imagining that their absence will be noticed, and save themselves up for the second and fourth, unless it should happen that, having heard from a trustworthy source that the third is to be a particularly brilliant party, they reverse the original order, assuring their hostess that “most unfortunately, we had another engagement last week.” So Mme. Bontemps was calculating how many Wednesdays there could still be left before Easter, and by what means she might manage to secure one extra, and yet not appear to be thrusting herself upon her hostess. She relied upon Mme. Cottard, whom she would have with her in the carriage going home, to give her a few hints. “Oh, Mme. Bontemps, I see you getting up to go; it is very bad of you to give the signal for flight like that! You owe me some compensation for not turning up last Thursday. . . . Come, sit down again, just for a minute. You can’t possibly be going anywhere else before dinner. Really, you won’t let yourself be tempted?” went on Mme. Swann, and, as she held out a plate of cakes, “You know, they’re not at all bad, these little horrors. They don’t look nice, but just taste one, I know you’ll like it.” “On the contrary, they look quite delicious,” broke in Mme. Cottard. “In your house, Odette, one is never short of victuals. I have no need to ask to see the trade-mark; I know you get everything from Rebattet. I must say that I am more eclectic. For sweet biscuits and everything of that sort I repair, as often as not, to Bourbonneux. But I agree that they simply don’t know what an ice means. Rebattet for everything iced, and syrups and sorbets; they’re past masters. As my husband would say, they’re the ne plus ultra.” “Oh, but we just make these in the house. You won’t, really?” “I shan’t be able to eat a scrap of dinner,” pleaded Mme. Bontemps, “but I will just sit down again for a moment; you know, I adore talking to a clever woman like you.” “You will think me highly indiscreet, Odette, but I should so like to know what you thought of the hat Mme. Trombert had on. I know, of course, that big hats are the fashion just now. All the same, wasn’t it just the least little bit exaggerated? And compared to the hat she came to see me in the other day, the one she had on just now was microscopic!” “Oh no, I am not at all clever,” said Odette, thinking that this sounded well. “I am a perfect simpleton, I believe everything people say, and worry myself to death over the least thing.” And she insinuated that she had, just at first, suffered terribly from the thought of having married a man like Swann, who had a separate life of his own and was unfaithful to her. Meanwhile the Prince d’Agrigente, having caught the words “I am not at all clever,” thought it incumbent on him to protest; unfortunately he had not the knack of repartee. “Tut, tut, tut, tut!” cried Mme. Bontemps, “Not clever; you!” “That’s just what I was saying to myself —‘What do I hear?’,” the Prince clutched at this straw, “My ears must have played me false!” “No, I assure you,” went on Odette, “I am really just an ordinary woman, very easily shocked, full of prejudices, living in my own little groove and dreadfully ignorant.” And then, in case he had any news of the Baron de Charlus, “Have you seen our dear Baronet?” she asked him. “You, ignorant!” cried Mme. Bontemps. “Then I wonder what you’d say of the official world, all those wives of Excellencies who can talk of nothing but their frocks. . . . Listen to this, my friend; not more than a week ago I happened to mention Lohengrin to the Education Minister’s wife. She stared at me, and said ‘Lohengrin? Oh, yes, the new review at the Folies-Bergères. I hear it’s a perfect scream!’ What do you say to that, eh? You can’t help yourself; when people say things like that it makes your blood boil. I could have struck her. Because I have a bit of a temper of my own. What do you say, sir;” she turned to me, “was I not right?” “Listen,” said Mme. Cottard, “people can’t help answering a little off the mark when they’re asked a thing like that point blank, without any warning. I know something about it, because Mme. Verdurin also has a habit of putting a pistol to your head.” “Speaking of Mme. Verdurin,” Mme. Bontemps asked Mme. Cottard, “do you know who will be there on Wednesday? Oh, I’ve just remembered that we’ve accepted an invitation for next Wednesday. You wouldn’t care to dine with us on Wednesday week? We could go on together to Mme. Verdurin’s. I should never dare to go there by myself; I don’t know why it is, that great lady always terrifies me.” “I’ll tell you what it is,” replied Mme. Cottard, “what frightens you about Mme. Verdurin is her organ. But you see everyone can’t have such a charming organ as Mme. Swann. Once you’ve found your tongue, as the ‘Mistress’ says, the ice will soon be broken. For she’s a very easy person, really, to get on with. But I can quite understand what you feel; it’s never pleasant to find oneself for the first time in a strange country.” “Won’t you dine with us, too?” said Mme. Bontemps to Mme. Swann. “After dinner we could all go to the Verdurins’ together, ‘do a Verdurin’; and even if it means that the ‘Mistress’ will stare me out of countenance and never ask me to the house again, once we are there we’ll just sit by ourselves and have a quiet talk, I’m sure that’s what I should like best.” But this assertion can hardly have been quite truthful, for Mme. Bontemps went on to ask: “Who do you think will be there on Wednesday week? What will they be doing? There won’t be too big a crowd, I hope!” “I certainly shan’t be there,” said Odette. “We shall just look in for a minute on the last Wednesday of all. If you don’t mind waiting till then ——” But Mme. Bontemps did not appear to be tempted by the proposal

    Granted that the intellectual distinction of a house and its smartness are generally in inverse rather than direct ratio, one must suppose, since Swann found Mme. Bontemps attractive, that any forfeiture of position once accepted has the consequence of making us less particular with regard to the people among whom we have resigned ourselves to finding entertainment, less particular with regard to their intelligence as to everything else about them. And if this be true, men, like nations, must see their culture and even their language disappear with their independence. One of the effects of this indulgence is to aggravate the tendency which after a certain age we have towards finding pleasure in speeches that are a homage to our own turn of mind, to our weaknesses, an encouragement to us to yield to them; that is the age at which a great artist prefers to the company of original minds that of pupils who have nothing in common with him save the letter of his doctrine, who listen to him and offer incense; at which a man or woman of mark, who is living entirely for love, will find that the most intelligent person in a gathering is one perhaps of no distinction, but one who has shewn by some utterance that he can understand and approve what is meant by an existence devoted to gallantry, and has thus pleasantly excited the voluptuous instincts of the lover or mistress; it was the age, too, at which Swann, in so far as he had become the husband of Odette, enjoyed hearing Mme. Bontemps say how silly it was to have nobody in one’s house but duchesses (concluding from that, quite the contrary of what he would have decided in the old days at the Verdurins’, that she was a good creature, extremely sensible and not at all a snob) and telling her stories which made her ‘die laughing’ because she had not heard them before, although she always ‘saw the point’ at once, liked flattering her for his own amusement. “Then the Doctor is not mad about flowers, like you?” Mme. Swann asked Mme. Cottard. “Oh, well, you know, my husband is a sage; be practises moderation in all things. Yet, I must admit, he has a passion.” Her eye aflame with malice, joy, curiosity, “And what is that, pray?” inquired Mme. Bontemps. Quite simply Mme. Cottard answered her, “Reading.” “Oh, that’s a very restful passion in a husband!” cried Mme. Bontemps suppressing an impish laugh. “When the Doctor gets a book in his hands, you know!” “Well, that needn’t alarm you much . . . ” “But it does, for his eyesight. I must go now and look after him, Odette, and I shall come back on the very first opportunity and knock at your door. Talking of eyesight, have you heard that the new house Mme. Verdurin has just bought is to be lighted by electricity? I didn’t get that from my own little secret service, you know, but from quite a different source; it was the electrician himself, Mildé, who told me. You see, I quote my authorities! Even the bedrooms, he says, are to have electric lamps with shades which will filter the light. It is evidently a charming luxury, for those who can afford it. But it seems that our contemporaries must absolutely have the newest thing if it’s the only one of its kind in the world. Just fancy, the sister-in-law of a friend of mine has had the telephone installed in her house! She can order things from her tradesmen without having to go out of doors! I confess that I’ve made the most bare-faced stratagems to get permission to go there one day, just to speak into the instrument. It’s very tempting, but more in a friend’s house than at home. I don’t think I should like to have the telephone in my establishment. Once the first excitement is over, it must be a perfect racket going on all the time. Now, Odette, I must be off; you’re not to keep Mme. Bontemps any longer, she’s looking after me. I must absolutely tear myself away; you’re making me behave in a nice way, I shall be getting home after my husband!”

    And for myself also it was time to return home, before I had tasted those wintry delights of which the chrysanthemums had seemed to me to be the brilliant envelope. These pleasures had not appeared, and yet Mme. Swann did not look as though she expected anything more. She allowed the servants to carry away the tea-things, as who should say “Time, please, gentlemen!” And at last she did say to me: “Really, must you go? Very well; good-bye!” I felt that I might have stayed there without encountering those unknown pleasures, and that my unhappiness was not the cause of my having to forego them. Were they to be found, then, situated not upon that beaten track of hours which leads one always to the moment of departure, but rather upon some cross-road unknown to me along which I ought to have digressed? At least, the object of my visit had been attained; Gilberte would know that I had come to see her parents when she was not at home, and that I had, as Mme. Cottard had incessantly assured me, “made a complete conquest, first shot, of Mme. Verdurin,” whom, she added, she had never seen ‘make so much’ of anyone. (“You and she must have hooked atoms.”) She would know that I had spoken of her as was fitting, with affection, but that I had not that incapacity for living without our seeing one another which I believed to be at the root of the boredom that she had shewn at our last meetings. I had told Mme. Swann that I should not be able to see Gilberte again. I had said this as though I had finally decided not to see her any more. And the letter which I was going to send Gilberte would be framed on those lines. Only to myself, to fortify my courage, I proposed no more than a supreme and concentrated effort, lasting a few days only. I said to myself: “This is the last time that I shall refuse to meet her; I shall accept the next invitation.” To make our separation less difficult to realise, I did not picture it to myself as final. But I knew very well that it would be

    The first of January was exceptionally painful to me that winter. So, no doubt, is everything that marks a date and an anniversary when we are unhappy. But if our unhappiness is due to the loss of some dear friend, our suffering consists merely in an unusually vivid comparison of the present with the past. There was added to this, in my case, the unexpressed hope that Gilberte, having intended to leave me to take the first steps towards a reconciliation, and discovering that I had not taken them, had been waiting only for the excuse of New Year’s Day to write to me, saying: “What is the matter? I am madly in love with you; come, and let us explain things properly; I cannot live without seeing you.” As the last days of the old year went by, such a letter began to seem probable. It was, perhaps, nothing of the sort, but to make us believe that such a thing is probable the desire, the need that we have for it suffices. The soldier is convinced that a certain interval of time, capable of being indefinitely prolonged, will be allowed him before the bullet finds him, the thief before he is taken, men in general before they have to die. That is the amulet which preserves people — and sometimes peoples — not from danger but from the fear of danger, in reality from the belief in danger, which in certain cases allows them to brave it without their actually needing to be brave. It is confidence of this sort, and with as little foundation, that sustains the lover who is counting upon a reconciliation, upon a letter. For me to cease to expect a letter it would have sufficed that I should have ceased to wish for one. However unimportant one may know that one is in the eyes of her whom one still loves, one attributes to her a series of thoughts (though their sum-total be indifference) the intention to express those thoughts, a complication of her inner life in which one is the constant object possibly of her antipathy but certainly of her attention. But to imagine what was going on in Gilberte’s mind I should have required simply the power to anticipate on that New Year’s Day what I should feel on the first day of any of the years to come, when the attention or the silence or the affection or the coldness of Gilberte would pass almost unnoticed by me and I should not dream, should not even be able to dream of seeking a solution of problems which would have ceased to perplex me. When we are in love, our love is too big a thing for us to be able altogether to contain it within us. It radiates towards the beloved object, finds in her a surface which arrests it, forcing it to return to its starting-point, and it is this shock of the repercussion of our own affection which we call the other’s regard for ourselves, and which pleases us more then than on its outward journey because we do not recognise it as having originated in ourselves. New Year’s Day rang out all its hours without there coming to me that letter from Gilberte. And as I received a few others containing greetings tardy or retarded by the overburdening of the mails at that season, on the third and fourth of January I hoped still, but my hope grew hourly more faint. Upon the days that followed I gazed through a mist of tears. This undoubtedly meant that, having been less sincere than I thought in my renunciation of Gilberte, I had kept the hope of a letter from her for the New Year. And seeing that hope exhausted before I had had time to shelter myself behind another, I suffered as would an invalid who had emptied his phial of morphia without having another within his reach. But perhaps also in my case — and these two explanations are not mutually exclusive, for a single feeling is often made up of contrary elements — the hope that I entertained of ultimately receiving a letter had brought to my mind’s eye once again the image of Gilberte, had reawakened the emotions which the expectation of finding myself in her presence, the sight of her, her way of treating me had aroused in me before. The immediate possibility of a reconciliation had suppressed in me that faculty the immense importance of which we are apt to overlook: the faculty of resignation. Neurasthenics find it impossible to believe the friends who assure them that they will gradually recover their peace of mind if they will stay in bed and receive no letters, read no newspapers. They imagine that such a course will only exasperate their twitching nerves. And similarly lovers, who look upon it from their enclosure in a contrary state of mind, who have not begun yet to make trial of it, are unable to believe in the healing power of renunciation

    In consequence of the violence of my palpitations, my doses of caffeine were reduced; the palpitations ceased. Whereupon I asked myself whether it was not to some extent the drug that had been responsible for the anguish that I had felt when I came near to quarrelling with Gilberte, an anguish which I had attributed, on every recurrence of it, to the distressing prospect of never seeing my friend again or of running the risk of seeing her only when she was a prey to the same ill-humour. But if this medicine had been at the root of the sufferings which my imagination must in that case have interpreted wrongly (not that there would be anything extraordinary in that, seeing that, among lovers, the most acute mental suffering assumes often the physical identity of the woman with whom they are living), it had been, in that sense, like the philtre which, long after they have drunk of it, continues to bind Tristan to Isolde. For the physical improvement which the reduction of my caffeine effected almost at once did not arrest the evolution of that grief which my absorption of the toxin had perhaps — if it had not created it — at any rate contrived to render more acute

    Only, as the middle of the month of January approached, once my hopes of a letter on New Year’s Day had been disappointed, once the additional disturbance that had come with their disappointment had grown calm, it was my old sorrow, that of ‘before the holidays,’ which began again. What was perhaps the most cruel thing about it was that I myself was its architect, unconscious, wilful, merciless and patient. The one thing that mattered, my relations with Gilberte, it was I who was labouring to make them impossible by gradually creating out of this prolonged separation from my friend, not indeed her indifference, but what would come to the same thing in the end, my own. It was to a slow and painful suicide of that part of me which was Gilberte’s lover that I was goading myself with untiring energy, with a clear sense not only of what I was presently doing but of what must result from it in the future; I knew not only that after a certain time I should cease to love Gilberte, but also that she herself would regret it and that the attempts which she would then make to see me would be as vain as those that she was making now, no longer because I loved her too well but because I should certainly be in love with some other woman whom I should continue to desire, to wait for, through hours of which I should not dare to divert any particle of a second to Gilberte who would be nothing to me then. And no doubt at that very moment in which (since I was determined not to see her again, unless after a formal request for an explanation or a full confession of love on her part, neither of which was in the least degree likely to come to me now) I had already lost Gilberte, and loved her more than ever, and could feel all that she was to me better than in the previous year when, spending all my afternoons in her company, or as many as I chose, I believed that no peril threatened our friendship — no doubt at that moment the idea that I should one day entertain identical feelings for another was odious to me, for that idea carried me away beyond the range of Gilberte, my love and my sufferings. My love, my sufferings in which through my tears I attempted to discern precisely what Gilberte was, and was obliged to recognise that they did not pertain exclusively to her but would, sooner or later, be some other woman’s portion. So that — or such, at least, was my way of thinking then — we are always detached from our fellow-creatures; when a man loves one of them he feels that his love is not labelled with their two names, but may be born again in the future, may have been born already in the past for another and not for her. And in the time when he is not in love, if he makes up his mind philosophically as to what it is that is inconsistent in love, he will find that the love of which he can speak unmoved he did not, at the moment of speaking, feel, and therefore did not know, knowledge in these matters being intermittent and not outlasting the actual presence of the sentiment. That future in which I should not love Gilberte, which my sufferings helped me to divine although my imagination was not yet able to form a clear picture of it, certainly there would still have been time to warn Gilberte that it was gradually taking shape, that its coming was, if not imminent, at least inevitable, if she herself, Gilberte, did not come to my rescue and destroy in the germ my nascent indifference. How often was I not on the point of writing, or of going to Gilberte to tell her: “Take care. My mind is made up. What I am doing now is my supreme effort. I am seeing you now for the last time. Very soon I shall have ceased to love you.” But to what end? By what authority should I have reproached Gilberte for an indifference which, not that I considered myself guilty on that count, I too manifested towards everything that was not herself? The last time! To me, that appeared as something of immense significance, because I was in love with Gilberte. On her it would doubtless have made just as much impression as those letters in which our friends ask whether they may pay us a visit before they finally leave the country, an offer which, like those made by tiresome women who are in love with us, we decline because we have pleasures of our own in prospect. The time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic; the passions that we feel expand it, those that we inspire contract it; and habit fills up what remains

    Besides, what good would it have done if I had spoken to Gilberte; she would not have understood me. We imagine always when we speak that it is our own ears, our own mind that are listening. My words would have come to her only in a distorted form, as though they had had to pass through the moving curtain of a waterfall before they reached my friend, unrecognisable, giving a foolish sound, having no longer any kind of meaning. The truth which one puts into one’s words does not make a direct path for itself, is not supported by irresistible evidence. A considerable time must elapse before a truth of the same order can take shape in the words themselves. Then the political opponent who, despite all argument, every proof that he has advanced to damn the votary of the rival doctrine as a traitor, will himself have come to share the hated conviction by which he who once sought in vain to disseminate it is no longer bound. Then the masterpiece of literature whidi for the admirers who read it aloud seemed to make self-evident the proofs of its excellence, while to those who listened it presented only a senseless or commonplace image, will by these too be proclaimed a masterpiece, but too late for the author to learn of their discovery. Similarly in love the barriers, do what one may, cannot be broken down from without by him whom they maddeningly exclude; it is when he is no longer concerned with them that suddenly, as the result of aft effort directed from elsewhere, accomplished within the heart of her who did not love him, those barriers which he has charged without success will fall to no advantage. If I had come to Gilberte to tell her of my future indifference and the means of preventing it, she would have assumed from my action that my love for her, the need that I had of her, were even greater than I had supposed, and her distaste for the sight of me would thereby have been increased. And incidentally it is quite true that it was that love for her which helped me, by means of the incongruous states of mind which it successively produced in me, to foresee, more clearly than she herself could, the end of that love. And yet some such warning I might perhaps have addressed, by letter or with my own lips, to Gilberte, after a long enough interval, which would render her, it is true, less indispensable to me, but would also have proved to her that she was not so indispensable. Unfortunately certain persons — of good or evil intent — spoke of me to her in a fashion which must have led her to think that they were doing so at my request. Whenever I thus learned that Cottard, my own mother, even M. de Norpois had by a few ill-chosen words rendered useless all the sacrifice that I had just been making, wasted all the advantage of my reserve by giving me, wrongly, the appearance of having emerged from it, I was doubly angry. In the first place I could no longer reckon from any date but the present my laborious and fruitful abstention which these tiresome people had, unknown to me, interrupted and so brought to nothing. And not only that; I should have less pleasure in seeing Gilberte, who would think of me now no longer as containing myself in dignified resignation, but as plotting in the dark for an interview which she had scorned to grant me. I cursed all the idle chatter of people who so often, without any intention of hurting us or of doing us a service, for no reason, for talking’s sake, often because we ourselves have not been able to refrain from talking in their presence, and because they are indiscreet (as we ourselves are), do us, at a crucial moment, so much harm. It is true that in the grim operation performed for the eradication of our love they are far from playing a part equal to that played by two persons who are in the habit, from excess of good nature in one and of malice in the Other, of undoing everything at the moment when everything is on the point of being settled. But against these two persons we bear no such grudge as against the inopportune Cottards of this world, for the latter of them is the person whom we love and the former is ourself

    Meanwhile, since on almost every occasion of my going to see her Mme. Swann would invite me to come to tea another day, with her daughter, and tell me to reply directly to her, I was constantly writing to Gilberte, and in this correspondence I did not choose the expressions which might, I felt, have won her over, sought only to carve out the easiest channel for the torrent of my tears. For, like desire, regret seeks not to be analysed but to be satisfied. When one begins to love, one spends one’s time, not in getting to know what one’s love really is, but in making it possible to meet next day. When one abandons love one seeks not to know one’s grief but to offer to her who is causing it that expression of it which seems to one the most moving. One says the things which one feels the need of saying, and which the other will not understand, one speaks for oneself alone. I wrote: “I had thought that it would not be possible. Alas, I see now that it is not so difficult.” I said also: “I shall probably not see you again;” I said it while I continued to avoid shewing a coldness which she might think affected, and the words, as I wrote them, made me weep because I felt that they expressed not what I should have liked to believe but what was probably going to happen. For at the next request for a meeting which she would convey to me I should have again, as I had now, the courage not to yield, and, what with one refusal and another, I should gradually come to the moment when, by virtue of not having seen her again, I should not wish to see her. I wept, but I found courage enough to sacrifice, I tasted the sweets of sacrificing the happiness of being with her to the probability of seeming attractive to her one day, a day when, alas, my seeming attractive to her would be immaterial to me. Even the supposition, albeit so far from likely, that at this moment, as she had pretended during the last visit that I had paid her, she loved me, that what I took for the boredom which one feels in the company of a person of whom one has grown tired had been due only to a jealous susceptibility, to a feint of indifference analogous to my own, only rendered my decision less painful. It seemed to me that in years to come, when we had forgotten one another, when I should be able to look back and tell her that this letter which I was now in course of writing had not been for one moment sincere, she would answer, “What, you really did love me, did you? If you had only known how I waited for that letter, how I hoped that you were coming to see me, how I cried when I read it.” The thought, while I was writing it, immediately on my return from her mother’s house, that I was perhaps helping to bring about that very misunderstanding, that thought, by the sadness in which it plunged me, by the pleasure of imagining that I was loved by Gilberte, gave me the impulse to continue my letter

    If, at the moment of leaving Mme. Swann, when her tea-party ended, I was thinking of what I was going to write to her daughter, Mme. Cottard, as she departed, had been filled with thoughts of a wholly different order. On her little ‘tour of inspection’ she had not failed to congratulate Mme. Swann on the new ‘pieces,’ the recent ‘acquisitions’ which caught the eye in her drawing-room. She could see among them some, though only a very few, of the things that Odette had had in the old days in the Rue La Pérouse, for instance her animals carved in precious stones, her fetishes

    For since Mme. Swann had picked up from a friend whose opinion she valued the word ‘dowdy’— which had opened to her a new horizon because it denoted precisely those things which a few years earlier she had considered ‘smart’— all those things had, one after another, followed into retirement the gilded trellis that had served as background to her chrysanthemums, innumerable boxes of sweets from Giroux’s, and the coroneted note-paper (not to mention the coins of gilt pasteboard littered about on the mantelpieces, which, even before she had come to know Swann, a man of taste had advised her to sacrifice). Moreover in the artistic disorder, the studio-like confusion of the rooms, whose walls were still painted in sombre colours which made them as different as possible from the white-enamelled drawing-rooms in which, a little later, you were to find Mme. Swann installed, the Far East recoiled more and more before the invading forces of the eighteenth century; and the cushions which, to make me ‘comfortable,’ Mme. Swann heaped up and buffeted into position behind my back were sprinkled with Louis XV garlands and not, as of old, with Chinese dragons. In the room in which she was usually to be found, and of which she would say, “Yes, I like this room; I use it a great deal. I couldn’t live with a lot of horrid vulgar things swearing at me all the time; this is where I do my work ——” though she never stated precisely at what she was working. Was it a picture? A book, perhaps, for the hobby of writing was beginning to become common among women who liked to ‘do something,’ not to be quite useless. She was surrounded by Dresden pieces (having a fancy for that sort of porcelain, which she would name with an English accent, saying in any connexion: “How pretty that is; it reminds me of Dresden flowers,”), and dreaded for them even more than in the old days for her grotesque figures and her flower-pots the ignorant handling of her servants who must expiate, every now and then, the anxiety that they had caused her by submitting to outbursts of rage at which Swann, the most courteous and considerate of masters, looked on without being shocked. Not that the clear perception of certain weaknesses in those whom we love in any way diminishes our affection for them; rather that affection makes us find those weaknesses charming. Rarely nowadays was it in one of those Japanese wrappers that Odette received her familiars, but rather in the bright and billowing silk of a Watteau gown whose flowering foam she made as though to caress where it covered her bosom, and in which she immersed herself, looked solemn, splashed and sported, with such an air of comfort, of a cool skin and long-drawn breath, that she seemed to look on these garments not as something decorative, a mere setting for herself, but as necessary, in the same way as her ‘tub’ or her daily ‘outing,’ to satisfy the requirements of her style of beauty and the niceties of hygiene. She used often to say that she would go without bread rather than give up ‘art’ and ‘having nice things about her,’ and that the burning of the ‘Gioconda’ would distress her infinitely more than the destruction, by the same element, of ‘millions’ of the people she knew. Theories which seemed paradoxical to her friends, but made her pass among them as a superior woman, and qualified her to receive a visit once a week from the Belgian Minister, so that in the little world whose sun she was everyone would have been greatly astonished to learn that elsewhere — at the Verdurins’, for instance — she was reckoned a fool. It was this vivacity of expression that made Mme. Swann prefer men’s society to women’s. But when she criticised the latter it was always from the courtesan’s standpoint, singling out the blemishes that might lower them in the esteem of men, a lumpy figure, a bad complexion, inability to spell, hairy legs, foul breath, pencilled eyebrows. But towards a woman who had shewn her kindness or indulgence in the past she was more lenient, especially if this woman were now in trouble. She would defend her warmly, saying: “People are not fair to her. I assure you, she’s quite a nice woman really.”

    It was not only the furniture of Odette’s drawing-room, it was Odette herself that Mme. Cottard and all those who had frequented the society of Mme. de Crécy would have found it difficult, if they had not seen her for some little time, to recognise. She seemed to be so much younger. No doubt this was partly because she had grown stouter, was in better condition, seemed at once calmer, more cool, more restful, and also because the new way in which she braided her hair gave more breadth to a face which was animated by an application of pink powder, and into which her eyes and profile, formerly too prominent, seemed now to have been reabsorbed. But another reason for this change lay in the fact that, having reached the turning-point of life, Odette had at length discovered, or invented, a physiognomy of her own, an unalterable ‘character,’ a ‘style of beauty’ and on her incoherent features — which for so long, exposed to every hazard, every weakness of the flesh, borrowing for a moment, at the slightest fatigue, from the years to come, a sort of flickering shadow of anility, had furnished her, well or ill, according to how she was feeling, how she was looking, with a countenance dishevelled, inconstant, formless and attractive — had now set this fixed type, as it were an immortal youthfulness

    Swann had in his room, instead of the handsome photographs that were now taken of his wife, in all of which the same cryptic, victorious expression enabled one to recognise, in whatever dress and hat, her triumphant face and figure, a little old daguerreotype of her, quite plain, taken long before the appearance of this new type, so that the youth and beauty of Odette, which she had not yet discovered when it was taken, appeared to be missing from it. But it is probable that Swann, having remained constant, or having reverted to a different conception of her, enjoyed in the slender young woman with pensive eyes and tired features, caught in a pose between rest and motion, a more Botticellian charm. For he still liked to recognise in his wife one of Botticelli’s figures. Odette, who on the other hand sought not to bring out but to make up for, to cover and conceal the points in herself that did not please her, what might perhaps to an artist express her ‘character’ but in her woman’s eyes were merely blemishes, would not have that painter mentioned in her presence. Swann had a wonderful scarf of oriental silk, blue and pink, which he had bought because it was exactly that worn by Our Lady in the Magnificat. But Mme. Swann refused to wear it. Once only she allowed her husband to order her a dress covered all over with daisies, cornflowers, forget-me-nots and campanulas, like that of the Primavera. And sometimes in the evening, when she was tired, he would quietly draw my attention to the way in which she was giving, quite unconsciously, to her pensive hands the uncontrolled, almost distraught movement of the Virgin who dips her pen into the inkpot that the angel holds out to her, before writing upon the sacred page on which is already traced the word ‘Magnificat.’ But he added, “Whatever you do, don’t say anything about it to her; if she knew she was doing it, she would change her pose at once.”

    Save at these moments of involuntary relaxation, in which Swann essayed to recapture the melancholy cadence of Botticelli, Odette seemed now to be cut out in a single figure, wholly confined within a line which, following the contours of the woman, had abandoned the winding paths, the capricious re-entrants and salients, the radial points, the elaborate dispersions of the fashions of former days, but also, where it was her anatomy that went wrong by making unnecessary digressions within or without the ideal circumference traced for it, was able to rectify, by a bold stroke, the errors of nature, to make up, along a whole section of its course, for the failure as well of the human as of the textile element. The pads, the preposterous ‘bustle’ had disappeared, as well as those tailed corsets which, projecting under the skirt and stiffened by rods of whalebone, had so long amplified Odette with an artificial stomach and had given her the appearance of being composed of several incongruous pieces which there was no individuality to bind together. The vertical fall of fringes, the curve of trimmings had made way for the inflexion of a body which made silk palpitate as a siren stirs the waves, gave to cambric a human expression now that it had been liberated, like a creature that had taken shape and drawn breath, from the long chaos and nebulous envelopment of fashions at length dethroned. But Mme. Swann had chosen, had contrived to preserve some vestiges of certain of these, in the very thick of the more recent fashions that had supplanted them. When in the evening, finding myself unable to work and feeling certain that Gilberte had gone to the theatre with friends, I paid a surprise visit to her parents, I used often to find Mme. Swann in an elegant dishabille the skirt of which, of one of those rich dark colours, blood-red or orange, which seemed always as though they meant something very special, because they were no longer the fashion, was crossed diagonally, though not concealed, by a broad band of black lace which recalled the flounces of an earlier day. When on a still chilly afternoon in Spring she had taken me (before my rupture with her daughter) to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, under her coat, which she opened or buttoned up according as the exercise made her feel warm, the dog-toothed border of her blouse suggested a glimpse of the lapel of some non-existent waistcoat such as she had been accustomed to wear, some years earlier, when she had liked their edges to have the same slight indentations; and her scarf — of that same ‘Scotch tartan’ to which she had remained faithful, but whose tones she had so far softened, red becoming pink and blue lilac, that one might almost have taken it for one of those pigeon’s-breast taffetas which were the latest novelty — was knotted in such a way under her chin, without one’s being able to make out where it was fastened, that one could not help being reminded of those bonnet-strings which were — now no longer worn. She need only ‘hold out’ like this for a little longer and young men attempting to understand her theory of dress would say: “Mme. Swann is quite a period in herself, isn’t she?” As in a fine literary style which overlays with its different forms and so strengthens a tradition which lies concealed among them, so in Mme. Swann’s attire those half-hinted memories of waistcoats or of ringlets, sometimes a tendency, at once repressed, towards the ‘all aboard,’ or even a distant and vague allusion to the ‘chase me’ kept alive beneath the concrete form the unfinished likeness of other, older forms which you would not have succeeded, now, in making a tailor or a dressmaker reproduce, but about which your thoughts incessantly hovered, and enwrapped Mme. Swann in a cloak of nobility — perhaps because the sheer uselessness of these fripperies made them seem meant to serve some more than utilitarian purpose, perhaps because of the traces they preserved of vanished years, or else because there was a sort of personality permeating this lady’s wardrobe, which gave to the most dissimilar of her costumes a distinct family likeness. One felt that she did not dress simply for the comfort or the adornment of her body; she was surrounded by her garments as by the delicate and spiritualised machinery of a whole form of civilisation

    When Gilberte, who, as a rule, gave her tea-parties on the days when her mother was ‘at home,’ had for some reason to go out, and I was therefore free to attend Mme. Swann’s ‘kettledrum,’ I would find her dressed in one of her lovely gowns, some of which were of taffeta, others of gros-grain, or of velvet, or of crêpe-de-Chine, or satin or silk, gowns which, not being loose like those that she generally wore in the house but buttoned up tight as though she were just going out in them, gave to her stay-at-home laziness on those afternoons something alert and energetic. And no doubt the daring simplicity of their cut was singularly appropriate to her figure and to her movements, which her sleeves appeared to be symbolising in colours that varied from day to day: one would have said that there was a sudden determination in the blue velvet, an easy-going good humour in the white taffeta, and that a sort of supreme discretion full of dignity in her way of holding out her arm had, in order to become visible, put on the appearance, dazzling with the smile of one who had made great sacrifices, of the black crêpe-de-Chine. But at the same time these animated gowns took from the complication of their trimmings, none of which had any practical value or served any conceivable purpose, something detached, pensive, secret, in harmony with the melancholy which Mme. Swann never failed to shew, at least in the shadows under her eyes and the drooping arches of her hands. Beneath the profusion of sapphire charms, enamelled four-leaf clovers, silver medals, gold medallions, turquoise amulets, ruby chains and topaz chestnuts there would be, on the dress itself, some design carried out in colour which pursued across the surface of an inserted panel a preconceived existence of its own, some row of little satin buttons, which buttoned nothing and could not be unbuttoned, a strip of braid that sought to please the eye with the minuteness, the discretion of a delicate reminder; and these, as well as the trinkets, had the effect — for otherwise there would have been no possible justification of their presence — of disclosing a secret intention, being a pledge of affection, keeping a secret, ministering to a superstition, commemorating a recovery from sickness, a granted wish, a love affair or a ‘philippine.’ And now and then in the blue velvet of the bodice a hint of ‘slashes,’ in the Henri II style, in the gown of black satin a slight swelling which, if it was in the sleeves, just below the shoulders, made one think of the ‘leg of mutton’ sleeves of 1830, or if, on the other hand, it was beneath the skirt, with its Louis XV paniers, gave the dress a just perceptible air of being ‘fancy dress’ and at all events, by insinuating beneath the life of the present day a vague reminiscence of the past, blended with the person of Mme. Swann the charm of certain heroines of history or romance. And if I were to draw her attention to this: “I don’t play golf,” she would answer, “like so many of my friends. So I should have no excuse for going about, as they do, in sweaters.”

    In the confusion of her drawing-room, on her way from shewing out one visitor, or with a plateful of cakes to ‘tempt’ another, Mme. Swann as she passed by me would take me aside for a moment: “I have special instructions from Gilberte that you are to come to luncheon the day after to-morrow. As I wasn’t sure of seeing you here, I was going to write to you if you hadn’t come.” I continued to resist. And this resistance was costing me steadily less and less, because, however much one may love the poison that is destroying one, when one has compulsorily to do without it, and has had to do without it for some time past, one cannot help attaching a certain value to the peace of mind which one had ceased to know, to the absence of emotion and suffering. If one is not altogether sincere in assuring oneself that one does not wish ever to see again her whom one loves, one would not be a whit more sincere in saying that one would like to see her. For no doubt one can endure her absence only when one promises oneself that it shall not be for long, and thinks of the day on which one shall see her again, but at the same time one feels how much less painful are those daily recurring dreams of a meeting immediate and incessantly postponed than would be an interview which might be followed by a spasm of jealousy, with the result that the news that one is shortly to see her whom one loves would cause a disturbance which would be none too pleasant. What one procrastinates now from day to day is no longer the end of the intolerable anxiety caused by separation, it is the dreaded renewal of emotions which can lead to nothing. How infinitely one prefers to any such interview the docile memory which one can supplement at one’s pleasure with dreams, in which she who in reality does not love one seems, far from that, to be making protestations of her love for one, when one is by oneself; that memory which one can contrive, by blending gradually with it a portion of what one desires, to render as pleasing as one may choose, how infinitely one prefers it to the avoided interview in which one would have to deal with a creature to whom one could no longer dictate at one’s pleasure the words that one would like to hear on her lips, but from whom one would meet with fresh coldness, unlooked-for violence. We know, all of us, when we no longer love, that forgetfulness, that even a vague memory do not cause us so much suffering as an ill-starred love. It was of such forgetfulness that in anticipation I preferred, without acknowledging it to myself, the reposeful tranquillity

    Moreover, whatever discomfort there may be in such a course of psychical detachment and isolation grows steadily less for another reason, namely that it weakens while it is in process of healing that fixed obsession which is a state of love. Mine was still strong enough for me to be able to count upon recapturing my old position in Gilberte’s estimation, which in view of my deliberate abstention must, it seemed to me, be steadily increasing; in other words each of those calm and melancholy days on which I did not see her, coming one after the other without interruption, continuing too without prescription (unless some busy-body were to meddle in my affairs), was a day not lost but gained. Gained to no purpose, it might be, for presently they would be able to pronounce that I was healed. Resignation, modulating our habits, allows certain elements of our strength to be indefinitely increased. Those — so wretchedly inadequate — that I had had to support my grief, on the first evening of my rupture with Gilberte, had since multiplied to an incalculable power. Only, the tendency which everything that exists has to prolong its own existence is sometimes interrupted by sudden impulses to which we give way with all the fewer scruples over letting ourselves go since we know for how many days, for how many months even we have been able, and might still be able to abstain. And often it is when the purse in which we hoard our savings is nearly full that we undo and empty it, it is without waiting for the result of our medical treatment and when we have succeeded in growing accustomed to it that we abandon it. So, one day, when Mme. Swann was repeating her familiar statement of what a pleasure it would be to Gilberte to see me, thus putting the happiness of which I had now for so long been depriving myself, as it were within arm’s length, I was stupefied by the realisation that it was still possible for me to enjoy that pleasure, and I could hardly wait until next day, when I had made up my mind to take Gilberte by surprise, in the evening, before dinner

    What helped me to remain patient throughout the long day that followed was another plan that I had made. From the moment in which everything was forgotten, in which I was reconciled to Gilberte, I no longer wished to visit her save as a lover. Every day she should receive from me the finest flowers that grew. And if Mme. Swann, albeit she had no right to be too severe a mother, should forbid my making a daily offering of flowers, I should find other gifts, more precious and less frequent. My parents did not give me enough money for me to be able to buy expensive things. I thought of a big bowl of old Chinese porcelain which had been left to me by aunt Léonie, and of which Mamma prophesied daily that Françoise would come running to her with an “Oh, it’s all come to pieces!” and that that would be the end of it. Would it not be wiser, in that case, to part with it, to sell it so as to be able to give Gilberte all the pleasure I could. I felt sure that I could easily get a thousand francs for it. I had it tied up in paper; I had grown so used to it that I had ceased altogether to notice it; parting with it had at least the advantage of making me realise what it was like. I took it with me as I started for the Swanns’, and, giving the driver their address, told him to go by the Champs-Elysées, at one end of which was the shop of a big dealer in oriental things, who knew my father. Greatly to my surprise he offered me there and then not one thousand but ten thousand francs for the bowl. I took the notes with rapture. Every day, for a whole year, I could smother Gilberte in roses and lilac. When I left the shop and got into my cab again the driver (naturally enough, since the Swanns lived out by the Bois) instead of taking the ordinary way began to drive me along the Avenue des Champs-Elysées. He had just passed the end of the Rue de Berri when, in the failing light, I thought I saw, close to the Swanns’ house but going in the other direction, going away from it, Gilberte, who was walking slowly, though with a firm step, by the side of a young man with whom she was conversing, but whose face I could not distinguish. I stood up in the cab, meaning to tell the driver to stop; then hesitated. The strolling couple were already some way away, and the parallel lines which their leisurely progress was quietly drawing were on the verge of disappearing in the Elysian gloom. A moment later, I had reached Gilberte’s door. I was received by Mme. Swann. “Oh! she will be sorry!” was my greeting, “I can’t think why she isn’t in. She came home just now from a lesson, complaining of the heat, and said she was going out for a little fresh air with another girl.” “I fancy I passed her in the Avenue des Champs-Elysées.” “Oh, I don’t think it can have been. Anyhow, don’t mention it to her father; he doesn’t approve of her going out at this time of night. Must you go? Good-bye.” I left her, told my driver to go home the same way, but found no trace of the two walking figures. Where had they been? What were they saying to one another in the darkness so confidentially?

    I returned home, desperately clutching my windfall of ten thousand francs, which would have enabled me to arrange so many pleasant surprises for that Gilberte whom now I had made up my mind never to see again. No doubt my call at the dealer’s had brought me happiness by allowing me to expect that in future, whenever I saw my friend, she would be pleased with me and grateful. But if I had not called there, if my cabman had not taken the Avenue des Champs-Elysées, I should not have seen Gilberte with that young man. Thus a single action may have two contradictory effects, and the misfortune that it engenders cancel the good fortune that it has already brought one. There had befallen me the opposite of what so frequently happens. We desire some pleasure, and the material means of obtaining it are lacking. “It is a mistake,” Labruyère tells us, “to be in love without an ample fortune.” There is nothing for it but to attempt a gradual elimination of our desire for that pleasure. In my case, however, the material means had been forthcoming, but at the same moment, if not by a logical effect, at any rate as a fortuitous consequence of that initial success, my pleasure had been snatched from me

    As, for that matter, it seems as though it must always be. As a rule, however, not on the same evening on which we have acquired what makes it possible. Usually, we continue to struggle and to hope for a little longer. But the pleasure can never be realised. If we succeed in overcoming the force of circumstances, nature at once shifts the battle-ground, placing it within ourselves, and effects a gradual change in our heart until it desires something other than what it is going to obtain. And if this transposition has been so rapid that our heart has not had time to change, nature does not, on that account, despair of conquering us, in a manner more gradual, it is true, more subtle, but no less efficacious. It is then, at the last moment, that the possession of our happiness is wrested from us, or rather it is that very possession which nature, with diabolical cleverness, uses to destroy our happiness. After failure in every quarter of the domain of life and action, it is a final incapacity, the mental incapacity for happiness, that nature creates in us. The phenomenon, of happiness either fails to appear, or at once gives way to the bitterest of reactions

    I put my ten thousand francs in a drawer. But they were no longer of any use to me. I ran through them, as it happened, even sooner than if I had sent flowers every day to Gilberte, for when evening came I was always too wretched to stay in the house and used to go and pour out my sorrows upon the bosoms of women whom I did not love. As for seeking to give any sort of pleasure to Gilberte, I no longer thought of that; to visit her house again now could only have added to my sufferings. Even the sight of Gilberte, which would have been so exquisite a pleasure only yesterday, would no longer have sufficed me. For I should have been miserable all the time that I was not actually with her. That is how a woman, by every fresh torture that she inflicts on us, increases, often quite unconsciously, her power over us and at the same time our demands upon her. With each injury that she does us, she encircles us more and more completely, doubles our chains — but halves the strength of those which hitherto we had thought adequate to bind her in order that we might retain our own peace of mind. Only yesterday, had I not been afraid of annoying Gilberte, I should have been content to ask for no more than occasional meetings, which now would no longer have contented me and for which I should now have substituted quite different terms. For in this respect love is not like war; after the battle is ended we renew the fight with keener ardour, which we never cease to intensify the more thoroughly we are defeated, provided always that we are still in a position to give battle. This was not my position with regard to Gilberte. Also I preferred, at first, not to see her mother again. I continued, it is true, to assure myself that Gilberte did not love me, that I had known this for ever so long, that I could see her again if I chose, and, if I did not choose, forget her in course of time. But these ideas, like a remedy which has no effect upon certain complaints, had no power whatsoever to obliterate those two parallel lines which I kept on seeing, traced by Gilberte and the young man as they slowly disappeared along the Avenue des Champs-Elysées. This was a fresh misfortune, which like the rest would gradually lose its force, a fresh image which would one day present itself to my mind’s eye completely purged of every noxious element that it now contained, like those deadly poisons which one can handle without danger, or like a crumb of dynamite which one can use to light one’s cigarette without fear of an explosion. Meanwhile there was in me another force which was striving with all its might to overpower that unwholesome force which still shewed me, without alteration, the figure of Gilberte walking in the dusk: to meet and to break the shock of the renewed assaults of memory, I had, toiling effectively on the other side, imagination. The former force did indeed continue to shew me that couple walking in the Champs-Elysées, and offered me other disagreeable pictures drawn from the past, as for instance Gilberte shrugging her shoulders when her mother asked her to stay and entertain me. But the other force, working upon the canvas of my hopes, outlined a future far more attractively developed than this poor past which, after all, was so restricted. For one minute in which I saw Gilberte’s sullen face, how many were there in which I planned to my own satisfaction all the steps that she was to take towards our reconciliation, perhaps even towards our betrothal. It is true that this force, which my imagination was concentrating upon the future, it was drawing, for all that, from the past. I was still in love with her whom, it is true, I believed that I detested. But whenever anyone told me that I was looking well, or was nicely dressed, I wished that she could have been there to see me. I was irritated by the desire that many people shewed about this time to ask me to their houses, and refused all their invitations. There was a scene at home because I did not accompany my father to an official dinner at which the Bontemps were to be present with their niece Albertine, a young girl still hardly more than a child. So it is that the different periods of our life overlap one another. We scornfully decline, because of one whom we love and who will some day be of so little account, to see another who is of no account to-day, with whom we shall be in love to-morrow, with whom we might, perhaps, had we consented to see her now, have fallen in love a little earlier and who would thus have put a term to our present sufferings, bringing others, it is true, in their place. Mine were steadily growing less. I had the surprise of discovering in my own heart one sentiment one day, another the next, generally inspired by some hope or some fear relative to Gilberte. To the Gilberte whom I kept within me. I ought to have reminded myself that the other, the real Gilberte, was perhaps entirely different from mine, knew nothing of the regrets that I ascribed to her, was thinking probably less about me, not merely than I was thinking about her but that I made her be thinking about me when I was closeted alone with my fictitious Gilberte, wondering what really were her feelings with regard to me and so imagining her attention as constantly directed towards myself

    During those periods in which our bitterness of spirit, though steadily diminishing, still persists, a distinction must be drawn between the bitterness which comes to us from our constantly thinking of the person herself and that which is revived by certain memories, some cutting speech, some word in a letter that we have had from her. The various forms which that bitterness can assume we shall examine when we come to deal with another and later love affair; for the present it must suffice to say that, of these two kinds, the former is infinitely the less cruel. That is because our conception of the person, since it dwells always within ourselves, is there adorned with the halo with which we are bound before long to invest her, and bears the marks if not of the frequent solace of hope, at any rate of the tranquillity of a permanent sorrow. (It must also be observed that the image of a person who makes us suffer counts for little if anything in those complications which aggravate the unhappiness of love, prolong it and prevent our recovery, just as in certain maladies the cause is insignificant beyond comparison with the fever which follows it and the time that must elapse before our convalescence.) But if the idea of the person whom we love catches and reflects a ray of light from a mind which is on the whole optimistic, it is not so with those special memories, those cutting words, that inimical letter (I received only one that could be so described from Gilberte); you would say that the person herself dwelt in those fragments, few and scattered as they were, and dwelt there multiplied to a power of which she falls ever so far short in the idea which we are accustomed to form of her as a whole. Because the letter has not — as the image of the beloved creature has — been contemplated by us in the melancholy calm of regret; we have read it, devoured it in the fearful anguish with which we were wrung by an unforeseen misfortune. Sorrows of this sort come to us in another way; from without; and it is along the road of the most cruel suffering that they have penetrated to our heart. The picture of our friend in our mind, which we believe to be old, original, authentic, has in reality been refashioned by her many times over. The cruel memory is not itself contemporary with the restored picture, it is of another age, it is one of the rare witnesses to a monstrous past. But inasmuch as this past continues to exist, save in ourselves, who have been pleased to substitute for it a miraculous age of gold, a paradise in which all mankind shall be reconciled, those memories, those letters carry us back to reality, and cannot but make us feel, by the sudden pang they give us, what a long way we have been borne from that reality by the baseless hopes engendered daily while we waited for something to happen. Not that the said reality is bound always to remain the same, though that does indeed happen at times. There are in our life any number of women whom we have never wished to see again, and who have quite naturally responded to our in no way calculated silence with a silence as profound. Only in their case as we never loved them, we have never counted the years spent apart from them, and this instance, which would invalidate our whole argument, we are inclined to forget when we are considering the healing effect of isolation, just as people who believe in presentiments forget all the occasions on which their own have not ‘come true.’

    But, after a time, absence may prove efficacious. The desire, the appetite for seeing us again may after all be reborn in the heart which at present contemns us. Only, we must allow time. Now the demands which we ourselves make upon time are no less exorbitant than those of a heart in process of changing. For one thing, time is the very thing that we are least willing to allow, for our own suffering is keen and we are anxious to see it brought to an end. And then, too, the interval of time which the other heart needs to effect its change our own heart will have spent in changing itself also, so that when the goal which we had set ourselves becomes attainable it will have ceased to count as a goal, or to seem worth attaining. This idea, however, that it will be attainable, that what, when it no longer spells any good fortune to us, we shall ultimately secure is not good fortune, this idea embodies a part, but a part only of the truth. Our good fortune accrues to us when we have grown indifferent to it. But the very fact of our indifference will have made us less exacting, and allow us in retrospect to feel convinced that we should have been in raptures over our good fortune had it come at a time when, very probably, it would have seemed to us miserably inadequate. People are not very hard to satisfy nor are they very good judges of matters in which they take no interest. The friendly overtures of a person whom we no longer love, overtures which strike us, in our indifference to her, as excessive, would perhaps have fallen a long way short of satisfying our love. Those tender speeches, that invitation or acceptance, we think only of the pleasure which they would have given us, and not of all those other speeches and meetings by which we should have wished to see them immediately followed, which we should, as likely as not, simply by our avidity for them, have precluded from ever happening. So that we can never be certain that the good fortune which comes to us too late, when we are no longer in love, is altogether the same as that good fortune the want of which made us, at one time, so unhappy. There is only one person who could decide that; our ego of those days; he is no longer with us, and were he to reappear, no doubt that would be quite enough to make our good fortune — whether identical or not — vanish

    Pending these posthumous fulfilments of a dream in which I should not, when the time came, be greatly interested, by dint of my having to invent, as in the days when I still hardly knew Gilberte, speeches, letters in which she implored my forgiveness, swore that she had never loved anyone but myself and besought me to marry her, a series of pleasant images incessantly renewed came by degrees to hold a larger place in my mind than the vision of Gilberte and the young man, which had nothing now to feed upon. At this point I should perhaps have resumed my visits to Mme. Swann but for a dream that came to me, in which one of my friends, who was not, however, one that I could identify, behaved with the utmost treachery towards me and appeared to believe that I had been treacherous to him. Abruptly awakened by the nain which this dream had given me, and finding that it persisted after I was awake, I turned my thoughts back to the dream, racked my brains to discover who could have been the friend whom I had seen in my sleep, the sound of whose name — a Spanish name — was no longer distinct in my ears. Combining Joseph’s part with Pharaoh’s, I set to work to interpret my dream. I knew that, when one is interpreting a dream, it is often a mistake to pay too much attention to the appearance of the people one saw in it, who may perhaps have been disguised or have exchanged faces, like those mutilated saints on the walls of cathedrals which ignorant archaeologists have restored, fitting the body of one to the head of another and confusing all their attributes and names. Those that people bear in a dream are apt to mislead us. The person with whom we are in love is to be recognised only by the intensity of the pain that we suffer. From mine I learned that, though transformed while I was asleep into a young man, the person whose recent betrayal still hurt me was Gilberte. I remembered then that, the last time I had seen her, on the day when her mother had forbidden her to go out to a dancing-lesson, she had, whether in sincerity or in make-believe, declined, laughing in a strange manner, to believe in the genuineness of my feeling for her. And by association this memory brought back to me another. Long before that, it had been Swann who would not believe in my sincerity, nor that I was a suitable friend for Gilberte. In vain had I written to him, Gilberte had brought back my letter and had returned it to me with the same incomprehensible laugh. She had not returned it to me at once: I remembered now the whole of that scene behind the clump of laurels. As soon as one is unhappy one becomes moral. Gilberte’s recent antipathy for me seemed to me a judgment delivered on me by life for my conduct that afternoon. Such judgments one imagines one can escape because one looks out for carriages when one is crossing the street, and avoids obvious dangers. But there are others that take effect within us. The accident comes from the side to which one has not been looking, from inside, from the heart. Gilberte’s words: “If you like, we might go on wrestling,” made me shudder. I imagined her behaving like that, at home perhaps, in the linen-room, with the young man whom I had seen escorting her along the Avenue des Champs-Elysées. And so, just as when, a little time back, I had believed myself to be calmly established in a state of happiness, it had been fatuous in me, now that I had abandoned all thought of happiness, to take for granted that at least I had grown and was going to remain calm. For, so long as our heart keeps enshrined with any permanence the image of another person, it is not only our happiness that may at any moment be destroyed; when that happiness has vanished, when we have suffered, and, later, when we have succeeded in lulling our sufferings to sleep, the thing then that is as elusive, as precarious as ever our happiness was, is our calm. Mine returned to me in the end, for the cloud which, lowering our resistance, tempering our desires, has penetrated, in the train of a dream, the enclosure of our mind, is bound, in course of time, to dissolve, permanence and stability being assured to nothing in this world, not even to grief. Besides, those whose suffering is due to love are, as we say of certain invalids, their own physicians. As consolation can come to them only from the person who is the cause of their grief, and as their grief is an emanation from that person, it is there, in their grief itself, that they must in the end find a remedy: which it will disclose to them at a given moment, for as long as they turn it over in their minds this grief will continue to shew them fresh aspects of the loved, the regretted creature, at one moment so intensely hateful that one has no longer the slightest desire to see her, since before finding enjoyment in her company one would have first to make her suffer, at another so pleasant that the pleasantness in which one has invested her one adds to her own stock of good qualities and finds in it a fresh reason for hope. But even although the anguish that had reawakened in me did at length grow calm, I no longer wished — except just occasionally — to visit Mme. Swann. In the first place because, among those who love and have been forsaken, the state of incessant — even if unconfessed — expectancy in which they live undergoes a spontaneous transformation, and, while to all appearance unchanged, substitutes for its original elements others that are precisely the opposite. The first were the consequences of — a reaction from — the painful incidents which had upset us. The tension of waiting for what is yet to come is mingled with fear, all the more since we desire at such moments, should no message come to us from her whom we love, to act for ourselves, and are none too confident of the success of a step which, once we have taken it, we may find it impossible to follow up. But presently, without our having noticed any change, this tension, which still endures, is sustained, we discover, no longer by our recollection of the past but by anticipation of an imaginary future. From that moment it is almost pleasant. Besides, the first state, by continuing for some time, has accustomed us to living in expectation. The suffering that we felt during those last meetings survives in us still, but is already lulled to sleep. We are in no haste to arouse it, especially as we do not see very clearly what to ask for now. The possession of a little more of the woman whom we love would only make more essential to us the part that we did not yet possess, which is bound to remain, whatever happens, since our requirements are begotten of our satisfactions, an irreducible quantity

    Another, final reason came later on to reinforce this, and to make me discontinue altogether my visits to Mme. Swann. This reason, slow in revealing itself, was not that I had now forgotten Gilberte but that I must make every effort to forget her as speedily as possible. No doubt, now that the keen edge of my suffering was dulled, my visits to Mme. Swann had become once again, for what sorrow remained in me, the sedative and distraction which had been so precious to me at first. But what made the sedative efficacious made the distraction impossible, namely that with these visits the memory of Gilberte was intimately blended. The distraction would be of no avail to me unless it was employed to combat a sentiment which the presence of Gilberte no longer nourished, thoughts, interests, passions in which Gilberte should have no part. These states of consciousness, to which the person whom we love remains a stranger, then occupy a place which, however small it may be at first, is always so much reconquered from the love that has been in unchallenged possession of our whole soul. We must seek to encourage these thoughts, to make them grow, while the sentiment which is no more now than a memory dwindles, so that the new elements introduced into our mind contest with that sentiment, wrest from it an ever increasing part of our soul, until at last the victory is complete. I decided that this was the only way in which my love could be killed, and I was still young enough, still courageous enough to undertake the attempt, to subject myself to that most cruel grief which springs from the certainty that, whatever time one may devote to the effort, it will prove successful in the end. The reason I now gave in my letters to Gilberte for refusing to see her was an allusion to some mysterious misunderstanding, wholly fictitious, which was supposed to have arisen between her and myself, and as to which I had hoped at first that Gilberte would insist upon my furnishing her with an explanation. But, as a matter of fact, never, even in the most insignificant relations in life, does a request for enlightenment come from a correspondent who knows that an obscure, untruthful, incriminating sentence has been written on purpose, so that he shall protest against it, and is only too glad to feel, when he reads it, that he possesses — and to keep in his own hands — the initiative in the coming operations. For all the more reason is this so in our more tender relations, in which love is endowed with so much eloquence, indifference with so little curiosity. Gilberte having never appeared to doubt nor sought to learn more about this misunderstanding, it became for me a real entity, to which I referred anew in every letter. And there is in these baseless situations, in the affectation of coldness, a sort of fascination which tempts one to persevere in them. By dint of writing: “Now that our hearts are sundered,” so that Gilberte might answer: “But they are not. Do explain what you mean,” I had gradually come to believe that they were. By constantly repeating, “Life may have changed for us, it will never destroy the feeling that we had for one another,” in the hope of hearing myself, one day, say: “But there has been no change, the feeling is stronger now than ever it was,” I was living with the idea that life had indeed changed, that we should keep only the memory of a feeling which no longer existed, as certain neurotics, from having at first pretended to be ill, end by becoming chronic invalids. Now, whenever I had to write to Gilberte, I brought my mind back to this imagined change, which, being now tacitly admitted by the silence which she preserved with regard to it in her replies, would in future subsist between us. Then Gilberte ceased to make a point of ignoring it. She too adopted my point of view; and, as in the speeches at official banquets, when the foreign Sovereign who is being entertained adopts practically the same expressions as have just been used by the Sovereign who is entertaining him, whenever I wrote to Gilberte: “Life may have parted us; the memory of the days when we knew one another will endure,” she never failed to respond: “Life may have parted us; it cannot make us forget those happy hours which will always be dear to us both,” (though we should have found it hard to say why or how ‘Life’-had parted us, or what change had occurred). My sufferings were no longer excessive. And yet, one day when I was telling her in a letter that I had heard of the death of our old barley-sugar woman in the Champs-Elysées, as I wrote the words: “I felt at once that this would distress you, in me it awakened a host of memories,” I could not restrain myself from bursting into tears when I saw that I was speaking in the past tense, as though it were of some dead friend, now almost forgotten, of this love of which in spite of myself I had never ceased to think as of a thing still alive, or one that at least might be born again. Nothing can be more affectionate than this sort of correspondence between friends who do not wish to see one another any more. Gilberte’s letters to me had all the delicate refinement of those which I used to write to people who did not matter, and shewed me the same apparent marks of affection, which it was so pleasant for me to receive from her

    But, as time went on, every refusal to see her disturbed me less. And as she became less dear to me, my painful memories were no longer strong enough to destroy by their incessant return the growing pleasure which I found in thinking of Florence, or of Venice. I regretted, at such moments, that I had abandoned the idea of diplomacy, and had condemned myself to a sedentary existence, in order not to be separated from a girl whom I should not see again and had already almost forgotten. We construct our house of life to suit another person, and when at length it is ready to receive her that person does not come; presently she is dead to us, and we live on, a prisoner within the walls which were intended only for her. If Venice seemed to my parents to be a long way off, and its climate treacherous, it was at least quite easy for me to gov without tiring myself, and settle down at Balbec. But to do that I should have had to leave Paris, to forego those visits thanks to which, infrequent as they were, I might sometimes hear Mme. Swann telling me about her daughter. Besides, I was beginning to find in them various pleasures in which Gilberte had no part

    When spring drew round, and with it the cold weather, during an icy Lent and the hailstorms of Holy Week, as Mme. Swann began to find it cold in the house, I used often to see her entertaining her guests in her furs, her shivering hands and shoulders hidden beneath the gleaming white carpet of an immense rectangular muff and a cape, both of ermine, which she had not taken off on coming in from her drive, and which suggested the last patches of the snows of winter, more persistent than the rest, which neither the heat of the fire nor the advancing season had succeeded in melting. And the whole truth about these glacial but already flowering weeks was suggested to me in this drawing-room, which soon I should be entering no more, by other more intoxicating forms of whiteness, that for example of the guelder-roses clustering, at the summits of their tall bare stalks, like the rectilinear trees in pre-Raphaelite paintings, their balls of blossom, divided yet composite, white as annunciating angels and breathing a fragrance as of lemons. For the mistress of Tansonville knew that April, even an ice-bound April, was not barren of flowers, that winter, spring, summer are not held apart by barriers as hermetic as might be supposed by the town-dweller who, until the first hot day, imagines the world as containing nothing but houses that stand naked in the rain. That Mme. Swann was content with the consignments furnished by her Combray gardener, that she did not, by the intervention of her own ‘special’ florist, fill up the gaps left by an insufficiently powerful magic with subsidies borrowed from a precocious Mediterranean shore, I do not for a moment suggest, nor did it worry me at the time. It was enough to fill me with longing for country scenes that, overhanging the loose snowdrifts of the muff in which Mme. Swann kept her hands, the guelder-rose snow-balls (which served very possibly in the mind of my hostess no other purpose than to compose, on the advice of Bergotte, a ‘Symphony in White’ with her furniture and her garments) reminded me that what the Good Friday music in Parsifal symbolised was a natural miracle which one could see performed every year, if one had the sense to look for it, and, assisted by the acid and heady perfume of the other kinds of blossom, which, although their names were unknown to me, had brought me so often to a standstill to gaze at them on my walks round Combray, made Mme. Swann’s drawing-room as virginal, as candidly ‘in bloom,’ without the least vestige of greenery, as overladen with genuine scents of flowers as was the little lane by Tansonville

    But it was still more than I could endure that these memories should be recalled to me. There was a risk of their reviving what little remained of my love for Gilberte. Besides, albeit I no longer felt the least distress during these visits to Mme. Swann, I extended the intervals between them and endeavoured to see as little of her as possible. At most, since I continued not to go out of Paris, I allowed myself an occasional walk with her. Fine weather had come at last, and the sun was hot. As I knew that before luncheon Mme. Swann used to go out every day for an hour, and would stroll for a little in the Avenue du Bois, near the Etoile — a spot which, at that time, because of the people who used to collect there to gaze at the ‘swells’ whom they knew only by name, was known as the ‘Shabby-Genteel Club’— I persuaded my parents, on Sundays (for on weekdays I was busy all morning), to let me postpone my luncheon until long after theirs, until a quarter past one, and go for a walk before it. During May, that year, I never missed a Sunday, for Gilberte had gone to stay with friends in the country. I used to reach the Arc de Triomphe about noon. I kept watch at the entrance to the Avenue, never taking my eyes off the corner of the side-street along which Mme. Swann, who had only a few yards to walk, would come from her house. As by this time many of the people who had been strolling there were going home to luncheon, those who remained were few in number and, for the most part, fashionably dressed. Suddenly, on the gravelled path, unhurrying, cool, luxuriant, Mme. Swann appeared, displaying around her a toilet which was never twice the same, but which I remember as being typically mauve; then she hoisted and unfurled at the end of its long stalk, just at the moment when her radiance was most complete, the silken banner of a wide parasol of a shade that matched the showering petals of her gown. A whole troop of people escorted her; Swann himself, four or five fellows from the Club, who had been to call upon her that morning or whom she had met in the street: and their black or grey agglomeration, obedient to her every gesture, performing the almost mechanical movements of a lifeless setting in which Odette was framed, gave to this woman, in whose eyes alone was there any intensity, the air of looking out in front of her, from among all those men, as from a window behind which she had taken her stand, and made her emerge there, frail but fearless, in the nudity of her delicate colours, like the apparition of a creature of a different species, of an unknown race, and of almost martial strength, by virtue of which she seemed by herself a match for all her multiple escort. Smiling, rejoicing in the fine weather, in the sunshine which had not yet become trying, with the air of calm assurance of a creator who has accomplished his task and takes no thought for anything besides; certain that her clothes — even though the vulgar herd should fail to appreciate them — were the smartest anywhere to be seen, she wore them for herself and for her friends, naturally, without exaggerated attention to them but also without absolute detachment; not preventing the little bows of ribbon upon her bodice and skirt from floating buoyantly upon the air before her, like separate creatures of whose presence there she was not unconscious, but was indulgent enough to let them play if they chose, keeping their own rhythm, provided that they accompanied her where she led the way; and even upon her mauve parasol, which, as often as not, she had not yet ‘put up’ when she appeared on the scene, she let fall now and then, as though upon a bunch of Parma violets, a gaze happy and so kindly that, when it was fastened no longer upon her friends but on some inanimate object, her eyes still seemed to smile. She thus kept open, she made her garments occupy that interval of smartness, of which the men with whom she was on the most familiar terms respected both the existence and its necessity, not without shewing a certain deference, as of profane visitors to a shrine, an admission of their own ignorance, an interval over which they recognised that their friend had (as we recognise that a sick man has over the special precautions that he has to take, or a mother over her children’s education) a competent jurisdiction. No less than by the court which encircled her and seemed not to observe’ the passers-by, Mme. Swann by the lateness of her appearance there at once suggested those rooms in which she had spent so long, so leisurely a morning and to which she must presently return for luncheon; she seemed to indicate their proximity by the unhurrying ease of her progress, like the turn that one takes up and down one’s own garden; of those rooms one would have said that she was carrying about her still the cool, the indoor shade. But for that very reason the sight of her gave me only a stronger sensation of open air and warmth. All the more because, being assured in my own mind that, in accordance with the liturgy, with the ritual in which Mme. Swann was so profoundly versed, her clothes were connected with the time of year and of day by a bond both inevitable and unique, I felt that the flowers upon the stiff straw brim of her hat, the baby-ribbons upon her dress, had been even more naturally born of the month of May than the flowers in gardens and in woods; and to learn what latest change there was in weather or season I had not to raise my eyes higher than to her parasol, open and outstretched like another, a nearer sky, round, clement, mobile, blue. For these rites, if they were of sovereign importance, subjugated their glory (and, consequently, Mme. Swann her own) in condescending obedience to the day, the spring, the sun, none of which struck me as being sufficiently flattered that so elegant a woman had been graciously pleased not to ignore their existence, and had chosen on their account a gown of a brighter, of a thinner fabric, suggesting to me, by the opening of its collar and sleeves, the moist warmness of the throat and wrists that they exposed — in a word, had taken for them all the pains that a great personage takes who, having gaily condescended to pay a visit to common folk in the country, whom everyone, even the most plebeian, knows, yet makes a point of donning, for the occasion, suitable attire. On her arrival I would greet Mme. Swann, she stop me and say (in English) ‘Good morning,’ and smile. We would walk a little way together. And I learned then that these canons according to which she dressed, it was for her own satisfaction that she obeyed them, as though yielding to a Superior Wisdom of which she herself was High Priestess: for if it should happen that, feeling too warm, she threw open or even took off altogether and gave me to carry the jacket which she had intended to keep buttoned up, I would discover in the blouse beneath it a thousand details of execution which had had every chance of remaining there unperceived, like those parts of an orchestral score to which the composer has devoted infinite labour albeit they may never reach the ears of the public: or in the sleeves of the jacket that lay folded across my arm I would see, I would drink in slowly, for my own pleasure or from affection for its wearer, some exquisite detail, a deliciously tinted strip, a lining of mauve satinette which, ordinarily concealed from every eye, was yet just as delicately fashioned as the outer parts, like those gothic carvings on a cathedral, hidden on the inside of a balustrade eighty feet from the ground, as perfect as are the bas-reliefs over the main porch, and yet never seen by any living man until, happening to pass that way upon his travels, an artist obtains leave to climb up there among them, to stroll in the open air, sweeping the whole town with a comprehensive gaze, between the soaring towers

    What enhanced this impression that Mme. Swann was walking in the Avenue as though along the paths of her own garden, was — for people ignorant of her habit of ‘taking exercise’— that she had come there on foot, without any carriage following, she whom, once May had begun, they were accustomed to see, behind the most brilliant ‘turn-out,’ the smartest liveries in Paris, gently and majestically seated, like a goddess, in the balmy air of an immense victoria on eight springs. On foot Mme. Swann had the appearance — especially as her pace began to slacken in the heat of the sun — of having yielded to curiosity, of committing an ‘exclusive’ breach of all the rules of her code, like those Crowned Heads who, without consulting anyone, accompanied by the slightly scandalised admiration of a suite which dares not venture any criticism, step out of their boxes during a gala performance and visit the lobby of the theatre, mingling for a moment or two with the rest of the audience. So between Mme. Swann and themselves the crowd felt that there existed those barriers of a certain kind of opulence which seem to them the most insurmountable that there are. The Faubourg Saint-Germain may have its barriers also, but these are less ‘telling’ to the eyes and imagination of the ‘shabby-genteel.’ These latter, when in the presence of a real personage, more simple, more easily mistaken for the wife of a small professional or business man, less remote from the people, will not feel the same sense of their own inequality, almost of their unworthiness, as dismays them when they encounter Mme. Swann. Of course women of that sort are not themselves dazzled, as the crowd are, by the brilliance of their apparel, they have ceased to pay any attention to it, but only because they have grown used to it, that is to say have come to look upon it more and more as natural and necessary, to judge their fellow creatures according as they are more or less initiated into these luxurious ways: so that (the grandeur which they allow themselves to display or discover in others being wholly material, easily verified, slowly acquired, the lack of it hard to compensate) if such women place a passer-by in the lowest rank of society, it is by the same instinctive process that has made them appear to him as in the highest, that is to say instinctively, at first sight, and without possibility of appeal. Perhaps that special class of society which included in those days women like Lady Israels, who mixed with the women of the aristocracy, and Mme. Swann, who was to get to know them later on, that intermediate class, inferior to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, since it ‘ran after’ the denizens of that quarter, but superior to everything that was not of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, possessing this peculiarity that, while already detached from the world of the merely rich, it was riches still that it represented, but riches that had been canalised, serving a purpose, swayed by an idea that was artistic, malleable gold, chased with a poetic design, taught to smile; perhaps that class — in the same form, at least, and with the same charm — exists no longer. In any event, the women who were its members would not satisfy to-day what was the primary condition on which they reigned, since with advancing age they have lost — almost all of them — their beauty. Whereas it was (just as much as from the pinnacle of her noble fortune) from the glorious zenith of her ripe and still so fragrant summer that Mme. Swann, majestic, smiling, kind, as she advanced along the Avenue du Bois, saw like Hypatia, beneath the slow tread of her feet, worlds revolving. Various young men as they passed looked at her anxiously, not knowing whether their vague acquaintance with her (especially since, having been introduced only once, at the most, to Swann, they were afraid that he might not remember them) was sufficient excuse for their venturing to take off their hats. And they trembled to think of the consequences as they made up their minds, asking themselves whether the gesture, so bold, so sacrilegious a tempting of providence, would not let loose the catastrophic forces of nature or bring down, upon them the vengeance of a jealous god. It provoked only, like the winding of a piece of clockwork, a series of gesticulations from little, responsive bowing figures, who were none other than Odette’s escort, beginning with Swann himself, who raised his tall hat lined in green leather with an exquisite courtesy, which he had acquired in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, but to which was no longer wedded the indifference that he would at one time have shewn. Its place was now taken (as though he had been to some extent permeated by Odette’s prejudices) at once by irritation at having to acknowledge the salute of a person who was none too well dressed and by satisfaction at his wife’s knowing so many people, a mixed sensation to which he gave expression by saying to the smart friends who walked by his side: “Whatl another! Upon my word, I can’t imagine where my wife picks all these fellows up!” Meanwhile, having greeted with a slight movement of her head the terrified youth, who had already passed out of sight though his heart was still beating furiously, Mme. Swann turned to me: “Then it’s all over?” she put it to me, “You aren’t ever coming to see Gilberte again? I’m glad you make an exception of me, and are not going to ‘drop’ me straight away. I like seeing you, but I used to like also the influence you had over my daughter. I’m sure she’s very sorry about it, too. However, I mustn’t bully you, or you’ll make up your mind at once that you never want to set eyes on me again.” “Odette, Sagan’s trying to speak to you!” Swann called his wife’s attention. And there, indeed, was the Prince, as in some transformation scene at the close of a play, or in a circus, or an old painting, wheeling his horse round so as to face her, in a magnificent heroic pose, and doffing his hat with a sweeping theatrical and, so to speak, allegorical flourish in which he displayed all the chivalrous courtesy of a great noble bowing in token of his respect for Woman, were she incarnate in a woman whom it was impossible for his mother or his sister to know. And at every moment, recognised in the depths of the liquid transparency and of the luminous glaze of the shadow which her parasol cast over her, Mme. Swann was receiving the salutations of the last belated horsemen, who passed as though in a cinematograph taken as they galloped in the blinding glare of the Avenue, men from the clubs, the names of whom, which meant only celebrities to the public, Antoine de Castellane, Adalbert de Montmorency and the rest — were for Mme. Swann the familiar names of friends. And as the average span of life, the relative longevity of our memories of poetical sensations is much greater than that of our memories of what the heart has suffered, long after the sorrows that I once felt on Gilberte’s account have faded and vanished, there has survived them the pleasure that I still derive — whenever I close my eyes and read, as it were upon the face of a sundial, the minutes that are recorded between a quarter past twelve and one o’clock in the month of May — from seeing myself once again strolling and talking thus with Mme. Swann beneath her parasol, as though in the coloured shade of a wistaria bower",Marcel Proust,Billy Ray Cyrus With Miley Cyrus,2008,"[43, 41, 38, 37, 38, 40, 46, 43, 42, 53]",10

And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (That I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

[Bridge: Rihanna & Ne-Yo, Both]
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (Hmm)

416,Stay,"[Verse 1]
I've been sitting here staring at the clock on the wall
And I've been laying here praying, praying she won't call
It's just another call from home
And you'll get it and be gone
And I'll be crying
And I'll be begging you, baby
Beg you not to leave
But I'll be left here waiting
With my heart on my sleeve
Oh, for the next time we'll be here
Seems like a million years
And I think I'm dying
What do I have to do to make you see
She can't love you like me?

[Chorus]
Why don't you stay?
I'm down on my knees
I'm so tired of being lonely
Don't I give you what you need?
When she calls you to go
There is one thing you should know
We don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay?

[Verse 2]
You keep telling me, baby
There will come a time
When you will leave her arms
And forever be in mine
But I don't think that's the truth
And I don't like being used and I'm tired of waiting
It's too much pain to have to bear
To love a man you have to share

[Chorus]
Why don't you stay?
I'm down on my knees
I'm so tired of being lonely
Don't I give you what you need?
When she calls you to go
There is one thing you should know
We don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay?

[Verse 3]
I can't take it any longer
But my will is getting stronger
And I think I know just what I have to do
I can't waste another minute
After all that I've put in it
I've given you my best
Why does she get the best of you
So next time you find you wanna leave her bed for mine

[Chorus]
Why don't you stay?
I'm up off my knees
I'm so tired of being lonely
You can't give me what I need
When she begs you not to go
There is one thing you should know
I don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay, yeah?",Sugarland,Sugarland,2008,"[72, 68, 62, 55, 45, 37, 36, 39, 41, 44]",10

Some days I spend a little extra time in the morning
Dress to impress you

419,Crank That (Soulja Boy),"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Oh, oh oh
Swa-na-na-na-na
The mighty cyclone

[Chorus: Mickael]
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
The mighty cyclone

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
Now look at that dumper on the back of that bumper
She ain't even playing when she shaking that rumpa
And, oh, you ain't know? She get lower than a muffler
Either with her girlfriends or showstoppin' with her hustler
The way she move her body, she might see the Maserati
She wanna put it on me, tryin' to show me her tsunami
She make it hard to copy, always tight and never sloppy
And got an entourage and her own paparazzi
Now, there she go again, ridin' through the stormy weather
You better button up, if you wanna go get her
Cause it is what it is, everybody wanna love her
But when she pop it, boy, you better run for cover

[Chorus: Mickael]
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
The mighty cyclone

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
It's a rap when she breakin' boys off the typhoon (It's a rap)
Gotta get that feta like a boss tycoon (It's a rap)
Now hold it steady, cause she make a monsoon (It's a rap)
Now you can Google, download to iTunes
See, what I'm sayin', she ain't playin'
Bet she got them heads turnin'
You gon' hear it clack-clack when them heels get to burnin'
Stiletto so fuego, she got her own label
And got us all doin' her tomato

[Chorus: Mickael]
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone

Shawty got looks and shawty got class
Shawty got hips and shawty got ass
When she hit the stage, she drop it down low like
Ay, this is crazy, it's amazing
She must be the one, the lady

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long

424,You Know I'm No Good,"[Verse 1]
Meet you downstairs, in the bar and hurt
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say ""What did you do with him today?""
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 2]
Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and pitta
You say, ""When we married""
'cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 3]
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soap my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble

425,What Do Ya Think About That,"I heard it through the grapevine
My new neighbor don't like my big red barn
A '47 Ford, bullet holes in the door
Broke down motor in the front yard
I got half a mind to paint a plywood sign
And nail it up on a knotty pine tree
Saying I was here first
This is my piece of dirt
And your rambling don't rattle me

Some people care about what other people think
Worry about what they say
Let a little gossip
Coming from a loose lip ruin a perfect day
Saying blah, blah, blah, just a jacking their jaws
Gotta let it roll off-a my back
I don't give a dern what other people think
What do ya think about that

I wear what I want to, overalls, work boots
Crank my music up loud
Like to sling a little mud in my four wheel drive
Trek it all into town

Shot a little eight ball down at the pool hall
Drink a beer with my friends
Now don't judge me and I won't judge you
Cause we all get judged in the end

Some people care about what other people think
Worry about what they say
Let a little gossip
Coming from a loose lip ruin a perfect day
Saying blah, blah, blah, just a jacking their jaws
Gotta let it roll off-a my back
I don't give a dern what other people think
What do ya think about that

Some people care about what other people think

It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now

And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore you're nothing more
I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like
It's easy if you do it right
Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

Or a seat a table with a jug of black label when a 12-pack won't quite do

Well Jo the bartender, she's a mighty good friender and she likes my company
When she says ""last call for alcohol"" that won't apply much to me

This is the clock upon the wall
This is the story of us all
This is the first sound of a newborn child
Before he starts to crawl
This is the war that's never won
This is a soldier and his gun
This is the mother waiting by the phone
Praying for her son

[Chorus]
Pictures of you, pictures of me
Hung upon your wall for the world to see
Pictures of you, pictures of me
Remind us all of what we used to be

[Verse 2]
There is a drug that cures it all
Blocked by the governmental wall
We are the scientists inside the lab
Just waiting for the call
This earthquake weather has got me shaking inside
I'm high up and dry

[Chorus]
Pictures of you, pictures of me
Hung upon your wall for the world to see
Pictures of you, pictures of me
Remind us all of what we used to be

[Bridge]
Confess to me, every secret moment
Every stolen promise you believed
Confess to me, all that lies between us
All that lies between you and me

We are the boxers in the ring
We are the bells that never sing
There is a title we can't win no matter
How hard we might swing

Pictures of you, pictures of me
Hung upon your wall for the world to see
Pictures of you, pictures of me
Remind us all of what we could have been
Pictures of you, pictures of me
Hung upon your wall for the world to see
Pictures of you, pictures of me
Remind us all of what we could have been

Could have been, we could have been
Pictures of you, pictures of me

Who's that stumblin'
around in the dark?

3
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:25,806
State your business, or
prepare to get winged!

4
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:30,605
Calm yourselves gentlemen,
I mean you no harm.

5
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:35,173
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.

6
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,327
Good cold evening gentlemen,

7
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:41,977
I'm looking for a
pair of slave traders

8
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:43,736
that go by the name
of the Speck Brothers.

9
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:45,610
Might that be you?

10
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,166
Who wants to know?

11
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:49,716
Well, I do.

12
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,634
I'm Dr. King Schultz,
this is my horse, Fritz.

13
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:55,251
What kinda doctor?

14
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:56,698
Dentist.

15
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:58,487
Now are you the Speck Brothers,

16
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:01,299
and did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?

17
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:02,233
So what?

18
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:04,325
So, I wish to parley with you.

19
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,426
Speak English.

20
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,430
Oh, I'm sorry.

21
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,031
Please forgive me, it
is a second language.

22
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:13,653
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,

23
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:15,706
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

24
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:18,180
Hello you poor devils!

25
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:25,511
Is there one amongst you, who was formerly
a resident of The Carrucan Plantation?

26
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:28,815
I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.

27
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:31,322
Who said that?

28
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,998
What's your name?

29
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,511
Django.

30
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:28,704
Then you're exactly
the one I'm looking for.

31
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:32,720
Do you know who the
Brittle Brothers are?

32
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,184
Who are they?

33
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:41,736
Big John...

34
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,025
Ellis...

35
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:48,630
and Raja... sometime
they call him Lit'le Raj.

36
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:52,269
They was overseers at
Carrucan plantation.

37
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:53,597
Not anymore.

38
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:57,977
Tell me...

39
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:02,392
If you were to see any of these three
gentlemen again, would you recognize them?

40
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:03,591
Hey!

41
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:05,590
Stop talk with 'em like that.

42
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:06,935
Like what?

43
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,169
Like that!

44
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:11,113
My good man, I'm simply
trying to ascertain-

45
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:12,777
Speak English, goddammit!

46
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:15,182
Everybody calm down,

47
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:19,204
I'm simply a customer trying
to conduct a transaction.

48
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:21,076
I don't care. No sale.

49
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,139
Now off wit' you!

50
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,561
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
o'course they're for sale.

51
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:27,294
Move it.

52
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:32,783
My good man, did you simply get
carried away with your dramatic gesture,

53
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:36,728
or are you pointing your weapon
at me with lethal intention?

54
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,930
Last chance, fancy pants.

55
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:42,825
Oh, very well...

56
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:14,514
I'm sorry to have put
a bullet in your beast,

57
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,655
but I didn't want you
to do anything rash

58
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,229
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

59
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:22,319
Goddamn son of a bitch!

60
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,616
You shot Roscoe!

61
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:27,011
And you killed Ace!

62
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:30,274
Hey, I only shot your brother
once he threatened to shoot me.

63
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,336
And I do believe I have

64
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:36,610
one, two, three, four, five
witnesses who can attest to that fact.

65
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:38,462
Damn legs busted!

66
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,326
No doubt. Now, if you can keep
your caterwauling down to a minimum,

67
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:45,406
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.

68
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,651
God fucking dammit!

69
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,260
As I was saying,

70
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:57,127
if you were to see the Brittle Brothers
again, you could recognize them?

71
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:58,925
Yeah.

72
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:01,940
Sold American! So Mr. Speck,

73
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:04,948
Mr. Speck, how much
for young Django here?

74
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,668
That iron is nasty business.

75
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:20,622
Could you hold this for a moment?

76
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:25,411
Thank you. Django,
get up on that horse.

77
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:32,251
Also if I were you, I'd take that winter
coat the dear departed Speck left behind.

78
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:49,731
Nigger, don't you
touch my brother's coat!

79
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:03,366
Goddammit!

80
00:10:07,547 --> 00:10:10,490
One hundred... ten...

81
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:14,835
twenty... and five...

82
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:17,085
for young Django here.

83
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:21,997
And since you won't be needing it anymore,
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

84
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:27,446
Also... Mr. Speck, I am afraid
I will require a bill of sale.

85
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:28,941
Do you have one?

86
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:31,792
You go to hell, dentist!

87
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:34,194
I thought not.

88
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:36,425
No worries!

89
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:38,074
I come prepared.

90
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:44,248
Thank you.

91
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,406
This will serve nicely
as a bill of sale.

92
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,420
Now as to you poor devils...

93
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:14,184
So as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,

94
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:17,329
you gentlemen have two choices.

95
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:22,629
One: once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,

96
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:24,530
then carry him to the nearest town.

97
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:28,277
Which would be at least thirty-seven
miles back the way you came.

98
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:30,243
Or Two:

99
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,601
You could unshackle yourselves...

100
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:37,152
take that rifle, put a bullet in
his head, bury the two of them deep,

101
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:40,567
and then make your way to a more
enlightened area of this country.

102
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:42,825
The choice is yours.

103
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,679
Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

104
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:50,366
the North Star is that one.

105
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,041
Tata.

106
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:13,811
Now wait a minute fellas,
let's talk about this.

107
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:20,997
You gotta be reasonable
on a situation like this.

108
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,774
I'm not a bad guy, look
I'm just doing my job!

109
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:29,231
Blueberry, didn't I
give you my last apple?

110
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:34,654
Tell you what boys, take me to Lit'le
Duck in El Paso, I'll get you your freedom.

111
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,621
No. No, please...

112
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,061
What's everybody staring at?

113
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:04,179
They never seen a
nigger on a horse before.

114
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:28,888
Good morning inn keeper!

115
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:32,700
Two beers for two weary travelers.

116
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,995
Ah, it's still a bit early.

117
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:37,229
We won't be open for another hour.

118
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:39,633
By then we'll be servin' breakfast.

119
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:42,407
Wow wow wow wow!

120
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:44,723
What the hell you
think you doin', boy?

121
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:47,081
Get that nigger outta here.

122
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:53,972
Help! Help!

123
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:55,241
Inn keeper!

124
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:58,853
Remember, get the
sheriff, not the marshall.

125
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:02,106
Alas...

126
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:06,397
Now we must act as our own bartender.

127
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,010
Sit down, my boy.

128
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:22,332
What kinda dentist are you?

129
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,126
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

130
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:35,747
These days I practice
a new profession.

131
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:40,441
Bounty Hunter.

132
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,418
D'you know what a Bounty Hunter is?

133
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:49,719
No.

134
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,930
Well...

135
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:56,675
The way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

136
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:59,038
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

137
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:06,788
Prost.

138
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:17,961
The state places a
bounty on a man's head,

139
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,302
I track that man, I find
that man, I kill that man,

140
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:25,642
after I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities,

141
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:27,860
and sometimes that's
easier said then done,

142
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,769
I show that corpse to the
authorities proving, yes indeed,

143
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:35,391
I truly have killed him, at which
point the authorities pay me the bounty.

144
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:39,695
So... like slavery, it's
a flesh-for-cash business.

145
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:42,482
What's a bounty?

146
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,538
It's like a reward.

147
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:50,828
You kill people and
they give you a reward?

148
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,919
Certain people, yeah.

149
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:54,019
Bad people?

150
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:55,272
Aah!

151
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,331
Badder they are, bigger the reward!

152
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,968
Which brings me to you.

153
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:04,030
And I must admit that I'm at a bit
of a quandary when it comes to you.

154
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:07,442
On one hand, I despise slavery.

155
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:09,520
On the other hand...

156
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:13,844
I need your help, if you're not in
a position to refuse, all the better.

157
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:19,607
So for the time being, I'm gonna make
this slave malarkey work to my benefit.

158
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:23,472
Still... having said that...

159
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,868
I feel guilty.

160
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,252
So...

161
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:32,393
I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

162
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,846
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

163
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:49,621
However I've had this endeavor, I'm
- I'm at a slight disadvantage,

164
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,049
in so far as, I don't
know what they look like.

165
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:56,232
But you do... don't you?

166
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,866
I know what they
look like, all right.

167
00:17:59,008 --> 00:17:59,693
Good.

168
00:18:00,573 --> 00:18:01,905
So here's my agreement.

169
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,874
You travel with me
until we find them-

170
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:05,952
Where we goin'?

171
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:10,210
I hear at least two of them are overseeing
up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.

172
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:15,921
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find them.

173
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:17,591
And when we find them...

174
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:20,833
you point them out, and I kill them!

175
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,713
You do that, I agree to
give you your freedom,

176
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:30,080
twenty-five dollars per Brittle
brother -that's seventy-five dollars,

177
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:34,281
and as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

178
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:44,819
Okay boys, fun's over.

179
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:47,699
Come on out.

180
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:54,258
All right folks, calm down.

181
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:56,883
You bout your business.

182
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:00,054
The jokers will be gone soon.

183
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:03,034
Now...

184
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:07,302
why y'all wanna come into
my town and start trouble,

185
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:10,724
and... scare all these nice people?

186
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,847
You ain't got nothin' better to do,

187
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:21,232
than to come into Bill
Sharp's town and show your ass?

188
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,297
What did you jus' do to our sheriff?

189
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:46,382
Now you can get the marshall.

190
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,265
Marshall, marshall!

191
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:51,740
Should we wait inside?

192
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,019
Can't we just leave?

193
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,449
After you.

194
00:19:56,426 --> 00:20:00,658
Move that buckboard long ways
'cross the street from the saloon!

195
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:03,006
I want six men, six
riffles behind it.

196
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,334
I want two men, two
rifles up on this roof,

197
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:07,994
two men two rifles on that roof.

198
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,055
All the barrels aimed
at that front door.

199
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:14,998
Somebody git poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

200
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,452
You in the saloon!

201
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:21,351
We got a hundred riffles aimed
on every way outta that buildin'!

202
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:25,137
You got once chance
git outta this alive!

203
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,164
You and your nigger come out right
now with your hands over your head,

204
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,347
and I mean, right now!

205
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:35,734
Is this the marshall I have
the pleasure of addressing?

206
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,336
Yes it is.

207
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:39,856
This is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.

208
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,192
That wunderbar, marshall.

209
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:46,299
I have relieved
myself of all weapons,

210
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,448
and just as you have instructed,

211
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:52,399
I am ready to step outside,

212
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:56,407
with my hands raised above my head.

213
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:58,677
I trust,

214
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:03,818
as a representative of the criminal justice
system of The United States of America,

215
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:06,641
I shan't be shot down in the street,

216
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:09,833
by either you or your deputies,

217
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:12,474
before I've had my day in court.

218
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,776
You mean like you did our sheriff?

219
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,278
Shot 'em down like
a dog in the street!

220
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,675
Yes, that's exactly what I mean!

221
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:21,847
Do I have your word as a lawman,

222
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:25,058
not to shoot me down
like a dog in the street?

223
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,191
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy
seein' somethin' like that,

224
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:35,083
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

225
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:38,753
Fair enough marshall, here we come!

226
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,333
They're a little tense out there.

227
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:47,292
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.

228
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:49,946
Come ahead.

229
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,218
You unarmed?

230
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,593
Yes indeed we are.

231
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:04,160
Marshall Tatum, may I
address you and your deputies,

232
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:06,618
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,

233
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,142
as to the incident
that just occurred?

234
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:11,277
Go on.

235
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:15,167
My name is Dr. King Schultz,

236
00:22:15,178 --> 00:22:18,274
and like yourself, marshall,
I am a servant of the court.

237
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:20,418
The man lying dead in the dirt,

238
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:24,225
who the good people of Daughtrey
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,

239
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:26,341
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

240
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:30,831
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

241
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,588
with a price on his head
of two hundred dollars.

242
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:36,533
Now, that's two hundred
dollars, dead or alive.

243
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:38,553
The hell you say!

244
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:42,308
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

245
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:45,841
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff

246
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:48,333
sometime in the last two years.

247
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:52,737
I know this because three years ago,

248
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:57,688
he was rustling cattle from the B. C.
Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas.

249
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,695
Now this is a warrant,

250
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:07,023
made out by circuit court Judge Henry
Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas.

251
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,253
You're encouraged to wire him.

252
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:11,331
He'll back up who I am,

253
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:14,359
and who your dear
departed sheriff was.

254
00:23:22,675 --> 00:23:24,175
In other words marshall,

255
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:26,245
you owe me two hundred dollars.

256
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:36,691
I'll be damned.

257
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:07,740
After this Brittle
business is behind us...

258
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:10,468
you'll be a free man.

259
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:14,858
With a horse, seventy five
dollars in your back pocket.

260
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,719
What's your plan after that?

261
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:22,148
Find my wife...

262
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:24,492
and buy her freedom.

263
00:24:26,677 --> 00:24:27,928
Django...

264
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:31,245
I had no idea you were a married man.

265
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:34,353
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

266
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:37,313
Me and my wife do.

267
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,228
All men in Carrucan did,
and that's why we uh...

268
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:42,467
we run off.

269
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,170
Django...

270
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,065
Django, Django...

271
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:50,683
You got sand, Django.

272
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:53,609
Boy's got sand.

273
00:24:55,852 --> 00:24:58,842
I got no use for niggers with sand.

274
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:03,605
I want you to burn the runaway
""r"" right here on his cheek.

275
00:25:04,494 --> 00:25:06,494
And the girl too.

276
00:25:07,444 --> 00:25:10,355
And I want you to take 'em
to the Greenville auction,

277
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,199
and sell 'em...

278
00:25:12,864 --> 00:25:14,264
Both of 'em...

279
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,520
Separately.

280
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:21,227
And this one...

281
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,577
you will sell him cheap.

282
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,442
In Greenville?

283
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,927
There should be some
sort of a records office.

284
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:43,914
You know when she was sold...

285
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,830
you know where she came from...

286
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,855
and you know her name.

287
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:53,128
What is her name?

288
00:25:53,723 --> 00:25:54,835
Broomhilda.

289
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:57,442
What?

290
00:25:57,784 --> 00:25:59,344
Broom-hilda.

291
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:01,633
- Broomhilda?
- Hm-hm.

292
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:05,576
Were her owners German?

293
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:07,186
Yeah, how you know?

294
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:11,165
She wan't born on The Carrucan Plantation,
she was raised by a German mistress.

295
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:12,360
Von Shafts.

296
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:13,807
She speak a little German too.

297
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:16,044
- Your wife?
- Hm-hm.

298
00:26:16,352 --> 00:26:20,013
When she was little, her mistress taught
her so she has somebody speak German with.

299
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:23,516
Alright, let me get this straight.

300
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:28,964
Your slave wife speaks German, and
her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

301
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:29,906
Yep.

302
00:26:34,324 --> 00:26:36,019
They call me Hildi.

303
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,550
When we gain access
to these plantations,

304
00:26:57,105 --> 00:26:59,456
we'll be putting on an ""Act"".

305
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,307
You'll be playing a character.

306
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:11,522
Hm?

307
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:13,389
No?

308
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,544
But during the act, you
can never break character.

309
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:27,729
D'you understand?

310
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:30,837
Yeah. Don't break character.

311
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:36,895
And you character is
that of the ""Valet"".

312
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:39,194
What that is?

313
00:27:40,421 --> 00:27:42,521
That's a fancy word for servant.

314
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:44,498
- ""Valet"".
- Hm-hm!

315
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:49,970
And now Django, you may chose
your character's costume.

316
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,297
You want that I pick
up my own clothes?

317
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:56,531
You
- but of course!

318
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:33,460
It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.

319
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:36,896
This is my valet, my
valet does not walk.

320
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,623
I said niggers on horses-

321
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:44,046
His name is Django, he's a free
man, he can ride what he pleases.

322
00:28:44,118 --> 00:28:45,743
Not on my property.

323
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:47,686
Not around my niggers he can't.

324
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:49,963
My good sir...

325
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,998
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

326
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,769
Allow me to unring this bell.

327
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:59,691
My name is Dr. King Schultz,
this is my valet Django,

328
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:02,490
and these are our
horses Tony and Fritz.

329
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:07,036
Mr. Bennett,

330
00:29:07,523 --> 00:29:12,187
I've been lead to believe that you
are a gentleman, and a business man.

331
00:29:12,476 --> 00:29:15,473
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas

332
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,656
to Tennessee to parley with you now.

333
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:22,737
I wish to purchase one
of your nigger gals.

334
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:29,586
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals?

335
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:31,693
No appointment, no nuttin'?

336
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,506
Oh, I'm afraid so.

337
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:38,096
Well what if I had to say I don't
like you, or your fancy pants nigger,

338
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:40,179
and I wouldn't sell
you a tinkers damn.

339
00:29:40,923 --> 00:29:42,648
Now what'cha gotta say about that?

340
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,184
Mr. Bennett,

341
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:51,489
if you are the business man I've
been led to believe you to be,

342
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:56,289
I have five thousand things, I might
say, that could change your mind.

343
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:04,285
Well com'on inside, and get
yourself somethin' cool to drink.

344
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:06,913
- Huh?
- Hm-hm.

345
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:20,859
Oh maybe, while we discuss business,

346
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:23,296
you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures

347
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:26,222
to escort Django here around
your magnificent grounds.

348
00:30:26,361 --> 00:30:28,604
Oh, absolutely! Eh, Betina!

349
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:29,675
Yessir, Big Daddy?

350
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:32,013
Eh... What's your Jimmie name again?

351
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,849
- Django.
- Django.

352
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:36,527
Betina sugar, could
you take Django there,

353
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:39,746
and take him around the grounds here
to show him all the pretty stuff.

354
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:41,207
As you please, Big Daddy.

355
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:42,378
Oh, Mr. Bennett,

356
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:47,618
I must remind you Django is a free
man. He cannot be treated like a slave.

357
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:51,352
Within the bounds of good taste, he must
be treated as an extension of myself.

358
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,611
Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?

359
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:54,427
Yes, sir?

360
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:56,607
Django isn't a slave.

361
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,544
Django is a free man. You understand?

362
00:31:00,673 --> 00:31:03,196
You can't treat him like any of
these other niggers around here,

363
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:06,027
cause he ain't like any of these
other niggers around here. Ya got it?

364
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:09,036
You wan' I should treat
him like white folks?

365
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:10,161
No.

366
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,254
That's not what I said.

367
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,891
Then I don't know
what'cha want, Big Daddy.

368
00:31:15,496 --> 00:31:17,704
Yes... I can see that.

369
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:19,106
Uh...

370
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:24,074
What's the name of that peckawood boy
from town that works with the glass?

371
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:26,666
His mama works at the lumber yard.

372
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:28,127
Oh, you mean Jerry.

373
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,913
That's the boy's name, Jerry!

374
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:31,374
You know Jerry, don't you sugar?

375
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:32,686
Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

376
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:34,561
Well that's it then...

377
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,362
You just treat 'em
like you would Jerry.

378
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:47,359
The house we just left
from, is the big house.

379
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:50,417
Big daddy call it
that, cause it's big.

380
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,816
That there is the pantry.

381
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:56,798
That's where Bid Daddy
hang out his day meat.

382
00:31:57,687 --> 00:31:59,662
Full o'squirrels.

383
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:03,771
What'cha do for your massa'?

384
00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:05,840
Didn't you hear him
tell ya I ain't no slave?

385
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:07,105
So you really free?

386
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:08,352
Yes. I as free.

387
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,869
You mean you wanna dress like that?

388
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,074
Betina, I need to ask you something.

389
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,332
What'cho want?

390
00:32:15,353 --> 00:32:17,012
I'm lookin' for three white men.

391
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:20,311
Three brothers, overseers. Their
name is Brittle. Do you know 'em?

392
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,225
Brittle?

393
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,676
Yes, Brittle. John
Brittle, Ellis Brittle,

394
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,637
Roger Brittle. Sometime
called Li'le Raj.

395
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,199
I don't know dem.

396
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:30,795
They could be usin' a different name.

397
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:33,300
They would have come to the
plantation this past year.

398
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:35,029
You mean The Shaffers?

399
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:37,157
Maybe. Three brother?

400
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:38,345
Ah-huh.

401
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:40,392
- Are they
here? - Ah-huh.

402
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:42,231
Could you point one of 'em out to me?

403
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:44,836
Well one's over in that field.

404
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,155
Old man Carrucan ain't going to
appreciate this now, she- she-

405
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:03,159
she work in a house, John,
you could mess her skin up,

406
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:04,557
and you gonna mess it up,
she ain't gonna be worth no-

407
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:06,080
she ain't gonna worth a damn thing.

408
00:33:06,101 --> 00:33:07,309
Like the bible say...

409
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,016
Look, I told you, I was
the one to make her do it.

410
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,469
You're ready?

411
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:18,764
She the one who went up for me and,
thing about you we gettin' whipped now,

412
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,199
that should be me! That should be me
John, I been here long enough, you know me!

413
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:23,814
You know me a long time, now!

414
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,411
You know master Carrugen
ain't gonna appreciate this!

415
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:37,271
She's
- she's a house slave!

416
00:33:41,261 --> 00:33:44,696
#Looking for freedom

417
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,280
#Looking for freedom ah-aah

418
00:34:00,818 --> 00:34:01,938
Please, please now.

419
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:04,594
If this what you want, to keep me
funny fighting for each other, please...

420
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:14,225
I like the way you beg, boy.

421
00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:19,716
Is that who you was lookin' for?

422
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:22,880
Yep.

423
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:25,525
Where the other two of 'em?

424
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,321
They by the stable, punishin'
Little Jody for breakin' eggs.

425
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,248
They whippin' Little Jody?

426
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:33,651
Point me in that direction.

427
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,176
You go to that tree,
and keep goin' that way.

428
00:34:42,276 --> 00:34:44,676
Go git that white
man I came here with.

429
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:48,331
Com'on now. Com'on, Jody!

430
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:51,716
Let me all... get you set up!

431
00:34:51,778 --> 00:34:54,283
And the Lord said the fear of ye...

432
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,358
and the dread of ye...

433
00:34:57,499 --> 00:34:59,903
shall be on every beast of here.

434
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:04,354
Hey, gimme that of what?
You better gimme that arm,

435
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:06,486

436
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,566
Okay, she ready!

437
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:43,093
And after this, we'll see
if you break eggs again.

438
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:47,828
John Brittle!

439
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:10,529
Remember me?

440
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,013
I like the way you die, boy!

441
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,032
Goddamn
son-of-a-bitch!

442
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:19,594
Ya'all wanna see somethin'?

443
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:23,551
Ooh no!

444
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:36,283
Who are they?

445
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:39,720
That's Big John, and
that's little Raj.

446
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:41,252
Where's Ellis?

447
00:37:41,813 --> 00:37:44,217
He's the one hightailin' it
across that field right now.

448
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:50,418
- You sure that's him?
- Yeah.

449
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,402
- Positive?
- I dunno.

450
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:55,033
- You don't know if you're positive?
- I don't know what positive means.

451
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:56,073
It means you're sure.

452
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,206
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

453
00:37:57,261 --> 00:37:58,822
Yes I'm sure it is Ellis Brittle.

454
00:38:12,104 --> 00:38:13,924
I'm positive he dead.

455
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:19,917
Django!

456
00:38:21,694 --> 00:38:24,105
Everybody calm down,

457
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,496
we mean no one else any harm.

458
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:28,292
Who are you two jokers?

459
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,271
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative

460
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:34,675
of the criminal justice system
of the United States of America,

461
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:38,338
the man to my left is Django
Freeman, he's my deputy.

462
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:41,030
In my pocket is a warrant

463
00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:45,448
signed by circuit court judge Henry
Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas,

464
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:50,120
for the arrest and
capture, dead or alive, of

465
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:54,599
John Brittle, Roger
Brittle, and Ellis Brittle.

466
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:57,013
They've gone by the name Shaffer.

467
00:38:58,183 --> 00:39:02,214
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers real name was Brittle.

468
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:05,989
These are wanted men. The
law wants them for murder.

469
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:10,395
Now I reiterate, the
warrant states dead or alive,

470
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:13,705
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

471
00:39:13,822 --> 00:39:17,241
we were operating within
our legal boundaries.

472
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:19,772
I realize...

473
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:22,768
passions are high,

474
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:24,963
but I must warn you,

475
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:28,336
the penalty for taking deadly
force against a office of the court

476
00:39:28,353 --> 00:39:30,389
in the performance of his duty is,

477
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,055
you will be hung by the
neck until you're dead.

478
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:41,266
May I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

479
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:44,951
Gimmie.

480
00:40:01,096 --> 00:40:02,421
Satisfied?

481
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:10,904
May I have that back, please?

482
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,825
Get off my land.

483
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:19,492
Post haste.

484
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:23,655
Load up the bodies
as quickly as you can,

485
00:40:23,665 --> 00:40:25,533
and let's get out of here.

486
00:40:50,678 --> 00:40:51,798
Hell...

487
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:54,390
That's 'em sonsabitches.

488
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:54,526
Now unless they start shootin'
first... nobody shoot 'em.

489
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,868
That's way too simple
for these jokers.

490
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,649
We're gonna whip that
nigger lover to death.

491
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,521
And I'm gonna personally strip
and clip that garboon myself.

492
00:42:09,855 --> 00:42:10,975
Damn...

493
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,031
I can't see fuckin'
shit outta this thing.

494
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,196
We ready, or what?

495
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:20,295
Ah hold on, I'm fuckin'
with my eye holes.

496
00:42:21,562 --> 00:42:22,536
Oh shit.

497
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,825
I just made it worse.

498
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Who made this goddamn shit?

499
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,976
Willard's wife.

500
00:42:28,055 --> 00:42:29,990
WÐµll mÐ°kÐµ yÐ¾u Ð¾wn
gÐ¾ddÐ°mn mÐ°Ñ•kÑ•!

501
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:33,906
Look, nobody's sayin' they
don't appreciate what Jenny did.

502
00:42:33,938 --> 00:42:36,469
Well if all I hadda do
was cut a hole in a bag,

503
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:38,430
I coulda cut it better than this.

504
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,910
How 'bout you Robert, can you see?

505
00:42:41,317 --> 00:42:42,728
Not too good.

506
00:42:42,908 --> 00:42:47,190
I mean, if I don't move my head, I
can see pretty good, more or less.

507
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:50,945
But when I start ridin', the bag's
moving all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

508
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:52,382
Oh shit!

509
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,421
I just made mine worse.

510
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:59,755
Anybody bring any extra bags?

511
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,153
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

512
00:43:02,357 --> 00:43:03,903
I'm just asking.

513
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:05,901
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

514
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:07,534
Oh well Shitfire!

515
00:43:07,591 --> 00:43:10,635
If you don't wear 'em as you ride
up, that just defeats the purpose.

516
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:12,500
Well I can't see in
this fucking thing!

517
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:15,678
I can't breathe in this fucking thing,
and I can't ride in this fucking thing!

518
00:43:15,724 --> 00:43:17,724
Well fuck all y'all, I'm going home!

519
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,449
Ya know I watched
my wife work all day

520
00:43:20,512 --> 00:43:24,368
gettin' thirty bags to get ready
for you ungrateful sonsabitches,

521
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:27,994
and all I hear is criticize,
criticize, criticize.

522
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:31,689
From now on, don't ask
me or mine for nothin'!

523
00:43:32,757 --> 00:43:33,877
Now look...

524
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:35,762
Let's not forget why we're here.

525
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,595
We gotta killer nigger
over that hill there.

526
00:43:39,103 --> 00:43:40,595
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

527
00:43:40,629 --> 00:43:41,924
Okay, I'm confused.

528
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:43,746
Are the bags on or off.

529
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:49,681
I think... we all think...
the bags was a nice idea.

530
00:43:49,709 --> 00:43:50,712
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

531
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:54,788
But not pointing 'ny fingers,
they could have been done better.

532
00:43:55,961 --> 00:43:59,036
So how about... no bags this time,

533
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:04,781
but next time, we do the bags
right, and then we go full regalia.

534
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,944
I get my bag off.

535
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:08,163
Wait a minute!

536
00:44:08,538 --> 00:44:10,007
I didn't say no bags.

537
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:12,353
But nobody can see.

538
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:13,772
So?

539
00:44:13,937 --> 00:44:16,069
So, it be nice to see.

540
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:18,546
Goddamit! This is a raid!

541
00:44:18,851 --> 00:44:21,747
I can't see, you can't see. So what?

542
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:24,317
All that matters is can
the fuckin' horse see!

543
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:25,797
That's a raid!

544
00:44:29,997 --> 00:44:31,117
Where's this shit!

545
00:44:32,163 --> 00:44:33,283
There he is!

546
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:35,895
Get that nigger out
from under 'at wagon.

547
00:44:36,366 --> 00:44:38,449
And get that nigger
lover out o'the wagon!

548
00:44:38,604 --> 00:44:39,746
That nigger ain't down here!

549
00:44:39,801 --> 00:44:40,921
- They're gone!
- What?

550
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,689
- They tricked us!
- Well where are they?

551
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:44,369
Auf wiedersehen.

552
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:53,899
Bull time.

553
00:44:56,481 --> 00:44:57,601
We get 'em now.

554
00:45:02,736 --> 00:45:04,468
Cowards tend to do that.

555
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,670
Goddammit!

556
00:45:18,822 --> 00:45:20,015
Would you care to?

557
00:45:27,236 --> 00:45:29,017
I can't see shit out of this...

558
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:30,874
He's getting away.

559
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:31,803
I got 'em.

560
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:35,522
Big Daddy's getting away.

561
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:37,129
I got 'em.

562
00:45:52,146 --> 00:45:53,221
Got 'em.

563
00:45:59,211 --> 00:46:00,810
For kids, ain't that short.

564
00:46:11,886 --> 00:46:14,886
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters were German?

565
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:17,353
Broomhilda is a German name.

566
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:20,595
If they named her, it stands
to reason they'd be German.

567
00:46:21,093 --> 00:46:23,286
Lots of gals where you
from named Broomhilda?

568
00:46:23,973 --> 00:46:26,966
Broomhilda is the name of a character

569
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:30,582
in the most popular of
all the German legends.

570
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:33,228
There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?

571
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,533
Oh yes, there is.

572
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:42,468
Do you know it?

573
00:46:42,615 --> 00:46:44,390
Every German knows that story.

574
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:52,891
Would you like me to tell you?

575
00:46:54,027 --> 00:46:55,269
Well...

576
00:46:56,054 --> 00:46:59,684
Broomhilda was a... princess.

577
00:47:01,575 --> 00:47:06,361
She was the daughter of
Wotan, the god of all gods.

578
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:10,114
Anyway, her father
is really mad at her.

579
00:47:10,213 --> 00:47:11,773
What she do?

580
00:47:12,716 --> 00:47:16,364
I can't exactly remember. I think
she disobeys him in some way.

581
00:47:17,065 --> 00:47:20,367
So he puts her on
top of the mountain.

582
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:22,178
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

583
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:25,662
It's a German legend, there's always
going to be a mountain in there somewhere.

584
00:47:26,186 --> 00:47:30,183
And he puts a fire breathing
dragon there to guard the mountain.

585
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:34,373
And he surrounds her...

586
00:47:34,926 --> 00:47:37,662
in a circle of hellfire.

587
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,442
And there, Broomhilda shall remain,

588
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:49,840
unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

589
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,419
Does a fella arise?

590
00:47:52,535 --> 00:47:55,341
Yes Django. As a
matter of fact, he does.

591
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:57,886
A fella named Sigfried.

592
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,140
Does Sigfried save her?

593
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:04,055
Quite spectacularly so.

594
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:09,779
He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

595
00:48:10,052 --> 00:48:13,846
He slays the dragon, because
he's not afraid of him.

596
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,008
And he walks through hellfire...

597
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:21,672
because Broomhilda's worth it.

598
00:48:25,576 --> 00:48:27,376
I know how he feel.

599
00:48:28,798 --> 00:48:31,798
I think I'm just
starting to realize that.

600
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:41,371
Now... Look... Django...

601
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:48,212
I don't doubt that one day
you will save your lady love.

602
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,731
But I can't let you go to
Greenville in a good conscious.

603
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:58,225
Slave Washington, in Mississippi,
isn't a place for you to visit.

604
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:00,921
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

605
00:49:04,582 --> 00:49:06,782
But let me ask you a question.

606
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:16,385
How do you like the
bounty hunting business?

607
00:49:18,149 --> 00:49:20,093
Kill white folks, and
they pay you for it?

608
00:49:21,304 --> 00:49:22,448
What's not to like?

609
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:25,101
And I have to admit,
we make a good team.

610
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:28,133
I thought you was mad at me for
killin' Big John and Lit'le Raj?

611
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:30,426
Yeah, on that occasion,
you were a tad overzealous,

612
00:49:30,528 --> 00:49:32,048
but normally, that's a good thing.

613
00:49:33,423 --> 00:49:35,627
How'd you like to
partner up for the winter?

614
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,630
What'd ya mean partner up?

615
00:49:38,172 --> 00:49:41,827
You work with me through the
winter till the snow melts.

616
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:45,574
I give you a third of my bounties.

617
00:49:46,465 --> 00:49:50,212
So we make some money this
winter, and when the snow melts,

618
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:56,531
I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
we'll find where they sent your wife.

619
00:50:01,106 --> 00:50:02,806
Why you care what happen to me?

620
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:06,440
Why you care if I find my wife?

621
00:50:06,855 --> 00:50:08,255
Frankly...

622
00:50:09,652 --> 00:50:12,312
I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

623
00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:16,032
And now that I have, I feel
vaguely responsible for you.

624
00:50:17,463 --> 00:50:20,837
Plus when a German meets a real life
Sigfried, that's kind of a big deal.

625
00:50:23,715 --> 00:50:26,298
As a German, I'm obliged to help you

626
00:50:26,306 --> 00:50:28,979
on your quest to rescue
your beloved Broomhilda.

627
00:52:46,617 --> 00:52:50,958
Ooh, what happened to mister ""I
wanna shoot white folks for money""?

628
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:52,901
His son's with him.

629
00:52:53,243 --> 00:52:56,018
Well good. He'll have
a loved one with him.

630
00:52:56,409 --> 00:52:58,404
Maybe even share a last word.

631
00:53:00,841 --> 00:53:02,639
That's better then most of them get,

632
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:05,029
and a damn sight
better then he deserves.

633
00:53:13,495 --> 00:53:15,141
Put down the rifle.

634
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:19,164
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

635
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,065
Just take out Smitty
Bacall's handbill.

636
00:53:26,558 --> 00:53:27,782
Read it aloud.

637
00:53:28,924 --> 00:53:30,946
Consider that today's lesson.

638
00:53:33,198 --> 00:53:35,664
Wanted, dead or alive.

639
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,289
Smitty Bacall and
the Smitty Bacall...

640
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:42,493
gang.

641
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,969
For murder and stagecoach ro...

642
00:53:48,532 --> 00:53:49,652
robbery.

643
00:53:50,181 --> 00:53:51,835
Seven zero zero ze-

644
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:52,663
Seven thousand.

645
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:54,499
- Seven-
- Thousand.

646
00:53:54,827 --> 00:53:58,457
""Seven thousand dollars
for Smitty Bacall,

647
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:05,221
one thousand and five hundred
dollars for each of his gang

648
00:54:07,374 --> 00:54:08,944
- memb...
- members.

649
00:54:09,687 --> 00:54:14,153
Known members of the Smitty
Bacall Gang are as fellows,

650
00:54:14,466 --> 00:54:15,895
- follows.
- follows.

651
00:54:16,637 --> 00:54:19,603
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and...

652
00:54:21,457 --> 00:54:22,939
Crazy Craig Koons.

653
00:54:24,158 --> 00:54:26,884
That is who Smitty Bacall is.

654
00:54:27,156 --> 00:54:29,864
If Smitty Bacall wanted to
start a farm at twenty-two,

655
00:54:29,872 --> 00:54:31,932
they would never have printed that.

656
00:54:32,393 --> 00:54:35,750
But Smitty Bacall wanted
to rob stagecoaches,

657
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:38,643
and he didn't mind
killing people to do it.

658
00:54:39,252 --> 00:54:42,460
D'you want to save your
wife by doing what I do?

659
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,012
This is what I do.

660
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:48,653
I kill people, and sell
their corpses for cash.

661
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:52,681
This corpse is worth
seven thousand dollars.

662
00:54:53,635 --> 00:54:55,995
Now quit your
pussyfootin' and shoot him.

663
00:55:06,122 --> 00:55:07,299
Pa?

664
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,768
Pa!

665
00:55:17,433 --> 00:55:18,553
Here...

666
00:55:19,137 --> 00:55:21,298
You need to keep this
Smitty Bacall handbill.

667
00:55:21,427 --> 00:55:22,197
Why?

668
00:55:22,354 --> 00:55:23,664
It's good luck.

669
00:55:23,797 --> 00:55:26,523
You always keep the handbill
of your first bounty.

670
00:56:14,568 --> 00:56:16,364
That's accurate.

671
00:57:24,212 --> 00:57:26,928
Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?

672
00:57:28,366 --> 00:57:30,031
Who the hell have you got there?

673
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,629
The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

674
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:35,758
Who the hell is the
Wilson-Lowe Gang?

675
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,982
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby
Lowe, and three of their acolytes.

676
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:42,357
Huh.

677
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,052
Well just leave 'em out here,
they ain't goin' nowhere.

678
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:48,955
Let's comin' outta the snowy
snow and git yourself some coffee.

679
00:57:49,555 --> 00:57:52,080
Had a birthday
yesterday, got some cake!

680
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,818
Pretty good.

681
00:58:15,974 --> 00:58:17,589
Move along!

682
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:24,665
Do it, walk!

683
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:28,585
Keep moving.

684
00:58:32,324 --> 00:58:35,124
Don't let that mud slow
you down, keep going.

685
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:52,265
Keep on.

686
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,956
Broomhilda Von Shaft,
age twenty-seven,

687
00:58:58,649 --> 00:59:00,469
""r"" on right cheek...

688
00:59:01,803 --> 00:59:03,810
Calvin Candy.

689
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:08,397
He owns the fourth biggest cotton
plantation in Mississippi, Candyland.

690
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:10,367
Candyland?

691
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:11,533
Oh so you've heard of it?

692
00:59:11,572 --> 00:59:13,476
Ain't no slave that
ain't heard of Candyland.

693
00:59:13,742 --> 00:59:16,124
Well, apparently that's
where you wife is,

694
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:19,473
and that's the repelling
gentleman who owns her.

695
00:59:19,528 --> 00:59:22,119
Let's just hope she works in
the out, slaying in the field.

696
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:23,820
Oh no, she ain't in the field, mate.

697
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,256
She... she pretty.

698
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:28,644
and she a tall girl, too.

699
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,416
The one you tore
back up on the nag...

700
00:59:33,788 --> 00:59:35,715
he burnt her runaway on her cheek.

701
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:38,410
They got damned.

702
00:59:43,221 --> 00:59:46,421
She no field nigger, but she ain't good
enough for the house no more either.

703
00:59:46,734 --> 00:59:48,427
They're gonna try to
make her comfort girl.

704
00:59:48,456 --> 00:59:50,193
What's a comfort
- Oh.

705
00:59:50,975 --> 00:59:53,075
Now while I got freedom...

706
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:55,691
Now while I got my gun.

707
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,589
So do we offer to buy her?

708
01:00:03,189 --> 01:00:04,309
So...

709
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:07,307
say...

710
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:12,536
a man wants to buy a horse...

711
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:14,997
needs to buy a horse.

712
01:00:16,712 --> 01:00:19,553
He walks up to the farmer's farm,
he knocks on the farmer's door,

713
01:00:19,569 --> 01:00:23,005
and asks the farmer to buy his horse.
And you know what the farmer says,

714
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:25,364
the farmer says: ""No"".

715
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:29,317
Well I say: fuck that farmer.

716
01:00:29,845 --> 01:00:31,383
And I'm stealin' that horse.

717
01:00:32,118 --> 01:00:36,318
Fair enough, but now you are horse
thief, and they hang horse thieves.

718
01:00:36,483 --> 01:00:38,840
Not to mention the horse goes
back to its original owner,

719
01:00:38,862 --> 01:00:40,691
because the horse is
still its property.

720
01:00:40,734 --> 01:00:44,359
We need her and we
need a bill of sale.

721
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:47,154
But if we ain't gonna try to
buy, then how we gonna get it?

722
01:00:48,038 --> 01:00:51,879
May I offer an alternative
plan for action?

723
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,390
Go ahead.

724
01:00:55,301 --> 01:00:59,806
The man walks up to the farmer's
farm, he knocks on the farmer's door,

725
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:05,913
and asks not to buy
the horse, but the farm,

726
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:12,027
and makes an offer so ridiculous,
the farmer's forced to say yes.

727
01:01:12,761 --> 01:01:14,448
We're gonna offer to buy Candyland?

728
01:01:14,479 --> 01:01:19,079
No, it's far too big, but apparently,
this farmer ain't all about the farm.

729
01:01:20,626 --> 01:01:22,741
How much do you know
about mandingo fighting?

730
01:01:22,781 --> 01:01:23,687
What?

731
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:28,637
Can you convincingly masquerade of someone
who's an expert on mandingo fighting?

732
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:29,828
Why?

733
01:01:30,096 --> 01:01:33,695
Because my character is that of
a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,

734
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:37,294
here in Greenville to buy my
way into the mandingo fight game,

735
01:01:37,342 --> 01:01:41,230
and your character is the mandingo
expert I hired to help me do it.

736
01:01:41,363 --> 01:01:43,079
They call that ""One-Eyed Charly"".

737
01:01:46,471 --> 01:01:47,851
Bonjour.

738
01:01:48,012 --> 01:01:51,111
Bonsoir, p'tite femme noire,

739
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,712
we are here to see Mr. Calvin Candy.

740
01:01:54,025 --> 01:01:55,585
Enter.

741
01:01:58,242 --> 01:01:59,642
Thank you.

742
01:02:00,495 --> 01:02:02,638
You want me to play a black slaver?

743
01:02:03,474 --> 01:02:05,737
Ain't nothin lower
than a black slaver.

744
01:02:06,362 --> 01:02:09,242
A black slaver is lower
than a head house nigger.

745
01:02:10,414 --> 01:02:12,220
And buddy, that's pretty fuckin' low.

746
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:15,768
Then play him that way,

747
01:02:15,823 --> 01:02:19,784
give me your black slaver.

748
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:33,116
Dr. Schultz!

749
01:02:33,163 --> 01:02:34,788
Good to see you again.

750
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:36,329
Mr. Moguy.

751
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:40,322
Thank you for your assistance in creating
the opportunity for this appointment.

752
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:41,898
Nonsense, it's my job.

753
01:02:42,554 --> 01:02:45,674
So, this is the One-Eyed
Charly I've heard so much about.

754
01:02:45,815 --> 01:02:47,705
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

755
01:02:48,049 --> 01:02:50,797
Django, this is Mr. Candie's
lawyer, Leonide Moguy.

756
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:52,607
Just call me Leo.

757
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:56,290
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar
room, y'all wanna follow me?

758
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:58,831
How long have you been
associated with Mr. Candie?

759
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:03,126
Oh, Calvin's father and I were about eleven
when we went to boarding school together.

760
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:06,434
Calvins' father father
put me through law school.

761
01:03:06,594 --> 01:03:09,669
One could almost say, I was
raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

762
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:12,060
One could almost say, you's a nigger.

763
01:03:12,429 --> 01:03:13,989
What did you say?

764
01:03:14,216 --> 01:03:15,218
I say...

765
01:03:15,243 --> 01:03:17,343
Real nothing, he's just being cheeky.

766
01:03:17,478 --> 01:03:21,923
Now, anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?

767
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,108
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

768
01:03:24,198 --> 01:03:26,008
Ah, what civilized people aren't?

769
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,477
And he prefers Monsieur
Candie to Mister Candie.

770
01:03:28,516 --> 01:03:30,616
Hmm, si c'est cela qu'il prÃ©fÃ¨re.

771
01:03:30,779 --> 01:03:35,029
He doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.

772
01:03:38,244 --> 01:03:40,569
Get back on top now, turn around.

773
01:03:40,632 --> 01:03:41,700
There you go.

774
01:03:42,198 --> 01:03:43,616
There you go.

775
01:03:45,598 --> 01:03:48,283
Why do you want to get
in the mandingo business?

776
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:55,146
You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?

777
01:03:55,443 --> 01:03:58,854
Quit stalling now.
Answer the question.

778
01:04:01,294 --> 01:04:02,940
The awful truth?

779
01:04:03,197 --> 01:04:04,862
Pff, I'm bored.

780
01:04:04,972 --> 01:04:06,812
This seems like a good bit of fun.

781
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,250
Well, come on over.

782
01:04:14,486 --> 01:04:17,132
We got us a fight goin' on,
that's a good bit of fun.

783
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:23,131
Won't you accompany me to the bar?

784
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,218
You don't go ahead in a house,
white man, even I know that.

785
01:04:43,368 --> 01:04:45,068
Dr. Schultz... -
What a real pleasure-

786
01:04:45,076 --> 01:04:46,689
Keep fighting, niggers!

787
01:04:46,775 --> 01:04:48,306
.. and I might add, an honor.

788
01:04:48,642 --> 01:04:51,889
Honored to meet you, please have
a seat, the pleasure's all mine.

789
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,651
Get Freeman Django
here whatever he wants.

790
01:04:55,379 --> 01:04:57,199
And I'll have sweet gin bourbon.

791
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,598
You go way, boy, you
do what I tell you!

792
01:05:20,861 --> 01:05:22,468
He's got big and strong!

793
01:05:23,124 --> 01:05:24,524
Com'on now!

794
01:05:24,684 --> 01:05:27,484
Ah, he's not doing what
I told him. For God sake.

795
01:05:28,134 --> 01:05:31,327
Bravo, Luigi, cosi e
dai. De casse piu rapido.

796
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:34,289
Com'on now boys, this
a fight to the death!

797
01:05:35,344 --> 01:05:37,271
Hit that animal or you're ain't!

798
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:45,226
Ecco i con la spola tappeto.
La spola tappeto giÃ¹.

799
01:05:45,757 --> 01:05:47,577
Big Fred, com'on!

800
01:05:48,492 --> 01:05:50,091
Turn him around, now!

801
01:05:53,647 --> 01:05:55,660
Use your strength, boy!

802
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,259
Com'on now, use your strength!

803
01:06:00,446 --> 01:06:01,846
There you go!

804
01:06:03,217 --> 01:06:04,617
There you go!

805
01:06:05,014 --> 01:06:05,808
Look at that!

806
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,829
Yeah I told you, this is a wild man.

807
01:06:10,245 --> 01:06:12,065
Do what I told you, boy.

808
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:13,282
Here you go!

809
01:06:13,328 --> 01:06:15,306
Ah. No! Aah!

810
01:06:15,361 --> 01:06:18,210
Do what I told you.
Ground him back, boy.

811
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:19,475
Ground him back!

812
01:06:21,757 --> 01:06:23,715
Uh, you no lose!

813
01:06:31,351 --> 01:06:33,226
No! No!

814
01:06:44,526 --> 01:06:45,683
Finish him.

815
01:06:49,642 --> 01:06:51,462
Go on, boy, finish him!

816
01:06:55,841 --> 01:06:57,519
That's why they call him big Fred!

817
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,261
Worth every penny.

818
01:06:59,301 --> 01:07:01,050
Well, arrivederchi, Luigi!

819
01:07:01,269 --> 01:07:03,605
Com'on up now boy,
get yourself a rest,

820
01:07:03,613 --> 01:07:06,469
you did a fine job, a real fine job.

821
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:08,231
Proceed in.

822
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:31,226
Tequila.

823
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,437
What's your name?

824
01:07:44,923 --> 01:07:46,208
Django.

825
01:07:48,757 --> 01:07:50,577
Can you spell it?

826
01:07:52,523 --> 01:07:56,513
D, J, A, N, G, O.

827
01:07:58,201 --> 01:08:00,021
The D is silent.

828
01:08:00,157 --> 01:08:01,277
I know.

829
01:08:08,479 --> 01:08:09,393
Umberto, andiamo.

830
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:10,576
Mr. Moguy,

831
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:12,784
I want you to take
care o' my new boy here.

832
01:08:13,034 --> 01:08:14,930
You find him a room with a soft bed,

833
01:08:14,939 --> 01:08:17,272
and you bring him up a
pony to lick his pawl.

834
01:08:17,781 --> 01:08:20,591
You be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow mornin' now, you hear?

835
01:08:20,669 --> 01:08:21,489
Yessir, Mr. Candy.

836
01:08:21,529 --> 01:08:25,347
Oh before you go, Roscoe,
get Fred here a tall beer.

837
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,978
You enjoy that, boy.

838
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:32,603
You've earned it.

839
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:33,810
Yessir.

840
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:44,782
What's your name, boy?

841
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:47,016
His name is Django Freeman.

842
01:08:47,409 --> 01:08:48,529
Hm-hm.

843
01:08:51,018 --> 01:08:52,242
Where did ya dig him up?

844
01:08:52,269 --> 01:08:56,008
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

845
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,469
I've heard tell about you.

846
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,176
I heard you've been telling ev'rybody
that mandingos are not damn good,

847
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:06,543
ain't nothing nobody is selling
is worth buying, I'm curious.

848
01:09:07,295 --> 01:09:09,394
What makes you such
a mandingo expert?

849
01:09:11,638 --> 01:09:14,038
I'm curious what
makes you so curious?

850
01:09:17,483 --> 01:09:19,285
- What did you say, boy?
- Calm down Butch.

851
01:09:20,643 --> 01:09:22,121
No offense given...

852
01:09:22,653 --> 01:09:23,736
None taken.

853
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:25,330
Uh, Monsieur Candie...

854
01:09:25,689 --> 01:09:29,554
Uhm, I'd appreciate if you could
direct your line of inquiry toward me.

855
01:09:29,609 --> 01:09:30,729
One.

856
01:09:31,684 --> 01:09:34,775
You do not have anything to drink,
can I get you a tasty refreshment.

857
01:09:34,915 --> 01:09:36,744
Yes! I'll have a beer.

858
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:37,931
Wunderbar.

859
01:09:38,117 --> 01:09:40,036
Roscoe, a beer for
the man with the beard,

860
01:09:40,046 --> 01:09:43,442
and I will have a Polynesian
Pearl Diver, do no spill the rum.

861
01:09:44,028 --> 01:09:45,148
Doc...

862
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:49,872
I'm a seasoned slaver, you are
- well, you are a neophyte,

863
01:09:49,888 --> 01:09:54,730
I'm simply trying to ascertain if this
cowboy here is taking advantage of you.

864
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:59,329
With all due respect,
Monsieur Candie,

865
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:02,223
I didn't seek you
out for your advice.

866
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:06,846
I sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top dollar market price.

867
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:10,171
I was under the impression
when you granted me an audience,

868
01:10:10,191 --> 01:10:12,532
it would be to discuss business.

869
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:17,210
But we weren't talking business yet.

870
01:10:17,882 --> 01:10:19,756
We were discussing my curiosity.

871
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:26,158
Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play.

872
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:29,427
Sheba,

873
01:10:29,784 --> 01:10:31,604
you stay right there.

874
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,078
I know you didn't name me.

875
01:10:35,334 --> 01:10:36,454
Prost.

876
01:10:36,703 --> 01:10:37,823
Jambo.

877
01:10:38,688 --> 01:10:40,170
Now according to Moguy,

878
01:10:40,572 --> 01:10:44,881
if I do business with you, I'm
doin' business with both of y'all.

879
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:47,469
He does the eyeballin', you
the billfold, is that it?

880
01:10:47,587 --> 01:10:52,030
Well, you don't make it sound too
flattering, but more or less, yeah.

881
01:10:53,788 --> 01:10:54,908
So...

882
01:10:55,457 --> 01:10:56,857
Bright Boy,

883
01:10:57,077 --> 01:10:59,385
Moguy tells me you looked
over my African flesh,

884
01:10:59,386 --> 01:11:01,301
and you was none too impressed, huh?

885
01:11:01,505 --> 01:11:03,305
Not for top dollar.

886
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:07,248
Well then we got nothing
more to talk about.

887
01:11:07,457 --> 01:11:09,525
You see, you wanna buy a
beat ass nigger from me,

888
01:11:09,607 --> 01:11:12,081
those was all the beat ass
niggers I wanna sell, so...

889
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:14,616
He don't wanna buy the
niggers you wanna sell.

890
01:11:15,073 --> 01:11:17,944
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

891
01:11:18,501 --> 01:11:22,522
I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

892
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:28,420
Well, hm. You won't sell your best.

893
01:11:28,657 --> 01:11:30,579
You won't even sell your second best.

894
01:11:31,392 --> 01:11:34,655
But your third best you don't
want to sell him either...

895
01:11:35,069 --> 01:11:38,926
but if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

896
01:11:40,513 --> 01:11:42,793
who knows what could happen?

897
01:11:44,286 --> 01:11:46,686
And what do you consider ridiculous?

898
01:11:47,398 --> 01:11:51,981
For a truly talented specimen,
well ""The Right Nigger""?

899
01:11:53,516 --> 01:11:55,318
How much would you say, Django?

900
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,500
Twelve thousand dollars.

901
01:12:05,445 --> 01:12:06,606
Gentlemen...

902
01:12:07,008 --> 01:12:08,772
You had my curiosity.

903
01:12:09,217 --> 01:12:10,902
Now you have my attention.

904
01:12:25,062 --> 01:12:27,140
Willie... Willie.

905
01:12:27,187 --> 01:12:29,007
Hold up! Hold up.

906
01:12:29,521 --> 01:12:30,331
Aah.

907
01:12:30,401 --> 01:12:32,057
Good morning, gentlemen.

908
01:12:32,144 --> 01:12:35,204
Good Dr. Schultz.
Beautiful morning isn't it?

909
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,298
You couldn't have
picked a better one.

910
01:12:37,345 --> 01:12:40,360
Please, won't you take a ride
with us here in the Victorian.

911
01:12:40,392 --> 01:12:42,068
Oh, thank you very much.

912
01:12:42,116 --> 01:12:44,270
Tie your horse up back there.

913
01:12:52,344 --> 01:12:53,464
Django!

914
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,825
Well I part company from many
of my phenologist colleagues,

915
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:05,124
cause I believe there's
a level above bright,

916
01:13:05,665 --> 01:13:11,155
above talented, above loyal
that a nigger can aspire.

917
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:16,664
Say one nigger that just
pops up on ten thousand.

918
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:18,531
The exceptional nigger.

919
01:13:19,412 --> 01:13:21,261
Bright day uh, Bright Boy?

920
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,798
Sun is up.

921
01:13:24,754 --> 01:13:26,574
Shinin' on all of us.

922
01:13:31,457 --> 01:13:33,277
Have a seat, Doc.

923
01:13:34,759 --> 01:13:35,943
Great an honor.

924
01:13:36,054 --> 01:13:37,388
The honor is all ours.

925
01:13:37,506 --> 01:13:38,091
Thank you.

926
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:44,433
.. but I do believe that given time,
exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here,

927
01:13:45,348 --> 01:13:47,470
will come if not freedom...

928
01:13:48,245 --> 01:13:49,645
more freedom...

929
01:13:51,611 --> 01:13:53,011
Bright Boy,

930
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,962
you are that one in ten thousand.

931
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:59,334
The name of the game is keep
up, not catch up, nigger.

932
01:14:15,288 --> 01:14:16,512
Touch your guns, you're dead.

933
01:14:16,521 --> 01:14:18,341
Everybody calm down!

934
01:14:19,036 --> 01:14:20,940
I saw the whole thing, no harm done.

935
01:14:20,971 --> 01:14:22,633
Are you- are you
kiddin' me, this nigger-

936
01:14:22,664 --> 01:14:26,164
I said no harm done! Now take
your hands off your pistol!

937
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:28,916
Butch!

938
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,070
That means you too.

939
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,653
Ev'rybody stop
antagonizing my guests.

940
01:14:36,355 --> 01:14:37,230
Who!

941
01:14:37,497 --> 01:14:39,119
Git back upon your horse.

942
01:14:39,436 --> 01:14:40,871
He broke my collarbone!

943
01:14:40,965 --> 01:14:45,572
For God sake, somebody please help
Who here back upon his goddamn horse.

944
01:14:46,368 --> 01:14:48,631
Ooh, now you are one lucky nigger.

945
01:14:49,858 --> 01:14:51,683
You got to listen to
your boss, white boy.

946
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:54,127
Oh I'm a good walk in
any moonlight for you.

947
01:14:54,325 --> 01:14:56,145
You wanna hold my hand?

948
01:15:02,262 --> 01:15:05,215
Willie! Take us home.

949
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:04,549
You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?

950
01:16:04,654 --> 01:16:05,668
No sir.

951
01:16:05,734 --> 01:16:08,134
You wan' a boot heel in it?

952
01:16:08,626 --> 01:16:09,504
No sir.

953
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,922
Then keep your goddamn
eyeballs off me.

954
01:16:13,089 --> 01:16:16,125
Flash that bad look at me again,
I give you a reason not to like me.

955
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:17,360
Now move, nigger!

956
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,925
You niggers gonna understand
somethin' 'bout me.

957
01:16:22,074 --> 01:16:23,938
I'm worse than any
o'these white men here.

958
01:16:24,235 --> 01:16:27,571
You keep them eyelash inside your ass,
you keep them goddamn eyeballs off me.

959
01:16:27,853 --> 01:16:31,053
He is a rambunctious sort, ain't it?

960
01:16:31,109 --> 01:16:32,405
Indeed!

961
01:16:34,959 --> 01:16:38,152
May you stop for a moment, so I
may put put a word in my man's ear?

962
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:42,249
Yeah, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimen of Candyland,

963
01:16:42,289 --> 01:16:45,662
so before that moment, it
would be good if I could have

964
01:16:45,663 --> 01:16:49,723
a confidential strategy
meeting with my... confident.

965
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:54,829
You mind tellin' me
what the hell you doing?

966
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:57,439
I've confirmed that
Broomhilda's at Candyland.

967
01:17:00,988 --> 01:17:02,431
Are you sure it's her?

968
01:17:02,523 --> 01:17:04,872
He didn't call her by name,
but she's a young lady,

969
01:17:04,897 --> 01:17:06,848
whip marks on her
back, and speaks German.

970
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:09,362
Now while it's not wise to assume,

971
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:11,791
in this instance, I
think it's pretty safe.

972
01:17:11,901 --> 01:17:13,301
Point being...

973
01:17:13,656 --> 01:17:16,476
don't get so carried away
with your retribution.

974
01:17:16,789 --> 01:17:18,758
We lose sight on why we're here.

975
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,081
You think I lost sight, did I?

976
01:17:20,112 --> 01:17:23,070
Yes, I do! Stop antagonizing Candy!

977
01:17:23,462 --> 01:17:28,639
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get both of us killed,

978
01:17:28,663 --> 01:17:33,410
and I, for one, don't intend to die in
Chickasaw County, Mississippi, U. S. A.

979
01:17:33,652 --> 01:17:36,384
I'm not antagonizing.
I'm intriguing him.

980
01:17:36,673 --> 01:17:39,405
You're yelling abuse
of these poor slaves!

981
01:17:40,186 --> 01:17:42,006
I recall the man...

982
01:17:42,444 --> 01:17:45,762
who had me killed another
man in front o' his son,

983
01:17:45,848 --> 01:17:47,205
and he didn't bat an eye.

984
01:17:49,056 --> 01:17:50,456
Remember that?

985
01:17:52,377 --> 01:17:53,663
Yeah of course I remember!

986
01:17:53,765 --> 01:17:55,273
What you said was...

987
01:17:55,539 --> 01:17:56,827
You said, this ain't my word...

988
01:17:58,355 --> 01:18:00,094
""In my word you got to get dirty"".

989
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:04,071
So that's what I'm
doing. I'm getting dirty.

990
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:11,013
Well you're paraphrasing
a tad, but...

991
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:14,409
that was it generally, just...

992
01:18:18,423 --> 01:18:20,243
see you at Candyland.

993
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:28,704
Alright niggers!

994
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,199
Back at it.

995
01:18:31,376 --> 01:18:33,476
That means you too, moonlight.

996
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:23,262
I'll 'be. D'Artagnan!

997
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:26,954
Now well, why do a
fool thing like run off?

998
01:19:27,421 --> 01:19:29,595
I can't fight no
more, Monsieur Candy.

999
01:19:29,847 --> 01:19:31,247
Yes you can!

1000
01:19:31,448 --> 01:19:33,633
YÐ¾u mÑ–ght nÐ¾t bÐµ Ð°blÐµ tÐ¾
wÑ–n, but yÐ¾ur Ð°Ñ•Ñ• ÑÐ°n fÑ–ght.

1001
01:19:34,704 --> 01:19:37,279
Mr. Stonesipher, would you
please shut these goddamn dogs up,

1002
01:19:37,317 --> 01:19:38,588
I cannot hear myself think!

1003
01:19:38,619 --> 01:19:43,405
Hush now, Marsha! Hush up,
Marsha! Marsha, hush up!

1004
01:19:43,555 --> 01:19:46,897
Hey, get these goddamn
dogs away from this nigger!

1005
01:19:56,075 --> 01:19:57,895
Well now boy...

1006
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:00,742
Gidown o' that tree.
- Yes sir.

1007
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:25,251
How long was he lose?

1008
01:20:26,275 --> 01:20:27,163
A night...

1009
01:20:27,851 --> 01:20:28,971
day...

1010
01:20:29,775 --> 01:20:30,895
Half the other night.

1011
01:20:32,388 --> 01:20:33,999
How far he git off property?

1012
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,880
Bout twenty miles off prop.

1013
01:20:36,343 --> 01:20:38,638
Pretty fer, conside'ing
that limp he got.

1014
01:20:40,989 --> 01:20:44,236
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

1015
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:45,783
One of this new lot.

1016
01:20:47,445 --> 01:20:50,231
The way he looks now, a blind
Indian wouldn't bet a bead on 'em.

1017
01:20:50,294 --> 01:20:53,143
Please Mr. Candy, I ain't got
it, ain't it no more, I can't-

1018
01:20:53,178 --> 01:20:56,164
No no no no, now no beggin'...

1019
01:20:57,367 --> 01:20:59,117
No playin' on my soft heart.

1020
01:21:03,169 --> 01:21:04,879
You're in trouble, now son.

1021
01:21:09,206 --> 01:21:12,006
I done paid 500 dollars for you...

1022
01:21:12,415 --> 01:21:14,688
When I pay 500 dollars...

1023
01:21:15,009 --> 01:21:19,389
I expect to get five fights outta a
nigga 'fore he rollover and play dead.

1024
01:21:19,905 --> 01:21:22,949
Got to understand, I'm...
I'm running a business here!

1025
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,434
You
- you fought three fights.

1026
01:21:25,536 --> 01:21:26,830
But I won everyone!

1027
01:21:26,878 --> 01:21:28,469
Yes you did. Yes you did,

1028
01:21:28,485 --> 01:21:31,424
but that last one, you muddled the
line between winning and losing.

1029
01:21:35,178 --> 01:21:36,998
Still the fact remain.

1030
01:21:37,538 --> 01:21:40,745
I pay 500 dollars, I
want five goddamn fights!

1031
01:21:41,592 --> 01:21:43,434
So what 'bout my five
hundred dollars, huh?

1032
01:21:45,789 --> 01:21:47,333
What about my five hundred dollars?

1033
01:21:49,161 --> 01:21:50,722
You go n' reimburse me?!

1034
01:21:56,859 --> 01:21:59,813
You even know what reimburse means?

1035
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:09,349
I'll reimburse you!

1036
01:22:13,018 --> 01:22:14,418
You will?

1037
01:22:19,859 --> 01:22:21,544
You pay 500 dollars...

1038
01:22:22,756 --> 01:22:26,160
for pratic'lly a one eyed
Ole'Joe ain't fit to push a broom?

1039
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,716
No, he won't.

1040
01:22:29,723 --> 01:22:31,728
He's just tired of you
toyin' with him, is all.

1041
01:22:32,846 --> 01:22:34,306
Matter o' facts, so am I.

1042
01:22:35,276 --> 01:22:37,172
But we ain't payin' a
penny for that pickaninny,

1043
01:22:37,482 --> 01:22:39,568
ain't got no use for 'em,
ain't that right, Doc?

1044
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:42,123
You heard 'em!

1045
01:22:51,607 --> 01:22:56,159
I'm gonna have to excuse Mr.
Stonesipher slack jaw gaze, he...

1046
01:22:56,373 --> 01:22:58,902
he ain't never seen a nigger
like you ever in his life.

1047
01:22:59,768 --> 01:23:01,548
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1048
01:23:04,041 --> 01:23:05,441
That right.

1049
01:23:06,392 --> 01:23:07,512
That matter...

1050
01:23:09,257 --> 01:23:11,077
Won't have that.

1051
01:23:16,645 --> 01:23:17,765
Now...

1052
01:23:19,073 --> 01:23:22,031
Sin'e as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here...

1053
01:23:24,774 --> 01:23:27,745
you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger anyway I see fit?

1054
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,420
He's your nigger.

1055
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:35,812
Mr. Stonesipher?

1056
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,755
Let Marsha and her bitches send
D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1057
01:23:41,594 --> 01:23:44,685
Marsha! Git the nigger!

1058
01:24:23,537 --> 01:24:25,881
Your boss looks a little
green around the gills

1059
01:24:25,882 --> 01:24:27,794
for a blood sport
like 'nigger fightin'?

1060
01:24:28,039 --> 01:24:29,093
No.

1061
01:24:29,734 --> 01:24:32,893
He just ain't use to seein' a
man ripped apart by dogs, is all.

1062
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:37,002
You are used to it?

1063
01:24:37,237 --> 01:24:40,737
I'm just a little more use
to American's than he is.

1064
01:24:41,383 --> 01:24:44,413
Now... Monsieur Candy,

1065
01:24:45,064 --> 01:24:46,624
whenever you're ready.

1066
01:24:47,023 --> 01:24:49,731
We rode five hours so you
could show off your stock.

1067
01:24:50,396 --> 01:24:52,216
Let's git to it.

1068
01:24:53,519 --> 01:24:55,612
Cause as of now, if
he's an example...

1069
01:24:56,105 --> 01:24:57,225
I ain't impressed.

1070
01:24:59,963 --> 01:25:01,363
Follow me.

1071
01:26:58,899 --> 01:27:00,631
Line up to the left here now niggers.

1072
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:06,860
That's it.

1073
01:27:09,698 --> 01:27:11,578
You gimme a line, gimme a line.

1074
01:27:11,655 --> 01:27:13,710
Get in line here. Right now!

1075
01:28:13,245 --> 01:28:15,070
Hello, Steven my boy!

1076
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:17,356
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass.

1077
01:28:17,838 --> 01:28:20,710
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1078
01:28:21,101 --> 01:28:22,661
Oh Steven, you have
nags for breakfast.

1079
01:28:23,075 --> 01:28:25,666
What's the matter, why so
ornery, you miss me, huh?

1080
01:28:25,696 --> 01:28:30,014
Oh-oh yes sir, I miss you
like a home miss flower,

1081
01:28:30,108 --> 01:28:34,176
like a - like a- a
baby miss Mum n' Teddy,

1082
01:28:34,824 --> 01:28:39,047
I miss you like I
misses a rock in my shoe.

1083
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:45,710
Now I ask you: who this
nigger, on that nag?

1084
01:28:45,758 --> 01:28:46,662
Hey Snowball.

1085
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:51,880
If you wanna know my name or
the name of my horse, you ask me.

1086
01:28:52,475 --> 01:28:55,199
Just who the hell you
callin' Snowball, horse boy?

1087
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:58,081
I'll snap your black ass of
that nag there in the mud-

1088
01:28:58,144 --> 01:29:00,774
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Steven, Steven.

1089
01:29:01,562 --> 01:29:02,598
Let's keep it funny.

1090
01:29:03,031 --> 01:29:04,645
Django here is a Freeman.

1091
01:29:05,544 --> 01:29:07,344
- This nigger here?
- That nigger there.

1092
01:29:07,821 --> 01:29:09,967
Let me at least
introduce the two of you.

1093
01:29:10,334 --> 01:29:14,120
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Steven.

1094
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:15,917
Steven, this is Django.

1095
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,591
You two ought to hate each other.

1096
01:29:17,756 --> 01:29:21,863
Calvin, just who the hell is this
nigger you feel the need to entertain?

1097
01:29:21,967 --> 01:29:25,769
Django, and his friend in grey
here Dr. Schultz are customers,

1098
01:29:26,066 --> 01:29:27,618
and they are our guests, Steven,

1099
01:29:27,627 --> 01:29:31,568
and you, you old decrepit bastard,
are to show them every hospitality.

1100
01:29:31,607 --> 01:29:33,753
You understand that?
- Yessir, here I'm understandin',

1101
01:29:33,758 --> 01:29:35,727
but I don't know why I gotta
take lip off this nigger?

1102
01:29:35,761 --> 01:29:38,761
You don't hafta know
why. Do you understand?

1103
01:29:39,263 --> 01:29:41,229
Yes sir, I understand.

1104
01:29:41,323 --> 01:29:42,443
Oh good!

1105
01:29:42,671 --> 01:29:45,692
They're spendin' the night, go up in
the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

1106
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,581
He gonna stay in the Big House?

1107
01:29:48,647 --> 01:29:50,995
Steven, he's a
slaver. It's different.

1108
01:29:51,046 --> 01:29:52,395
In the Big House?

1109
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:53,804
Well you gotta problem with that?

1110
01:29:53,827 --> 01:29:56,260
No, no no I got no problem with it,

1111
01:29:56,315 --> 01:29:59,117
with you I gotta problem with burnin'
the bed, the sheets, the pillow cases,

1112
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:01,156
ev'rything up when this
black ass motherfuckers gone!

1113
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:03,166
Now that is my problem,
they are mine to burn!

1114
01:30:03,305 --> 01:30:05,623
Now your problem right now
is making a good impression.

1115
01:30:05,723 --> 01:30:07,920
And I want you to start
solving that problem right now,

1116
01:30:07,954 --> 01:30:09,584
and git them goddamn rooms ready!

1117
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:12,889
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.

1118
01:30:14,862 --> 01:30:16,262
Go on now.

1119
01:30:17,104 --> 01:30:19,554
Can't believe you brought a
nigger to stay in the Big House.

1120
01:30:19,641 --> 01:30:21,563
You get a rollin' over and
it's God man free right now.

1121
01:30:21,564 --> 01:30:22,220
He had a lip on you.

1122
01:30:22,412 --> 01:30:24,823
A nigger in the estate
part. What shit is that!?

1123
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:26,006
Now.

1124
01:30:26,199 --> 01:30:30,493
Where is my beautiful sister!

1125
01:30:31,019 --> 01:30:32,384
There she is!

1126
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:39,303
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
southern belle is my widowed sister.

1127
01:30:39,683 --> 01:30:43,610
Darling, you are a
diamond for tired eyes.

1128
01:30:44,729 --> 01:30:48,211
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1129
01:30:48,274 --> 01:30:51,764
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charlie,
you'll git your ass up on that hill.

1130
01:30:51,795 --> 01:30:53,139
Com'on Charlie, go on now.

1131
01:30:53,162 --> 01:30:55,144
Go, com'on now. You know where it is.

1132
01:30:55,613 --> 01:30:57,009
Like you on a rope!

1133
01:30:58,281 --> 01:31:00,696
Niggers don't walk
'round here! Niggers run!

1134
01:31:01,523 --> 01:31:03,623
- Ah, Monsieur Candie?
- Hmm?

1135
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:08,765
About that matter, about the
nigger girl we were talking about?

1136
01:31:08,945 --> 01:31:09,804
Nigger girl?

1137
01:31:09,909 --> 01:31:13,208
Yeah, I believe you
mentioned she spoke German?

1138
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,780
Ah yes, Hildi, what about her?

1139
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:20,416
Do you think before the demonstration
you could send her around to my room?

1140
01:31:20,806 --> 01:31:23,077
You little Dickens, you!

1141
01:31:23,903 --> 01:31:24,803
I don't see why not.

1142
01:31:24,828 --> 01:31:27,958
Steven, when you get through showing
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1143
01:31:27,988 --> 01:31:31,446
get her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room.

1144
01:31:31,491 --> 01:31:36,176
Actually, Monsieur Candie, it's
- it's somethin' I ain't tole you that yet.

1145
01:31:36,497 --> 01:31:37,012
What?

1146
01:31:37,097 --> 01:31:39,712
Uh, Hildi in The Hot Box.

1147
01:31:41,811 --> 01:31:43,024
What's she doin' there?

1148
01:31:43,117 --> 01:31:46,582
What 'cha think she doin' there,
in The Hot Box, she bein' punished.

1149
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:49,544
- What did she do?
- She ran off again.

1150
01:31:50,202 --> 01:31:52,965
Jesus Christ Steven, how many
people ran away while I was gone?

1151
01:31:53,012 --> 01:31:53,918
Two.

1152
01:31:54,365 --> 01:31:55,498
And when did she go?

1153
01:31:55,581 --> 01:31:58,581
Last night, they
- they brought her back this morning.

1154
01:31:58,785 --> 01:32:01,243
How bad did Stonesipher's
dogs tear her up?

1155
01:32:01,808 --> 01:32:05,301
Lucky for her, they was out
chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1156
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:09,418
Bill and Cody went out lookin' for her,
found her and brought her back, uh...

1157
01:32:10,078 --> 01:32:11,209
Now she a little beat up,

1158
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:14,310
but she done that the all damn self,
runnin' through them damn bushes and shit.

1159
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:15,794
How long she been in the box?

1160
01:32:16,054 --> 01:32:19,044
How long ya think, she
been in there all damn day!

1161
01:32:19,177 --> 01:32:22,284
And the lit'le bitch got
ten more days be in there.

1162
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:23,845
Steven, take her out.

1163
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:25,207
Take her out, why?!

1164
01:32:25,293 --> 01:32:27,254
Because I said so, that's why.

1165
01:32:27,299 --> 01:32:29,179
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1166
01:32:29,313 --> 01:32:33,812
Hildi is my nigger, Southern hospitality
dictates I make her available to him.

1167
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:36,119
But Monsieur Candie,
she just ran off.

1168
01:32:36,158 --> 01:32:39,711
Jesus Christ Steven, what is the point
of havin' a nigger that speaks German,

1169
01:32:39,797 --> 01:32:42,177
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?

1170
01:32:42,381 --> 01:32:46,450
Now I realize it is inconvenient
but still, you take her ass out!

1171
01:32:46,591 --> 01:32:47,442
Yes sir.

1172
01:32:49,058 --> 01:32:52,329
Lara Lee, will you and Cora
be responsible for getting

1173
01:32:52,349 --> 01:32:55,349
Hilda cleaned up and
presentable for Dr. Schultz here?

1174
01:32:55,384 --> 01:32:56,784
Of course, darling.

1175
01:32:56,929 --> 01:33:01,924
Now gentlemen, I do apologize, but I'm
wearer for our travels beyond words,

1176
01:33:02,072 --> 01:33:04,893

01:33:09,704 --> 01:33:12,389
Ya'all have heard the man,

Go! Come here!

Get over there, get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to doctor

1180
01:33:18,418 --> 01:33:20,237

- what did you say your name is, Schut?

1181
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:21,847
- Schultz.
- Schultz!

1182
01:33:22,236 --> 01:33:24,022
Git her back over here, alright girl?

1183
01:33:24,069 --> 01:33:25,469
Yes sir.

01:34:43,464 --> 01:34:47,102
Hilda, you cominâ€™ with me, or you

1185
01:36:22,237 --> 01:36:23,594
Hello ladies.

1186
01:36:23,688 --> 01:36:27,170
Dr. Schultz, may I
introduce to you Broomhilda.

1187
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,409
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1188
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:37,566
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Broomhilda.

1189
01:36:38,603 --> 01:36:40,931
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

1190
01:36:41,002 --> 01:36:44,502
Well, it's not often a nigger
speaks German, don't you know?

1191
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:49,443
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1192
01:36:49,545 --> 01:36:53,427
I could see all the passion you
inspire completely justified.

1193
01:36:57,632 --> 01:36:59,732
The doctor here speaks German!

1194
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:04,099
And I've been informed
you do as well?

1195
01:37:05,323 --> 01:37:07,486
Go ahead girl, speak a little German.

1196
01:37:15,937 --> 01:37:17,483
Astonishing.

1197
01:37:24,844 --> 01:37:27,313
- And I should
bring- - Much obliged.

1198
01:38:00,981 --> 01:38:02,293
Don't be afraid.

1199
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:42,939
Pardon.

1200
01:40:37,459 --> 01:40:38,858
Hey Little Trouble Maker.

1201
01:40:48,044 --> 01:40:50,444
You silver tongued devil you.

1202
01:41:06,701 --> 01:41:12,238
Look Monsieur Candie, they were all
fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1203
01:41:12,605 --> 01:41:15,423
But the best three, by far, were:

1204
01:41:15,751 --> 01:41:17,009
Sampson...

1205
01:41:17,648 --> 01:41:19,608
Well, what's his name again?
- Goldie.

1206
01:41:20,007 --> 01:41:22,872
Goldie... and Eskimo Joe.

1207
01:41:23,505 --> 01:41:25,760
By the way, why is
he called Eskimo Joe?

1208
01:41:25,827 --> 01:41:29,237
Oh, you never know how these
nigger nicknames get started.

1209
01:41:29,352 --> 01:41:32,873
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold, who knows?

1210
01:41:36,013 --> 01:41:37,253
Well, regardless,

1211
01:41:37,787 --> 01:41:39,409
Samson's your best,

1212
01:41:39,637 --> 01:41:40,995
we all know that,

1213
01:41:41,378 --> 01:41:45,117
you will never sell him, and
I can see why, he's a champion.

1214
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:48,742
Hm-hm-hm! All
three are champions.

1215
01:41:49,563 --> 01:41:51,123
Samson's champion.

1216
01:41:51,901 --> 01:41:53,820
Them other two pretty good.

1217
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:56,554
Calvin, what that
nigger- you let-

1218
01:41:56,563 --> 01:41:57,773
That's alright, that's alright.

1219
01:41:57,844 --> 01:41:59,802
You have to understand
Monsieur Candie,

1220
01:41:59,914 --> 01:42:03,607
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,

1221
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:07,749
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1222
01:42:07,796 --> 01:42:09,145
Is that right?

1223
01:42:09,421 --> 01:42:13,450
Hence... I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1224
01:42:14,777 --> 01:42:17,166
I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1225
01:42:19,126 --> 01:42:21,235
He needs to have... panache.

1226
01:42:21,382 --> 01:42:23,850
- Need to have what what what?
- Panache, hum...

1227
01:42:24,913 --> 01:42:27,575
- A sense of showmanship!
- Showmanship, yes.

1228
01:42:27,612 --> 01:42:31,359
I want to be able to bill him
him as the ""Black Hercules"".

1229
01:42:32,711 --> 01:42:34,497
Black Hercules, isn't that clever?

1230
01:42:34,545 --> 01:42:36,003
More like niggerly.

1231
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:39,602
I said, and I quote:

1232
01:42:40,306 --> 01:42:45,573
""I would pay top dollar
for the Right Nigger"".

1233
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:49,944
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo
Joe is the wrong nigger per se...

1234
01:42:50,944 --> 01:42:53,488
but is he right as rain?

1235
01:42:54,814 --> 01:42:57,999
Dr. Schultz, I will have you know,

1236
01:42:58,065 --> 01:43:01,195
there is no one in the nigger
fight game that appreciates

1237
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:04,434
the value of showmanship more
than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie.

1238
01:43:04,442 --> 01:43:05,442
Nobody.

1239
01:43:05,694 --> 01:43:09,184
But one must not forget the most
important thing in the nigger fight game.

1240
01:43:09,291 --> 01:43:12,343
And that is a nigger
that can win fights.

1241
01:43:12,781 --> 01:43:16,997
Now that should be your first,
second, third, four, and fifth concern.

1242
01:43:17,135 --> 01:43:19,382
Now after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1243
01:43:19,435 --> 01:43:22,585
then you can start to
implement a grand design.

1244
01:43:23,504 --> 01:43:26,105
In other words, first thing is first.

1245
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:28,285
First thing is first.

1246
01:43:36,716 --> 01:43:39,116
I see you two gettin' on.

1247
01:43:39,643 --> 01:43:41,323
Famously.

1248
01:43:41,667 --> 01:43:44,312
Oh Monsieur Candie, you
can't imagine what it's like

1249
01:43:44,313 --> 01:43:47,758
not to hear you native
tongue in four years.

1250
01:43:48,012 --> 01:43:50,673
Well hell, I can't imagine
two weeks in Boston.

1251
01:43:52,241 --> 01:43:55,498
Two weeks in Boston, oh that's your
- oh man!

1252
01:43:57,071 --> 01:43:58,633
Ah, two weeks in Boston!

1253
01:43:58,996 --> 01:44:04,462
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1254
01:44:04,521 --> 01:44:08,948
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1255
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:11,008
Ah be careful now Doctor Schultz,

1256
01:44:11,171 --> 01:44:13,801
you might have caught yourself
a little dose of Nigella.

1257
01:44:14,138 --> 01:44:16,503
Nigella's a powerful emotion, boy.

1258
01:44:16,558 --> 01:44:20,001
It's like a pool of black tar,
once it catches your ass, you can't-

1259
01:44:20,071 --> 01:44:21,876
Yessir, you can't.

1260
01:44:23,223 --> 01:44:27,728
I don't know doctor, you can lay on
all the German sweet talk you want, but

1261
01:44:27,776 --> 01:44:30,536
it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1262
01:44:34,302 --> 01:44:40,292
Well... naturally, it is the soaring
eagle that attracts her attention,

1263
01:44:40,383 --> 01:44:42,784
not the plucked chicken.

1264
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,646
Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself,

1265
01:44:46,664 --> 01:44:48,372
you are quite a dapper
European gentleman.

1266
01:44:48,396 --> 01:44:51,678
You gotta finish this, you got to put your
elbow in this, this is, do you hear me-

1267
01:44:51,728 --> 01:44:54,124
You know that nigger, don't ya?

1268
01:44:55,045 --> 01:44:56,218
- Who?
- Who?

1269
01:44:56,294 --> 01:44:59,057
Don't who me bitch, you
know who I'm talking about!?

1270
01:45:01,078 --> 01:45:02,368
At the table?

1271
01:45:03,296 --> 01:45:04,720
I don't know him.

1272
01:45:04,888 --> 01:45:06,107
You don't know him?

1273
01:45:06,606 --> 01:45:07,656
No.

1274
01:45:07,874 --> 01:45:09,054
No what?

1275
01:45:09,334 --> 01:45:10,741
No sir.

1276
01:45:15,544 --> 01:45:17,422
You wouldn't lie to
me now, would you?

1277
01:45:22,134 --> 01:45:23,342
Okay...

1278
01:45:24,707 --> 01:45:27,611
If
- if you say so.

1279
01:45:34,003 --> 01:45:37,320
Eskimo Joe's a quality
nigger, no doubt about it.

1280
01:45:39,181 --> 01:45:40,409
But if it was my money...

1281
01:45:42,053 --> 01:45:44,105
I wouldn't pay no twelve
thousand dollars for him.

1282
01:45:44,408 --> 01:45:46,293
What would your price be?

1283
01:45:46,885 --> 01:45:48,870
Well, if I was
inclined to be generous,

1284
01:45:48,948 --> 01:45:52,174
and I don't know why I would
be inclined to be generous...

1285
01:45:53,292 --> 01:45:54,360
nine thousand...

1286
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:56,832
maybe.

1287
01:45:57,725 --> 01:45:59,125
Dr. Schultz...

1288
01:45:59,709 --> 01:46:03,644
Let me reclarify how this
whole negotiation came about.

1289
01:46:03,988 --> 01:46:06,235
You see, it wasn't me who
came to you to sell a nigger,

1290
01:46:06,252 --> 01:46:07,032
Sure, it wasn't.

1291
01:46:07,054 --> 01:46:09,165
It was you who
approached me to buy one.

1292
01:46:09,181 --> 01:46:10,047
Sure it was.

1293
01:46:10,101 --> 01:46:12,833
Now that nine thousand dollar
figure Bright Boy was banding about,

1294
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:14,105
that ain't too far off from right,

1295
01:46:14,108 --> 01:46:15,769
and if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,

1296
01:46:15,784 --> 01:46:17,539
I could do so any day of the week.

1297
01:46:17,551 --> 01:46:18,566
Any day.

1298
01:46:18,982 --> 01:46:21,104
But like you said
in Greenville doctor,

1299
01:46:21,293 --> 01:46:22,963
I don't wanna sell 'em.

1300
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:26,531
It was only your ridiculous offer

1301
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:29,836
of twelve thousand dollars
that made me even consider it.

1302
01:46:29,852 --> 01:46:31,252
Hmm-hmm.

1303
01:46:39,118 --> 01:46:43,311
You know Monsieur Candie, you do
possess the power of persuasion.

1304
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:52,137
Why not, Monsieur Candie, you have a
deal, Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!

1305
01:46:52,208 --> 01:46:55,393
Hurray, doctor, hurray, and
a wise decision, that is!

1306
01:46:55,455 --> 01:46:58,866
However, that is a
tremendous amount of money.

1307
01:46:59,161 --> 01:47:02,338
And the way you have your
Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer,

1308
01:47:02,387 --> 01:47:04,377
a persnickety man named Tuttle,

1309
01:47:04,517 --> 01:47:07,694
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1310
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:11,705
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1311
01:47:11,979 --> 01:47:15,390
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe
examined by a physician of my choosing.

1312
01:47:15,444 --> 01:47:16,844
Naturally.

1313
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:21,097
So say I return in about...

1314
01:47:23,690 --> 01:47:25,790
.. five days time.
- Five days?!

1315
01:47:25,969 --> 01:47:28,826
With my Mr. Tuttle.
And then my Mr. Tuttle

1316
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:32,340
and your Mr. Moguy can hash out the
finer details between themselves.

1317
01:47:33,474 --> 01:47:36,339
I say splendid Doctor... Splendid.

1318
01:47:37,152 --> 01:47:38,552
Gentlemen...

1319
01:47:39,464 --> 01:47:40,928
may I propose a toast...

1320
01:47:43,695 --> 01:47:47,468
to Eskimo Joe. Or, shall we call him

1321
01:47:47,778 --> 01:47:49,598
the Black Hercules.

1322
01:47:49,922 --> 01:47:51,656
To the Black Hercules.

1323
01:47:51,774 --> 01:47:53,019
The Black Hercules!

1324
01:47:53,277 --> 01:47:54,779
The Black Hercules...

1325
01:47:54,844 --> 01:47:58,060
You was right, Doctor, that
name do help pay an ass.

1326
01:48:00,388 --> 01:48:01,788
Hildi...

1327
01:48:02,218 --> 01:48:03,456
I'm outta drink, girl.

1328
01:48:06,689 --> 01:48:10,952
So Hildi... how you like servin' at
the big table in the big house, huh?

1329
01:48:11,957 --> 01:48:14,689
When Monsieur Candy
talk to you, you answers.

1330
01:48:15,288 --> 01:48:17,121
I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.

1331
01:48:17,239 --> 01:48:18,145
Hmm-hmm.

1332
01:48:18,302 --> 01:48:20,216
It's a lot better than
sizzling in that hot box,

1333
01:48:20,235 --> 01:48:22,635
or draggin' your ass
through a bramble bush.

1334
01:48:22,709 --> 01:48:25,722
Maybe it's not quite as much fun as
getting the pleasure o' the mandingos,

1335
01:48:25,753 --> 01:48:27,652
huh sugar babe?
- Hmm oh, she like them new.

1336
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:30,213
- Like Simpson, huh?
- Yessir.

1337
01:48:30,549 --> 01:48:32,210
- You know Monsieur Candie,
- Hmm?

1338
01:48:32,231 --> 01:48:35,924
the doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1339
01:48:35,948 --> 01:48:39,234
since how they don't have many
niggers where he come from.

1340
01:48:39,297 --> 01:48:42,036
Dr. Schultz, when you
was alone with Hildi here,

1341
01:48:42,059 --> 01:48:45,255
did ya just speak German, or
did ya git her clothes off?

1342
01:48:45,287 --> 01:48:47,087
No, we just talked and...

1343
01:48:47,138 --> 01:48:49,144
Oh so
- so you haven't seen her back?

1344
01:48:49,336 --> 01:48:50,324
I haven't-

1345
01:48:50,434 --> 01:48:53,529
No no no, now Steven's right,
you might find this interesting.

1346
01:48:53,589 --> 01:48:57,219
Hildi, com'on take off your dress,
show Dr. Schultz your back here, go on!

1347
01:48:57,258 --> 01:49:01,263
Uh, Calvin, I just got her all
dressed up and looking nice.

1348
01:49:01,365 --> 01:49:05,784
But... Lara Lee, Dr. Schultz is from
Dusseldorf, they don't got niggers there.

1349
01:49:05,993 --> 01:49:07,474
He's a man of medicine.

1350
01:49:07,631 --> 01:49:10,537
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers endurance for pain.

1351
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:14,089
These niggers are tough Dr.
Schultz, no doubt about it.

1352
01:49:14,176 --> 01:49:16,595
Hilda's got somethin' like
four lashes on her back.

1353
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:19,054
Lare Lee, just get
- why don't you lose her goddamn mat?

1354
01:49:19,086 --> 01:49:21,091
Look a' that, doctor, it's
like a painting, look at that.

1355
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:22,190
Calvin!

1356
01:49:23,096 --> 01:49:26,181
We are eating, ain't no one
wanna look at her whipped up back!

1357
01:49:28,197 --> 01:49:30,241
Fine. Fine, fine fine fine...

1358
01:49:30,507 --> 01:49:32,981
After the dinner,
Steven. After dinner.

1359
01:49:34,216 --> 01:49:35,715
During the brandies, gentlemen. Uh?

1360
01:49:42,147 --> 01:49:44,247
Cora, come get this girl!

1361
01:49:47,196 --> 01:49:49,498
She all messed.
- Yes ma'am?

1362
01:49:49,951 --> 01:49:51,965
Oh! Why are you all undone?

1363
01:49:52,012 --> 01:49:54,676
I just got you done,
now come over, here!

1364
01:50:01,077 --> 01:50:04,981
Baby, you got Steven his bad side,
when you need to be on his blind side.

1365
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:07,168
You said you ain't know him?

1366
01:50:08,197 --> 01:50:09,332
Huh?

1367
01:50:09,469 --> 01:50:14,451
I said... you said
you ain't know him.

1368
01:50:16,316 --> 01:50:17,876
I don't.

1369
01:50:18,236 --> 01:50:19,559
Yes you do.

1370
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:22,985
Mister Steven...

1371
01:50:24,393 --> 01:50:25,712
I don't.

1372
01:50:25,907 --> 01:50:27,707
Why is you lyin' to me?

1373
01:50:30,342 --> 01:50:31,678
I ain't.

1374
01:50:32,156 --> 01:50:34,116
Then why is you cry?

1375
01:50:35,017 --> 01:50:36,382
You scarin' me.

1376
01:50:36,622 --> 01:50:38,422
Why is I'm scarin' you?

1377
01:50:39,255 --> 01:50:40,955
Because you scary.

1378
01:50:42,689 --> 01:50:49,077
.. to speak German this afternoon with
Hildi, was positively soul enriching.

1379
01:50:52,139 --> 01:50:54,863
You stay in that chair.

1380
01:51:00,442 --> 01:51:05,041
You indicated earlier you'd
be willing to part with Hildi.

1381
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:07,953
Oh yes. Yesiree Bob I did.

1382
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:15,709
In that case... allow me...
to propose another proposition.

1383
01:51:16,084 --> 01:51:16,956
I'm all ears.

1384
01:51:17,183 --> 01:51:19,003
Hurry up, goddammit!

1385
01:51:19,969 --> 01:51:21,972
Monsieur
Candie- - Steven!

1386
01:51:22,434 --> 01:51:24,873
You just interrupted
Dr. Schultz here!

1387
01:51:25,818 --> 01:51:30,948
Uhm... sorry doctor Schultz, my
ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1388
01:51:32,308 --> 01:51:35,587
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen.

1389
01:51:36,522 --> 01:51:38,480
You mean get up outta my chair?

1390
01:51:38,618 --> 01:51:40,410
If you could manage it.

1391
01:51:40,723 --> 01:51:41,843
Why?

1392
01:51:42,135 --> 01:51:43,664
It's about dessert.

1393
01:51:43,778 --> 01:51:45,398
What about dessert?

1394
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:48,559
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1395
01:51:48,635 --> 01:51:50,695
We're havin' white cake.

1396
01:51:50,931 --> 01:51:53,436
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1397
01:51:53,585 --> 01:51:57,856
You right Monsieur Candy, you
right, I'll handle it myself.

1398
01:51:58,002 --> 01:51:59,426
Meet me in the library.

1399
01:51:59,755 --> 01:52:03,073
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to the evening,

1400
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,983
she get fucked up 'round
here, you blame me.

1401
01:52:05,078 --> 01:52:06,896
Fine, fine friend Steven, I...

1402
01:52:08,107 --> 01:52:09,662
will be along momentarily.

1403
01:52:10,409 --> 01:52:11,529
Yessir.

1404
01:52:12,363 --> 01:52:13,483
Well...

1405
01:52:14,176 --> 01:52:15,134
gentlemen...

1406
01:52:15,373 --> 01:52:18,175
as you can see, talented as
they are no doubt in the kitchen,

1407
01:52:18,207 --> 01:52:21,962
from time to time... adult
supervision is required.

1408
01:52:24,869 --> 01:52:26,827
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1409
01:52:32,784 --> 01:52:34,884
You may clear the dinner service.

1410
01:52:38,915 --> 01:52:39,812
Hurry up girl.

1411
01:52:39,966 --> 01:52:41,374
So Dr. Schultz...

1412
01:52:41,804 --> 01:52:44,622
Why don't you regal us
with the tale of the circus?

1413
01:52:45,418 --> 01:52:47,035
The circus!

1414
01:52:54,295 --> 01:52:56,095
What is the matter?

1415
01:53:01,404 --> 01:53:05,956
Them motherfuckers ain't
here to buy no mandingos.

1416
01:53:06,602 --> 01:53:08,058
They wants that girl.

1417
01:53:10,313 --> 01:53:13,053
Steven, what the hell
are you talkin' about, hm?

1418
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:16,477
They playin' your ass for a
fool, that what I'm talkin' bout.

1419
01:53:16,758 --> 01:53:20,123
They ain't here for
no muscle bound jimmie,

1420
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:22,271
they here for that girl.

1421
01:53:22,717 --> 01:53:25,278
What... what girl. What... Hildi?

1422
01:53:25,308 --> 01:53:27,587
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django?

1423
01:53:27,908 --> 01:53:30,016
Them niggers know each other.

1424
01:53:31,001 --> 01:53:32,717
He... he just bought Eskimo Joe.

1425
01:53:32,722 --> 01:53:34,053
Did he give you any money?

1426
01:53:34,115 --> 01:53:35,209
No, not yet, but they go-

1427
01:53:35,229 --> 01:53:37,722
Then he didn't buy
diddly, not yet no how.

1428
01:53:37,912 --> 01:53:43,152
But he's just about to buy who he come
here to buy, when I interrupted him.

1429
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:46,337
Thank you Steven.
You're welcome Calvin.

1430
01:53:51,966 --> 01:53:54,213
Whe
- where you gettin' all this?

1431
01:53:55,002 --> 01:53:57,489
Why would they go through all
that trouble for a nigger with a-

1432
01:53:57,496 --> 01:53:59,913
with a chewed up back, ain't
worth three hundred dollars?

1433
01:54:00,095 --> 01:54:03,733
They're doin' it cause that
nigger Django's in love with Hildi.

1434
01:54:04,265 --> 01:54:05,934
She probably his wife.

1435
01:54:06,172 --> 01:54:10,060
Now, why that German give a fuck who that
uppity son-of-a-bitch is in love with,

1436
01:54:10,074 --> 01:54:12,274
I'm sure I don't know.

1437
01:54:15,039 --> 01:54:16,915
If she's who they want...

1438
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:21,474
why this whole... snake oil
pitch about mandingos in?

1439
01:54:21,836 --> 01:54:24,818
You wouldn't pay no never
mind into three hundred dollar.

1440
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:27,149
But that twelve thousand?

1441
01:54:28,457 --> 01:54:30,644
That made you real
friendly now, didn'it?

1442
01:54:33,639 --> 01:54:35,039
Yes it did.

1443
01:54:38,746 --> 01:54:39,879
His wife, uh?

1444
01:54:44,652 --> 01:54:46,509
If it had been a snake...

1445
01:54:46,883 --> 01:54:48,290
we would have beat'em.

1446
01:54:51,424 --> 01:54:56,289
Those lyin'... goddamn time...

1447
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:59,979
wastin' sonsabitches.

1448
01:55:02,224 --> 01:55:03,784
Sonsabitches!

1449
01:55:03,917 --> 01:55:08,859
.. out of New Orleans, so I had quite
a bit of practice with... theaters types.

1450
01:55:10,095 --> 01:55:11,745
Oh there you are!

1451
01:55:11,845 --> 01:55:15,420
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow ran off together.

1452
01:55:16,724 --> 01:55:18,831
That'd be a hell of
a note, wouldn't it?

1453
01:55:19,099 --> 01:55:20,112
Lara Lee...

1454
01:55:20,354 --> 01:55:21,971
I was just lookin'
out the big window.

1455
01:55:22,045 --> 01:55:23,937
Billy Crash is out
there dealin' with some

1456
01:55:23,972 --> 01:55:26,368
shady slaver try n'
sellin' a passel of ponys,

1457
01:55:26,378 --> 01:55:29,617
would you be a dear and go out
there give them gals an eyeball.

1458
01:55:30,501 --> 01:55:33,301
- Of course, brother.
- Thank you, darling.

1459
01:55:45,947 --> 01:55:49,360
Okay. Business never sleeps.

1460
01:55:51,654 --> 01:55:53,054
A propos...

1461
01:55:53,202 --> 01:55:58,932
before your exit, we were discussing the
possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1462
01:55:59,027 --> 01:56:01,309
Ah yes! Yes we would.

1463
01:56:02,028 --> 01:56:04,387
And we will again... in a moment.

1464
01:56:20,488 --> 01:56:22,588
Who is your little friend?

1465
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:29,150
This is Ben...

1466
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:35,248
He's a Ol'Joe that... lived
around here for a long time.

1467
01:56:35,811 --> 01:56:37,911
And I do mean a long damn time.

1468
01:56:39,303 --> 01:56:40,703
Well Ben here...

1469
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:43,170
took care of my daddy...

1470
01:56:43,733 --> 01:56:45,553
and my daddy's daddy...

1471
01:56:46,129 --> 01:56:48,275
till the open kill doe who one day...

1472
01:56:51,377 --> 01:56:52,859
who been took care o'me.

1473
01:56:55,633 --> 01:56:59,537
Growin'up the son of a... of a
huge plantation owner in Mississippi

1474
01:56:59,551 --> 01:57:05,541
puts a white men in contact with
a whole lot o'... black faces.

1475
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:12,336
I spent my whole life here...
right here... in Candyland...

1476
01:57:13,704 --> 01:57:17,233
surrounded... by black faces.

1477
01:57:19,546 --> 01:57:22,614
And seein' them ev'ry
day, day in day out, I...

1478
01:57:23,216 --> 01:57:24,918
I only had one question.

1479
01:57:28,987 --> 01:57:30,620
Why don't they kill us?

1480
01:57:34,727 --> 01:57:36,654
Now right up there on that porch...

1481
01:57:37,077 --> 01:57:39,568
three times a week for fifty years,

1482
01:57:39,702 --> 01:57:44,262
Ol'Ben here... would shave my
Daddy with a straight razor.

1483
01:57:45,004 --> 01:57:50,126
Now... if I was Ol'Ben, I would
have cut my Daddy's goddamn throat,

1484
01:57:50,185 --> 01:57:53,925
and it wouldn't have taken me
no fifty years to do it neither.

1485
01:57:56,276 --> 01:57:57,688
But he never did.

1486
01:57:59,532 --> 01:58:00,652
Why not?

1487
01:58:02,186 --> 01:58:03,061
You see...

1488
01:58:03,490 --> 01:58:05,818
the science of analogy...

1489
01:58:06,871 --> 01:58:12,071
is crucial to understandin' the...
separation about two species.

1490
01:58:13,873 --> 01:58:16,277
In the skull of the African here...

1491
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:20,228
the area associated
with submissiveness

1492
01:58:20,296 --> 01:58:25,559
is larger than any human or any other
sup human species on planet earth.

1493
01:58:41,490 --> 01:58:43,310
If you examine...

1494
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:46,690
this peace of skull here...

1495
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:56,982
you'll notice three distinct dimples.

1496
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:03,574
Here... here... and here.

1497
01:59:04,019 --> 01:59:05,139
Now...

1498
01:59:05,449 --> 01:59:10,212
If I was holding a skull of a
- of a... of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1499
01:59:10,611 --> 01:59:14,882
these three dimples would be found in the
area o'the skull most associated with...

1500
01:59:15,226 --> 01:59:16,626
creativity.

1501
01:59:17,224 --> 01:59:19,324
Î’ut thÑ–Ñ•' thÐµ
Ñ•kull Ð¾f ÎŸl'Î’Ðµn.

1502
01:59:20,036 --> 01:59:23,916
And in the skull of
Ol'Ben, unburden by genes,

1503
01:59:24,513 --> 01:59:28,721
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1504
01:59:29,675 --> 01:59:31,075
servility.

1505
01:59:32,394 --> 01:59:33,899
Now Bright Boy...

1506
01:59:34,767 --> 01:59:37,007
I will admit you are pretty clever.

1507
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:41,342
But if I took this hammer here...

1508
01:59:43,753 --> 01:59:45,750
and I bashed it in your skull...

1509
01:59:47,062 --> 01:59:49,445
you would have the
same three dimples...

1510
01:59:50,172 --> 01:59:51,966
in the same place...

1511
01:59:53,794 --> 01:59:55,161
as Ol'Ben.

1512
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:59,910
Now lay your palms
flat on the table top!

1513
02:00:00,008 --> 02:00:03,051
If you lift those palms off
that turtle shell table top,

1514
02:00:03,104 --> 02:00:06,349
Mr. Butch is gonna let loose with
both barrels of that sawed off!

1515
02:00:07,454 --> 02:00:10,796
There have been a latta lies said
around this diner table here tonight,

1516
02:00:10,822 --> 02:00:12,446
but that you can believe!

1517
02:00:13,647 --> 02:00:14,754
Mr. Moguy,

1518
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:18,618
would you be so kind as to collect the
pistol hangin' on those boys hips here?

1519
02:00:23,452 --> 02:00:24,832
Thank you ever so much.

1520
02:00:24,903 --> 02:00:26,023
Doctor.

1521
02:00:30,402 --> 02:00:31,681
Where were we?

1522
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:37,459
Jackass.

1523
02:00:41,365 --> 02:00:42,804
Oh yes...

1524
02:00:43,314 --> 02:00:48,077
I do believe you were just getting ready
to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1525
02:00:48,751 --> 02:00:50,029
I am right?

1526
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:55,120
Right then.

1527
02:00:57,822 --> 02:00:59,321
Bring out Hildi!

1528
02:01:02,509 --> 02:01:03,629
Your way, honey.

1529
02:01:05,217 --> 02:01:07,417
Sit your ass in that goddamn chair!

1530
02:01:07,441 --> 02:01:08,886
Lay your hands flat on that table.

1531
02:01:08,941 --> 02:01:10,761
And shut your mouth!

1532
02:01:14,597 --> 02:01:18,986
Dr. Schultz... in
Greenville, you yourself said,

1533
02:01:19,090 --> 02:01:21,251
that for the ""Right Nigger""
you'd be willing to pay

1534
02:01:21,267 --> 02:01:24,400
what some may consider
is a ridiculous amount.

1535
02:01:25,079 --> 02:01:28,053
To which, me myself said, ""What is
your definition of ridiculous? "",

1536
02:01:28,081 --> 02:01:31,920
to which you said,
""Twelve thousand dollars"".

1537
02:01:32,989 --> 02:01:36,799
Now considering you all have
ridden a whole lotta miles,

1538
02:01:36,961 --> 02:01:38,641
went to a whole lotta trouble,

1539
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:43,484
and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
purchase this lovely lady right here,

1540
02:01:43,516 --> 02:01:48,810
it would appear that Broomhilda
is in fact the ""Right Nigger""!

1541
02:01:50,063 --> 02:01:52,740
And if y'all wanna leave
Candyland with Broomhilda...

1542
02:01:53,829 --> 02:01:59,146
the price is twelve thousand dollars.

1543
02:01:59,539 --> 02:02:03,693
And I take it you prefer the ""take
it or leave it"" style of negotiating?

1544
02:02:05,615 --> 02:02:07,435
Yes I do, doctor.

1545
02:02:07,976 --> 02:02:14,106
You see, under the laws of Chickasaw
County, Broomhilda here is my property.

1546
02:02:14,653 --> 02:02:19,869
And I can chose to do with my
property whatever I so desire!

1547
02:02:21,064 --> 02:02:27,608
And if you all think my price
for this nigger here is too steep,

1548
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:30,427
what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1549
02:02:33,550 --> 02:02:37,571
take this fuckin' hammer here,
and beat her ass to death with it!

1550
02:02:37,651 --> 02:02:39,187
Right in front of both y'all!

1551
02:02:39,201 --> 02:02:40,060
Ain't it good, fella?

1552
02:02:40,063 --> 02:02:44,451
Then we can examine the three
dimples inside Broomhilda skull!

1553
02:02:44,647 --> 02:02:45,910
Now!

1554
02:02:46,043 --> 02:02:48,332
What's it gonna be, Doc? Huh?

1555
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:50,169
What's it gonna be?

1556
02:02:50,184 --> 02:02:53,784
May I lift the hands off the table
top in order to remove my billfold?

1557
02:02:55,597 --> 02:02:56,719
Yes you may.

1558
02:03:10,578 --> 02:03:11,698
That twelve.

1559
02:03:15,826 --> 02:03:17,245
Sold!

1560
02:03:17,957 --> 02:03:23,618
To the man with the exceptional
beard, and his unexceptional nigger.

1561
02:03:29,701 --> 02:03:31,724
Mr. Moguy.
- Yes Calvin?

1562
02:03:32,738 --> 02:03:36,071
You make this gentleman a receipt
for twelve thousand dollar, please.

1563
02:03:36,236 --> 02:03:39,054
- Twelve thousand dollar.
- Hm.

1564
02:03:41,074 --> 02:03:43,474
It was a pleasure doin'
business with ya all.

1565
02:03:44,046 --> 02:03:45,482
Now gentlemen...

1566
02:03:46,834 --> 02:03:48,927
If you care to join
me in the parlor...

1567
02:03:49,771 --> 02:03:52,074
we will be serving white cake.

1568
02:05:20,445 --> 02:05:21,997
Well done, Calvin.

1569
02:05:24,815 --> 02:05:27,633
Excuse me... Excuse me, madam?

1570
02:05:28,821 --> 02:05:31,225
Could you please stop
playing Beethoven?

1571
02:05:31,269 --> 02:05:32,607
Take your hands off that harp!

1572
02:05:36,993 --> 02:05:38,113
Doctor!

1573
02:05:38,389 --> 02:05:40,988
- Doc, you can't go in there!
- Hey uh, Steven, hey!

1574
02:05:40,998 --> 02:05:43,011
- He got no business goin' in there.
- Let it be.

1575
02:05:43,806 --> 02:05:47,186
He's a little upset, that's
all. I'll handle this.

1576
02:06:12,941 --> 02:06:14,061
White cake?

1577
02:06:15,204 --> 02:06:18,004
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1578
02:06:27,530 --> 02:06:29,996
You brooding 'bout me
getting the best of ya, uh?

1579
02:06:30,911 --> 02:06:35,432
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1580
02:06:35,674 --> 02:06:37,026
D'Artagnan.

1581
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:41,427
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.

1582
02:06:42,251 --> 02:06:44,051
Come again?

1583
02:06:46,936 --> 02:06:50,785
Alexandre Dumas. He wrote
""The Three Musketeers"".

1584
02:06:51,207 --> 02:06:52,918
Yes of course, doctor.

1585
02:06:52,957 --> 02:06:54,703
I figured you must be an admirer,

1586
02:06:54,713 --> 02:06:58,486
you named your slave after
his novel's lead character.

1587
02:06:59,441 --> 02:07:03,059
Now if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1588
02:07:03,110 --> 02:07:05,350
I wonder what he
would have made of it?

1589
02:07:07,344 --> 02:07:08,990
You doubt he'd approve?

1590
02:07:11,151 --> 02:07:16,180
Yes, his approval would be a
dubious proposition at best.

1591
02:07:18,574 --> 02:07:20,347
Soft hearted Frenchy?

1592
02:07:22,377 --> 02:07:24,377
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1593
02:07:28,469 --> 02:07:30,304
Are these Broomhilda's papers?

1594
02:07:30,414 --> 02:07:32,232
- Yes they are.
- May I?

1595
02:07:32,365 --> 02:07:34,159
- Of course!
- Thank you.

1596
02:07:36,863 --> 02:07:42,071
I dealt her bill of sale of ownership is
written of course a freedom papers, doctor.

1597
02:07:42,291 --> 02:07:44,452
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1598
02:07:45,653 --> 02:07:47,523
Right over there,
on that little table.

1599
02:07:47,617 --> 02:07:49,017
Thank you.

1600
02:08:09,888 --> 02:08:11,288
Thank you.

1601
02:08:14,773 --> 02:08:16,593
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1602
02:08:19,084 --> 02:08:21,302
consider yourself a free woman.

1603
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:35,320
Mister Candy...

1604
02:08:37,248 --> 02:08:40,753
Normally, I would
say ""auf wiedersehen"".

1605
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:45,673
But since what ""auf wiedersehen""
actually means is ""till I see you again"",

1606
02:08:46,370 --> 02:08:49,703
and since I never wish to
see you again, to you sir,

1607
02:08:50,133 --> 02:08:52,735
I say good bye.

1608
02:08:56,983 --> 02:08:58,383
Let's go.

1609
02:08:59,723 --> 02:09:00,843
Com'on.

1610
02:09:02,858 --> 02:09:05,258
One more moment, Doctor!

1611
02:09:06,650 --> 02:09:07,726
What?

1612
02:09:12,293 --> 02:09:14,470
It's a custom here in the South,

1613
02:09:14,996 --> 02:09:18,165
once a business deal is
concluded that the two parties...

1614
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:20,541
shake hands.

1615
02:09:21,277 --> 02:09:22,664
It implies good faith.

1616
02:09:23,474 --> 02:09:25,593
- I'm not from the South.
- But you are...

1617
02:09:26,592 --> 02:09:28,125
in my house doctor...

1618
02:09:29,711 --> 02:09:31,316
so I'm afraid I must insist.

1619
02:09:31,589 --> 02:09:35,088
Insist? On what? That
I shake your hand?

1620
02:09:35,105 --> 02:09:38,235
Oh, then I'm afraid I must
insist in the opposite direction.

1621
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:40,453
You know what I think you are?

1622
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:43,640
What you think I am? No I don't.

1623
02:09:45,490 --> 02:09:47,657
I think you are a bad loser.

1624
02:09:47,831 --> 02:09:50,831
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1625
02:09:51,026 --> 02:09:52,539
Never the less...

1626
02:09:52,886 --> 02:09:55,781
here in Chickasaw
County, a deal ain't done

1627
02:09:56,110 --> 02:09:58,734
until the two parties
have shook hands.

1628
02:09:59,375 --> 02:10:02,419
Even after all that paper
signin', don't mean shit...

1629
02:10:03,341 --> 02:10:06,385
you don't shake my hand.

1630
02:10:07,729 --> 02:10:10,664
If I don't shake your hand,

1631
02:10:10,859 --> 02:10:13,507
you're gonna throw away
twelve thousand dollars?

1632
02:10:13,688 --> 02:10:15,787
I don't think so.

1633
02:10:16,609 --> 02:10:18,289
Mr. Butch,

1634
02:10:19,657 --> 02:10:23,662
if she tries to leave here before this
nigger lovin' German shakes my hand,

1635
02:10:24,432 --> 02:10:26,592
you cut her ass down.

1636
02:10:48,171 --> 02:10:51,424
You really want me
to shake your hand?

1637
02:10:52,951 --> 02:10:54,511
I insist.

1638
02:10:55,972 --> 02:10:58,222
If you insist.

1639
02:11:16,453 --> 02:11:18,212
Aaah Calvin!

1640
02:11:19,108 --> 02:11:21,206
Caalvin!

1641
02:11:26,976 --> 02:11:29,432
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1642
02:11:42,143 --> 02:11:44,078
The nigger's going crazy, the hell-

1643
02:11:44,727 --> 02:11:47,396
Help, he's blowing everybody
- Aaah!

1644
02:12:04,453 --> 02:12:06,575
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1645
02:12:10,728 --> 02:12:11,848
Get that fuckin'...

1646
02:12:12,476 --> 02:12:13,596
Get that fuckin'-

1647
02:12:16,567 --> 02:12:21,182
Damn sonofabitch, what- what
did the fuckin'- goddammit!

1648
02:12:22,846 --> 02:12:23,966
What the-

1649
02:12:25,672 --> 02:12:27,039
Don't strike me!

1650
02:12:27,132 --> 02:12:28,857
You stupid sonofabitch!

1651
02:12:28,928 --> 02:12:30,328
Sorry Jessie!

1652
02:12:30,404 --> 02:12:34,995
Who the fuck gave a
nigger a goddamn gun!

1653
02:13:08,190 --> 02:13:10,515
Nigger, com'on and kill-

1654
02:13:10,922 --> 02:13:14,169
Aah! God! Ah my God, aah!

1655
02:13:14,289 --> 02:13:16,138
Motherfucker!

1656
02:14:35,634 --> 02:14:37,454
Hold your fire!

1657
02:14:40,294 --> 02:14:42,114
Hold your fire!

1658
02:14:43,597 --> 02:14:45,697
Stop shooting, goddammit!

1659
02:14:54,284 --> 02:14:55,404
Django!

1660
02:14:56,285 --> 02:14:57,405
What?

1661
02:15:00,267 --> 02:15:02,087
We got your woman!

1662
02:15:03,273 --> 02:15:06,342
Billy Crash here ha' got
his pistol upside her hair!

1663
02:15:06,841 --> 02:15:08,880
You'll stop all that gettin'on,

1664
02:15:08,982 --> 02:15:11,518
he don't blow her goddamn brains out.

1665
02:15:11,693 --> 02:15:13,582
And that ain't no third holes, boy!

1666
02:15:14,535 --> 02:15:15,907
That there is a promise.

1667
02:15:17,509 --> 02:15:18,629
Oh oh!

1668
02:15:18,970 --> 02:15:20,090
You ain't give up?

1669
02:15:20,546 --> 02:15:22,646
Thought you going, uh?

1670
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,080
We will kill you!

1671
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:25,850
How shit?!

1672
02:15:26,052 --> 02:15:28,776
Honest, ain't lyin',
Django, I swear o' all God.

1673
02:15:30,177 --> 02:15:31,297
You give up?

1674
02:15:32,151 --> 02:15:34,422
Ain't no harm gonna come t'you.

1675
02:15:36,306 --> 02:15:38,352
And I'm supposed to
believe your black ass?

1676
02:15:38,728 --> 02:15:41,858
Personal, I ain't give a good goddamn
what you believe or don't believe!

1677
02:15:41,890 --> 02:15:44,965
I believe, if you don't give
up in the next ten seconds,

1678
02:15:44,979 --> 02:15:47,140
we gonna blow this bitch
her brains out! Believe that!

1679
02:15:47,159 --> 02:15:48,968
Believe that!

1680
02:15:53,184 --> 02:15:54,582
You give me up.

1681
02:15:54,824 --> 02:15:55,527
Six!

1682
02:15:55,551 --> 02:15:56,871
Just let me go!

1683
02:15:57,021 --> 02:15:57,769
Seven!

1684
02:15:57,797 --> 02:15:59,271
- I take care too much.
- Django.

1685
02:15:59,341 --> 02:16:00,195
Eight!

1686
02:16:00,524 --> 02:16:01,924
I love you.

1687
02:16:01,993 --> 02:16:03,113
Nine!

1688
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:04,888
- Hold it!
- No!

1689
02:16:07,279 --> 02:16:08,607
I give up.

1690
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:11,562
I can't hear you, nigger.

1691
02:16:12,469 --> 02:16:14,547
I said: I give up!

1692
02:18:14,968 --> 02:18:16,793
Hock a litl'e doodle, nigger.

1693
02:18:22,496 --> 02:18:24,775
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1694
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:27,840
I knew there was something
fishy 'bout y'all.

1695
02:18:29,356 --> 02:18:34,025
We found your ""wanted"" posters... and
book of figures in your saddle bags.

1696
02:18:35,762 --> 02:18:37,307
I gotta say...

1697
02:18:38,115 --> 02:18:40,706
I ain't never heard of no
black bounty hunter before.

1698
02:18:41,432 --> 02:18:44,742
A black boy paid to kill white men,
how d'you like that line of work?

1699
02:18:45,570 --> 02:18:48,370
Prob'bly pretty good
while it lasted, uh?

1700
02:18:57,983 --> 02:19:00,099
Time to say goodnight
to them nuts, black.

1701
02:19:00,282 --> 02:19:01,365
On three...

1702
02:19:02,149 --> 02:19:03,248
One...

1703
02:19:03,788 --> 02:19:04,756
I got you.

1704
02:19:05,506 --> 02:19:06,692
Two...

1705
02:19:06,973 --> 02:19:08,892
Calm down nigger, keep calm.

1706
02:19:10,033 --> 02:19:11,153
Cap't?

1707
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:13,160
Miss Lara wants to see you.

1708
02:19:14,265 --> 02:19:17,073
That is somethin' to do
with the Old Man's funeral.

1709
02:19:18,455 --> 02:19:21,922
Oh, and she changed her
mind 'bout snippin' Django.

1710
02:19:23,079 --> 02:19:26,381
She gonna give 'em to
the LeQuint Dickey people.

1711
02:19:27,671 --> 02:19:30,231
Well she didn't waste
a minute tellin' me.

1712
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:39,197
How disappointing.

1713
02:20:01,815 --> 02:20:02,935
You n' me.

1714
02:20:04,907 --> 02:20:06,027
These ain't...

1715
02:20:06,453 --> 02:20:08,273
what you take with you.

1716
02:20:11,333 --> 02:20:14,854
Your black ass been all the
motherfuckers' in that Big House

1717
02:20:14,909 --> 02:20:17,539
could talk about for
the last few hours.

1718
02:20:18,446 --> 02:20:22,342
Seemed like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in their life,

1719
02:20:22,363 --> 02:20:24,803
was comin' up with all kinds
o'ways to kill your ass.

1720
02:20:25,014 --> 02:20:30,621
Now mind ya, most of 'dem ideas had
to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.

1721
02:20:30,697 --> 02:20:35,999
Now, that may seem like a
good idea, but truth is...

1722
02:20:37,669 --> 02:20:43,338
when you snip a nigger's nuts,
most of 'em bleed out, know 'bout...

1723
02:20:43,612 --> 02:20:45,612
seven minutes, most of 'em...

1724
02:20:47,992 --> 02:20:49,419
More than most.

1725
02:20:50,140 --> 02:20:51,739
Then I say is...

1726
02:20:53,504 --> 02:20:55,340
Hells bells...

1727
02:20:56,180 --> 02:21:00,174
the niggers we sell to LeQuint
Dickey, got it worse then that.

1728
02:21:01,244 --> 02:21:04,069
And they're still sayin'
""Let's whip 'em to death"",

1729
02:21:04,145 --> 02:21:07,595
""Dump 'em to the mandingos"",
""Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs"".

1730
02:21:07,831 --> 02:21:12,891
And I say, ""What's so special 'bout
that? We do that shit all the time!

1731
02:21:13,048 --> 02:21:19,295
Hells bells, the niggers we sell to
LeQuint Dickey got it worse then that"".

1732
02:21:20,410 --> 02:21:27,136
Low and behold, out of nowhere, miss
Lara come up with the bright idea

1733
02:21:28,078 --> 02:21:32,739
of givin' your ass to the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1734
02:21:34,170 --> 02:21:38,519
And as a slave of the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

1735
02:21:39,254 --> 02:21:42,783
hence forth, till the day you die,

1736
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:45,986
all day, ev'ryday,

1737
02:21:46,236 --> 02:21:48,843
you will be swingin' a sledgehammer,

1738
02:21:49,192 --> 02:21:53,272
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1739
02:21:54,440 --> 02:21:58,680
Now when you get there, they
gonna take away your name,

1740
02:21:58,844 --> 02:22:01,599
give you a number,
and a sledgehammer,

1741
02:22:02,021 --> 02:22:03,857
and say ""get to work"".

1742
02:22:04,662 --> 02:22:07,112
One word of says, they
cuts out your tongue,

1743
02:22:07,187 --> 02:22:09,513
they's good at that too,
you won't believe that.

1744
02:22:09,770 --> 02:22:12,043
Ooh, they does that for you.

1745
02:22:13,502 --> 02:22:19,845
They gonna work you, all day,
ev'ry day, till your back give up.

1746
02:22:20,407 --> 02:22:22,896
Then they gonna hit you in
the head with the hammer,

1747
02:22:23,039 --> 02:22:25,388
tow your ass down the nigger hole.

1748
02:22:25,881 --> 02:22:31,175
And that... will be the
story end for you, Django.

1749
02:23:19,896 --> 02:23:21,716
Hey, white boy...

1750
02:23:22,982 --> 02:23:24,802
I said: hey, white boy!

1751
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:27,906
Shut up, black, you ain't got
nothing to say I wanna hear.

1752
02:23:27,938 --> 02:23:30,647
How'd you like to make
eleven thousand dollars?

1753
02:23:30,694 --> 02:23:31,980
D'you ain't hear?

1754
02:23:32,018 --> 02:23:34,766
I said, how d'you like to
make eleven thousand dollars?

1755
02:23:35,722 --> 02:23:37,821
Eleven thousand five
hundred, actually.

1756
02:23:38,267 --> 02:23:40,235
What the fuck are you talking about?

1757
02:23:40,306 --> 02:23:42,522
Back there at that
plantation Candyland,

1758
02:23:42,676 --> 02:23:45,126
there was an eleven thousand
five hundred dollar fortune,

1759
02:23:45,148 --> 02:23:47,868
just sittin' there, and
y'all rode right past it.

1760
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:50,437
You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.

1761
02:23:50,566 --> 02:23:53,446
I ain't sayin' that, nice
thing 'bout this fortune it is.

1762
02:23:53,661 --> 02:23:56,104
It ain't illegal, you can't steal it,

1763
02:23:57,003 --> 02:23:58,430
ya gotta earn it, white boy.

1764
02:23:59,133 --> 02:24:01,305
You got something to
say, mate, you say it.

1765
02:24:01,457 --> 02:24:04,738
The eleven thousand five hundred dollar
fortune waiting for you back at Candyland,

1766
02:24:04,786 --> 02:24:07,236
is in the form of a
wanted dead or alive bounty

1767
02:24:07,253 --> 02:24:09,352
on Smitty Bacall,
and the Bacall Gang.

1768
02:24:09,493 --> 02:24:11,352
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1769
02:24:11,393 --> 02:24:14,609
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this
murdering gang of stagecoach robbers,

1770
02:24:14,784 --> 02:24:16,415
the Bacall Gang.

1771
02:24:16,526 --> 02:24:19,533
There's a seven thousand dollar
wanted dead or alive bounty on him,

1772
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:23,071
one thousand five hundred dollars
for each of his three accomplices.

1773
02:24:23,274 --> 02:24:24,461
Dandy Michaels,

1774
02:24:25,227 --> 02:24:26,347
Gerald Nash,

1775
02:24:26,618 --> 02:24:28,858
Crazy Craig Koons.

1776
02:24:29,686 --> 02:24:32,465
Now all four o'them gentlemen,
they're back there at Candyland,

1777
02:24:32,535 --> 02:24:34,650
laughin' their ass off. You know why?

1778
02:24:34,876 --> 02:24:37,076
Cause they just got away with murder.

1779
02:24:37,342 --> 02:24:39,011
But it ain't got to be that way.

1780
02:24:39,085 --> 02:24:42,504
You and your mate, young
rabbit and Yango get that money.

1781
02:24:42,559 --> 02:24:43,856
What these jokers do again?

1782
02:24:43,903 --> 02:24:46,721
These sonofabitch, they
- they killed innocent people.

1783
02:24:47,362 --> 02:24:49,906
Stagecoach robbery.
Innocent white people!

1784
02:24:51,836 --> 02:24:54,719
I got the handbill right here in
my pocket if you let me get it.

1785
02:24:54,767 --> 02:24:56,167
Get it here.

1786
02:24:58,015 --> 02:25:03,255
Wanted dead or alive... Smitty
Bacall and the Smitty Bacall gang.

1787
02:25:03,301 --> 02:25:04,853
But you're a slave!

1788
02:25:05,143 --> 02:25:06,963
I ain't no goddamn slave!

1789
02:25:07,533 --> 02:25:08,921
Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?

1790
02:25:08,976 --> 02:25:11,458
- 7000 dollars for Smitty
Bacall... - This is a shit load!

1791
02:25:11,638 --> 02:25:13,169
I'm a bounty hunter.

1792
02:25:14,837 --> 02:25:19,293
Yesterday, as a free man,
I rode in the Candyland,

1793
02:25:19,327 --> 02:25:23,549
on a horse, with my German
white partner, Dr. King Schultz.

1794
02:25:24,222 --> 02:25:28,727
We tracked the Bacall gang all the
way from Texas, to Chikasaw County.

1795
02:25:29,088 --> 02:25:31,742
We finally found their ass
laying low at Candyland.

1796
02:25:32,102 --> 02:25:35,271
We went in there to get
'em, things went sour,

1797
02:25:35,670 --> 02:25:38,732
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot.

1798
02:25:39,207 --> 02:25:43,157
Then ev'rybody there decided
to blame me, so here I am.

1799
02:25:45,447 --> 02:25:47,390
But Django ain't on that manifest,

1800
02:25:47,539 --> 02:25:50,200
and all o'you know I ain't
supposed to be on this trip.

1801
02:25:50,616 --> 02:25:53,566
But them four men are still
back there, they're still wanted,

1802
02:25:54,062 --> 02:25:56,236
and that eleven thousand
five hundred is up for grabs,

1803
02:25:56,245 --> 02:25:59,202
and the last thing they'd expect
is y'all ridin' back and gittin' it.

1804
02:25:59,713 --> 02:26:01,533
What's the deal?

1805
02:26:02,055 --> 02:26:05,974
You tell us who they are
and we... turn you lose?

1806
02:26:06,272 --> 02:26:08,372
I ain't tellin' who they are.

1807
02:26:08,504 --> 02:26:11,738
Look, you give me a
pistol, one o'them horses,

1808
02:26:11,993 --> 02:26:14,957
and five hundred dollars of that
eleven thousand five hundred,

1809
02:26:15,242 --> 02:26:16,652
and I'll point 'em out to you.

1810
02:26:16,838 --> 02:26:18,173
This a real handbill.

1811
02:26:18,567 --> 02:26:22,126
Ah jus'cause it's a real handbill's
doesn't mean that other bunch o'malarky is.

1812
02:26:22,226 --> 02:26:28,239
Now why would a slave have a wanted
dead or alive handbill in his pocket?

1813
02:26:32,846 --> 02:26:36,046
Ain't that black ridin'
into Candyland yesterday?

1814
02:26:42,014 --> 02:26:43,097
Alright...

1815
02:26:43,853 --> 02:26:45,878
I'm gonna ask you again...

1816
02:26:47,310 --> 02:26:49,613
I want you to remember
I don't like liars.

1817
02:26:50,534 --> 02:26:55,930
Is he a Candyland slave, or did he ride
in with a white man on horse yesterday?

1818
02:26:56,415 --> 02:26:57,535
Yeah.

1819
02:26:58,531 --> 02:27:00,656
They walked us from the
Greenville Auction and

1820
02:27:00,657 --> 02:27:02,731
he rode in on a horse
with a white man.

1821
02:27:03,659 --> 02:27:05,836
And this white man...

1822
02:27:06,039 --> 02:27:07,667
was the black his slave?

1823
02:27:08,081 --> 02:27:09,635
He weren't no slave.

1824
02:27:09,782 --> 02:27:11,675
You
- you fuckin' sure about that?

1825
02:27:11,821 --> 02:27:13,221
Damn sure.

1826
02:27:17,504 --> 02:27:19,291
What happened over at Candyland?

1827
02:27:19,354 --> 02:27:20,408
Bunch of shootin'...

1828
02:27:21,033 --> 02:27:22,338
master got shot.

1829
02:27:23,018 --> 02:27:24,674
- Who shot 'em?
- The German.

1830
02:27:25,164 --> 02:27:26,375
Why did he do that?

1831
02:27:26,911 --> 02:27:30,403
The nigger and the German was actin'
like they were slavers, but they weren't.

1832
02:27:30,724 --> 02:27:32,409
Well, what were they?

1833
02:27:32,586 --> 02:27:34,284
Bounty hunters.

1834
02:27:35,098 --> 02:27:37,758
Fuck me Roy, I mean this
- this could be big, mate!

1835
02:27:39,174 --> 02:27:40,499
Well, smoke...

1836
02:27:41,281 --> 02:27:42,679
you gotta deal.

1837
02:27:43,941 --> 02:27:45,374
I got one more condition.

1838
02:27:45,986 --> 02:27:46,923
What is that?

1839
02:27:47,007 --> 02:27:49,864
When we get there...
when the time come...

1840
02:27:52,184 --> 02:27:54,041
you let me help you kill 'em.

1841
02:27:55,331 --> 02:27:56,977
You're a funny bugger!

1842
02:27:57,216 --> 02:27:58,992
- Get him loose.
- Yeah, yeah.

1843
02:27:59,461 --> 02:28:01,482
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

1844
02:28:01,607 --> 02:28:03,263
You got yourself a deal, mate.

1845
02:28:05,577 --> 02:28:07,887
- You alright for a black fella!
- Oh yeah!

1846
02:28:09,934 --> 02:28:11,054
Jeez...

1847
02:28:13,774 --> 02:28:16,224
There ya go... There ya go, mate.

1848
02:28:17,267 --> 02:28:19,667
For you, we'll give you
that pack horse over here.

1849
02:28:19,923 --> 02:28:21,860
What's them saddle bags got in?

1850
02:28:22,131 --> 02:28:23,235
Dynamite.

1851
02:28:23,262 --> 02:28:26,142
I ain't ridin' no horse with
no goddamn dynamite on his back.

1852
02:28:26,247 --> 02:28:27,471
I can understand that.

1853
02:28:28,284 --> 02:28:33,867
Frankie, we take 'em sticks off that
horse, and stick 'em in the nigger cage.

1854
02:28:35,118 --> 02:28:38,256
A little dynamite for you
black ass to play with!

1855
02:28:48,644 --> 02:28:51,393
Hey Floyd, you got that
rifle on the wagon, don't you?

1856
02:28:51,424 --> 02:28:52,338
Yeah, alright.

1857
02:28:52,479 --> 02:28:54,510
Don't you give 'em
your gun and gun belt.

1858
02:28:56,789 --> 02:28:59,325
Now, don't drop the
fucking thing, alright?

1859
02:28:59,873 --> 02:29:02,677
I just had the sights
fixed, and that perfect.

That you were never going to be this way

There's always somewhere left to turn
So don't give up now (Give up now)
You're so close to a brand new day
Yes, you are
And if you just can bear to be alone, then I'll stay

To see what you've been going through
And all that I can say is that I'm here now

Un-fucking-believable! Lil Wayne's the president
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch; call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money 'til the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him—bury him?
I know one day they got to bury him
Better lock my casket tight, baby, so I don't let the Devil in

Tied to the fuckin' Birdman like a lug
And dear Mr. Ronald Williams
To you I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim

Goin' at their heads, like hair in a comb
Sittin' by the window, I just stare at the storm
Know I'll make it through it like hair in a comb

And you all have witnessed, but I am not finished

438,Through The Fire And Flames,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
On a cold winter morning
In the time before the light
In flames of Death's eternal reign
We ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down
And the times are tough, alright
The sound of evil laughter falls
Around the world tonight
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell
Bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain
We watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again, we know
So now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown
Far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

[Chorus]
So far away we wait for the day-ay
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

[Short Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back through the mid-morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars
In your darkest dreams, see to believe
Our destiny this time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight
And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go on

[Chorus]
So far away we wait for the day-ay
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard now can we understand?
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man

[Chorus]
So far away we wait for the day-ay

439,I Don't Wanna Be In Love (Dance Floor Anthem),"[Verse 1]
She's going out to forget they were together
All that time he was taking her for granted
She wants to see, if there's more
Than he gave
She's looking for
He calls her up; he's tripping on the phone now
He doesn't want her out there and alone now
He knows she's moving it
Knows she's using it
Now he's losing it
She don't care

[Chorus]
Everybody, put up your hands
Say: ""I don't want to be in love
I don't want to be in love""
Feel the beat now, if you've got nothing left
Say: ""I don't want to be in love
I don't want to be in love""
Back it up now, you've got a reason to live
Say: ""I don't want to be in love
I don't want to be in love""
Feeling good now, don't be afraid to get down
Say: ""I don't want to be in love
I don't want to be in love""

[Verse 2]
He was always giving her attention
Working hard to find the things she mentioned
He was dedicated, by most suckers hated
That girl was fine, but she didn't appreciate him
She calls him up; she's tripping on the phone now
He had to get out and he ain't coming home now
He's trying to forget her; that's how he got with her
When he first met her, when they first got together

[Chorus]
Everybody, put up your hands
Say: ""I don't want to be in love
I don't want to be in love""
Feel the beat now, if you've got nothing left
Say: ""I don't want to be in love
I don't want to be in love""
Back it up now, you've got a reason to live
Say: ""I don't want to be in love
I don't want to be in love""
Feeling good now, don't be afraid to get down
Say: ""I don't want to be in love
I don't want to be in love""

[Bridge]
To the beat
To the beat
To the beat
You got nothing to lose
Don't be afraid to get down

[Verse 3]
We break up, it's something that we do now
Everyone has got to do it sometime
It's okay, let it go
Get out there and find someone
It's too late to be tripping on the phone here
Get off the wire you know everything is good here
Stop what you're doing, you don't want to ruin
The chance that you got to find a new one

[Chorus]
Everybody, put up your hands
Say: ""I don't want to be in love
I don't want to be in love""
Feel the beat now, if you've got nothing left
Say: ""I don't want to be in love
I don't want to be in love""
Back it up now, you've got a reason to live
Say: ""I don't want to be in love
I don't want to be in love""
Feeling good now, don't be afraid to get down

441,How Far We've Come,"[Intro]
Hello, hello, hello

[Verse 1]
I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world
But its feeling just like every other morning before
Now I wonder what my life is going to mean if it's gone
The cars are moving like a half a mile an hour at that
I started staring at the passengers who're waving goodbye
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time?

[Chorus]
But I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Well I, believe, it all, is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

[Verse 2]
I think it turned ten o'clock but I don't really know
Then I can't remember caring for an hour or so
Started crying and I couldn't stop myself
I started running but there's no where to run to
I sat down on the street and took a look at myself
Said where you going man you know the world is headed for hell
Say your goodbyes if you've got someone you can say goodbye to

[Chorus]
I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Well I, believe, it all, is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

[Verse 3]
It's gone, gone, baby its all gone
There is no one on the corner and there's no one at home
It was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me, and it's over for you
Well its gone, gone, baby its all gone
There is no one on the corner and there's no one at home
Well it was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me, and it's over for you

442,Over You,"[Verse 1]
Now that it's all said and done
I can't believe you were the one
To build me up then tear me down
Like an old abandoned house
And what you said when you left
Just left me cold and out of breath
I fell too far, was in way too deep
Guess I let you get the best of me

[Chorus]
Well, I never saw it coming
I should've started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought to doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally getting better
And now I'm picking up the pieces
And spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through
I got over you

[Verse 2]
You took a hammer to these walls
Dragged the memories down the hall
Packed your bags and walked away
There was nothing I could say
And when you slammed the front door shut
A lot of others opened up
So did my eyes so I could see
That you never were the best for me

[Chorus]
Well, I never saw it coming
I should've started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally gettin' better
And now I'm picking up the pieces
And spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through, I got over you

Well, I never saw it coming

I'd believe only that which I'd heard, yeah

When I look in her eyes, it ain't no surprise
Sparks start a flying like the 4th of July
She gets me so hot, my heart starts a popping'
When we get to kissing, there ain't no stopping
When it comes to love, she ain't no slacker
My little darlin' is a firecracker

[Verse 2]
When I light the fuse, I gotta get back quick
You gotta be careful with a dynamite stick
Son of a gun, she's fun to handle
And she packs a punch like a roman candle
She's a pack of black cats in a red paper wrapper
My little darlin' is a Firecracker

[Chorus]
We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
We're a match made in heaven and it ain't no joke
But I'd sure hate to see it go up in smoke
We got a good thing going and it feels so right
She's a firecracker, she's the light of my life

[Verse 3]
She goes off with a great big bang
Boys, I tell yea it's a beautiful thing
She takes off, you better hang on tight
She's a blonde bottle rocket in the middle of the night
When she makes love she's a heartattacker
My little darlin' is a Firecracker

[Chorus ]
We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
We're a match made in heaven and it ain't no joke
But I'd sure hate to see it go up in smoke
We got a good thing going and it feels so right
She's a firecracker, she's the light of my life

Yea, we gotta good thing going and it feels so right
She's a Firecracker
She's the light of my life

449,Don't Blink,"[Verse 1]
I turned on the evening news
Saw a old man being interviewed
Turning a hundred and two today
Asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his old pipe
Laughed and said ""All I can say is.""

[Chorus]
Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

[Verse 2]
I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said
""Best start putting first things first.""
'Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand
You can't flip it over and start again
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth

[Chorus]
Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead

I felt the rush of the Rio Grande
Into Yellowstone and I've seen first-hand
Niagra Falls and the lights of Vegas
I've criss-crossed down to Key Biscayane
And Chi-town via Bangor, Maine
Think I've seen it all, and all I can say is

[Chorus]
How 'bout them cowgirls?
Boys, ain't they something?
Sure are some proud girls
And you can't tell them nothing
And I tell you right now, girls
May just be seven wonders
Of this big, old round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls?

[Verse 2]
She's a-ridin' colts in Steamboat Springs
Bailing hay outside Abilene
She's trying hard to fit in in some city
But her home is 'neath that big, blue sky
And the Northern Plains and those other wide
Open spaces, nowadays, there ain't as many

[Chorus]
How 'bout them cowgirls?
Boys, ain't they something?
Sure are some proud girls
And you can't tell them nothing
And I tell you right now, girls
May just be seven wonders

But how 'bout them cowgirls?

[Bridge]
Boy, she don't need you and she don't need me
She can do just fine on her own two feet
But she wants a man who wants her to be herself
And she'll never change, don't know how to hide
Her stubborn will or her fighting side
But you treat her right and she'll love you like no one else

[Chorus]
Yeah, how 'bout them cowgirls?
Boys, ain't they something?
Sure are some proud girls
But you can't beat their loving
And I tell you right now, girls

Had a beautiful thing
Maybe you just saved my life

Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin to scream about just back your Bimmer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to key my house
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me
The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me
I don't wanna another you so I'mma slide (yup)
But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay

Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones
Know you ain't lettin them climb up in my throne
Now, baby that lime with that Patron
Have me talkin crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above
It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side
We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love'll have you open though
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show
So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

[Hook]

[Fabolous]
Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The next rap to show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'mma do somethin, it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us
Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~!
If you love your baby then turn this up
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup
Relax, don't be tryin to perm us up
We already straight - yesss

And maybe this is going too fast
And maybe it's not meant to last

Or hand to hold, or hell to pay

I just wanna start again (I just wanna start again)
And maybe you could show me how to try
And maybe you could take me in

And I had my heart beating down
But I always come back for more, yeah

You're faking a smile with the coffee you go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time

And when you saw me, I'm the one that you were steaming on
And when you need it, I'm the shoulder that you would be leaning on
Take off that Gucci and keep them Vicky sneakers on
Let's take a flight 'cause the world is our playground
And buy houses from the Lou, to the A-Town
It's silk sheets so it's soft when you lay down
Ching-a-ling, yeah, I get down and stay down
There's no one better, baby girl, you's a blessing
You got me heading in a positive direction
You got my vote, when you re-up for election
Cause all I wanna do is give you love and affection

[Hook]

[Bridge: Amerie/Chingy]
Why you wasting your time (say what?)
And boy, running the streets (say what?)
When you can just come to me? (oh, is that right?)
You know i got what you need (say what?)
I got what you want (say what?)
Boy, won't you come and see? (all there, babe!)
What if you never seen a girl like me ever, like me before?
Won't you come inside, let me keep it dry
Cause I'm so fly

473,Livin' Our Love Song,"Baby when I look at you with your hair fallin' down and your baby blues
Standing there across the room I get so lost in the way you move
It makes me reminisce back to years ago on a night like this
Teary eyed as you took my hand and I told you that I'd be your man
So many things have come so many things have gone
One thing that's stayed the same is our love is still growing strong

{Chorus}
Baby just look at us all this time and we're still in love
Something like this just don't exist
Between a backwoods boy and a fairy tale princess
People said it would never work out
Living our dreams has shattered all doubts
It feels good to prove 'em wrong
Living our love song

Oh darling would you look at me
With my heart beating fast and my shaking knees
It's pretty hard to believe after all these years I still need you this badly
You're dancing in my arms with a spotlight moon in a sea of stars
Girl we've come so far everything I want is everything that you are
I just want to lay you down
Say I love you without a sound
I think you know what I'm talking about

{Chorus}

{Chorus}

Feels good to prove 'em wrong
Just living our love song",Jason Michael Carroll,Jason Michael Carroll,2008,[98],1

475,The Pretender,"[Intro]
Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

[Verse 1]
Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense
Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never ending, never ending
Same old story

[Chorus]
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

In time or so I'm told
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent, we're
Temporary, temporary

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

I'm the voice inside your head
You refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face
Mirroring your stare
I'm what's left
I'm what's right
I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that'll take you down
Bring you to your knees
So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

In the fantasy, it's plain to see, just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking, all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move

Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky little lamb
Do you see what I see

Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite

[Verse 2]
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
(Do you hear what I hear)
Ringing through the sky shepherd boy

High above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Do you know what I know

[Verso 1]
Cada blanco en mi mente
Se vuelve color con verte
Y el deseo de tenerte
Es más fuerte, es más fuerte
Solo quiero que me lleves
De tu mano por la senda
Y atravesar el bosque que divide nuestras vidas
Hay tantas cosas que me gustan hoy de ti

[Coro]
Me enamora, que me hables con tu boca
Me enamora, que me eleves hasta el cielo
Me enamora, que de mí sea tu alma soñadora
La esperanza de mis ojos
Sin ti mi vida no tiene sentido
Sin ti mi vida es como un remolino
De cenizas que se van, oh
Volando con el viento

[Verso 2]
Yo no sé si te merezco
Solo sé que aún deseo
Que le des luz a mi vida
En los días venideros
Léeme muy bien los labios
Te lo digo bien despacio
Por el resto de mis días quiero ser tu compañía
Hay tantas cosas que me gustan hoy de ti

[Coro]
Me enamora, que me hables con tu boca
Me enamora, que me eleves hasta el cielo
Me enamora, que de mí sea tu alma soñadora
La esperanza de mis ojos
Sin ti mi vida no tiene sentido
Sin ti mi vida es como un remolino
De cenizas que se van, oh
Me enamora, que me hables con tu boca
Me enamora, que me eleves hasta el cielo
Me enamora, que de mí sea tu alma soñadora
La esperanza de mis ojos
Sin ti mi vida no tiene sentido
Sin ti mi vida es como un remolino
De cenizas que se van, oh

480,Nothin' Better To Do,"[Verse 1]
Hung my cotton dress on rusted wire
Up there on Pilahatchee Bridge
Just a crazy roughneck's daughter
Jumped head-first into the water
Baptized away my sins
Hitched to town with Bobby Jo and Tommy
Couple of lookers, new best friends
We slipped in the back of Sunday service
Know them church ladies, they heard us
Bum smoke money from the offering

[Chorus]
Mama said, ""Idle hands are Devil's handiwork
Oh, the trouble you'll get into
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do""
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Sign read 'Bait, Chips, Beer and Ammunition'
That Slim-Jim bag boy hadn't a prayer
Well, I hiked my skirt and did the talkin'
While them boys were busy walkin'
Case of .5 out the back door
Hid deep in the Mississippi backwoods
We danced and played around 'til dark
Well, I had them wrestlin' for my first kiss
Turned into a fight and they missed
Me speedin' off in Tommy's car

[Chorus]
Mama said, ""Idle hands are Devil's handiwork
Oh, the trouble you'll get into
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do""
Yeah!

Nobody hurt, nobody harmed
Nobody's business but my own
Mama said, ""Idle hands are Devil's handiwork
Oh, the trouble you'll get into""

You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, babe, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, babe, you got nothin' better to do, no no
