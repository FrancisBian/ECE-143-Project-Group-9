0,Blank Space,"[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless

1,Take Me To Church,"[Produced by Hozier and Rob Kirwan]

[Video directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson]

[Verse 1]
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

4,Thinking Out Loud,"[Verse 1]
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

I don't like the way he's looking at you
I'm starting to think you want him too
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can't help it

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus]
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why) I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why) I still get jealous

[Verse 2]
I wish you didn't have to post it all
I wish you'd save a little bit just for me
Protective or possessive? Girl
Call it passive or aggressive?

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It’s not your fault that they hover

You're the only one invited (Invited)
Say there's no one else for you (For you)
'Cause you know I get excited, yeah
When you get jealous too

10,Only,"[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo!
I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody, but tape
Yeah, that was a setup, for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt's fake, worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas, who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasonin'
And tell 'em bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, lowkey it may be high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn’t take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I’m obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that’s right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that’s cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up
So I can plan for it
(Pinkprint, AYE!)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I never fucked Nick and that's fucked up
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin', ain't hittin' it right
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like gold is yellow
All my goons, so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calender say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up, if she wave
They bet not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses, with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the B out, behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off
Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

11,The Heart Wants What It Wants,"[Intro]
What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Bridge]
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

12,Habits (Stay High),"[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I eat my dinner in my bathtub, then I go to sex clubs
Watchin' freaky people gettin' it on
It doesn't make me nervous if anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies, binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money, dazed and kinda lonely

[Chorus]
You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time, to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze, tryna forget you, babe
I fall back down (Back down)
Gotta stay high, all my life, to forget I'm missin' you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Pick up daddies at the playground, how I spend my day time
Loosen up their frown, make 'em feel alive
I make it fast and greasy, I'm numb and way too easy

[Chorus]
You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time, to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze, tryna forget you, babe
I fall back down (Back down)
Gotta stay high, all my life, to forget I'm missin' you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Staying in my play pretend, where the fun ain't got no end
Oh, can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain
Oh, staying in my play pretend, where the fun ain't got no end
Oh, can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain

[Chorus]
You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time, to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind

14,Don't,"[Verse 1]
I'm at a fish I don't wanna be in
I'm not prepared and I have no clothes
I can face my back
Ask yourself if it's possible to buy a seat

Where is my hand?
I said to myself, ""Do you dance?"" (Satan)
Do you know that I love myself?
Is everything in life real?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Holiday does not match with confidence
Each has many words, yes
I have a lot of shape and everything, mm
We want one with fox
(What does the fox say?)

[Chorus]
I want you to have a child
Everything was destroyed by poverty
And that man right in front of me

We can control the lightning chain
Yes, that's my son
What is your name?

Because you're still in prison, I'm sorry
Taxis in hell cost six dollars per minute
And I'm so happy with other people

We can control the lighting chain
Yes, that's my son
What is your name?

[Verse 2]
We do not want to be dinner
Terry, I do not know
I want to read my ears
This place exists

It is the disease of tension
But what I say is done
Education? Eh, it's nice for me to think about it
Find out the good things

[Pre-Chorus]
No human contact
Yes, everyone is right, yes
I'm very happy with the animals
And you can heal him

[Chorus]
I want you to have a child
Everything was destroyed by poverty
And that man right in front of me

We can control the lightning chain
Yes, that's my son
Yes, yes, yes, no

Because you're still in prison, I'm sorry
Taxis in hell cost six dollars per minute
And I'm so happy with other people

We can control the lighting chain
Yes, that's my son
Beyond the Gulf of Persia

[Bridge]
But who does not love me?
Every single Jesus
But who does not love me?
Dear, this is my own business

I do not like you, you are so beautiful
God, everything
But who does not love me?

I want you to have a child
Everything was destroyed by poverty
And that man right in front of me

Some legends are told

Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Verse 1]
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

Handcuff me to the bed, girl it ain't no bailin'

Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin' game

Gonna love ya, gonna love ya

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got em mirrored
And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing...

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody
That will do ya how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Till you feel like you breathe for it
'Till you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
'Till it's got you gasping for air
And you lean for it
'Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it
I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back go quick
Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shit

'Cause shawty you thinkin’ them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here (she here, she here!)
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?

We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid

Tell her friend to join in both ways

He said, ""I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slamming door""
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me

Then somebody said what I'm saying to you
Opened my eyes and told me the truth
They said, ""Just a little faith, it'll all get better""
So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm

Changed
And now I'm stronger

[Chorus]
There must've been something in the water
Oh, there must've been something in the water

And well, I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hope and all out of fight

[Verse 4]
Couldn't fight back the tears, so I fell on my knees
Saying, ""God, if you're there, come and rescue me.""
Felt love pouring down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
Changed
And now I'm stronger

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water
Oh, there must be something in the water

[Bridge]
And now I'm singing along to Amazing Grace
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thank God almighty, I saw the light
Gonna look ahead, no turning back
Live every day, give it all that I have
Trust in someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am changed
And now I'm stronger

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water (Amazing grace)
Oh, there must be something in the water (How sweet the sound)
Oh, there must be something in the water (That saved a wretch)
Oh, there must be something in the water (Like me)
Oh, yeah

She says they're walking in a straight line
But that's not really her style
They all got the same heartbeat
But hers is falling behind
Nothing in this world could ever bring them down
Yeah they're invincible
And she's just in the background

Oh, Oh and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man

And I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I was scared of dentists in the dark

And I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green

You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

And they said I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Cause all the cool kids they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

And thinking as that checkered flag was waving

But life’s about those days that we all like

Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon

And it blows October
I think about us shoulder to shoulder
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over

50,Anaconda,"So, for a while on the internet, THIS was controversial. Not the song itself, not any actual music or lyrics that people heard and objected to. Just this: Nicki Minaj's butt. People were up in arms apparently, declaring that it's Not safe for work ,and that it's too racy, to the point where I couldn't help but feel that the reaction to this cover was somewhat planned, like they planted articles drawing attention to the cover art. I mean,  it HAS to be, right? Just to have her fans rally around her in support, saying, ""Eff the haters you go girl! Show off your natural Black beauty… that has obviously been digitally lightened and augmented for the main purpose of looking attractive to an audience of men who couldn't give a damn about her artistic integrity… Grrrl power! But for real, is anyone ACTUALLY offended by this? Is this new? Are we really shocked by Nicki Minaj using sexuality to sell her music? I mean, call me a hipster, but I was through with this last year after the whole thing about:

""BOOBS BOOBS BOOBS BOOBS BOOBS, LOTTA BOOOOOBS""

Yeah, after a line like that, you're no longer actively trying to be respected as a rapper. And besides, looking back at it (*ahem* no pun intended), she's ALWAYS been about using sexuality for fame. Remember this picture? Yeah, that's when she STARTED getting popular. In fact, remember that whole ""I may or may not be bisexual"" nonsense, where she was tapping into the mental struggle that many young teenagers go through with their sexual identity, and it was obvious that her PR people made her push that persona for the dual purpose of A, gaining the following of sexually questioning young adults and B: turning the heads of men who like the idea of a girl being into chicks but still totally wanting the D? Yeah, it's always been about gimmicks to some extent. Hell, she was giving damned lap dances on stage during her tours. But if I were to play Devil's advocate, and try to validate these claims that THIS is the cover that ""went too far"", I'd probably wager that it relates to the way she is blatantly presented, the fact that, in this cover, she is not coming to you as a rapper, she is coming to you as her butt. In this picture, she is not the individual Nicki Minaj anymore, she is just another one of the millions of pictures of eye candy showing us their backsides, because she's just another video ho, and we all know the only thing we REALLY want to see is your ass, Nicki. So stop talking, face the front of your body away from me, and show me the TRUE reason we give a damn about you. Thing is, though, this visual of her depersonalizing herself and just being another ass for us to look at… that's not new either. In fact, I remember having that exact feeling when I saw her in the ""Ass"" video. THAT was the first time I felt like something was wrong. I mean, I know most video's will have a female rapper being sexualized, but it's usually a special sexualization, where you can tell that we're supposed to be focusing on the personality of the rapper in question. Here, in this elongated segment of her shaking her ass, there was nothing unique about her, it was face away from the camera, ass out, just another video ho in the shoot. So, even in the aspect of her being treated as run of the mill sex candy, this is NOT new. Actually, this is pretty tame. In fact, when I first saw this, I wasn't even concerned with her ass, the first question I had was, ""Why the hell is the song called ""Anaconda""?"" What could a song called ""Anaconda"" possibly be about?

My Anaconda don't… My Anaconda don't...
My Anaconda don't want none unless you got buns hun

Oh

It's interesting that it samples ""Baby Got Back"", however, I don't like when people sample songs that were already proven to be number one hits, especially so liberally. Now, I've heard a lot of feminists championing the sample of this song, claiming that Nicki's ""taking back the song for women"", but… dude, no, She just ripped off a well-known ""shake your booty"" song to make her own ""shake your booty"" song. And I'm not usually one to call a song a rip-off when it's sampling another song, because a lot of songs use sampling to enhance a certain sound that they liked in the original work, and I can get with that. With this? Nothing is done with the beatwork that enhances the music, they just layer annoying, unnecessary sounds over the sample so much, it makes you just want to go listen to the original. All of these sounds just get on my nerves

*bell ringing* Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
""Little In the middle, but she got much back
*layered over ""Oh my God, look at her butt""*
*moan, DAMN*

And not to mention the most annoying sound they use on the track: nicki Minaj

*she laughs annoyingly*

I wasn't exaggerating. Nicki, nothing is that funny. What are you even laughing about?

""He LOVES this fat ass!""

…you sound like a super villain who just hypnotized and trapped someone with your buttcheeks. …Is that where the pro-feminist message comes in?

But that's near the end of the song, the first part of the song is her telling a couple short stories about guys she used to have sex with, both of whom sold drugs

Boy toy named Troy, used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was getting some coins

I let him hit it cause he slang Cocaine

Just… straight up, no shame, ""I let him have sex with me because he deals drugs"". And… look, I know a lot of rappers embed themselves in the drug culture, and so she aligns herself with it too, because the drug game is cool to everyone nowadays, but my problem is that, she doesn't paint herself as an active agent in any of this drug activity, and yes, the drug dealing business is a shady profession with people of moral ambiguity that you should not look up to, but, with any business man, legal or illegal, there's always the illustrious draw to them, a certain respect for anyone who's worked their way up to where they are, who climbed through the rungs of an industry, no matter what type it was, and has put in work to make a comfortable living for themselves. As a culture, we respect that. We see the wit and intellect behind men like Don Corleone, Walter White, and Frank Lucas, and many rappers want to emulate that lifestyle because of the respect of their hustle. Nicki Minaj, on this track doesn't play the person who worked her way to the top, no, it's quite apparent that she is playing the role of the two-bit, materialistic floozy who bangs her way into the lap of luxury, and, well, you're not SUPPOSED to look up to Daisy Buchanan from the Great Gatsby, you feel me? Now, if she was talking about being the queen pen in this whole thing, and that SHE was the one putting in work, and that she was a sugar momma for some young guy that she used and tossed to the side, I'd be like, okay, you're switchin' it on 'em, and showing that it's no thing for a woman to be in control of things. But this is not that scene. She's portraying the drug dealer's air-headed plaything, right down to the cutesy, child-like voice and seeming dismissiveness of his terrible actions as long as he has a nice house and gives her pretty shoes

(He) was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish

And, throughout the song, she keeps talking about freaky sex that she has with these guys, which is there to make you see her as a sexually liberated women, and hey, I get it: it's about doing to men what men do to women in rap songs

He toss my salad like his name Romaine

But then, her supposed female righteousness is quickly followed by her telling him to buy her clothes

And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit

The premise here is a straight-forward, ""I had sex with him, now he owes me clothing"". Now look, I know I'm a man, and as such, I can't be the one to say what ultimately is empowering for women, or even that she HAS to make songs that empower women, but jeez I'm not asking her to be Rosie the Riveter or anything, just to be her own damn woman, or at least portray herself as such. It's not like she isn't a business woman who's been making power moves in the industry, at least I somewhat thought she was, until I hear songs like this where she talks about still being reliant on men. This just feels lame and ultimately pandering to a crowd that just wants to hear sexuality as the ONLY way a woman can have any semblance of dominance in the industry

Now, maybe I say this because I think the song being sampled is by a male rapper in the early 90's who was at least being controversial with his message:

I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing

So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!

So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneeded bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo

No one was really out there in music, saying that black women were a standard of beauty that was to be desired in the mainstream, especially not in music. Of course, the problem with Sir Mix-a-Lot's song is, you can easily say that, for all it's talk of being proud to throw some appreciation toward the female form commonly associated with black women, ultimately, you can easily say that he's still objectifying them, sure they're the women not commonly seen as attractive in a White-dominated world, but it doesn't change the fact that objectification is what's still happening. So here Nicki comes to sample that song, and ""take it back for the ladies"" as it were, but honestly? Other than the fact that there is indeed a female rapping over Mix-a-Lot's beat, Nicki doesn't REALLY do much to earn that ""reclaimer"" title that some people seem to want to give her. Come on, guys, just BECAUSE a black woman is the one who gets the mic to talk about female bodies, I don't think that fact in and of itself makes it a female positive piece of art. I'm sayin', when you see those vine videos of girls shaking their asses while their best friend records it, I doubt feminists breathe a sigh of relief when they hear that the person behind the camera is also a girl, because hey, at least it's a woman recording it! Naw, it's still video made for the entertainment and approval of thirsty men. And to me, this song is just sampling ""Baby Got Back"" as yet another gimmick, trying to turn heads with the 90's nostalgia bomb that is ""Baby Got Back"". Sorry. Now, so far, I haven't really shown you that many lyrics from the song itself. But for real, that's because there really aren't that many, and the ones that are interesting to talk about are even fewer and farther in between. There are two short verses that barely qualify as short stories, and the second half of each of those verses goes exactly the same. But as expected, there are still a couple of odd lyrics in there...

He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck 'em in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills
And he telling me to chill

You want him to eat you out with his grills still in his mouth? *show dirty grill* That… can't be hygenic…

This dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's

…Well, which tower ARE you talking about, then?

…Okay, with this lyric, I know what she was TRYING to do, but she kinda messed up with the execution. you see this is a thing in rap that I like to call the ""unwordplay"", where someone uses a euphemism for something, but instead of directly comparing their play on words with what the wordplay may literally allude to, like, ""I'm just kicking' it like a soccer team"", they jokingly disassociate the play on words with what you may have expected them to be comparing something to, for instance, ""Yeah, we're just kicking' it, but I ain't talking' 'bout a soccer team"", the joke being that they're acknowledging the fact that it's a euphemism. The problem here is with the wording, because when she says:

Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's

It's no longer just about comparing his dick to a tower, it's now about what KIND of tower. It's like she's saying: ""Yeah, his dick was as big as a tower… but not, like, the EIFFEL tower. I mean, that'd just be ridiculous! No, it was more like, maybe a Lego figurine of the Eiffel tower, if I had to be precise

And… that's it, as far as lyrics are concerned. After the 2 minute mark of this 4 minute and 49 second video, there are no more new lyrics that aren't just repetitions of the chorus or the bridge, so the second half of this song is just playing different parts of Baby Got Back with annoying sound affects. That and unnecessarily long outro where Nicki just sort of rambles

Yeah! This one is for my bitches with a fat ass in the…

Dude, just end it…

Fuck the skinny bitches
Fuck the skinny bitches in the club

Dude, just end it…

I got a big fat ass--

Dude, even the engineer is trying to cut you off. End the song. END THE FU--

Overall, I gotta give this a 0 out of 5. I was thinking about maybe giving it a 1, because the verses are at least short for how crappy they are, but then…

Nicki: *laughs*

And I just can't imagine actively wanting to listen to all this again. This is bad. It's choppy, annoying, simple to the point of embarrassment, and doesn't respect the audience enough to cut it out before it wears out it's welcome. That sample used for the chorus works for about 30 seconds before you start questioning whether or not the producer actually had any idea what to do with the song other than just play ""Baby Got Back"" under her vocals, and Nicki is in full on goofy bimbo mode, and just comes across as someone desperate to keep people talking about her, instead of delivering rhymes that anyone can give a shit about. The video included. I mean, before, in her videos, there was at least SOMETHING else going on, Ice motorcycles, crazy costumes, now, it's just that uncomfortable part of the ""Ass"" video stretched out for 4 minutes trying to justify this poor excuse for a rap song. And what's worse, SO many people keep supporting it because they feel like it's a feminist piece. Ladies and gentlemen: did we watch the same video? Did you guys somehow miss the part where she sprays herself with whip cream and attempts to deep throat a banana? I mean, I know pro-feminist media is hard to find in a mainstream context, but… are you guys gonna act like you DIDN'T just hear yet another strip club anthem with yet another music video for men to watch on mute? This video was just another submission to the ""male gaze"" portfolio, right down to the director of the video and music production credits. Just because a woman's in the front of the scene, doesn't mean this isn't just another product by men, for men. So, can we NOT act like this isn't just more pandering crap to keep her relevant because being a good rapper apparently isn't enough? Good god, you're a household name, yet your label doesn't have nearly enough faith in you as an artist to NOT have you shaking your ass just to keep people watching

Truth is that I never learned

And exchange it some day for a crown

To the Old Rugged Cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach, gladly bear
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share

You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire

Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple on the red carpet
And I'm flyer than that nigga on the hang glider
Four, five, six, seven chains on, just stay in your lane, ho
Don't you like these A. Wang's? Don't you like these gold fangs?

Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that

[Verse 1]
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time, she was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?""
Damn…

And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, ""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…

And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick!""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin' and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, ""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""

I don't think I can, ooh

Believe we had a great night but I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you, shit
You don't like that I make this easy, leaving after sexing on the floor
Baby, I know you need me like I need you, but I'm not the one you wanna love

So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like
You used to them but ain't no loving me
I hear what you would say and girl, it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party 'til we can't, ain't no loving me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me
So don't come looking for love
Oh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love

Shawty if you looking for somebody trying to settle down
Probably won't be around, nah baby
You should hit me when you tired
Of playing up in the house and ain't nobody around, you need that

We can both make love to the daylight, you got it girl, you got it girl
But you know I can't stay right? Uh, nah babe
All I want is you so what you tryna do?

And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now",Sam Smith,Sam Smith,2014,[90],1
84,Like A Cowboy,"[Verse 1]
Every time I fall I get back up again
Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind
Let it take me where it wants to go
Another one horse town, another damned old rodeo

[Pre - Chorus]
I know this life is crazy
But I'll be home soon baby

[Chorus]
I'll ride in on a sunny day
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Well baby you know I can't stay long
You wake up, I'll be gone
Until then I'll hold on
Like a cowboy

[Verse 2]
I keep your picture tucked inside my old hat
It brings me luck, I need a bunch of that
This midnight winding road runs through my blood
I can't give it up, like I said I would

[Pre - Chorus ]
I know it's hard on you
But like I always do

[Chorus]
I'll ride in on a sunny day
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Well baby you know I can't stay long
You wake up, I'll be gone
Until then I'll hold on
Like a cowboy

I'll ride in on a sunny day
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy

Every time I fall I get back up again

86,Come Join The Murder,"[Verse 1]
There's a blackbird perched outside my window
I hear him calling
I hear him sing
He burns me with his eyes of gold to embers
He sees all my sins
He reads my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
One day that bird, he spoke to me
Like Martin Luther
Like Pericles

[Chorus]
Come join the murder
Come fly with black
We'll give you freedom
From the human track
Come join the murder
Soar on my wings
You'll touch the hand of God
And He'll make you king
And He'll make you king

[Verse 2]
On a blanket made of woven shadows
Flew up to heaven
On a raven's glide
These angels have turned my wings to wax now
I fell like Judas from grace tonight

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I walk among the children of my fathers
The broken wings, betrayal's cost
They call to me but never touch my heart, no
I am too far
I'm too lost

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Verse 4]
So now I curse that raven's fire
You made me hate, you made me burn
He laughed aloud as he flew from Eden
You always knew, you never learn

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Come join the murder
Come fly with black
We'll give you freedom
From the human track
Come join the murder
Soar on my wings
You'll touch the hand of God
And He'll make you king
And He'll make you king",Genius Polska Tłumaczenia,The White Buffalo & The Forest Rangers,2014,[93],1
87,Sledgehammer,"[Intro: Camila]
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer

[Verse 1: Camila]
I don't admit it, I play it cool
But every minute that I'm with you
I feel the fever and I won't lie, I break a sweat
My body's telling all the secrets I ain't told you yet

[Pre-Chorus: Ally]
Oh oh, I struggle to contain
Woah oh, the love that's in my veins
Oh oh, and how it circulates
Oh oh

[Chorus: Camila]
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer
You're taken over the beat of my body, you just don't let up, don't let up
You're taken over the beat of my body but you lift me up, lift me up
If you take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer

[Verse 2: Lauren]
So close together, so far apart
You're turning me on and my fire's waiting for your spark

[Pre-Chorus: Ally]
Oh oh, I struggle to contain
Woah oh, the love that's in my veins
Oh oh, and how it circulates
Oh oh

[Chorus: Camila]
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer
You're taken over the beat of my body, you just don't let up, don't let up
You're taken over the beat of my body but you lift me up, lift me up
If you take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer

[Bridge: Normani & Ally & Camila]
The truth is out, no stopping now, I'm getting closer
I've had enough, undress my love, I'm coming over
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer, oh
And if you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer, hammer, oh
If you take my pulse

[Chorus: Camila + Ally]
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer (Oh!)
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer
You're taken over the beat of my body, you just don't let up, don't let up
You're taken over the beat of my body but you lift me up, lift me up
If you take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer",Fifth Harmony,Fifth Harmony,2014,"[94, 99, 93]",3
88,No Role Modelz,"[Verse 1]
I scrolled through the holiest scriptures
Studied the prose to scope the cons in it
Was confident I'm competent
In conquering the common sense
The consequence of complicated contemplation
Concentrated, consecrated, conscious efforts
Shepherds no better than the tended flock
Led them by the letter to the desert
Generations lost
Representing god, but lacking knowledge and credentials
Overzealous and contentious
Overselling their potentials
So who am I to play the nemesis?
A pessimist with blemishes
I'll preface with my genesis
I wasn't always analytical
Was reverent to the biblical
I'm cutting this umbilical
Was born again a new man in my early adolescence
Preaching from the television got me interested
Gifted with the great I Am...
A sinner intercepted
Drowning in the sound waves, my blessed intervention
Had to pause and just breathe
Leagues be deeper than my fathoms
And I started spitting water swallowed at my baptism
Kept my craft drifting
Dipping my toes in the cold stream
Now it's full steam
Rowing with pulpits, the whole scene
Church

[Bridge]
No love for the godless system
No love for these thoughtless droves
Role models rep bad religion
Fat sheep can't recognize goat

[Hook]
Don't save 'em
They won't wanna be saved
Don't save 'em
They won't wanna be saved
Don't save 'em
They won't wanna be saved
Don't save 'em
They won't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
True faith healers lead the way right now
'Cause most church leaders facetious
I'm speaking of the few of the elitest ever reaching up
And teaching us the evils of believing we achieve enough
Too many prophets gossiping and politicking
Profiting off gospel of prosperity
A heresy
Preposterous celebrities
Parodies of legacies
Reflecting not their legendary ancestries
Deceptively, the devil's in the chemistry
Take it from me, don't sip, I spill it
No will to chill with spirits
Don't deal with the still, dismiss 'em
I'm real with the quill, explicit
Won't kneel to a filthy system
A field that feels like a prison
Resistance killing ambition
Debilitating their wisdom
They're smitten, fits of belligerence
Manipulation of children
I've quit this sinister mission
Snippet of me in the beginning
A sinner, stripped of his lineage
And fitting in with the image
Spitting, skin was the difference
And living in a position
That's distant from tribulations
Persisted by institutions
I step in for visitation
Respecting this sacred ground
All these clowns are behaving reckless
Protective, I lay 'em down

[Bridge]
No love for the godless system
No love for these thoughtless droves
Role models rep bad religion
Fat sheep can't recognize goat

[Hook]
Won't save 'em
They don't wanna be saved
Won't save 'em
They don't wanna be saved
Won't save 'em
They don't wanna be saved
Won't save 'em
They don't wanna be

[Verse 3]
The scholarly or sovereignty
They're jokes without the comedy
Forefathers taught us properly, apocalyptic prophecies
Like crop stripped from the knowledge tree
Now quality of artistry is lauded as anomaly
We owe the pops apologies
Their progeny's propagating fodder feed
Monetized monotony through audio lobotomy
Abolish their philosophy
The fault is in astrology
Follow not mythology but god
And god is calling me to body diabolically
Obfuscating conflagrations
Dropping on the congregation
Dominating competition
Populating mausoleums
Skipped the talking bush and bullshit
Chose to follow my own wit to master my craft and hone it
I pastor the masses
Hold up
Does god and his lot condone it?
Acknowledge that I'm devoted or classify me opponent?
Recognize I am potent
Could step aside as atonement
To spare their lives if I want but
I'm weaponizing this moment
Exorcising you demons
Evangelizing to heathens
No appetite for prestige, it's beneath me to seek allegiance
Up and above like a halo over their heads
Shedding light upon the industry
The ministry is scared
And I'm its nemesis
Escalate my eminence
I'm pestilent to evanescent petulance
This eloquence is execution
Please excuse my egotism
I am what they aim to be
If I ain't have no faith in me
Then blame it on my atheism",JesterFlows,J. Cole,2014,[95],1
89,Burnin' Up,"[Intro: Jessie J]

'Fore she step up in here you need to step up your gear
Wish a Lamborghini had four doors (four doors)
From the corner store to the corridor (corridor)
Me and my homie on the dance floor
White girl in the middle, looking like an Oreo

Roof on fire, we can burn up
Turn down for what, nigga turn up
Motherfucker must ain't learn nothin'
Back in the day used to down with a burn coat

Light got the Lord on the top floor
In a Ford, wearin' Tom Ford
Walk in the club and her ass start clappin'
Tell shawty I want an encore

90,Homegrown Honey,"[Verse 1]
Sitting at a bar in New York City
Everybody here looking New York pretty
But you’re the kinda girl that’s got that something
Dancing to the groove like it just ain’t nothing
They ain’t never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there ain’t nothing hotter

[Chorus]
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown

[Verse 2]
Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying “Son it’s on”
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song

[Chorus]
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown

[Bridge]
Ooh baby, baby, baby
You’re driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
I’m a long way away from where I’m from
But baby you feel like home

[Chorus]
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown
You’re so money, money, money

91,When I Was Your Man,"[Round 1: Arcane]
I said, I was ready to put a stack up
But he had to ask his dad, he needed some backup
Told me his dad wanted to talk to me on the phone and make sure everything add up
I said that shit is sad Charron
You want me to talk to your dad on the phone
When are you gonna lose the chaperone and be a fucking man of your own?
When I was 17 I hustled blocks, had a couple spots
Pounds to my crew
But I never would've rapped outside my bedroom if I sounded like you
When I was 17 I could spit rhymes and freestyle hard
This kid can't even rap and y'all treat him like he's some kind of child star
Well I'ma make him die slow, like poorly prescribed drugs
Or I can make your life short like a .45 snub
Cause little Corey's rhymes suck, so keep your corny lines tucked
Cause we already know how child stars named Corey wind up
But you ain't no Corey Haim
This corny lame is such a groupie I should slap dude
He prolly ain't never even heard of Lost Boys/Boyz, the movie or the rap group
Yo, think about it, think about it
It's been 13 years since Biggie died
And back when that shit happened little Corey wasn't even five
So, now this little fucking preteen virgin soul hurting
His idea of a musical legend is Bo Burnham
Well since you need a history lesson, I'm gon' learn him
After I light up this little glow worm it's closed curtains
See I go hard for the 905, I stay repping that Hammer City
I laugh when you do like this with your hands
That's the same way I be milking your grandma's titties
Mothafucka, I'm a graveyard yet, you ain't even on my radar yet
So I'ma put Charron to sleep in a box, race car bed

[Round 1: Charron]
Yo listen
You said might milking my grandma's titties, well my flowing's legit
You talking about my grandma, well you're older than her bitch
Listen, you brought up Bo Burnham, well he's my boy
That motherfucker is evil
When you heard his song Klu Klux Klan Cookout you're like, ""He said what about my people?""
""You are not black!"" Was always said by his mother
""Arcane, you can't say that word. You're not a brother.""
Now look at you today you stupid fucker
That advice was like the bullet that killed Kurt Cobain
It went in one ear and out the other
Arcane, I met your friends Winston and Ted and that's Ted too
Arcane, you don't have any black friends dude
So where the fuck did you get that accent through?
Yo, he actually thinks he's black, this guy is a wigger
Stop eating Tootsie Rolls with a spork, you won't bite off your fingers
Go ahead and mention I'm young
No one's impressed with this evident scum
You're in your mid thirties and you dress like a thug
You're about as real as the ID I used to get in this club
Someone older than Psycho is something we haven't seen before
I've battled a Korean, you battled in the Korean War
See I should be getting a girlfriend, you should be getting a wife
16 years ago I was in diapers
In 16 years you'll be in diapers for the rest of your life
And your long ass introduction for Knamelis
Organik should've said your time was up
Ironically your intro didn't end til' 3:14, that's pi as fuck!

[Round 2: Arcane]
Son, I run my city like my name was Pops Papalia
I got an Ikea coffee table covered in pot paraphernalia
Since you said I'm 40 son I hope you're not scared of a failure
That means I'm 80 proof, my shit'll put hair on your genitalia
And you can say I'm washed up but I don't really think that's clever cause
Truth is I'm a veteran and you 'bout to be a has been who never was
You went 4 and 0 against bums, but you ain't never battled a vet
So it's time this little overrated faggot got a reality check
Listen, you battled Sandman, JWalker, Lokust and O.Z
So I guess you proved you can hang with the lost tier MC in the whole league
I beat cats like Knamelis, Scandalous, some real fucking OG's
This kid get excused from gym class cause his bitch ass is prone to nose bleeds
Now I know Ottawa got some real MC's
Osa and Bender both grizzly
So how you trying to go international in Grind Time? You ain't even the best in your own city
I heard you ducking Roosevelt cause you in the same age bracket
Okay faggot, you battle in New York with those arms flapping he'd put you in a straight jacket
Now, I understand this, you use those rebuttals as a gimmick
To me that shit's transparent
So everybody look it's King Of The Dot's kid with the flips
This little bitch named Sharon
Well you the type that should never try to rap outside your parent's home
So it's my Basic Instinct to put an ice pick through Sharon's Stone(s)
Now, if this was URL, I'd have to blare the fog horn
Last I seen you, you could barely handle O.Z., it's Sharon Osbourne
Listen, you got molested by Knamelis and Pat Stay
But you were scared of holding his hand
Y'all on some down low Three's Company shit
Sharon, Lois and Bram
First you was Pat Stay's bitch, you call him your ""sugar daddy""
But then when he pimped yo' ass out to Knamelis I guess you took it badly
So I'ma slaughter this geek and please don't bother to speak
You still got a piece of Knamelis pubic hair caught in your teeth
Bitch!

[Round 2: Charron]
Pat Stay wants to rape me, those are the freshest schemes
If Pat Stay was here he'd knock this sucker out for wearing EXCO jeans
You are not black
An intervention was held by his family at his place in the fall
""Alex, you're 30 working at Ikea where they're paying you small
On your breaks you go and hang out with your gang at the mall
And for God will you stop telling people your middle name is 'Jamal'?""
If you're the baddest guy from Hamilton your town is to send
My dad wants the rest of my Cub Scout meetings held there for 2010
And you're from Hamilton? Well I'm a city slayer
After I murder you, your crew and your city mayor
R.I.P. Hamilton, like that Piston's player
When it comes to King Of The Dot, your sister's the biggest groupie
She gave the whole town dome like the plot for the Simpson's movie

[Arcane]
Watch your fucking mouth son!

[Charron]
(Damn. What are you talking about?)
When it comes to girls I'm like GSP
I dominate from the top cause they're out of breath and they're gasping
With girls you're like Dan Hardy cause you'll never end up tapping
See I'm skinny and smart, love pictures of art and I'm sick at guitar
I realize people pick me apart cause they don't think that I'm hard
But Knamelis told me in high school you were picked on and scarred
You were gifted and smart with riveting marks
And ate lunch in the library with the kids that were really bizarre
So I realize I'm a nerd and I just live with the card
So you're battling the person you're afraid to admit that you are

[Round 3: Arcane]
I said yo, son
If all you gon' be spitting, is rehearsed writtens
I hope he brought more than that last weak verse with him
I swear to God you can bring a team of researchers with him
This dude can't even fucking find a t-shirt that fits him
Yo, and you can keep calling me a wigger
But you saying you taking his cash, its like you saying you clapping triggers
Son, you ain't stacking figures, you still playing with action figures
Quit bringing the same lame ass crackers with ya
Cause all of y'all seem like a bunch of rejects from ya high school volleyball team
But yo listen
I know I'm that dude that everybody loves to hate
Yeah, I choked and still won, gave y'all something to debate
Then I came back to clean up ya big brother Jake
So after this, you can tell Pesci I'm coming for the cake
You ain't hip hop ya fake, now you done pissed off at Drake
Antawn Jamison, I might just Chris Bosh ya face
See, cause everything I touch is ether
I should put you in a fucking freezer
You be almost like just like Justin Bieber but you never touched a beaver
Yo, and you ain't never hustled neither
So I don't know what this little guy about
But this some grown man business
I'ma have to put this little kid on timeout

[Round 3: Charron]
Yo, I came to spit flames, I'm here to bust the ether
You compare me to Justin Bieber?
But you have so many ugly features
It looks like as a kid you were beat more than Russell Peters
Yo, and you talk like, ""Yo, I'm Chris Bosh"" basketball when you're making a rhyme
Well I fucked your girl she's the craziest dime
I left her legs more spread open than Lebron James when he's taking a stride
Listen, and you said I stayed at Knamelis's house the last battle you rapped in
Well the night before I stayed at your house I'll tell the people what actually happened
I showed up to his house in a red shirt, he was puzzled and confused
Like, ""Corey, this is Hamilton! You can't wear that the Crips are coming over soon.""
I watched you post up at Zellers from 12:00 to 6:00
With your arms crossed like that and foot on the wall like this
At your house I met your twin brother Mike
I said, ""Wow, you guys are identical, you look exactly alike.""
He said, ""Man, what the fuck do you mean we look exactly alike?""
[?] wrapping salad for supper and rolled out the futon
As soon as you took a bite of it you choked on the croutons
I said, ""Can I get you something to drink? Perhaps a cup of juice?""
He said, ""Man, what the fuck is juice? I want some grape drink baby. Hmmm. Spurt and stuff.""
It was bedtime and he said, ""Boy, you ain't dressed like a rapper.""
He brought me some 2Pac underwear and Exco pajamas
There was no blankets I was cold up on Arcane's sofa
He said, ""Don't use the sheets on my windows. Here's one of my Scarface posters.""
I looked at your Get Rich Or Die Trying wallpaper as I laid on your couch
And said, ""Fuck. This. Shit. I'm going to Knamelis' house.""
Just look at you, Jesus fucking Christ
You're 32 and wearing Exco...you suck at life",King of the Dot,Chris Jamison,2014,[98],1

[Verse 1]
Ever since you left me
I've been ridin' 'round, cranking up a little country gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears
I don't know how much more missin' you I can take

[Pre-Chorus]
I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

[Chorus]
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

[Verse 2]
I take a shot of I don't care what you're doing now
Chase that one with a cold screw you
When that's done, I just might wash it down
With a big pitcher of someone new

[Pre-Chorus 2]
That blond blonde blonde
At the bar, bar, bar
See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart, heart, heart

[Chorus]
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

[Verse 3]
When we were together
I thought life would suck forever
Even though I knew better than the pain would never end
They say the night's darkest just before the dawn
Gets kissed by the day break, got down on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
And I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel

Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet

She ain't ready for it

Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public

Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?

""i"" -Kendrick Lamar

We got a young brother to stand for something!
We got a young brother that believe in the all of us!
Brother Kendrick Lamar! He's not a rapper, he's a writer, he's an author!
And if you read between the lines, we'll learn how to love one another! But you can't do that
Right on
I said, you can't do that - without loving yourself first

I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulations, but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bow-tie
Praying that the holy water don't go dry, yeah yeah
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But ain't no nigga never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at the time, sun gone shine)

Everybody looking at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gone do? (What you gone do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times our potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this

And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at the time, sun gone shine)

These days of frustration keep y'all on ducking rotation
I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum basis
Dreams of realities peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now
The strong in me, I still smile

And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at the time, sun gone shine)

Walk my barefeet (Walk my barefeet)
Down, down valley peak (Down, down valley peak)
I keep my fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum)
I keep my heart undone (My heart undone)

And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at the time, sun gone shine)

I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'm a do it 'til I get it right
I went to war last night
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', l can never see the message
I can never take the lead, I can never bob and weave
For my nigga that be letting 'em annihilate me
And the sound is moving in a meteor speed
From a 100 to a billion lay my body in the street
Keep my money in the ceiling let my mama know I'm free
Give my story to the children and the lesson they can read
And the glory to the feeling of the only unseen
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, ""I love myself!""

I lost my head, I must've misread what the good book said
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside

103,Royals,"A Valentine’s Playlist is an important part of your romantic night together. While it can be used in many ways, like in your car as you drive to dinner or a concert, it works best as a mood-setter for a quiet night at home together. The playlist is the background to your own expression of romance, but it serves as a subliminal message of your love and affection.

Assembled here are two playlists, and two points of view – one, a man, the other, a woman. Your playlist will be your own feelings and expression, but these can serve as inspiration and maybe remind you of the special songs you want on your own.
A Man’s ViewGuys love sex almost as much as food. (Some claim they love sex even more than food, but really, they just love the thrill of the hunt for sex, and after the sex, they’ll go have some food to celebrate.) Guys also know that women secretly love bad boys, so your playlist has to convey that undertone early and often to impart a sense of danger. You just can’t do that with classical music; save that for Sunday morning. No, the best music to express that bad boy image is rock. You can go with any of its variants, from country rock to southern rock to rockabilly to punk to indie, but keeping an edge to it will serve you well.

The playlist must have four parts too:

Flirtation – Sets the mood for romance
Seduction – Lets her know she’s the only one you desire
Surrender – Helps her release her inhibitions and beg you for the coup de grâce
Te Amo Mi Amor– Time to express your love and fidelity

""She's Too Good For Me"" -- by Warren Zevon -- Why It's HereA Woman's View:Throughout music, we generally find the male charming the female, while the ladies are most known for their mournful breakup songs. However, this doesn't mean that women don't crave intimacy with their companions (while it lasts). A woman loves to play innocent and seduce her man through subtle implications that escalate to full-blown love. She is determined to leave a legacy in her companion's mind, and most of all, make him feel. She voices her feelings of devotion, and most of all, her wish for her Valentine to reciprocate these feelings.
A Woman's Playlist:There is no better way to beckon him than through a dance floor, be it through upbeat pop or classic jazz. Yes, even if you need to learn a mating dance like a certain species of sexy bird to get his attention, put some swing into it for V-Day. There are a number of moods you could use to get him on the stage to get the love felt:
Upbeat /energetic: If he is the straight-forward type, he is likely more responsive towards a blaring and blunt track that screams ""LOVE ME AND TOUCH ME!"" or ""I LOVE YOU SO IT'S YOUR TURN TO RECIPROCATE!""Intimate confessing: These songs are far more mellow and often contain subtle implications of what the artist really wants. The declaration of love and the invitation for it are expressed nonetheless.

Point / Counterpoint

Point:
""She is determined to leave a legacy in her companion's mind""
- Angela Ding
Legacy schmegacy, Angela. Men know that women want commitment and security. (They have an instinctual need to nest.) Women won't have sex with men at the drop of a hat; they need to know there's a real connection and real emotion. I'll bet it was women that invented Valentine's Day idea to begin with. You ladies created a whole ritual around love itself, and then insist that we guys express our feelings. It isn't bad enough that we have to show our feelings (and thus become vulnerable to your rejection), you have to layer onto the whole thing that there be a legacy to our relationship - that we have to carry our devotion to you around with us in a sling bag, long after you're gone, to share with the next woman who comes down the pike.

Counterpoint:
""Hi, I'm George, and I like you, but I like sex so much more, so let me seduce you with bad-boy music."" If you think that's the way to a woman's heart, then bravo. Hardcore music doesn't go very far if you also want it to have those ""Te Amo Mi Amor"" undertones. Nice attempt at painting a bad-boy image with romantic setting, but charming women through a four-step guide of confessions just to snatch us for a bodily release is just superficial.

If you want a one-night stand, then of course women need to mean something to the male, and being a part of him is a greater proof of devotion. What you view as ""baggage"" is a memory of what used to be. Or, in the male's standards, as long as the sex was great, right?About the Authors:

Angela Ding and George Plant are regular contributors here at Genius.  As you could tell from their position statements and annotations , they role-played  stereotypical characters for this article.  Their relationship is collegial; they have no personal or romantic (or even adversarial) relationship.

The underlying message here was that, in a relationship, we each have many sides to our personalities.  While men are often painted one way and women another, it's best to simply be ourselves. If someone finds you attractive, good for you. If you both find each other attractive, well then, maybe you've really got something there worth developing together!

105,Fancy,"Hi, I'm the Rap Critic, and, my goodness, after that last Chris Brown episode, I think I need to hear some rap that's NOT from a completely misogynist male perspective. It's starting to make me physically ill. What chart topping female rapper do we have out there? Well, there's Nicki Minaj, but… ""BOOBS, BOOBS, BOOBS, BOOBS, LOTTA BOOBS"" I'm not sure her maturity level is advanced enough to not insult my intelligence right now, so let's go with someone else. Who else out there is reppin' it for the ladies? C'mon, there's gotta be somebody!

*picture of Iggy Azalea*

Oh yeah, that white, female rapper from Australia. That's literally as far away from the norm as you can get before you start coming back on the other side of the globe! And she's doing pretty well for herself, touring with beyonce and scoring a top 10 song on the charts with this single, ""Fancy"". Well, I'm always one to give an outsider a chance, so what unique flavor is this rapper from the Land Down Under gonna hit us with?

*song starts, goes to the verse*
First thing's first, I'm the realest
Drop this and let the whole world feel it

Okay, I gotta give her a little props on the way she starts her verse on the off measure, like, you expected one more bar to happen before the verse starts, but she seems to be coming in early, which is appropriate, since she hits you with the line ""first things first"", as if her early entrance is meant to accentuate the point of saying, ""Iggy's in charge and comes in exactly when she wants to, your expectations be damned. I see you, miss Azalea...

And I'm still in the Murda Business
I can hold you down, like I'm givin' lessons in physics

*Australian dude from Jurassic Park*
Clever girl…

Sorry… Australian stereotypes from Jurassic Park… you know, now that I think about it, she doesn't sound very… Australian, does she? I mean, sure she came to American when she was 16 and spent most of that time in the South, and for the last 3 years, she's been mentored by T.I. on his label, but honestly, if T.I. ever did a very unconvincing impression of a female white Australian rapper, this is exactly what he would sound like. But hey, who am I to judge accents? I'm from the south, and I barely sound like it… well, except when I say ""y'all"". Apparently, that's an exclusively southern thing, but whatever, keep going…

You should want a bad bitch like this (Huh?)
Drop it low and pick it up just like this

You know, now that she just rapped an obvious filler lyric here, I'm starting to realize that I'm not feeling this song as much as I would want to. I can't really figure out why that is. Is it the beat?

Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, somethin' worth a half a ticket on my wrist

Yeah, I really think it's the beat that's turning me off, or, more accurately, it's not turning me up! I mean, if this is a party jam, I wanna hear something that makes me want to get up!  But this:

Takin' all the liquor straight, never chase that (Never)
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back

It's just a 3 to 4 note ""doon doon doon bass line and ""people unenthusiastically shouting ""hey hey hey"" in the background, and… wow, I just described ""Rack City"" by Tyga… a song title I hope is making you say ""what's that?"", because no one needs to remember that song…

Drop this and let the whole world feel it

To be honest, Iggy, there's not really a lot to feel…

Maybe for the chorus, the producer here will amp things up a little

I'm so fancy… you already know
I'm in the fast lane… from L.A. to Tokyo

Uh… never mind… I mean, is it just me or… is Charli XCX's voice too… big for this track? Like, the way she sings and the vocal effects they put on her voice make it sound like it should have a more raucous sound to to it, but the beat behind her doesn't feel like it's supporting her very well. This ultimately sounds like a boring remix of a more interesting version of this song. I don't know, is there a rock version of this song that someone could point me to? I feel like I could enjoy this better if there where some electric guitars, or a trumpet section, but as is, it's underwhelming. THIS is the type of music her voice belongs on:

""I LOVE IT!""

And you may not like this type of music, but you have to admit it does fit Charli XCX's style, but this...

I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold?

This is… wait, are you asking people to taste your gold? What, are you shoving your chains in someone's mouth? That's not fancy. I dare say that's not fancy at all!

I'm so fancy… you already know

Well, if we already know, why do you feel the need to tell us? Is it possibly because certain people who obviously DON'T possess a certain quality but want people to think they do like to project the idea that they do by repeatedly telling you what type of person they wish they were? Maybe? Just a little?

Trash the hotel… Let's get drunk on the mini bar!!!

O… okay, seriously, does she… NOT know what ""fancy"" means? Because… I don't know about you, but I don't generally hear people use ""fancy"" as a word to describe people who trash hotels…

Film star, yeah, I’m deluxe

Wait, Charli XCX is a film star? Not in any movie I'VE ever heard of! You know, I think I'm coming off as being real negative towards her, but I don't mean to, I just don't think her strengths are being played up very well. Her energy isn't the problem, it's the crap they gave her to say. I dunno, maybe if the song was called ""I'm so trashy"" or ""I'm so using the term ""fancy"" ironically, but I'm sorta ambiguous about whether or not that's intentional"", maybe I could ride with that, but currently, it's not working for me, and usually a really tight beat could excuse that, but, well, as previously stated, that's not happening… Now, to Iggy's credit, when she comes back in, she picks up some steam and adds some slick style to her delivery

I be that I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw

I said, ""Baby, I do this, I thought that you knew this""
Can't stand no haters and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, each beat dear departed

Although, I don't get why ""retarded"" is still considered a compliment in rap music, but whatever…

Still stuntin, how you love that

Eh… *wavering hand*

Got the whole world asking how I does that

Asking how you do what? What, are they asking how a female rapper like you could be successful in a male-dominanted genre? Well, I'm guessing a lot of that success would directly stem from a blatant sexualization of your persona, am I right?

It's just the way you like it, huh?
It's so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh?

Yeah... yeah, I'm right…

Overall, I'd give this a 3 out of 5. The song has a lot of faults that make it undesirable for ME to replay, but I wouldn't be offended if people were into it, given her core audience. It's definitely fun if you're in that sort of mood, and the tag team of Charlie and Iggy vibe off of eachother pretty well as contrasts: Charli as the wild chick with the forceful vocals, and Iggy as the relaxed, chilled out rapper with the calm demeaner would make a great album overall to listen to, but if they ever did do that, this would be one of the weaker songs on it. Frankly, I think it's pretty cool that a British singer and an Australian rapper have the number one song on the rap charts right now, but I honestly wish it was with something a little more engaging than what I got out of this song. But I see some potential in this one. I think she could add a lot of flavor to the game, and actually I'm looking forward to what else she's got in store.

Feels like a close, it’s coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Couplet 1 : Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called ‘’Hi! My Name Is’’ dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
Cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I’ve been against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn’t amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don’t wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin’, it’s your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I’ve already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story?
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to…

[Refrain : Sia]
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I never before
I didn’t wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, the time is here
Guts over fear, I shall not tear
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Guts over fear, guts over fear

[Couplet 2 : Eminem]
It’s like I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn’t until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck""
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I’ve caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in the trailer park?
And the window that was closing and there’s nowhere else I can go with flows in
And I’m frozen cause there’s no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I’d rather make “Not Afraid 2” than making another mothafuckin’ “We Made You” uh
Now I don’t wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I can’t explain to y’all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my damn self
But on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, ‘cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all’s they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
Everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I’m gone
And to think I was... gone

I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line",Craig Wayne Boyd,Craig Wayne Boyd,2014,[84],1

She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burn up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her, ""Wanna ride out?"", and she said yes
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed

Go ahead baby let me see what you got
You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just wanna see that thing drop
From the back to the front to the top
You know me I'm off in the cut
Always like a squirrel, looking for a nut
This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck

Forget about bills and the first of the month

112,Roller Coaster,"[Verse 1]
She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done

[Chorus 1]
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

[Verse 2]
The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back

[Chorus 1]
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

[Bridge]
She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her

[Chorus 2]
When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'

Yo te miro, se me corta la respiración
Cuando tú me miras se me sube el corazón
(Aceleras o meu coração)
Y en un silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras
La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol

Bailando (bailando)
Bailando (bailando)
A noite aquecendo, teu corpo mexendo
Subindo e baixando (subiendo y bajando)
Bailando (bailando)
Bailando (bailando)
Este fogo cá dentro subindo crescendo
Ardendo e queimando

Con tu física y tu química también tu anatomía
La cerveza y el tequila y tu boca con la mía
Ya no puedo más (não aguento mais)
Ya no puedo más (não aguento mais)
Com essa melodia, és a minha fantasia
Com a tua filosofia a minha mente está vazia
Não aguento mais (ya no puedo más)
Não aguento mais (ya no puedo más)

Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo
Bailar contigo, tener contigo
Una noche loca (una noche loca)
Ay besar tu boca (y besar tu boca)
Eu quero estar contigo, viver contigo
Dançar contigo e ter contigo
Uma noite louca (uma noite louca)
Uma noite louca

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Tú me miras y me llevas a otra dimensión
(Entro noutra dimensão)
Tus latidos aceleran a mi corazón
(Teu suspiro acelera o meu coração)
Que ironia do destino não poder tocar-te
Abrazarte y sentir la magia de tu olor

118,Sunshine & Whiskey,"Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

[Verse 1]
Chilling on a beach with my sweet Georgia peach
Not a care in the world, just trying to beat the heat
Body like an hourglass, sand on her feet
I can't help but stare cause I got the best seat
Just when I thought it couldn't get any hotter you slid on in
Said, ""I'm a little hot and bothered, if you know what I mean
Let's crank it up to a hundred degrees""

[Refrain]
You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, Coppertone red
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

[Verse 2]
I was slow driving south with the top drop down
Her hair in the wind, Tom Petty up loud
You gave me that look, you licked them lips
I said, ""Hang on baby, better pull over for this""
I don't wanna get DWK, driving while kissing they'll put you away

[Refrain]
You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
It's like a bottle of Jack straight to the head

119,Dirt,"[Intro: Music Video Only]
I'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day

[Verse 1]
You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (Dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (Dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...

[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Music Video Interlude 1]
Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay

[Verse 2]
You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (Dirt)
You know you came from it (Dirt)
And some day you'll return to...

[Chorus ]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Music Video Interlude 2]
I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said ""the world comes right to my window every day""... Even if it's broken
(You know you came from it (dirt, dirt) And some day you'll return to)

[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains, you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Post-Chorus]
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Music Video Interlude 3]
See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, bake good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen

She's a good girl, she's Daddy's favourite
He's saved for Harvard, he knows she'll make it
She's good at school, she's never truant
She can speak French, I think she's fluent

[Pre-Chorus: Calum & Michael]
'Cause every night she studies hard in her room
At least that’s what her parents assume
But she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend
Here's what she told me the time that I caught them

[Chorus: All & Luke]
She said to me, ""Forget what you thought""
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
Good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
Good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught

[Verse 2: Calum & Michael]
She's a good girl, a straight A-student
She's really into all that self-improvement
I swear she lives in that library
But if you ask her she'll say, ""That's where you'll find me""

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Michael]
But if you look then you won’t find her there
She may be clever but she just acts too square
'Cause in the back of the room where nobody looks
She’ll be with her boyfriend
She’s not reading books

[Chorus: All & Luke]
She said to me, ""Forget what you thought""
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
Good girls are bad girls and good girls are bad girls

Who's that shadow holding me hostage? I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear I'm getting used to being held by you

[Chorus: All]
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done now
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, you got me tied down
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way

[Verse 2: Louis & Niall]
Who's this man that's holding your hand and talking 'bout your eyes?
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But my Stockholm Syndrome is in your room
Yeah, I fell for you

[Chorus: All]

I used the light to guide me home
But now together we're alone
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go

Car full of girls in a blue Mustang
Four y’all, more y’all, caravan
V.I.P model in hand, bottle in hand
Wobble again
I make it crack in the back a Benz while cracking the frame
On the highway, just me and Wiz
With a dirty dozen, about to handle this
Was they cousins or was they twins?
I love it when they both go all in
Like that, this one and that one
See he wants the cute one, I want the fat one

123,Am I Wrong,"[Verse 1]
Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
Am I wrong for saying that I'll choose another way?
I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing
Just cause everybody doing what they all do
If one thing I know, how far would I grow?
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home

[Hook]
So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?
But that's just how I feel, that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see

[Verse 2]
Am I tripping for having a vision?
My prediction; I'mma be on the top of the world
Hope you, hope you don't look back, always do what you decide
Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel
Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let them compare you, no
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how we feel

[Hook]

If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right, right

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight

And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on

Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22

I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he’s right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you
Do you read the ones I wrote you?

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Verse 2: Calum]
The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you’re happy and it hurts that you moved on
It’s hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
It’s like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish, we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Bridge: Luke]
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

[Chorus: All]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them

And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standing out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So I built you a house from a broken home
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
It took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?

Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is running in circles of you and me

Love was something you never heard enough
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? (Out of the woods)
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

[Bridge]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out and said, ""I'm setting you free""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good)
Oh, I remember

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
(Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
(Are we?)
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?

[Verse 1]
Taking me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just want to shout out, give me more
You're just a hideaway
You're just a feeling
You let my heart escape
Beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh baby, it's out of my control
It's going home
But you're just a chance I take
To keep on dreaming
You're just another day
That keeps me breathing

[Chorus]
Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me
Hideaway with me some more
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh

[Verse 2]
You send me the shiver and the spine, might overflow
You're bringing me closer to the edge
I'm letting go
You're just a hideaway
You're just a feeling
You let my heart escape
Beyond the meaning
Pulling my head into the clouds
I'm floating off
When you can be going I can't find a way to stop
You're just a chance I take
To keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh

Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me

Write my name on the wall
Money in the mattress, bet she wanna get involved
She hopped on the blunt, say, where the hookah y'all?
I tell her pass back if the shit too strong, it's all set
Mozart art on the block, so wet
I got her where I want her and I ain't done yet
Lookin' at your future, baby, put down the cigarette
Come hop on this kush jet and take flight, yeah
Tell them bitches, hmm fuck that
You with Aladdin, bet I got a magic carpet for that ass, yes

Pass baby, welcome to rich class, baby
You all Maybelline, with ya new Celine
Audemars on lean, cars on sheen
You white girl, but black girl ghetto fly thing
It's verified, they ain't on your sea level
Watered eyes, don't cry, inhale and breathe regular
My baby on it, high at the crack of dawnin'
Body shape, figure eight, like Picasso draw ya

159,Studio,"Hi, I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Schoolboy Q. Now, admittedly, with a name like that, you expect an intellectual, pretentious, maybe even snobbish type know-it-all rapper, right? Well…

*GANGSTA GANGSTA GANGSTA*

…yeah, not exactly. Yeah, Q's on that ol' gangster shit, and at first, I was really reluctant to listen to him, because Q's opening song hits you with:

GANGSTA SHIT

…which just makes me say, ""really? Even after Kendrick Lamar, your predecessor on your label T.D.E. hit us with an album pretty much denouncing that whole lifestyle, you want to come right after him, hitting us with the same ol' crap?"" Oh, and let me guess, despite all this gangsta gangsta talk, the single that will get the most play is the one that's aimed at the ladies, right? The one that has a lighter beat to it, and talks about how much he wants to be with his girl, but since he's still totally gangsta, he has to remind us how he's still a thug, and mainly focuses on the sexual aspect of their relationship, right?

*song plays*

*sighs* let's get this over with

So we start off with what everyone wants from a music video: dialogue!

""When are you coming home, it's already 3 am""

And you can hear in my voice how affected I am by this. I was hired because of my acting skills

*she lowers the phone to her boobs*

I keep forgetting that music videos are not a very subtle art form

*fades* Okay, so the actual songs starts, and we get a… hm… I don't hear any music…

Wait, is there ANOTHER scene of dialogue coming up?! Dude, just get to the song!

""I'm at home, and I feel like chilling out…""

Uh… what is she reading? Is that a… mad-libs app? It looks like it. No doubt, it's affiliated with Beats by Dre in some manner, right? What, do you just pick random words, and it gives you a silly sentence based off of them? …Uh, okay, well what does this one say?

""I'm at home, and feel like chilling out with myself to hiphop

*stars laughing, but stops* That's not funny. If you're gonna be random, at least be funny

*show rap-Libs*

Exactly!

I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby

Okay, FINALLY, we get to the song, an it's about having to put in work in the studio when in the back of your head, you wish you were home with your loved one. Okay, I can get with that

But this song so fuckin' dope, girl, it's harder not for me to blaze it

Well, that kinda changes the tone of the song now, because when you say I'm sittin' in the studio tryna get to you, that sounds like someone who's on a schedule and HAS to finish an album before a certain deadline but wants to hurry up as fast as he can to get back to her; however, when you say ""But this song's so dope, I have to blaze it"", that takes away the work aspect, and it ends up sounding like you're enjoying what you're doing. Basically it's the difference between saying, ""I wanna be with you, babe, but I have to finish this job!"" and saying, ""I want to be with you babe, but I'm just HAVING SO MUCH FUN! And you know, you may BE having fun, but dude, you don't let HER know that! That's not gentleman etiquette!

To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'

Adequate recovery

I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby

Alright, so with that line wrapping it up, we finish the chorus, and get into the actual first verse by Schoolboy Q

Q:
See I've been in the studio just tryna get to you, baby

Or… we just repeat the chorus again…

All night layin' verses though I'd rather lay with you, baby

So, he just rhymed ""get with you, baby"" with ""lay with you, baby""… now, let's be clear here: this isn't like that Jay-Z song ""Change Clothes"", where everyone got on Jay for rhyming ""necessary with necessary""

Young Hov' in the house is so necessary
No bra with that blouse, that's so necessary

Because I understood that the rhyme was actually withe the words ""house"" and ""blouse"". However, here, make no mistake there is NO rhyming happening Look, I know it's a song for the lady's but come on, man, put some effort into it!

Bra and panties matchin', nail and toes, you all kinda lady

Oh hey, look, he found a word that rhymes with ""baby"", just in time for the… THIRD line in this couplet. Well, at least he did it eventually…

Angel out of Heaven, such a goddess have a nigga praying'

And look, he… ALMOST found another word to rhyme with ""lady""

I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby

Oh, was that the whole first verse? Well, that was… lazy, alright let's just keep going

You need a real nigga, shorty so come in, throw that pussy, shorty

Hey, he's finally rapping with some energy! Even though we're halfway through the video and he has yet to rhyme two different words together. And yeah, I know I seem to be only focusing on the rhymes and none of the actual content of his lyrics, but honestly, with this song, so far, it's the only thing to really grasp onto. I mean, what is it that he's saying that I can actually get into?

See I think you and me can make it, this little verse to get you naked

Wait, am I mistaken, or did he just flat out say: ""I truly believe in the integrity of our relationship"", quickly followed by, ""I wrote these lyrics so I could see your boobs

Shit, my type ain't quite her type

…and you admit that she's not even your type

Just when that door knock lose your thong, girl
Cause you girl, cause you girl, girl, cause you girl, girl

…you okay there, Q? Did you… like, mentally breakdown while trying to find a word to rhyme with ""girl""?

Put my tongue in different places, play a game of Operation

Oh hey, he managed to work in some semblance of metaphorical allusion, because, you know, in operation, you play a game where you touch all the different parts of the body, and he's saying that he'll use his tongue while doing the same with her

Na-na-na, la-la, la-la, you get what I'm saying

Oh-ho, you see, because the syllables he's speaking are reminiscent of the tongue movements, and she knows exactly what he means by it!

No metaphors, nothing like that
I'm keeping it straight to the point with you

I don't know, dude, you raps could benefit from a little wordplay. I mean, the cunnilingus allusion was at least a little entertaining. And in general, I think music could stand to utilize more metaphorical language. I mean, sure, a lot of works of art used metaphors and plays on wording for the purpose of working around censorship, but I think it's a lot more stimulating to leave some things to the imagination, to not have to say everything in such blunt terms

I'mma put this dick up all in-side-of-you

I keep forgetting that gangsta rap is not a very subtle art form…

Well, overall, I'd give this a 1 out of 5. Honestly, this song sounds like they were sitting in the studio, trying to rush together a love song on the last day of recording before they shot the album to the label. I mean, when the most clever line in your song is:

""Na-na-na, la-la, la-la,""

You are NOT finished writing. Now, in preparation for this review, I decided to listen to Schoolboy Q's Oxymoron album again, and upon closer listens, the guy has some substance behind this LP, I got that he actually wanted to tell me about himself over the course of the album. Unfortunately, despite my positive feelings towards it, it's certainly not a perfect album by any definition, but a song like this is NOT a substantial representation of what he has to offer, and is one the weakest points on said album, but hey, he needed the club song for the ladies, so there it is.

Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more

177,Angel In Blue Jeans,"[Verse 1]
And though I never got her name
Or time to find out anything
I loved her just the same
And though I rode a different road
And sang a different song
I’ll love her till my last breaths gone

[Chorus 1]
Like a river made of silver
Everyone came running to the scene
I was shot down in cold blood
By an angel in blue jeans

[Verse 2]
Late that night she got away
I chased her to the turnpike
Then lost her where the music never plays
And though I rolled upon the stones and fell into the water
I’ll love her till my judgment day

[Chorus 2]
Like a sunrise made of white lies
Everything was nothing as it seems
I was shot down in cold blood
By an angel in blue jeans

[Bridge]
I hear voices calling all around
I keep falling down
I think my heart could pound right out of me
I see a million different ways
To never leave this maze alive

[Verse 3]
I woke up in somebody’s arms
Strange and so familiar
Where nothing could go wrong
Barely alive or nearly dead
Somehow awake in my own bed
And there you are

[Chorus 3]
Like a highway headed my way
Life is but a dream
I was shot down by your love
My angel in blue jeans",Train,Train,2014,"[94, 79, 91]",3

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework

But they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here

[Verse 2]
People talk girl
You know damn well
When they got a good tale to tell
Let's give them something they ain't never seen
A little Rated R redneck dream
Let's blaze a trail through the dirty south
Or give them something they can talk about
A little story that they won't forget
Long after we ride off into the sunset
Baby, cause we ain't dead yet, baby

[Chorus]
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here

[Bridge]
We only get one chance around
This runaway roller coaster train
And it ain't slowing down
So baby they're gonna remember our name

[Chorus]
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
No, we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here",Jason Aldean,Jason Aldean,2014,[63],1
185,Pills N Potions,"Hi, I'm the Rap Critic, and just in time for my Missy Elliott video where I mentioned how people were comparing her to Nicki Minaj, comes a new single from Nicki Minaj, called ""Pills N Potions"". So let's prepare for yet another ""look at me look at me"" video where she does silly, outlandish things just to get people talking about her

*video starts*

Pills n potions
We're overdosing

Whoa, hey, look at Nicki. Like, just look at her. She looks… normal. No crazy hairstyle, no exaggerated faces, just… her…

*cuts to her showing her breasts*

…and her boobs, but I was expecting that

*pez dispenser rabbit, rabbit picture*

Okay, that's… kinda random, but, but not enough to be distracting. So, what's this song about?

Pills n potions
We're overdosing

Oh… okay, now I get why this song's being more serious. From the context I'm getting, I'm guessing it's gonna be a song about substance abuse and trying to get through it all. Okay, that's unexpected, but that can definitely make for a powerful, meaningful song…

*show ""Dr. Dre Beats Pill*

Oh. oh, you didn't…

Wow. You just subverted the meaning of our own song for the sake of an ad for Beats by Dre pills.  I mean, I could understand using this in a party song, but this is obviously not meant to be that.  I mean, I haven't even gotten to the lyrics, and already I can't take this song seriously now, because they thought it'd be cute to use a play on words that equates beats by Dre stereos to crippling drug addiction. But hey, what do I know, maybe this song ISN'T about narcotics, maybe it's actually about OVERDOSING on the sweet audio quality of Beats by dre pills! So, what, does the word ""potions"" in the title not refer to a general term for alcoholic substances, but is actually just an ad for, I dunno, your perfume line or something

*shows perfume in video*

…Huh…

I'm angry but I still love you

Oh… okay. Well, I guess you can't have a downtempo song be a hit without the word ""love"" in the chorus, so now it's more clear what this song is actually about: substance abuse when it intervenes in a relationship. Okay, that sounds engaging

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove

…Thank you for expanding on that idea. I mean, she just says ""I still love""… *motions* go on. Did you want to tell us who or what you love? Or, when you say ""I still love"", are you just plainly stating, ""I possess the general capability to love"". Okay, I guess that's f-- *shows the weird gas eyes* AUGH! What the hell is that? Are those supposed to be... tears? Maybe she's crying… mercury?

*shows other animations of it*

What is that supposed to be? Like, it looks like the water animation you would see in one of those 90's t.v. shows when they still hadn't figured out how to use CGI

*shows her smoking*

Oh… is that supposed to be smoke? That looks horrible. Maybe they could be grey clouds or something, but definitely not smoke. And does that mean this last scene is about her being surrounded by smoke? It looks more like she's surrounded by deformed zombies covered in grey bedsheets

Uh… right, sorry, back to the song. What were we talking about again? Oh yes, chemical dependency affecting a loving relationship. Got it!

*song plays*

*snoring, shakes awake* huh, not in the ear! …Oh, right, the song. Uh... chemical dependency in loving relationships, right… if you haven't figured this out, I'm saying that the song is kinda boring. And that's not to say that downtempo songs are inherently boring, but this just isn't striking me like it should. The beat's just inoffensive and unengaging. But maybe it's serving a purpose: to be a more somber look at chemical dependency affecting a loving relationship. Okay, I actually remember what the song is about. Let's go

Ayo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin’ wasn’t tasteful

Okay, so this first line could be about how, no matter how crazy someone they love may get on drugs, she'll still love this person at their core, even though she's not necessarily overlooking the things this person may have done to her

Even though you out here lookin’ so ungrateful
I'mma keep it movin’ be classy and graceful

And she remains calm with a sense of quiet, dignity and grace, despite how drugs can make a close one blind to the emotions of those who have done a lot for you… to be clear, though, I'm only assuming that drugs are the reasoning behind what this unnamed other person is doing, mainly because I haven't been given any other context

I told 'em it’s no friends in the game, you ain’t learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don’t burn that yet

…this IS about drugs, right? Because, without the context of the chorus, this COULD be about someone who is, in general, just a jerk

Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible that they love you

I'm sorry, are we still talking about chemical dependency affecting a loving relationship, because… this just sounds like the Nicki Minaj version of ""No New Friends"" by Drake

Yo, people will love you and support you when it’s beneficial
I'mma forgive, I won't forget, but I'mma dead the issue

Okay, so we're circling back to the original point at the beginning! Well, in the first verse, anyways, as I'm under the assumption that this song no longer has anything to do with drugs anymore. Honestly, it feels like the words ""pills and potions"" in the chorus are there just to make the song sound more important than it really is. Also, to sell merchandise. But okay, the point is, she's saying that she understands how underhanded and shady people can be, but that she will be the bigger person in the situation and let it pass

But I sped off in a Benzy
I see the envy when I'm causin' a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em
Cop cribs in the hills on ‘em

So, this is what I'm getting from this mature, more responsible Nicki Minaj

Hey, man, I forgive you for what you did to me, BECAUSE MY LIFE IS BETTER THAN YOURS! *TONGUE OUT* I'M RICH, BIATCH!

Sounds healthy

Look, I don't like the sentiment this song is slowly churning out. It's like, ""yeah, things are going wrong in her life, BUT she's still totally super rich, you guys, lest we forget. And I can understand for any other song where the whole purpose is her bragging, but I was under the impression that this wasn't going to be one of those songs, specifically based on the chorus. Remember, Nicki, how you were talking about overdosing on drugs but still loving someone throughout the process? Do you even remember that part? Because that sounded like it was leading to a deeper, more heartfelt song, but I guess not, because you HAVE to talk about speeding off in Benzes, right? It's like, damn, can't a rapper be vulnerable for a full 4 minutes without needing to ego boost themselves by reminding us of their success? Can't you have an emotion that doesn't involve your pride for the length of a full verse?

Well, at least she finally mentioned drugs somewhere in the there

So I pop pills for 'em

But wait, she only mentions popping pills as a part of a celebration of her victory over the haters, like, because I know you guys are hating on me, I'm going to rub it in your face by doing expensive drugs. Sure, it's a small line, but since it's the only time she directly brings up drugs in the verse, I'm forced to notice it, and… well, talking about celebrating your accomplishments by doing drugs in the verse is a bit of a different depiction than I was expecting from a chorus that sheepishly sings about overdosing on them

Overall, I'd give this a 3 out of 5. An yeah, I know this one's short, but Honestly, there's not a lot to say about it, and half of the song is her saying ""I still love"", so there's not really a lot to say about that, and either way, this song doesn't affect me enough in general to illicit that much of a response. It's the definition of the word average. Like, plenty of songs I give a 3 star rating because it does things that were good in one area where in others they weighed it down. With this, the feeling behind it is so ""meh"" that it can only be rated in the middle. The rhymes are okay, but they don't really seem to follow the theme of the chorus. At first look, it sounds like it's about drugs and the affects thereof, but then it sounds like it has nothing to do with that, and that it's about friends who offend you but that you still love and forgive, but THEN near the end, it's just about stuntin' on haters. It just comes out like a big, blobby, unfinished mess… like these visual effects!

Well, I'm the Rap Critic, and this song isn't even worthy of my catchphrase",Rap Critic,Nicki Minaj,2014,"[89, 73, 64, 62, 50, 61, 48, 43, 46, 46, 45, 34, 41, 44, 24, 43, 42, 47]",18

She's fighting back tears, she's fighting back years

Sugar cane, back lanes

And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind, basically raped me
Rose through the bullshit like a matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at 'em
And even the score
So, I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At four in the morning
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant, art ignorant
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate to be inconsiderate
But the industry took my innocence
Too late, now I'm in this bitch!

Doors open up, I emerge with ten chains (Damn)
Even back then, they was calling me Ten Chains (Ayy)
Ask me what I spent, I tell 'em, ""It's no thing""
If I had it added up, it'd cost me like ten things (Yeah)
We used to take a little show money just to throw money (Money)
If it's on the floor, nigga, it's the floor money
If you brought it out to blow when you got it from the blow
Then that's why the fuck they call that shit ""blow money"" (Woo)
Still the realest nigga in this, y'all know it
Kept it one hunnid since the day I came through
My nigga hit me up, say he goin' out of town
So I threw him fifty thou', told him, ""Bring me back two"" (That's right)

Hear the twenties, fifties, hunnids, the money machine clickin' (Yeah)
And my Rollie ain't tickin', I ball
I done seen it all

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Uncle died on the spot
Pop killed the family with heroin shots (Real shit)
Gave my life to the block
Figured, I get shot, 'least I die on top (Real shit)
I came alive in the drop
Big body all white, shit looked like a yacht, ugh (Real shit)
I got 'em five grand a pop
Had a plug in Saint Thomas on a trillion watts, ugh (Trill shit)
Flew 'em back to the States
Parked ninety-two bricks in front of 560 State
Now the Nets a stone throw from where I used to throw bricks
So it's only right I'm still tossin' 'round Knicks, ugh
Probably brought your auntie a couple bags
I probably front your uncle a couple halves
Was in the S-Class, you was just in class
You know I was finna blow like a meth lab
Expanded the operation out in Maryland
Me and Emory Jones in the caravan
Took the show on the road out in VA
Dropped a couple off with Rolla in the PA (Real Rolla)
Plug got shot, we started slowin' up
Took a trip down to see how he was holdin' up
The war's on, now, he got shot again
This time he was gone for good, then we got it in
Emory got knocked, we was down ten
The whole team hot, walls closin' in
Niggas can't tell me shit about this dope game
'Bout this cocaine, man...

194,Cold One,"[Verse 1]
It was a perfect day for the end of May, they say a record high
I was starin' at that green water
When out of the blue and by surprise
She had her feet up on the cooler as she put our love on ice
She grabbed a beer, said, ""I'm out of here""
And walked out of my life

[Chorus]
That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave
Did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that
Hell hot summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one

[Verse 2]
It ain't the first time, or last time I watched love walk out
But it's damn sure the one time I still ain't forgot about
I still like to drink a beer but a long neck I won't do
Cause every time I see one sweating, man
I break out in one too

[Chorus]
That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave
Did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that
Hell hot summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one

[Chorus]
That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave
Did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that hell hot summer sun

I’d go shoot tequila, take a lime and suck it
And we’d tell our bosses they can do the same
We’ll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing

We’d sail around the world and go to shore in a dingy
But till that dream comes true why don’t you grab your bikini cause

But we have got each other and gas in the tank

204,We Dem Boyz,"Hi. I'm the Rap Critic. And I just realized: outside of my collab review with Todd on that movie he did with Snoop Dogg, I haven't talked too much about Wiz Khalifa. And maybe that's to my detriment. I mean, he's racked up a surprising amount of hits, and heck, I liked ""Young, Wild, and Free"" and uh… *shows single covers for his other songs* uh… well, I liked ""Young, Wild, and Free"", but other than that, Khalifa has never struck me as someone I NEEDED to listen to, and *shows ""O.N.I.F.C."" cover* *chuckles* Jesus Christ… what I'm trying to say is, he ALSO never struck me as someone to take seriously

But you know what? I haven't listened to him in a while. Maybe, looking at his new single with fresh eyes will change my perception of him. So, without further ado, let's look at Wiz Khalifa's ""We Dem Boyz""… wow, that doesn't sound good…

*long video intro*

*sighs* Does a song called ""We Dem Boyz"" REALLY need a long intro?

*song starts*
AY! *autotuned*

Autotune? AUTOTUNE?! STILL?! REALLY?! Is this still here? Do we NEED this when rapping, a musical form of art that isn't reliant on tonal pitches? Was auto tune the thing you needed to help this record go over with the people? I ask you, honestly, have you ever heard a rapper start using auto tune and said to yourself, ""Well, I WAS gonna stop listening to him, but then he started sounding like a robot with a vocal glitch, and I thought, ""Hey, I should give him a second chance!"" I don't know about you, but when I hear a rapper with auto tune on, I immediately tune out, because I have YET to a hear a rap verse with auto tune on it that was EVER good. Not even from Lil Wayne, not even from Kanye. Sure, maybe there were songs where he SANG the whole time and I liked it, but I can't name you ONE good auto tuned rap verse. My theory is that most rappers who throw auto tune on their verses do it because their verse was boring as shit, they KNEW it was boring as shit, and had to find a way, ANY way to possibly make it sound interesting

Hol up, hol up, Hol up, we dem boyz

*looks*

Hol up, hol up, hol up, we makin' noise
Hol up, hol up, hol up, hol up, hol' up

That is not the chorus

Hol up, hol up, hol up, we makin' noise
Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz

Dear God. This is the chorus

Hol up, hol up, hop up

What are we holding up for? Are you trying to think of what to say next, but the beat is drowning out your thought process or something?

*beat stops*

There, the beat stopped, so now you can think. So, what were you trying to say?

Hol up, hol up, hol up, hol up, hop up

*looks*

Hol up, we dem boyz

Oh… So, the whole phrase is, ""Hol' up: we dem boyz"". Not, ""hol' up BECAUSE we dem boyz, no, nothing is connecting these phrases, just ""hol' up. We dem boyz"". So, all that build up, telling us to hold up, and pay attention, and that's all you had to say? You sure you had nothing else to add there?

Hol up, hol up, hol up, we makin' noise

Well, ya damn sure ain't makin' music

Hol up, hol up, hol up, pop a bottle (pop a bottle)
Hol up, hol up, hol up

Wait, did the verse just start? I… I can't tell, it all sounds the same. Okay, eventually he starts using other words, and since he spent the first full minute of this video telling us that they, indeed, dem boyz, well, what about these boys?

Hol up, hol up, hol up, pop a bottle (pop a bottle)
Hol up, hol up, hol up, If you suck, then swallow

…Okay, I'm assuming he's not talking to his boys when he says that, but I guess what do I know?

And white girls gimme becky (Becky)

Well, that part's just about you

Leave the club these hoes be tryin to chase me

…and… that's also just about you. So… whatever happened to… dem boyz? I mean, is it too much to ask that if Wiz demands you halt what you're doing to pay attention to his statement that he and his clique are ""dem boyz"", shouldn't he… tell you something about them? Who they are, what they do? A plural noun is all I'm asking for. You could literally replace ""me"" with ""us"" in these verses and it would at least fit the presumed subject of the song. But since I guess we're not talking about dem boyz anymore, despite, that, being, THE CHORUS, please, just go on to tell us more about yourself

Foreign girls call me sexy

Do they now? Only foreign girls, eh? Hm, maybe they just don't know the English translation for ""freakishly skinny""

Throwin money on her like she won the lotto (the lottery)

Did… the background vocals just explain what he meant by the ""lotto""

Like she won the lotto (the lottery)

Thank you, background vocal Khalifa, we REALLY needed the clarification

Say she never smoked I turned her to a stoner (smoking now)

Is she smoking now? Is THAT what you meant by turning her to a stoner? Well, I couldn't have guessed!

You got a ass so fat let's make a baby (And another one)

You know, these rappers seem to have a thing about painting women as gold digging whores, like in THIS line:

Man on the low all these hoes be actin so material

...but dude, if the only qualification you have for having a child with a woman, not just having sex, nope, we've skipped to wanting to father children based off of butt sizes, so if you're willing to pay child support from the jump based off of the size of a girl's ass, maybe, just MAYBE, you're kind of inviting shallow, vapid women to rip you off

Hol up, man did you see her interior?

Her interior?… are we still talking about women at this point? Because, the previous line was:

Hoes be actin so material

And then… you bring up her… interior… like, he's asking have you seen her insides? That's, serial killer talk, dude. I mean, I'm sure he's just talking about her vagina, but for God's sake, she's not a car! I mean, I know rappers frequently like to objectify women as cars, but referring to the inside of her vagina as the interior is just slightly too specific to not be awkward

Hol up, these niggas broke, these niggas lazy

Oh, they're lazy, are they? And, how does 70% of this song go again?

Hol up, hol up, hol up, hol up, hol' up

Yeah, never call anyone lazy again

You know, a lot of you guys give me guff for not giving certain songs lower ratings. Like, some people thought I was too nice to Nicki, or too nice to Iggy Azalea, no, it's not that, it's just that it's all about perspective. ""Pills N Potions"" was average, ""Fancy"" was a little below average, but wasn't bad enough to warrant too much hatred. THIS is terrible. This is effortless, this is lazy, this is crap. This deserves a 0 out of 5. Honestly, hip-hop fans out there Why do you like this? And no, I'm not talking to young, impressionable surface fans who would listen to the sound of a baboon jacking off if there was a catchy chant over it. No, I'm talking to the straight-up fans of Wiz Khalifa that perpetually keep him popular. Why do you like this? He's not doing anything that any run of the mill unknown, talentless rapper isn't doing: which is slathering auto tune on their voices and spitting rhymes that 8 year olds would find intellectually insulting, so why do you like him in particular? What made you want to give your money to him and say, ""Yes, this is worth it. You are special""? Cause as far as I'm seeing, he is not. And this isn't like some one-hit wonder who got big off one hit who will eventually fade away, this guy has stuck around, but with music like this? For real, I want you to take away the hype, take away the radio play that repeats the song to make you like it, take away the name Wiz Khalifa from this song, it's just a song that you heard and didn't know who it was by. Listen to this again… *Hol' up hop' up hop' up* and tell me what there is to like about this. On second thought, don't tell me. In fact, If you'll excuse me, I will gleefully return to my existence of NOT listening to Wiz Khalifa

Tearing down an almost two lane back road

Staying on the gas like we're never coming back

We are, we are, we are tonight

Jouant avec la main qui nous a été donnée dans cette partie

On doit arrêter de faire semblant mais on ne le fait pas
Pourquoi nous pointer du doigt de toute manière quand on est les mêmes?

Apparemment pour faire le chemin ou aurait besoin d'un arrêt au stand
Attends, je sais que l'amour peut être une plage sans rivage

Je sais que parfois c'est dur de réaliser que je suis l'homme dont tu as besoin
J'ai fait un rêve on a fait des branches, commencé un arbre généalogique, hein
Et j'ai l'impression que tout ce qu'on fait c'est trop tard
Tu m'as demandé pourquoi j'aime tant ta mère, car elle est une toi plus vieille
J'espère que tu es heureuse
Je suppose que c'est la seule chose que je devrais te donner
Il n'y a pas de numéros deux
On est un et un, et on est le couple le plus impair
Seulement humains, sauf toi, t'es une déesse
Te mentant seulement quand je te couche, je ne suis qu'honnête

It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

You ain't nothing but a creeper baby, I'm just saying though
Saying though, aye, it ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

[Verse 1 - K Camp]
Creeping on the low, hope your man don't see
She will bust it down for some damn Lime-A-Ritas
Chew me like some bubblegum, something like Rasheeda
Gotta get my partner some, she on me like Adidas
Baby, you can't hold back, better stop flexing like you not
Your man tryna patrol then I guess he is a cop
But he really can't cuff if he busting at my spot
But I done had enough cause you making my shit hot
Blowing up a nigga phone, what I tell yo ass 'bout that?
Tryna hold something, hold my nuts, can you do that?
Can you play around with that mouth while he hit it from the back?
You can't say nothing now cause we all been through that, through that

You know that ain't a real bag bitch, that's a knock off
When I get that work I get to juggin' like hot sauce
All swimmin pool lakefront
Hit it from the back, rearrange her lace front
Stuntin', tattoos on my neck and on my kidney
If I don't like that ho I turn her ass into a frisbee
If I dont like your disc I turn that ho into a frisbee
I throw it out on Old Nat right by the Wendy’s
Three cellphones and all of 'em jumpin'
I can see your hoes and all em' nothing
Yeah I'm a don don', Don Cheadle, Don Cornelius
Watch the Dom spill
Pockets fat as Don Cartagena, nigga, done deal!

Hit her on yo mattress, make you feel some type of way
Pass her to my migos, they gonna bust it, ¡Andale!
Please don't play no games cause I know thats what you like

That’s my fam, I’ll hold ‘em down forever
Us against the word, we can battle whoever
Together ain’t no way gonna fail
You know I got your back, just like a turtle shell
Nobody do it better, all my brothers tryna get some cheddar
We all want our cut like the Shredder
Me and my bros come together for the dough
Bought the orange Lamborghini, call it Michelangelo
With the nunchucks doors and I'm pullin' up slow
When we fall up in the party, they know anything goes
Check my rolex they say I'm the man of the hour
All this green in my pockets, you can call it turtle power

We all around if it's going down
It's just us, all for one, yeah you hear 'em right
Our business done, we disappear into the night
Came up together, so we all down for the fight
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Family, ain't nothing strong as that
And I'll be posted up where the strong is at
Brothers by my side, city on my back, real heroes
That's what the people want
They ain't born, gotta create 'em
Sayin' we gone as soon as we save 'em
Thats part of the plan, by my side I'mma keep my brothers
Live or die man we need each other

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Four hittas, four winners
Tryna tell 'em you don't wanna go to war with us
We be them, we be them, young ridahs
Raised in the gutters, really started from the bottom
We all we ever had, we all we ever needed and we undefeated
We be goin' hard, and make it look easy
Give me the whole pie, real cheesy
I told your girl No but you might not believe me
Takin' pics for me, told her smile for me
Pass her off I'm a real team player
Bandanna on my face like a gangster

I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to fake it
The only time we really talk
Is when our clothes are coming off

It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay it in instead
I like us better when we're wasted

Ohhh ohh ohh oh oh

You are my glass half empty
Sipping my ocean dry
Emotionally spin me
'Till none of our planets could align
But I could stand you one more night

Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead

You are a catch-22, either way I miss out
All of the grief I give you
Is energy I can live without
But I could stand you one more night

Ooh, girl, you're shining like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never going out of style
Ooh, pretty baby, this world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me
When I just wanna make you smile?

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

[Chorus]
You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic
Baby, you're so classic (Baby you)
Baby, you're so classic

[Verse 2: Tony Oller]
Four dozen roses, anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you, doing it Sinatra style
I'mma pick you up in a Cadillac like a gentleman bringing glamour back
Keep it real to real in the way I feel
I could walk you down the aisle

I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's love on rewind, everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it how you—
Out of my league, old school chic
Like a movie star from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic
Baby, you're so classic
Baby, you're so classic

[Verse 3: Malcolm Kelly]
Baby you're class, and baby you're sick
I never met a girl like you ever till we met
A star in the 40s, center fold in the 50s
You got me tripping out like the 60s, hippies

Queen of the discotheque
A 70s dream and an 80s best
Hepburn, Beyonce, Marilyn, massive
Girl you're timeless, just so classic

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind

Good thing I'm not epileptic

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here, boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus 2]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""come here boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

[Bridge]
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

[Chorus 3]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss

Literacy's your mission (Hey, hey, hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's why I think it's a good time (Woo!)
To learn some grammar (What)

Say you've got an ""i-t""
Followed by apostrophe ""s"" (Woo!)
Now, what does that mean?
You would not use ""it's"" in this case (Woo!)
As a possessive (No, no, no!)
It's a contraction (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
What's a contraction?
Well, it's the shortening of a word or a group of words
By omission of a sound or letter (Woo!)

Okay, now here are some notes
Syntax you're always mangling (Woo!)
No X in ""espresso""
Your participle's danglin' (Uh-huh)

If you really wanna (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh)
Leave out that Oxford comma (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh)

Some cunning linguist (Woo!)
To help you distinguish
What is proper English
(Everybody wise up!)

[Bridge]
One thing I ask of you (Okay)
Time to learn your homophones is past due (Woo!)
Learn to diagram a sentence, too
Always say ""to whom"", don't ever say ""to who"" (Woo!)
And listen up when I tell you this
I hope you never use quotation marks for emphasis (Woo!)
You finished second grade, I hope you can tell
If you're doing good or doing well (Woo!)
You better figure out the difference
Irony is not coincidence (Woo!)
And I thought that you'd gotten it through your skull
About what's figurative and what's literal (Woo!)
Oh, but just now (Just now), you said (You said)
You ""literally"" couldn't get out of bed (Woo!) (What?)
That really makes me want to literally
Smack a crowbar upside your stupid head

[Pre-Chorus]
I read your e-mail (Yeah, yeah)
It's quite apparent (Woo!)
Your grammar's errant
You're incoherent (Woo!)
Saw your blog post (Hey, hey)
It's really fantastic (Oh, woah)
That was sarcastic (Oh, psych!)
'Cause you write like a spastic (Woo!)

I hate these word crimes (Everybody wise up)
Your prose is dopey (Woo!) (Hey)
Think you should only (Woah, woah)
Write in emoji (Woo!)

242,Trophies,"Listening to an album or single is one thing, spending the effort to search, and/or annotate an artists lyrics separates casual listeners from loyal fans. Genius analytics can truly determine who made the biggest impact in a calendar year. So with that in mind, we decided to breakdown lyric driven trends in 2014.
Most viewed songs in 20142014 really felt like the year of the ""single"". While we missed major label offerings from the game's hottest MC's, we had an abundance of outstanding singles, features and breakthrough artists. The likes of Bobby Shmurda, Rich Gang, and Rae Sremmurd dropped meme-generating songs quicker than you could understand what Young Thug was saying.  And although Thugger and Rae Sremmurd   may appear more times on the list, Bobby Shmurda took the crown with his single “Hot Nigga”, which  has snagged more than 3,000,000 page views since July last year.

Even with the Young Thugs and Shmurdas in the rap game, fans found themselves furiously searching content from 2012 and 2013. Just under half the songs you'll find below were not from 2014. Most notably, 2013's two rap biggest songs - “Drunk In Love” & “Rap God” sit at the top of our view count. In an even bigger twist, Kendrick Lamar flexed his influence with “m.A.A.d city” - the 8th track from his modern classic good kid, m.A.A.d city broke into the top 10.
1. Beyonce ft Jay Z - “Drunk In Love”
2. Eminem - “Rap God”
3. Bobby Shmurda - “Hot Nigga”
4. Rich Gang - “Lifestyle”
5. Beyonce - ""Partition""
6. Drake - “0-100/The Catch Up”
7. Lil Wayne ft. Drake - “Believe Me”
8. The Weeknd ft. Ty Dolla $ign & Wiz Khalifa- “Or Nah Remix”
9. Kendrick Lamar ft. MC Eiht - “m.A.A.d city”
10. Big Sean ft. E-40 - “I Don’t Fuck With You”
11. T.I ft.Young Thug - “About The Money”
12. Jhene Aiko - “The Worst”
13. Rae Sremmurd - “No Flex Zone”
14. Childish Gambino - “V. 3005”
15. Nicki MInaj - “Lookin’ (Lookin' Ass Niggas”)
16. Rae Sremmurd - ""No Type""
17. Eminem ft. Rihanna - “The Monster”
18. Jay Z ft. Beyonce - “Part II: On The Run”
19. Drake - ""Trophies""
20. Kanye West ft. Charlie Wilson - “Bound 2”
Most viewed artists in 2014Song views may rule the roost when it comes to who had the hottest meme of the minute, but an artist is the total package. In 2014, only six of the most viewed artists on Genius released full albums. The most surprising addition to the top ten is Childish Gambino -  seeing his name there with raps heavyweights shows how far he's come from that infamous 1.6.

Drake took 2014's crown as the most viewed artist on Genius - is this a surprise? Yes, for two reasons. The list doesn't include features, and Drake only released a handful of tracks in 2014, meaning he relied heavily on 2013's Nothing Was The Same. It looks like Yeezy was right all along, Drake really is the most popular man in rap.
1. Drake
2. Eminem
3. Beyonce
4. Kanye West
5. Kendrick Lamar
6. Childish Gambino
7. Jay Z
8. Lil Wayne
9. J. Cole
10. The Weeknd
11. Nicki Minaj
12. Rick Ross
13. ScHoolboy Q
14. Jhene Aiko
15. Rich Gang
16. Chief Keef
17. Chris Brown
18. Big Sean
19. Chance The Rapper
20. A$AP Rocky
Bonus: The Carters Beyonce & Jay Z appear in the top ten artists, but only on records featuring each other in the ""most viewed"" songs list. This cements their ""power couple"" brand, but raises more questions about their individual status. Have the ""Beyonce & Jay Z"" brands been replaced by ""The Carters?""

245,Let It Go,"[Verse 1]
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I've tried

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know

[Chorus 1]
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Verse 2]
It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

[Chorus 2]
Let it go, let it go
I'm one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past!

And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go

She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up and I said
Hey, I know I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot
She said, I saw you coming over, I already thought it over
And okay, so now what

[Chorus]
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car

[Verse 2]
So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin

[Chorus]
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I really hadn't thought it through that far
I can't promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car

[Verse 3]
We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor said, you know what's on the way
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out

[Verse 4]
And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
You think it'll start, I said, it's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are
She said, are you sure it'll get us where we're going
I said, if there's one thing I know girl, it's gotten us this far

But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall

Well, I guess all those years
They don't mean nothing
Now I can't wait
To count those rings
Nothing left of us but dust and splinters

Because I, I don't have you

248,Timber,"Hi. Rap Critic here. Let's talk about Pitbull…

So, how do you talk about a rapper who has nothing to say?

I mean, I can't remember one song from this man that DIDN'T talk about being in a club. As far as I remember, his topics range from ""party party party, and drink, drink, drink"" to ""party party party, and drink, drink, drink … but, like, in another country this time!"". Geez, even Sean Paul did a love song every once in a while! And I don't have a problem with party music in general, far from it, it's just that anything involving Pitbull's music has a very… processed feel to it, like a prepackaged, factory-sealed, product. Every one of his mini-verses seem like such cliff notes versions of rap music tropes, it's insulting

Like, dude, come on, LIE TO ME. Can you at least pretend like you're more than ""the go-to guy for optional rap verses on pop songs""? You know how on some radio stations, they'll cut out the rap verse of a song, leaving you with 30 seconds of an awkward voiceless backtrack, as you rap along to words that you could swear were there the last time you heard it? ""California Gurls"". Yeah, because apparently there's still a large amount of people out there who just can't stand the thought of rappers in popular music, so much so that there are radio stations across the country who market themselves on the idea that, ""Hey, if you listen to us, you don't have to wory about all that pesky rap nonsense that's ruining music!"" *play intro to ""California Gurls"". Wait, they even cut him out of the intro? He's not even rapping there!

I have NEVER heard of something like this happen to other genres of music. I've never heard of a radio station dedicated to editing out violins and saxophone solos from songs because some people don't like jazz or classical music. In fact, I've never heard of a rap station that prides itself on cutting pop singers out of rap songs, but when it comes to rappers on pop songs, people are still saying ""get that damn talky noise out of my ear,"" so much so that you can bank your radio station's appeal on that sentiment alone? That's… disappointing, to say the least. Wait, who were we talking about again? Oh yeah, Pitbull. Sorry, I got distracted by something interesting...

But yeah, Pitbull to me, always ends up sounding like a guest artist on his own songs most of the time. In fact, I'm surprised no radio station's gotten confused and accidentally cut the the rap verses out of his own songs. *example of Pitbull's song being edited*

You know, I reviewed a Flo Rida song a year or so ago, and the only reason I decided to do so was because it was called ""I Cry"", and a title like that meant that maybe he would say something I could actually make a full episode ago. And, well, he did say a few things, but for the most part, it was kinda typical. But hey, at least there was that initial interest. Now, Pitbull's a little different from Flo, in that, admittedly, his Spanish heritage gives him a a little bit of flavor to his lyrics, but not in a really substantial way. But, like Flo Rida, I figure if I do hear a song from that sounds like it'll stand out, I give it a try

Then, I heard this song, ""Timber"". *song intro* Well that's…certainly different. A country western rap song from a guy from Cuba and a woman who was obviously raised in… in… Nashville, Tennessee? Oh… well, she doesn't sound like it! *beat switches to typical club music* Uh… and neither does this song anymore. Really, the harmonica is the only thing keeping the country theme together. And yeah, the sample comes from a 70's bluesy song, but… look at this video. I think you know what they're going for

It’s going down, I’m yelling timber
You better move

I will say, that's a relatively witty, catchy first lyric. Unfortunately, I wouldn't say it's strong enough to build a whole song around,  but given how generic the rest of the chorus is, it leads me to believe that that first lyric was the only reason this song was made.  Like, they were thinking, ""Hey, guys, how's this: ""it's going down... like someone shouted timber, get it?"" And… uh… rednecks like trees, right? Rednecks, lumberjacks, same thing, am I right? Am I right, fellas? No, seriously, is that right? I don't know…

""Let's make a night *Or, a song* you won't remember""

Okay, let's stop wasting time. Let's get to pit bull. So basically, let's waste more time...

The bigger they are, the harder they fall

Okay, that's not a bad opener, continuing with the trees-slash-party metaphor, in that the bigger the tree or the bigger the party, the more intensely hard it's gonna go down. That's… ok

This biggity boy’s a dignity dog

Also, I appreciate the callback to the 90's with the Das EFX's placement of ""iggety"" in the middle of words, which is fitting, because it pays homage to the HipHop tradition that, even back in the 90's, rappers could get famous off of spitting a bunch of unimportant nonsense. Seriously, listen to ""They Want EFX"" and tell me it held some deep message about the human condition:

My thigh bone's connected to my knee bone
My knee bone's connected to my hardy-har-har-har

No Parks sausages, mom, please

Oh-h-h-h-h-h-hhh I'm steamin, a-go-ny!

B - I - N - G - O-oh
You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around, hon, so uh
Dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun

I'm pretty sure those guys just got high and tried to reference everything from their childhood as quickly as possible. Hm… I wonder if they went on to write for Family Guy. *play ""Price is Right"" loser horn, look to camera, shrug shoulders*

I have ‘em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber

I understand that Miley Cyrus is a buzz word right now when it comes to twerking, but *show miley twerking*  I don't think that's because she was good at it

Face down, booty up, timber
That’s the way we like the what, timber

Okay, really, what is up with rappers censoring themselves on the uncensored versions of songs. I get it if it's done for an effect, like a joke or something, but THIS lyric is a reference to a very explicit 2 Live crew song:

""FACE DOWN, ASS UP, THAT'S THE WAY WE LIK TO FUCK""

And he's not making a joke about it, he sounds like he was tapped on the shoulder and told to make the lyric less explicit by saying ""booty"" instead ass and saying ""that's the way we like to WHAAT!?"" like his parents just walked in while he was recording the lyrics

""Face down, booty up, that's the way we like to WHAT!?! Mom, dad, you weren't supposed to be in the studio today?!

Look, when the only reason you're self-censoring your words is so because you're actively trying to be more radio friendly, then just erase the lyrics and say something else!

Look up in the sky, it’s a bird, it’s a plane
Nah, it’s just me, ain’t a damn thing changed

I guess that's an okay reference, saying that even though people may seem him as someone whose ego's reached a great height as far as fame and wealth are concerned, he's still a down to earth guy, but… when you watch the video, it ruins any charm it might have had. He just looks so smug about a line that wasn't really that great. *show his face* Get it, I compared myself to superman, hehe… well, I thought it was funny…*

Club jumping like Lebron, now Voli

You know, I would be angry about this blatant interruption of the song for the sole purpose of product placement, but honestly, I'll take this over what he did on the ""Give Me Everything"" song, which, at the very start of the song, synergized repetition of product placement with the fact that rhyming words with themselves has become openly accepted as a way to rap in order to give us this gem:

Me not working hard?
Yeah, right! Picture that with a Kodak
Or, better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak

Why yes, Pitbull DID have a deal with Kodak. How did you know? Well, anyways, let's get back to the verse:

Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it’s going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it’s going down

Oh, I'm sorry, I must have skipped to the bridge near the end of the song, let's back up by about 45 seconds

Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it’s going down

Wait, I'm sorry, I went too far back! Now, we're in the middle of the first verse, and… wait, keep playing that part

One more shot, another round
End of the night, it’s going down

…No… This man, instead of making two full verses, just repeated a two bar phrase for the second  half of BOTH verses. You… cheater!!! Dude, n… really? You just COULDN'T be bothered to write two complete verses? I mean, hey, I guess that makes both our jobs easier. Whatever, you know what? I give this a 2 out of 5

You could give this song credit for trying to do the country western approach with the harmonica, and the intro that sounds like a more bluesy/country western feel. And to Pit's credit, he's... just not on the song long enough to annoy me. His mannerisms are there, but they're tolerable. Well, except for the ""just repeat one phrase to substitute as the second half of the verse"" thing. It's so obviously jarring to hear, because to my ear, it truly feels like he ran out of things to say and just plugged in the bridge that was supposed to go at the end to make up for unfinished verses. As well, after a while, the phrase ""it's going down"" is used so much, it starts to feel like one of the writers was someone's out-of-touch dad who just figured out what ""it's going down"" meant, and REALLY wanted his kids to know that he was hip to the lingo

It's goin' down
It's going down
It's goin' down
It's going down
It's goin' down
IT'S, ABOUT, TO GO, DOWN!

After a while it starts to feel forced, like they're TRYING to make it popular, or people JUST started saying it and they're trying to make it the new Y.O.L.O. or something, but it doesn't have enough personality or catchiness to do so. Well, I'm the Rap Critic!

[Verse 1: Jimmy Skoog]
Yeah, I was six years old when my mom told me give it all, never hold back
So for a few years I would try real hard and I had my moments, no Kodak
Relocated from the city to a small town and I moved to a school so notorious
And I felt so out of place so it's no lie when the song tell the story of
A shy kid, never talked back, feelings hidden by the shades and the ball cap
So all their weird looks had me feeling trapped, as others thought of me thinking I was all that
And it's funny how they never caught that vibe of a kid that was heading down a dark path
And that all their words only made it worse but they just laughed when they walked past, so I'm...

Lost in the world, keep searching. Grind real hard, putting work in
But I still can't see no light at the end of the tunnel, is it worth it?
And I heard them say if you're always on the move you won't ever feel the world spin
Well, if that's true then that must be the reason I feel like I'm caught up in a whirlwind
Stuck, all I need is a little luck, tailwind, a few bucks - I'ma show this
Whole world that I've got it all planned and whatever goes down I won't ever lose focus
So sick of being told this goddamn lie that I'll never get noticed
Trapped in a town all bogus, like a great white in a gold fish bowl, bitch
I stay cool, try to get it on
Bet it all on this dream they are shitting on
I ain't saying that I'm better y'all, I'm just little too big for your little pond
Sick of being told I can not be the greatest at what I do, just watch me
'cause I know what I'm doing and Alex already told me that he got me, that's why I'm...

Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end

Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

When I'm wiser and I'm older

And love is the prize

Did they ever fight like us?

They never tried like us

Quarter in a payphone
Drying laundry on the line
Watching Sun Tea in the window
Pocket watch tellin time
Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown cause I couldn't buy it yet
If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree

Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

[Verse 2]
If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls
And girls would turn them down
Staying married was the only way to work your problems out

Tell me whatcha say now?
Tell me whatcha say
Come again?
If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
'Cause you got me face down

And don't take this personal
But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me

Tell me whatcha say now
Tell me whatcha say?
You said that you would come again
You said that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one
So why would you show up?
So uninvited then
Just change my mind like that

[Bridge 2]
Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special

You better act like you know

Everybody's like, he's no item
Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em
He one nights 'em
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
And tell you the truth, wish we never did it
'Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
(God damn) God damn, baby, my mind's blown
Be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And, yeah, I know what you did
But baby I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just

276,Show Me,"Hi, I'm the Rap Critic, and… look, I know pop songs are typically lazily-written, blatantly sexual, and just the lowest common denominator when it comes to portraying any sort of intelligence, but this is just… okay, let's start from the beginning

This is Kid Ink. His main attribute is that he has tattoos. Like, a lot of tattoos. Other than that, he, uh… look, he's the new version of whoever had a hit song last year, but didn't stick around long. For all intents and purposes, he's j-kwon version 10 for the year 2014. And if you don't remember who J-Kwon is, well, that's exactly my point. So, here's Kid Ink's 2014 reimagining of the 4,348th song about being in the club and wanting to have sex with a girl, but… in the assembly line of mediocre pop/rap songs, something happened in the process that made this particular product defective.  and it starts with Chris Brown, who should be weaving one of those suggestive yet subtle pop song choruses that R and B singers are known for, right?

""Baby let me put your panties to the side (uh)""

….You know, that's romantic…

But seriously, wow, talk about cutting to the chase. You know, most songs usually have some some sort of build up to an explicit lyric, some set up of some kind. Jeez, even Enrique Igacias at least begged her pardon first *""Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude""* before saying, *""But tonight, I'm fucking you""* . But when you just kick off a song with ""Baby lemme put your panties to the side"" I can't help but feel like we skipped a few steps. It just seems a little contrary to the smooth R and B singer thing he's trying to pull off

""I'mma make you feel alright
‘Cause I'mma give you what you need, yeah""

Okay, now we're back into the vague, obviously sexual but in no way descriptive style of songwriting that you guys are known for!

""Mami you remind me of something
But I don’t know what it is (I don't know)""

….*amused, quick-off-and-back glance*

""You remind me of something (uh)
But I don’t know what it is right now""

…*chuckling* You've gotta be kidding me! Are you really gonna base the hook of this chorus around an unfinished pick up line?

""You remind me of something (uh)
But I don’t know what it is right now""

Don't try to act like this is some slick turn of phrase, you sound like you just couldn't read what the songwriters gave you on the note pad!

""Mami you remind me of something
But I don’t know what it is (I don't know)""

I don't know what… what is this trying to do?! Are you trying to pass off forgetfulness as sexy? You guys must think amnesia is downright titillating! no really, I wanna know the thought process behind this. Maybe, they realized how corny pick up line choruses were getting, especially after whole bedrock debacle, and thought they could do a Seinfeld-type one up move by comparing her to… nothing. Nah, that sounds too existential. Was this, maybe… some sort of homage to that old R. Kelly song?

""You remind me of something
I just can't think of what it is""

But wait, in THAT song, he immediately starts using comparisons

""You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride it
Something like my sound, I wanna pump it""

Sure, they're stupid comparisons, I mean, I don't think any woman wants to be compared to a jeep, if being compared to cars at all. I mean, if you were, why not something like a maserati, or a lamborghini, those are some sexy cars. In fact, I'm pretty sure there's an adult actress NAMED maserati, because that sounds cool. But, no girl would call herself a jeep. I mean look at this thing, it's bulky and asexual at best. You might as well call her a van. So, maybe they weren't referencing that song. Maybe this chorus was just completely improvised, and he just blurted out whatever came to mind first

""Hands in the air, looking' for a bitch right now""

Yeah, that would explain a lot.. But wait, I didn't let the chorus continue, maybe there's something in there I forgot about. What does he say after that line?

""Cause you remind me of something (uh)
Girl you gotta show me (alright) *looks confused*
You remind me of something (uh)
But I don’t know what it is right now (I don't know)
You remind me of something (uh)
Girl you gotta show me""

Wait, so that's what you were doing? That was your ace in the hole? Trying to turn your absentmindedness into the reason why she should have sex with you? Look, when I hear a song where someone's talking to a member of the opposite sex, I usually imagine what it would translate to in real life. And when I hear this, this is the only way it translates to me:

""Girl, you remind of... of something, but I don't remember what it was… so why don't you remind me… by having sex with me…

As far as I can imagine, there's just no way to make this sexy. Unless of course, you're a well-known celebrity, in which case, the chorus could be interpreted like this:

Girl, you remind me of, um… of, uh…*girl: uh-huh?*... look, I'm rich and famous and I want to have sex with you. Can we just skip to the part where we… *girl: yeah, sure…* Alright, let's go

And with the obvious ""You could never say something this stupid to a girl unless you're as rich as me"" mentality that this chorus has been written in, it pulls me out of the song immediately… and we haven't even gotten to the rapper yet!

Uh, on the real no lie
I don’t know what it is but you just my…

Okay, I see we're just gonna get the same obliviously stupid mannerisms that we've heard on the chorus. in fact, I don't even know why I'm bothering. It's obvious that I'm not going to get anything clever from this song

Got a cup in your hand (hand)
Baby sitting but you ain’t got no kids

Rhyming ""hand""…. with ""kids""… You know what? This song is already promised a VERY low rating because of Mr. Brown over here, so unless there's some great payoff to that crappy chorus, it's not redeeming itself. So, come on, let's skip ahead to the lyric that says what she reminds him of, because there's no way they'd set up such a chorus without some punchline SOMEWHERE

We ain’t leaving ’til there ain’t no more left (yeah)
Can’t see no time on the Rolex

Yeah, yeah, your watch has so many diamonds, you can't see the time, everyone's said it, and you're not special. Keep going

Go on the floor like a doormat (uh)
Baby you know where to throw that

Wait… is that what she reminds him of, a doormat? Because she ""goes on the floor""? Well, I hope not, because… calling a person a doormat, has… a bit of a negative connotation to it, so this can't be it, let's… keep going

Uh, so tell me what your name is
I don’t really care who you came with (no)

Nope, he doesn't bring… really, now? Is that what you're going to say to her?

""So, girl, what's your name?""
""Well, I'm Kiesha, I just came with my best friends…""
""Haha, I don't care…""

Unless you got a couple friends look like you

""That is, unless of course, your friends are hot, because then I'll want to have sex with them, too… and… by openly telling you this, I'm assuming it won't be a problem, because, I mean, when has a girl ever been jealous when a guy tries to talk to other women?

My bad if my ex try to fight you

Oh yeah…

Okay, I'm sick of this, and the way he thinks chatting up girls at the bar works is not helping, but that chorus still frustrates me, so I want to get to the point: what is the thing that she reminds him of? I have to know

You remind me of…

Oh, here it is! Here's the thing she reminds him of! All will be revealed!

You remind me of something missing
Misses, you got my full attention

So… she reminds him of… something missing, like in his life, which is a ""mrs."", a spouse, a loving companion… WHAT A LOAD OF HORSE SHIT

So, this song was building up to him telling her she was wifey material? Oh, I'm sorry, maybe the fact that you were talking about pulling her panties to the side 2 minutes before you even asked what her freaking name was kinda threw me off!

This gets a 0 out of 5. It's crap. These lyrics are horrendously irredeemable, from the word go. The very first line of the chorus socks you with a bad taste in your mouth, and what follows are a bunch of lines that NO ONE would get away with in real life, so there's no connection you could make with it. The problem is that the way the chorus is written, with forgetting what he was going to say, sounds like it should have been played for laughs. But it's not. They wanted you to take that seriously as a slick pick-up line, There's nothing smooth about what he said, and there's nothing cool about it. It sounds like it was written by a bunch of jackasses who have no idea how human interaction works, and I just can't deal with it

You got me thinking that we could run away

Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's

And now that ass gettin' fatter and I know it's because of me

I put that glacier on your little hand
Now that's the only thing without a tan
My trophy on that Bound bike, I gave you only pipe

289,Billie Jean,"[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"" (Hee-eeh)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (Ah-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee)

[Break]
Ah, hee-hee-hee
Hee! Hoo!

[Chorus]
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! (Oh)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son (No-no-no)
She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one

290,Slave To The Rhythm,"[Verse 1]
She dances in the sheets at nights
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

[Chorus]
She's a slave to the rhythm

[Verse 2]
She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
""Sir, I must be home tonight""
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind

[Chorus]
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

[Bridge]
She works so hard, just to make a way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

[Verse 3]
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

[Chorus]
Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

293,Somebody That I Used To Know,"[Verse 1]
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Verse 2]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

Thinking about you sitting there saying I hate this, I hate it

Give me back my hometown
Cause this is my hometown

All the colors of my youth
The red, the green, the hope, the truth
Are beating me black and blue cause you're in every scene

These sleepy streetlights on every sidewalk side street
Shed a light on everything that used to be

Give me back my hometown

Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight sorrow free
I will give you all of me
Just leave your lover, leave him for me

We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old
Oh, I'm in love with you and you will never know
But if I can't have you I'll walk this life alone
Spare you the rising storm and let the rivers flow

298,Can't Remember To Forget You,"[Verse 1: Shakira]
I left a note on my bedpost
Said, ""Not to repeat yesterday’s mistakes""
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory
The way you make me feel, yeah, you gotta hold on me
I've never met someone so different
Oh, here we go
You a part of me now
You a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

[Chorus: Shakira]
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh

[Verse 2: Rihanna & Shakira, Both]
I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I'm tryna say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory

The way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh, here we go
He a part of me now
He a part of me
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow

300,Headlights,"[Produced by Emile Haynie & Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave!""
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2: Eminem]
‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Momma, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & Eminem]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone public, excuse me
Been wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew; see, it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)
Hit the lottery, oh wee
But With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meet
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink

No I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from

You-you won there's no more u-u-using your mind
The way it worked)
Yo-lo-lo-lo-yee-whoo
I think you've been wandering off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it

Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
Emcees, blood get spilled and I
Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates that's so great

EXT. WINTER RIVER, CONNECTICUT - DAY

A crisp and perfect New England town.  Almost too neat
to be real.  No visible townspeople.  CAMERA EXPLORES
town.


CAMERA FLIES

over a rickety bridge -- PAST the Maitland Hardware and
Appliance store -- PAST the church -- the Historical
Society -- UP over the graveyard on the hill and
finally --

To the Maitland house.  The perfect Victorian house
surveying the tiny village.  Suddenly --


A GIANT DADDY LONGLEGS SPIDER

mounts the crest of the hill beside the house, pauses to
wave a spindly leg and then creeps menacingly on top of
the Maitland house.

ADAM (O.S..)
Well, well, you're a big fella...!

A hand -- as big as God's -- with a huge tweezer,
gently reaches down out of the sky and lies, palm up,
in the yard next to the house.  Daddy Longlegs climbs
into it.  The hand rises into the sky again.


INT. ATTIC - NEW ANGLE - DAY

Reveals Winter River as a miniature town, while The
Daddy Longlegs and the hand are normal size.  Above the
model are a homely representation of moon, sun, and
stars -- a whole, tiny, mechanical universe to track
the hours of the day.  A large plat map of the city is
prominent on the wall.

The hand is ADAM MAITLAND'S.  In his late 30's, he's a
solid easy-going citizen.  Capra used to make movies
about him.

Adam's model town sprawls across most of the attic
space.  Windows on either end of the attic shed good
light into the warm room.  Adam very carefully lifts
the spider out the open window.  Smiles as he drips him
lightly on the breeze.


CAMERA TILTS UP FROM THE WINDOW

To see the real Winter River, laid out exactly as the
model, at the foot of the hill.  Adam breathes deeply
and looks very pleased at the glorious town below him.


ON HIS HUGE HAND AGAIN

as it reaches into model and tweezes a tiny sign into
the tiny window of Maitland's Hardware Store on main
street.  It reads:

ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND
ARE
ON VACATION!
HOORAY!

Adam leans down and eyes the sign.

BARBARA
(behind him)
I'm ready!

Adam turns to see entering:  BARBARA MAITLAND, 35 -- a
wholesome beauty who is mellowing well.  She smiles at
him.  Perhaps a certain tinge of sadness about her,
because they don't have children.

ADAM
(happy to see her)
She's ready.

BARBARA
(eyeing the model)
It looks great.

ADAM
(nodding)
Thanks.

She pushes a wrapped present across the table.

BARBARA
Happy vacation, honey!

Adam smiles and gives her a present he's hidden under
the table.  He opens his present.  A can of furniture
oil.

ADAM
Manchurian Tung oil?
(playfully grabs
Barbara and kisses
her)
Where did you get it?

BARBARA
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
There's enough to refinish the
gateleg table and the cherry
wardrobe...

Adam hands Barbara a carefully-wrapped bundle -- she
unwraps her gift... rolls of very expensive floral
wallpaper.  She cradles it in her arms like gold leaf.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam... it's beautiful.

Adam nods, and embraces her.

ADAM
Enough to do the guest room...

BARBARA
(cooing)
I'm so glad we're spending our
vacation at home...
(with a sudden resolve)
... I'm going to get started right
now!

ADAM
(pulling her back)
Whoa!... hold on...

Barbara calms down, returning to Adam's embrace... as:

PHONE RINGS -- They freeze, then grin.

ADAM & BARBARA
(unison)
No one's home!

HONK HONK outside.  They look at each other horrified.
Peer out the window.

BARBARA
Oh no.

ADAM
(pointing at her)
It's your turn, darling.

She shakes her head with resignation and goes downstairs.
KNOCKING on door from below.


INT. STAIRCASE AND KITCHEN - DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS Adam and Barbara downstairs.  We see the
rambling, old fashioned quality to the house.

Clean, sentimental, warm and floral.  Some rooms in
progress.  They continue down the main staircase past
photos of themselves, old photos of the early days of
Winter River, pictures and mementos of three
generations in hardware.  Barbara goes to the kitchen
and Adam continues down to the basement.


HER POV - A WOMAN

JANE BUTTERFIELD -- tall, gawky and aggressive peeks in
the kitchen door.  She's divorced three husbands and
buried another for good measure.  She's ruthless but is
weirdly, seamlessly pleasant.  She waves a legal sized
paper at them, starts to come inside.


INT./EXT. KITCHEN DOOR

Barbara makes dash for it and holds it just as Jane gets
a foot in.  Jane smiles wildly.

JANE
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you.
I heard you were on vacation!

BARBARA
That's right, Jane.  Complete
vacation.

JANE
Honey -- today I am three hundred
fifty thousand dollars!

BARBARA
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the
morning!

JANE
Look at me, think of me as cash!
This offer is really real!  From a
rich man in New York City who only
saw a photograph!
(rattles on)
My buyer has just made a killing
in condos in Manhattan, but he's
got a little stress problem...
(taps her head)
... so -- he wants to bring the
wife and kid for the old peace and
quiet.

BARBARA
That's what we're looking for,
too.

JANE
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, just
listen now.  This house is too
big.  It really ought to be for a
couple with a family.

That hurts Barbara a little.  She looks at Jane.

JANE
(continuing)
Oh, honey... I didn't mean
anything... it's just too big for
you.

Jane compulsively affixes her business card, face inside.
in the windowpane.

BARBARA
(shutting door)
'Bye, Jane, see you in a few
weeks.


ADAM

is humming happily, looking for paint brushes in the
ground floor storeroom.  He spies a cassette deck and
looks through a stack of cassettes and plays one.  It
is an old INKSPOTS LOVE SONG.


INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

Barbara is starting to paper the walls already.  She
frowns at the MUSIC.  Goes to the door.

BARBARA
Oh, honey.  You said no Inkspots
on this vacation!

It CLICKS OFF.  She goes back into the room.


INT. STOREROOM - DAY

Adam puts away the tape but keeps humming the song.  He
opens the shutters on a small window.  ON WINDOW...

JANE
(her huge face
grinning at him)
Boo!

He jumps back, frightened.

ADAM
No, Jane.

Adam closes the shutters as Jane affixes yet another
card to the window.  He continues his search for a
brush.


JANE

exits jauntily, flapping her contract down the lawn.


INT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Adam continues rummaging for a brush.  Can't find it.

ADAM
(calling to distant
Barbara)
Honey, come with me down to the
store?

BARBARA (O.S.)
What for?

ADAM
I need a good brush for this Tung
oil and I want to pick up a piece
of the model.  Let's go early
before anyone sees us.

Barbara has already papered a few rolls in the guest
room.

BARBARA
Okay, but let's hurry back.  You
just run in okay?


EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

The Victorian house from the model ""in the flesh.""
Adam stands by the station wagon.

On the bumper of the car is a sticker reading:
WARNING:  I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS.

Barbara gets in driver's side.  They drive off.


INT. THE CAR - DAY

Adam dusts the inside of the dashboard.  Clean Clean.

BARBARA
(preoccupied)
Jane said we should sell the house
to someone with a family.

ADAM
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.

Puts his hand on her shoulder.


EXT. THE RIVER AND BRIDGE AND HILL - DAY

We see the car coming down the hill toward the bridge.

ADAM (V.O.)
We should be flattered that she
wants to sell our house.

BARBARA (V.O.)
I know... I just wish she'd leave
us alone.

ADAM (V.O.)
Let's not think about it.  We'll
have a nice romantic, quiet,
vacation.  Here comes the bridge
chorus.

Car reaches the rickety covered bridge.  Car shakes,
bobbing up and down on every plank.

ON Barbara and Adam TIGHT -- (they've done this routine
before).  They sing an old Johnny Mathis song.  With a
lot of vibrato.

TOGETHER
Chances are... When I wear a
foolish grin...

They laugh.


EXT. DOWNTOWN WINTER RIVER - DAY

Just like the model, but real.  And populated.

CAMERA PAUSES ON a gorgeous storefront with a brass
lion out front.  Sign above doors says --

BOZMAN BUILDING 1835

An old man polishes the lion as Maitlands drive by and
wave.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Wave at the lion.

ADAM (V.O.)
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.

BARBARA (V.O.)
(embarrassed)
Adam!

Ernie looks around to see no one's looking and polishes
the balls of the lion.


CAMERA SPIES A JAUNTY DOG

like Benji, peeing on the opposite corner of the lion.
Maitlands drive by store with sign:

JANE BUTTERFIELD
ANTIQUES
REAL ESTATE
TRAVEL


INT. ANTIQUE STORE REAL ESTATE OFFICE TRAVEL AGENCY -
DAY

The store is bursting with antiques of all sorts,
travel brochures, photographs of houses for sale, and a
serve-yourself Xerox machine.  LITTLE JANE, her eight-
year-old daughter is drudgingly making copies.

Jane, phone in hand, rushes to the window to watch
Maitlands drive by.  Almost popping the cord when it
reaches its end.  She's waiting for the other party to
pick up.

JANE
Y... ello.  Mrs. Deetz?  Well the
condition is what we country folk
call, fixin'... Yes, I think they
are fixin' to accept another
offer.  Well maybe if you offer
390,000 they'll take it.


EXT. MAITLAND HARDWARE - DAY

Adam sprints up the steps of his lovely hardware store.
OLD BILL, a slightly-addled ancient barber, is napping
in a chair in front of his shop, next door to Adam's.
Adam fumbles with the lock, not interested in conver-
sation.  He drops his keys, waking Old Bill.

OLD BILL
'Morning, Adam.  You need a
haircut before your vacation?

ADAM
No thanks, Bill.

OLD BILL
How's the model coming?

ADAM
Good, Bill -- Good.

Bill turns around and continues prattling even though
Adam has entered.  Bill prattles throughout.

OLD BILL
Y'know, I was thinkin'... you said
Bozman built the foundation in
1835 but y'know his grandson came
in here last week and said he
found a bottle with an 1836 stamp
in it plastered in the foundation.
(suddenly disgusted
at the memory)
He's got hair down to his
goddamned shoulders...


INT. MAITLAND HARDWARE

Adam pulls down a few good paintbrushes and carefully
picks up a small model of the Bozman building.  He
walks out.  Old Bill continues unabated.

OLD BILL
He said ""Just give me a trim..."" I
took a scissors to him so fast...
would've skimmed him clean if he
hadn't...

Adam strides by quickly to the car.

ADAM
See you, Bill.

OLD BILL
Right.


EXT. MAITLAND'S CAR - DAY

The Maitlands drive their car out of town.


ON JANE


EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE - DAY

Car approaches.


INT. CAR - DAY

Five brushes sit on the seat next to Adam.  He cradles
small replica of the Bozman building, complete with
brass lion.

BARBARA
It's a beauty.

ADAM
Yeah it turned out okay.  We
applied for a historical plaque
for it.  That'll be the third one
on Main Street.

BARBARA
(jokingly)
With all these historical
landmarks in town, where are they
going to put the condominiums?

ADAM
(grinning)
Slow down there, honey... I don't
want the vibration to weaken the
model.

BARBARA
(nervous)
Oh... I'm sorry...

Barbara starts to apply the brakes.

Just before the bridge the dog waddles out in the road.
Stops to pee.  Barbara swerves.  As the car hits the
rickety bridge, the speed is just a bit too much.

Boards RATTLE and loosen, the car skews and catches in
an open slot, careens to the right, then the left and
the bridge.


INT. CAR - DAY

A piling has smashed through the window on the pas-
senger side, crushing the upper part of Barbara's
arm.  She is wailing in pain and fright.

Adam tries to help Barbara.  He tries to get out of the
car.  None of this succeeds.


EXT. BRIDGE AND RIVER - DAY

The dog finishes, looks over at the car, walks across
the bridge and steps on the one board which holds the
car aloft.

The car rocks back and forth for a moment, and then
slides forward toward the water.


EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE

The car plunges into the rushing water.  It floats
for a moment, and then sinks like a stone.

FADE TO BLACK.


FADE IN:

INT. BARBARA AND ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Quiet, still, expectant.  There is a fire laid in the
hearth.  Suddenly and for no apparent reason it ignites
and burns with a furious cheerfulness.

Barbara and Adam enter, dazed, wet, and bedraggled.

BARBARA
Something like this always happens
when we try to go on vacation.
Always.

Adam leads her toward the fire.

ADAM
You'll feel better when you're
dry.

He holds out his hands to be warmed.  Barbara comes up
beside him.  All this time she's been holding her
injured arm with the other hand.

BARBARA
This fire wasn't burning when we
left the house.

ADAM
How's your arm?

BARBARA
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.

She holds her arms out to warm them.  One hand catches
on fire.


BARBARA'S LEFT ARM

They stare at it dumbfoundedly before Adam regains his
senses and snatches it out of the fire.  Two of the
fingers are burning like candles, and Barbara indus-
triously blows them out.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam.

CUT TO:


INT. LIVING ROOM:  A FEW MINUTES LATER - DAY

They are sitting on the couch together.  Barbara is
looking away slightly -- as one does when a doctor is
drawing blood -- while Adam looks at her fingers.  He
frowns.

He looks at his skin.  It is pale.  He looks at
Barbara.

ADAM
You'd better sit down, hon.

BARBARA
I am sitting.

ADAM
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I
don't think we survived that
crash.

BARBARA
(pause)
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own
house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some
coffee.  You get some more
firewood.

Adam gets up, a little absently, she follows him as he
wanders to the front door.  He peers out.

ADAM
Let's take things extra slow.  Do
you remember how we got back up
here?

Barbara tests her hand, clenches and unclenches her
fist.

BARBARA
I'm fine.  My arm works fine.

Adam, exploring, opens the door, steps out on the front
porch.


EXT. FRONT PORCH - TWILIGHT

Adam's face is painted with color of sunset.  He stands
atop the steps leading down to the front yard.  Barbara
stands just inside the open threshold, looking out
worriedly.

BARBARA
(quiet sarcasm)
The end of a perfect day.

Adam starts to step down to the yard.

ADAM
Honey, I'm gonna go down to the
bridge and retrace our steps.

He steps off the last step into the yard and promptly
disappears.

BARBARA
Adam!


EXT. THE GREAT VOID

Adam is nowhere.  There's no ground, no sky, nothing to
stand on or hold onto or give boundaries or distance.
Just vast nothing.  Not white and not colored either.
NOISE OF A CLOCK TICKING.

Adam looks about surprised, doesn't like what he
doesn't see.  He turns around to head back up the
steps.  There are no steps.

ADAM
Barbara?

His VOICE ECHOES STRANGELY.  He runs off a little in
the distance, and calls again from over there.

ADAM
(continuing; quietly)
Where are you?

He goes even farther away.


IN THE FOREGROUND

an enormous geared wheel -- the size of a man -- rolls
by, tearing up the unseamed ground.  Something pours up
out of the tear -- ooze or stuffing.

Adam runs forward and stares after the wheel, which is
now out of sight.


TWO SMALLER GEARS

looking very much like components of a giant watch --
spin along behind him.  One of them veers suddenly
toward him, and though Adam jumps out of the way, the
gear snags his trouser leg and shreds it.  LOUD
TICKING.


A PERFECTLY ENORMOUS GEAR

comes barreling toward him.  Adam leaps out of its
way.  The gear turns, fish-tailing, kicking up ooze and
stuffing.

Adam flings himself suddenly to the right, but trips
into the path of the gear.  As he's about to be
crushed, he's suddenly jerked up to safety.


EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

It's Barbara who's grabbed him, and quite evidently
saved his life -- not life, perhaps -- but existence.
He's shaken, breathless.

Barbara stares at him, as if wondering what he's just
been through.

ADAM
(weakly)
You saved my -- uh -- life... or
whatever...

BARBARA
Two hours.

ADAM
What?

BARBARA
That's how long you were gone.

ADAM
(pondering that)
... Hmmm?


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Barbara leads Adam into the house.

ADAM
Anything happen while I was away?

BARBARA
Yes, it did.  Yes, it did.  I made
a couple of small discoveries.


BARBARA

stands by the mirror over the hearth mantle.  On the
mantle is Barbara's prize collection of porcelain
horses.  Adam comes to stand beside her.  They look
into the mirror, and there is no reflection of them.

Barbara picks up one of the horses, and trots it through
the air.  The horse is imaged in the mirror.

BARBARA
(continuing)
There's that, and there's this.

She picks up an ancient, leather-bound book.  It's
yellow and worn, about the size of the Boy Scout
manual.

CLOSEUP:  Its title is HANDBOOK FOR THE RECENTLY
DECEASED.

ADAM
(reading)
Handbook for the recently
diseased.

BARBARA
Deceased.  I don't know where it
came from.  Look at the publisher.

ADAM
(he does and reads)
Handbook for the Recently Deceased
Press.

BARBARA
(finally admit-
ting it)
I don't think we survived the
crash.


INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam is already in bed, reading from the handbook.
Barbara is getting ready for bed -- going through a
ritual of sorts that they practiced every night of
their married lives.

BARBARA
I don't like situations like this.
I hate it when I'm not in control.
So just tell me the basics.

ADAM
This book isn't arranged that
way.  What do you want to know?

BARBARA
There are a thousand things... Why
did you disappear when you walked
off the front porch?  Is this a
punishment?  Are we halfway to
heaven or are we halfway to hell?
And how long is this going to
last?

ADAM
I don't see anything about
""Rewards and Punishments"" or
""Heaven and Hell.""
(frustrated)
This book reads like stereo
instructions!  Listen to this...
'Geographical and Temporal
Perimeters... Functional
perimeters vary from manifestation
to manifestation.""  This is going
to take some time.


BARBARA

paces, she trips on her wallpaper rolls.  Kicks them.

BARBARA
I knew I'd never finish the guest
room.  Adam, we just can't stay in
here forever!

They look at each other, the question hangs in the air.
Can't they?

Adam stands and walks to the window.

ADAM
(thoughtfully)
Maybe we should set up a normal
routine.

She looks at him like he's nuts.

ADAM
(continuing)
I mean, let's try to nail down
something in our lives.  A regular
schedule.  We can keep track of
time and go on with our projects
up here in the attic.

She shakes her head, exasperated.  Flops down on the
bed.

BARBARA
Oh, God, maybe this is all just a
bad dream.

ON ADAM - TIGHT - a somber look comes across his face.

ADAM
I'm afraid not, honey.

Barbara looks up at him, questioningly.

BARBARA
Why?  What's wrong?  Adam?

She stands and joins him at the window.


THEIR POV THROUGH THE WINDOW

In the distance we see an automobile funeral procession
threading its way toward the nearby cemetery.  Head-
lights are on.  We recognize Jane's car in the line.


REVERSE ON BARBARA AND ADAM

somber faces.


TIGHTER ON PROCESSION

It arrives at the gravesite.  We see some familiar
faces, Ernie, and Old Bill the Barber.  Jane and little
Jane watch as two identical coffins are carried to-
gether, to two open graves.


ON BARBARA AND ADAM

She drops her head sadly on his shoulder.  He leans his
face slightly into hers.

FADE OUT.


FADE IN:

INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam is setting up a small monument in the model town
cemetery.  It reads:  ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND/UNITED
IN LIFE/UNDIVIDED IN DEATH.

ADAM
I wish I had a better view of the
cemetery from up here.  I don't
know which area is the best
placement for us.

Barbara, trying to clean, lets out a frustrated YELP!
She paces.

ADAM
(continuing)
Cabin fever, han?

BARBARA
I can't clean anything.  The
vacuum is out in the garage.  I
can't leave the house.  Why don't
they tell us something?  Where are
all the other dead people in the
world?  Why is it just you and me?

ADAM
Maybe this is heaven.

BARBARA
(looking at the
dusty walls)
In heaven there wouldn't be dust
on the wallpaper.

ADAM
Hon... I didn't want to die, but
really, this is fine with me.
Look, we never have to wash dishes
again.

BARBARA
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three
weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you.  I
really need to be around people,
get out to the church and go
grocery shopping.

ADAM
But I'm not hungry, are you?

Barbara shakes her head and picks up the Handbook and
pages through it desperately.

BARBARA
I keep having this feeling that
something has got to happen.

CAR DOOR SLAMS outside.  Adam and Barbara look at one
another.  Run to window.


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Jane Butterfield is staring up at the old house.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam, from his angle, can just barely see her.

ADAM
God, it's Jane.

BARBARA
What's she doing here?

ADAM
I don't know.
(shouting)
Jane, Jane, up here!


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Unhearing, Jane heads for car.  SOUND OF WIND UP.
Blows her dress.  Little Jane straggles along with her
like an apprentice.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara watches Adam, and shakes her head.  He stops.

BARBARA
She can't see you, right?

Adam nods.

BARBARA
(continuing)
In the book, Rule Number Two:  the
living usually won't see the dead.

ADAM
Won't?  Or can't?

BARBARA
Just says ""won't.""  Wait a minute.
Here it says ""the living are
arrogant... they think they'll
never die, so they refuse to see
the dead.""

ADAM
Arrogant.  That's Jane all right...

Barbara sighs and nods.

BARBARA
At least we won't have to worry
about her.

Adam smiles and goes to his model.


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Jane drives away.  CAMERA HINGES to see a FOR SALE
sign.  Across it -- another smaller banner.  It reads:
SOLD!

CUT TO:


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

The Maitlands are asleep.  CAMERA EXPLORES the room a
bit.  It is getting slightly tatty.  Adam rolls over,
pulling the covers off Barbara.  We see:

ON BARBARA -- she is hovering off the side of the bed.

An OMINOUS RUMBLE -- like a 4.0 earthquake shakes
the house.  GLASS RATTLES, the ceramic horses on the
mantelpiece jump around.  Barbara falls to the floor.
They look at one another with horror.  They leap up and
run downstairs.


INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

The RUMBLE BUILDS TO A CLIMAX, there is a LOUD METALLIC
SQUEAL, and then a CRASH... just as Barbara and Adam
arrive.


THE FRONT DOOR

smashes open revealing a moving van ramp.


A TEN-FOOT ELECTRIC-BLUE ITALIAN LEATHER COUCH

slides smoothly down the ramp.  On the couch sits DELIA
DEETZ.

The couch CRASHES into the base of the staircase,
smashing the newel post and several of the balusters.
Barbara cringes.  One of the balusters falls at Delia's
side.  She grasps it like a scepter.

Two MOVING MEN rush down the ramp.

MOVING MAN #1
Sorry about that, Mrs. Deetz.

DELIA
Don't worry.  It was going anyway.

Delia is relentlessly New York, relentlessly fashion-
able, relentlessly thin -- totally self assured.

She is also a woman with a mission -- to gut Barbara
and Adam's house and remake it in her own very upscale
image.

Delia's gaze is on the living room, but she looks
through Adam and Barbara as if they weren't even there
(which to her eyes they're not).

Still holding the baluster, Delia gets up off the couch
and moves into the living room, surveying it with an
odd mixture of ambition, and resolution.


BEHIND HER

the two Moving Men bring in a matching blue leather
armchair.  In the armchair sits LYDIA DEETZ.

Lydia, age 14, is a pretty girl, but wan, pale and
overly-dramatic, dressed as she is in her favorite
color, black.  She's a combination of a little death
rocker and an 80's version of Edward Gorey's little
girls.

She has a couple of expensive cameras around her neck
-- and is already taking photographs of the moving
men.  Lydia is cool, Lydia is sullen, Lydia is her
father's daughter by his first marriage.  Lydia is
usually about half-pissed off.  But underneath... we
like her a lot.

The Moving Men still hold up the chair, waiting for
Delia to decide where she wants it.

DELIA
(continuing)
Jesus.  Who lived here?  The
Waltons?

TIGHT ON Lydia -- calmly surveys the house.

Delia signals wearily that the Moving Men can put the
chair down anywhere.

DELIA
(continuing)
Get all this other crap out of
here.

Lydia hops down out of the chair, and comes farther
into the living room.

DELIA
(continuing)
Where is your father?... probably
in the kitchen.

That's the cue for CHARLES DEETZ, who comes in through
the swinging door, and across the dining room... a ner-
vous but basically pleasant man, CHARLES DEETZ is
intent on attacking rest and relaxation with the same
vengeance that earned him millions in real estate.

CHARLES
The noise in that kitchen.  Noisy
refrigerator, noisy faucets...
We'll have to replace it all.  I
want no humming in the house.


LYDIA

exploring on her own, gazes around the living room with
growing pleasure, she backs up for a good angle to
photograph.

CAMERA HINGES -- She is standing with her back right up
to Barbara -- who is horrified at this creature.

Charles enters.

CHARLES
(to Lydia)
What do you think, honey?

LYDIA
Delia hates it.

Lydia gazes at a dusty maze of spider webs.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I could live here.

A movement makes Lydia turn around and scream.  It is
Delia.  Not Barbara.

DELIA
Settle down, Lydia.  I wonder
where we are going to get
counseling for you out here.

A VIOLENT FALSETTO SCREAM turns the Deetz family's
attention to the front windows.

OTHO (O.S.)
Help!  Oh help!


OTHO'S MASSIVE BODY

Wedged in the window frame.  The short, stubby legs,
dressed in the world's largest pair of Georgia Armani
slacks, protrude into the living room, waving fran-
tically.  Expensive Italian loafers are kicked off the
feet, revealing a pair of expensive patterned socks.
By their feet shall ye know them.

DELIA
It's Otho!

CHARLES
Otho, why didn't you just come in
the door?

Otho's voice comes as if from a great distance.

OTHO (O.S.)
It's bad luck.  And I believe
hugely in luck.

DELIA
Hold your breath and we'll pull.

Delia turns to Charles and Lydia for help -- doesn't
get it -- and at last pulls Otho into the living room
single-handedly.

All this while the Moving Men are variously carting out
the handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous
new furniture.

Otho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and
faggoty.  But he's not all fat and fun -- this customer
carries nasty emotional weight as well.


OTHO

holds onto the curtains for support as he is pulled
through the window.  And when he is at last all the way
through, and upright on his feet, he suddenly gives a
tremendous yank.  The whole drapery apparatus,
including valences, crashes to the floor.

OTHO
That was the single most
unattractive window treatment I
have ever seen in the entire of my
existence.

DELIA
(starry eyed)
I'm so glad you could leave the
city to consult me, Otho.

Otho is looking around the room with an eye of quiet
horror.

OTHO
Yes, of course you are.  Well,
Otho had an intuition.  Call it a
hunch -- that it was going to be a
fabled monstrosity of a house.
And it certainly is.  Charles,
you're lucky the yuppies are
buying condos, so you can afford
what I'm going to have to do to
this place.  We are talking from
the ground ups'ville!

CHARLES
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me
out of it.  I am here to relax and
clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I
mean to do it.

He exits to find solace in a quiet corner of his house.
During this speech, Otho has been surreptitiously pos-
ing for Lydia's camera.  She clicks the shutter.

OTHO
(ignoring her)
Is the rest of the house as bad as
this?

DELIA
The rest of the house is probably
worse.  When can you and I get
started?

OTHO
No time like the present, as my
wicked stepmother used to say.

Out of the pockets of his size 56 Georgia Armani
jacket, Otho takes two cans of spray paint -- the kind
the graffiti artists use -- and shakes them as if they
were castanets.  They certainly sound like it.

OTHO
Delia, let's get this show on the
road.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

At one end, near the stairs leading up to the attic,
Barbara and Adam are slumped against opposite walls.

BARBARA
Adam, we are in hell.  I hate
these people.

ADAM
They make Jane look good.

BARBARA
Is this a punishment for something
we did in life?  What can we do?

ADAM
(determined)
We're not completely helpless.
I've been reading the book.
There's a word for people in our
predicament, honey.

Barbara looks at him.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Ghosts!

Barbara is shocked at the reality.

Otho and Delia come up the stairs at the end of the
hallway.

OTHO
We're dealing with negative
entertainment potential here.  I
mean, there's absolutely no organic
walking flow-through.

Otho looks down the hallway.  It's empty.  Adam and
Barbara are no longer there.

DELIA
What's wrong?

OTHO
I thought I saw something.

DeLia turns and spray-paints on the wall -- in luminous
orange -- the word MAUVE.

DELIA
Okay?

OTHO
(screaming with delight)
You read my mind!  I love clients
who can read my mind.  I don't
think people realize how strong a
connection there is between
interior design and the
supernatural.

DELIA
(fawning)
I know... I read your book, The
Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf.

OTHO
Gooood!

Delia opens the door and they step inside another room.

DELIA
This will be Lydia's room.


INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - DAY

It's not Lydia's room yet, of course, because it still
has the Maitlands' furniture in it.  Barbara had partly
wallpapered it before the accident.  Her tools are still
there.

DELIA
What do you think?

OTHO
Viridian?

DELIA
Viridian?  What is...?

Otho spray-paints the word VIRIDIAN on the wall -- plus
the word BLUE GREEN -- and Cr2 03, right over a picture
of Adam and Barbara as kids.

OTHO
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic
oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in
chemistry.  I was a hair analyst!
Briefly.  Interior design is a
science, Delia!  Think of me as
Doctor Otho.
(looking at wall)
And this patient is truly sick!

DELIA
Of course, her favorite color!
How beautiful!

Delia smiles.  Behind Delia and Otho, the room's closet
door swings slowly open with and ominous CREAK.


DELIA AND OTHO

turn that way, with a suggestion of dread.  Inside the
closet, Barbara's corpse is suspended from the ceiling
by a belt.  The corpse twists with a CREAK, and Barbara
grins ghostly -- and slowly tears off her face, leaving
nothing but muscle and bone beneath.  Her eyeballs
dangle on her cheeks.

Delia and Otho stare aghast.

DELIA
Oh my God!

OTHO
We just have to pray that the
other closets are bigger than this
one.

He walks over.  Looks inside.

OTHO
(continuing)
Were these people dwarfes? (sic)
(spies something)
Oooooo!...  Look!

He finds, neatly hung in plastic, the Maitlands'
wedding outfits.  Totally captivated by this powerful
image, he peers through the plastic at them.  Holding
each up to Delia.  Barbara watches wide-eyed at them.

OTHO
(continuing)
Ozzie...
(holding up
her dress)
... and... Harriet!  What happened
to these people?

Delia slams the door in Barbara's contorted face.

DELIA
They died.


INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

Delia and Otho come out of Lydia's bedroom and go
through the bathroom.  Disgusted, they continue on to
the study.


OTHO

reaches out and turns the knob.  The door swings omi-
nously open on Charles' study.  This had been Adam's
reading and birdwatching study.  Bird posters on the
wall, books everywhere.  Straight out of Better Homes
and Gardens 1963.

OTHO
Ooo.  Deliver me from L.L. Bean!


ANGLE

There is one slight difference, however, because on the
rag rug in the middle of the floor lies Adam's headless
corpse.  Standing over him, holding in one hand a long
knife and in the other Adam's blood-and-gore dripping
head is Barbara -- with a maniacal look on her face.
Behind them, Charles is thumbing through Adam's Audubon
collection.  He sits up like a cornered animal protect-
ing his territory.

CHARLES
(to Otho and Delia)
This room is off limits.  I don't
want either of you to touch one
piece of furniture in here.  This
is my room.


INSIDE THE ROOM

The eyes of Adam's severed head open and look up at
Barbara -- she stops screaming.

ADAM'S HEAD
They don't see us.  They can't
hear us.

Outside, Delia is shaking her head.

DELIA
The woman who lived here had the
aesthetic instincts of Betty
Crocker.

BARBARA
I'm going to get her.

DELIA
I cannot convey to you the extent
to which this house bores me.

OTHO
(looking around
scientifically)
Once you cover up the wallpaper,
knock down a few walls, alter the
traffic patterns, and -- perhaps
-- think about an inground pool --
the place might just be livable.
What's on the third floor?

DELIA
Attic space.

OTHO
Let's see.  We could turn that
into a media room.

They head up the stars to the attic.


INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Adam's head has a look of terror on it.

ADAM'S HEAD
Oh, God.  I forgot to lock the
attic door!

Adam's headless body jumps up off the floor and rushes
out of the room.


INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - SAME TIME

Otho and Delia climbing.  The headless corpse careens
past them, around the bend in the stairs and out of
sight.

OTHO
Did you feel something?

Delia shakes her head.

OTHO
(continuing)
I felt a cool wind.

The expression on Otho's face suggests he knows more
than he's telling.


INT. LANDING OUTSIDE ATTIC DOOR - SAME TIME

The headless corpse rushes through the open door into
the attic.


INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

The headless corpse slams the door shut, turns the key
in the lock.  Then he slumps against the locked door in
an exaggerated stance of relief.


INT. ATTIC LANDING - SAME TIME

Delia tries the knob.  The door is locked.

OTHO
You don't have a key?

DELIA
Maybe Charles does.

OTHO
I have a feeling there's some very
interesting space behind this
door.

DELIA
(sarcastic)
Probably the world's largest
Reader's Digest collection!
C'mon, let's have some chablis,
Otho, I'm laid bare by this
experience.  Entirely bare.


INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Barbara still holding Adam's head.

Charles still calmly leafing through the Audubons.

ADAM'S HEAD
Whew!  That was close.

BARBARA
I cannot witness this.

Barbara distractedly puts Adam's head on a bookshelf.
His headless body fumbles with the books and finally
reattaches the head.


INT. STUDY - DAY

Adam turns away from the window.

Barbara, fuming, moves around Charles making wild
gestures.

BARBARA
What's the good of being a ghost
if you can't frighten people to
death?

ADAM
Oh, honey...

BARBARA
No, I'm not putting up with this.

She storms out of the room.


INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Barbara storms in, as if straight from the room up-
stairs.  She heads straight for the back door.  Just as
she opens the door, Adam rushes up.

ADAM
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out
there.  You don't know --

BARBARA
Nothing can be worse than this...

She flings open the door and steps outside.  She
promptly disappears.

ADAM
Barbara!


EXT. SURFACE OF SATURN'S MOON TITAN - DAY

Barbara plunges into the dusty surface of Titan with an
enormous Saturn looming in the sky.  She looks around
with wonder and some fear.


A SULFUR VOLCANO

erupts in the distance.  A meteor CRASHES with a lurid
EXPLOSION.  As from a great distance she hears Adam's
VOICE.  Like THUNDER.

ADAM
Barbara!

She turns slowly in the yellow dense sand that covers
the surface of this distant moon.


BARBARA'S POV

Adam is trudging towards her.  Behind him, hovering
isolated in the air, is the kitchen door.


BACK TO SCENE

Adam at last catches up with her.  Surveys around them.

BARBARA
Oh Adam.  Find somebody.  I'm
getting all yellow.  Do something!


BEHIND THEM

Something is burrowing rapidly toward them through the
sand.  The Something could be right out of ""Dune"".


BARBARA AND ADAM

stare for a moment, then Adam grabs her and pulls her
toward the kitchen door.  But the kitchen door has
moved, so they veer in the new direction.

The Something follows them and rises out of the sand.


ON SOMETHING

It is a very big, very nasty, and very hungry SNAPPING
SANDWORM.  It ROARS and lunges at them.


BARBARA

slightly angered at it, instinctively bats at it.


THE SANDWORM

is momentarily stunned at Barbara's audacity.  It
freezes and shakes its loathesome head.


BARBARA

bats at it again.  Adam is wide-eyed, tries to pull her
away.  The Sandworm recovers and ROARS after them.


ADAM

grabs Barbara and tries to escape, but they slip and
sink in the sand.

They make it to the door just in time, swing it open
and hurl themselves through.  The door shuts with a
BANG just in front of the ROARING SANDWORM.

THE SANDWORM

rears and ROARS in frustration, HOWLING to the ringed
planet.


INT. KITCHEN

Barbara, weeping, throws herself in Adam's arms.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me
alone.

ADAM
You left me.

BARBARA
I know.  I'm sorry.

She hugs him tight.

BARBARA
(continuing)
I just realized that I could have
been killed alone.  Don't ever
leave me, honey.

Both contemplate that horror.

BARBARA
(continuing)
We're trapped in this house
forever... with those... people.

ADAM
You can't say that for sure.  It
could be a transitional thing.
Like a post-life crisis.  We just
have to be tougher with them.
Come on.  Have some brandy.
Spirits?

BARBARA
(a tentative smile)
Death didn't improve your sense of
humor.

They head for the dining room.


INT. DINING ROOM

Adam has his arms around Barbara's shoulder.  They walk
in the door and stumble upon the Deetzes at their
dinner.  Lydia's back is to them.  Barbara and Adam
back out of the room but stop to listen.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The Deetz's around the dining room table.  There are
candles and good china laid out-- but they're eating
out of Chinese take-out boxes.

DELIA
I can't believe that we're eating
Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan
up here?  Hunan?

CHARLES
There's only one Chinese
restaurant out here, darling, the
owners are Irish and Irish people
happen to cook Cantonese.  They
don't know better.

LYDIA
I plan to have a stroke from the
amount of MSG that's in this food.

DELIA
This is our first meal in this
house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do
our little private parts to make
it a pleasant one?

CHARLES
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a
darkroom in the basement.

LYDIA
(dramatically)
My whole life is a darkroom!
One... big... dark... room.

Delia rolls her eyes and nods.  She's been through this
before.

DELIA
Nonsense... you'll go to school,
maybe meet a farm boy.

Delia laughs.  Charles smiles.

LYDIA
(doleful)
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll
let me hang myself from a rope in
his barn.

CHARLES
Lydia, in a couple of years this
whole town will be filled with
people like us.

DELIA
We'll be the art center of summer
New York.  I'll start sculpting
again... I'll teach those gallery
bastards to refuse my sculpture.
And when Otho and I get through
with this house, you people are
not going to recognize it.

LYDIA
(dramatically)
I say let's keep it the way it is.

Delia stares at Lydia.

CHARLES
(smiles)
Good idea!

Delia shifts her glare to Charles.

LYDIA
I do.  I really like it.  I
mean, it's already sort of like
somebody's home, isn't it?  Their
couch is comfortable and doesn't
stick to your legs.  It smells
like a real home, not a French
whorehouse.

DELIA
Lydia, at your age, you are so
young.
(back to business)
Charles, we need to call that
awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow
and get the key to the attic door.
Can't you find a way to hold back
some of her commission?

CHARLES
We're going to have a lot to do
tomorrow...
The Goodwill truck is coming.

DELIA
... and whatever is up there in
that attic goes away with it.

CHARLES
Should have it fumigated, too.  I
saw a fly today.

Lydia looks at them with a mixture of sadness and
anger.


OUTSIDE THE DOOR - ON THE STAIRS

-- listening, sit Barbara and Adam.  A tear rolls down
her face.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam and Barbara are lying down on the floor, peering
out of one of the small windows overlooking the front
yard of the house.  The handbook open in front of them.


EXT. FRONT YARD - ADAM AND BARBARA'S POV - DAY

The entire front yard is alive with workmen and their
vehicles.  Plumbers, electricians, cable TV men, etc.
In the road on front of the house are several cars of
rubbernecking locals, astonished by all the activity.
The City has come to Town.  Moving men continue to move
in the Deetz' modern, expensive and ugly furniture.
They collide with Goodwill men coming out with the
Maitlands' lovely antiques and personal possessions.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam and Barbara just look at one another as if to say
""We're next!""  Adam leafs through the handbook furi-
ously.

BARBARA
Look in the index...

ADAM
Not really...  what's this?

Adam pulls from the book an ancient, yellowed,
crumbling handbill.  He carefully opens it.

ON handbill -- very primitive, crude, red printing.

ADAM (V.O.)
(reading)
Having difficulty adjusting?
Is death a problem and not a
solution?  Unhappy with eternity?
Troubled by the living?  Call
Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.
That's Betelgeuse,  Betel...

The remainder of the sheet is torn off.

ON Barbara -- fingering the torn edge.  Looking in the
book for the remainder.  No luck.

BARBARA
That's it?  No number, or
instructions?

ADAM
Nothing.  The bio-exorcist?  I
don't get it...


INT. KITCHEN

Charles, away from the chaos outside is calmly steeping
a mug of herb tea.  His solitude is interrupted by a
2500 lb. Vulcan range breaking through a too-small
kitchen window.

CHARLES
(shouting through
the window)
What the hell are you trying to do
out there?


DELIA - OUTSIDE

is berating the inept crane operator and shrieks
periodically at some fine art movers who are struggling
under her horrid modern welded steel sculptures.


LYDIA

snaps photos of the mayhem.  She stops to scan the whole
house.


LYDIA'S POV

When her gaze reaches to top of the house, she suddenly
glimpses Barbara and Adam's faces in the window.


BACK TO SCENE

Lydia blinks hard.  Her mouth drops open.  She looks
all around -- as if she'd just seen a ghost or two.


JANE BUTTERFIELD'S CAR

pulls up.  Little Jane sits in the front seat, burdened
with an enormous stack of collated and stapled copies.

Lydia catches sight of Jane and runs over.

Little Jane locks her door, in fear of Lydia-the
strange.  Lydia stares at her.

LITTLE JANE
Are you a boy or a girl?

LYDIA
I only speak to vertebrates.

LYDIA
What happened to the people who
used to live here?

LITTLE JANE
(ratty little voice)
They drowned!

JANE
Yes, they were family.  I was
devastated.
(beat)
Here, darling.

Jane hands a key to Lydia.

LYDIA
(impressed)
Is this the key to the attic?

JANE
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open
any door in that house.  Will you
give it to your father?
(handing her a
business card)
And you might mention that I
single-handedly decorated the
house.  In case he needs advice in
that area.  Come see me.

Jane goes away.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Lydia's face sobers as she looks up at the now empty
attic window.

DELIA (O.S.)
Help!  Get off me!

Lydia drops the skeleton key into her pocket surrepti-
tiously.  She follows Delia's SHRIEKING.


EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Lydia rounds the corner to see Delia, pinned flat
against the house by one of her horrid steel sculp-
tures.  Two movers are struggling to free her.  Lydia
snaps a quick photograph.

They finally free Delia.  She clutches at her head,
just short of tearing her hair out.

DELIA
You jerks!  That is my art, and it
is dangerous!  You think I want to
want to die like that?
(seeing Lydia)
Lydia.  Moving is a family affair.
So buckle down now and go get
Mommy some drugs.

LYDIA
Any particular kind?

DELIA
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!

Lydia walks off toward the house.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara is half-hiding on the edge of the window.

BARBARA
That little girl saw us.

ADAM
She couldn't have.  We can't make
them see us.

BARBARA
But she saw us.  I could feel it.

ADAM
(pause, thinking
that over)
That's all we need.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Lydia looks up the stairs at the attic landing.  She's
a little scared.  She decides to go up the dark stairs.

IN THE HALL

At the end of the hall stands Charles, directing men
who are carrying books into the room that will be his
study.

He continues on.


A BLAST of STEAM

fills the hallway, because workmen are already going at
the wallpaper.  Lydia emerges from it.  Looking up at
stairway to attic, mounting courage.


INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - DAY

Lydia creeps upward, taking the skeleton key from her
pocket.  FLOORBOARDS SQUEAK.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam works on his model.  He hears the SQUEAK, looks up
confidently.

ADAM
(whispering)
Don't worry.  I've locked it.

Barbara smiles and knits while rocking in her chair.


INT. ATTIC LANDING

Lydia quietly inserts the key in the lock of the attic
door.  She turns it.  The key is stiff.  She turns
harder.  It's stuck.  Lydia tries the door -- it's no
go.  She turns the key again.  This time it goes all
the way around.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara and Adam, surprised by the key, look at each
other, carefully, very quietly, stand up and tiptoe
toward door.


ON THE SCREEN OF AN OLD TV SET

in the corner of the attic -- Suddenly -- a ghostly
image POPS ON.


ON TV - A BIZARRE, SMALLISH FELLOW

outfitted in a too-big cowboy hat, bad wig, and over-
sized sunglasses appears on screen singing very
quickly.  (It's a heavily disguised BETELGEUSE.)


BEHIND HIM

the CAMERA QUICKLY PANS an assortment of tombstones a
la Cal Worthington.

BETELGEUSE
(singing)
Have the living got you down?
Betelgeuse!
Are they jacking you around?
Betelgeuse!
Have you broken out in hives
'Cause you're tired of their jive?
I will drive them from your
hive... Betelgeuse!


ANOTHER ANGLE

CAMERA TILTS DOWN a flashing tombstone with
""BETELGEUSE"" written on it.  Adam rushes over to shut
it off.  He can't find a plug.  He looks around behind
set... no workings inside at all.  He peers around to
the screen.  It is blank.  Suddenly -- Betelgeuse POPS
ON AGAIN.

BETELGEUSE
Say it once... Betelgeuse
Say it twice... Betelgeuse.
The third time's a charm...
Betelgeuse!
Come on down!

He POPS OFF.  Adam and Barbara stare at each other.


INT. LANDING - DAY

Lydia listens.  Did she hear something?  She puts her
hand on the knob and tries to turn it.  It's stuck.

Then the key eerily pops out of the lock and falls on
the floor.

Charles' head suddenly appears behind her.  Scares her.

CHARLES
What are you doing?


INT. ATTIC

Adam is holding on tight to the knob of the door.  With
her knitting needle, Barbara has poked the key out.

The two stand absolutely still, listening, terrified of
the living intruders.


INT. ATTIC LANDING - LYDIA AND CHARLES

LYDIA
I was just trying to open the
door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought
over a skeleton key.

CHARLES
Let me have it.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara and Adam tighten.


ON THE LANDING

LYDIA
But it doesn't work.

She hands her father the key.  He looks at it and
throws it in the corner.

CHARLES
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway,
this can wait.  We'll get a
crowbar later.  Where's your
mother?

LYDIA
(very quick de-
cisive delivery)
Stepmother.

CHARLES
I'm going down to relax.  I want a
noise-free zone.  Do you
understand?  Noise-free.

He goes down the stairs.

LYDIA
Dad?

He continues.

CHARLES
(irritated, over
his shoulder)
What?

LYDIA
I'm lonely.

A BLAST OF STEAM from below drowns out her words.
Charles stops and turns around.  The BLAST STOPS.

CHARLES
What?


TIGHT ON LYDIA

She is resolved.

LYDIA
Nothing.

Charles continues.  She begins to follow slowly.


ON KEY

behind Lydia.  WIDEN as Adam rushes out the door, grabs
the key and rushes back in again.  Lydia hears some-
thing but doesn't see.


INT. ATTIC

Barbara and Adam have moved away from the door.

ADAM
(looking through
the handbook)
We need some help.  I found
something this morning.  Here.
Emergencies.
(reads)
""In case of emergency, draw door.""

BARBARA
Draw door?  I don't know why we
keep looking in that stupid book.

Adam takes a piece of chalk and draws a little door on
the exposed brick of the chimney.

BARBARA
(continuing)
You don't actually think this
is going to work?

Adam draws a doorknob.  Then he tries to turn it.  The
door, perhaps to his surprise, fails to open.

BARBARA
Yet another triumph for Adam and
Barbara in the afterlife.  Why
don't we try this Beetle guy??...

ADAM
Wait.

He looks at book, then writes on the door:  KNOCK AND
ENTER.  He exchanges a glance with Barbara.  She's even
more skeptical than before.  Turns away in disgust.

Adam knocks on the door, and turns the knob.  Nothing.
She is more disgusted.  Adam goes back to the book.

ADAM
(continuing)
Aha!  Knock three times.


ANOTHER ANGLE

He knocks three times.  Turns knob.  The chalked door
swings magnificently open.

Behind is an eerie light source, SOARING MUSIC, maybe
even a heavenly choir singing pear-shaped syllables.

Barbara and Adam look at one another again.  They hold
hands and step tentatively through.

Their figures are lost in the blinding light.

They start to shut door after them.


ON THE ATTIC LANDING

Lydia is staring at the light pouring from under the
attic door.  It suddenly goes out.

ON LYDIA

She is dumbfounded.  She listens.


ON THE LANDING

Lydia speeds down the steps.


INT. CHARLES' STUDY - DAY

Charles, fiercely intent on relaxing, paces like a
catfish out of water.  Ralph Lauren in K-mart.  He
stretches.  He sits uneasily in an easy chair, tries
like hell to get comfortable.  Finally, he puts a book
under his bottom to get sitting straight.  Looks around
tapping his fingers.  What to do?  Looks at watch.

He takes down a book from Adam's library, it is an
Audubon book of birds.  He whips through it like it's
the comics and then looks around for more.

He finds the ""Illustrated Walden"" by Thoreau.  He
speed reads it.

He is now really bored.  Goes to the fireplace, tries
to light it.  Cannot do it.  Goes to desk and writes:

OTHO-INSTALL GAS FIRE LOGS IN
STUDY.

He studies bird posters.  Finds beautiful cardinal
picture.

Takes field glasses and looks out window.


HIS POV

Spies big ugly-looking ratty bird devouring something.


ON CHARLES

horrified.  Wrinkles his nose.

Lydia enters.  He jumps.

CHARLES
Jesus Christ!

Lydia is shocked.

CHARLES
(continuing)
Darling, can't you see I'm
relaxing in here!

LYDIA
Well I just wanted to tell you
what I saw.

CHARLES
Lydia.  What the hell is the point
of my moving up here if you people
won't let me relax?  Go help your
mother.

Charles returns to field glasses, spies something.  She
looks at him in frustration.

LYDIA
(on her way out)
Fine.  Maybe you can relax in a
haunted house.  But I can't.

She exits.  Charles peers after her, brow furrowed.
Looks out again at the village.  Uses his field glasses
to get a better look.


HIS POV

It is the Bozman Building.  Ernie is out front pol-
ishing the brass lion.


ON CHARLES

He thinks.  Moves the field glasses to punctuate his
discovery of the building.  (His eyes never leave field
glasses throughout the following.)

CHARLES
Nice building... Bad paint.  Good
lines... bad roof.  Good
parking... hmmm???

That really registers with him.  Without looking, he
dials a familiar number on the phone with one hand,
lifts the receiver.  He clacks his teeth together pur-
posefully.

SECRETARY'S VOICE
Botco International.

CHARLES
Yes, I'd like to speak with Maxie
Dean.

SECRETARY'S VOICE
He's not in right now.

CHARLES
Well tell him that Charles Deetz
called.

He hangs up and continues to spy on Bozman Building.
Clacks his teeth.

CHARLES
(continuing)
My God what I could do with that
parking.

DISSOLVE TO:


TIGHT SHOT - BARBARA AND ADAM

Very still, they look cautiously to the right and left
-- just with their eyes.  They're astounded by what
they see, though we don't yet see it.

ADAM
... Not what I expected when we
walked through that door.

BARBARA
No. But it's somewhere without big
worms.

CAMERA DRAWS BACK and we find that Adam and Barbara are
in:


INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

The most unpleasant waiting room that you ever remember
waiting in.  Fifties furniture with broken legs,
couches propped up on telephone books.

Standing ashtrays with dirty stand.  Linoleum floors
patched a hundred times.  National Geographics with the
covers torn off.  The ""Take a number"" registers in the
millions.


AS THE CAMERA COMPLETES A CIRCLE OF THE ROOM

We see a RECEPTIONIST.  She's the quintessential 50's
receptionist -- tight sweater, bullet-breasted bra,
bleached hair, red lipstick.  She's wearing a ribbon
across her breast reading ""MISS ARGENTINA"" and there
are knife slashes across both wrists.

RECEPTIONIST
You don't have an appointment, do
you?

ADAM
W... We didn't know how to make one.

BARBARA
An appointment for what?

RECEPTIONIST
What do you want?

BARBARA
We need some help.

RECEPTIONIST
Already?  You just bit the big one
nine months ago and you want help?

ADAM
Nine months?  What difference does
that make?

RECEPTIONIST
(shrugging)
Good luck.  You're going to use up
all your help vouchers.

ADAM
Help vouchers?

RECEPTIONIST
D-90's.  You spend a hundred
and twenty-five years on earth,
actually, in that house, during
which you get only three class-one
D-90 intercessions with Juno.  You
probably haven't even read through
the manual completely yet.

BARBARA
Why three?


TYPIST

Behind the Receptionist holds up both hands each of
which have only three fingers on them.

TYPIST
Rule Number Three.  Everything
comes in threes...

RECEPTIONIST
You'll have to wait if you don't
have an appointment.

BARBARA
How long do we have to wait?

ADAM
Wait for who?

RECEPTIONIST
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not
that it matters to your type.  But
there are all these other people
here ahead of you.  I'd say 3
hours.

The waiting room is now filled with people.  Dead
people, some in fairly awful states.  A cornucopia of
carnal shreddage.

Adam and Barbara look around for a moment, then very
quietly, they reach out to grasp hands.

RECEPTIONIST
(continuing)
Number 54 million, six hundred
one.  Ferndock.

CAMERA PUSHES IN CLOSE.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. ATTIC LANDING - DAY

Lydia kneels down with a screwdriver, a nail file, an
ice pick, and a credit card.  She inserts nail file
into the door.  She struggles, and after several
attempts -- finally uses the ice pick and POP!  The
door swings open ominously.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia enters.  The room is dim, and filled with dust
motes.  There are shadows in all the corners.

She bumps into a switch which engages the model sun and
moon and that eerily illuminates the model town.  She's
frightened, then entranced.

She peers at it from different angles, her fear for-
gotten.  She notes small tools scattered around an
unfinished area.  She continues around the model,
oblivious to everything else.  Then...

She kicks something.  Ducks under the table and comes
up with something, holds it up to the light.  It's the
handbook.  She looks through it.  Finds the marked
page... looks at the chalk door.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

Barbara and Adam are still holding hands, as if they
hadn't moved.  Like waiting for an IRS audit.

BARBARA
(to Adam)
Is this what happens when you die?

The Receptionist overhears.  She points at Barbara.

RECEPTIONIST
This is what happens when YOU die.
(points to another
corpse)
That is what happens when HE dies.
That is what happens when THEY
die.  It's highly personal.  And
I'll tell you something... if I
knew then what I know now... I
wouldn't have had my little
""accident!""

She holds up her wrists and smiling at her little joke,
wriggles them indicating her slashes.

OTHER CORPSES
(all together)
Amen!

Barbara and Adam look at them.  Corpses resume doing
what they were doing.  A GRINDING NOISE O.S. -- The
Receptionist looks up.

Barbara and Adam also look O.S.


THEIR POV

A Message delivery wire GRINDS along loudly on a
pulley.  The actual message is held in the hand of the
MESSENGER, a flattened corpse, suspended as if on a
shirt clothesline, tire marks on his face and clothing.
A major roadkill.  Dust and gravel ground into him.  He
smiles wanly at Barbara and Adam as the Receptionist
takes a message on a piece of paper and reads it.

RECEPTIONIST
Maitland, party of two!  Take your
handbook and go to the sixth door.

Barbara and Adam upset at the loss of their handbook...

BARBARA
We forgot our handbook.

CUT TO:


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia is studying the handbook with intense interest.

CHARLES (O.S.)
(from distant
downstairs)
Lydia, Delia needs your help!

Lydia gives one more look at the book, and then goes to
the door quickly and silently.

CHARLES (O.S.)
Right now, Delia says!


INT. OFFICE - DAY

RECEPTIONIST
(shaking her head
in disgust)
Out that way, through the typing
pool, down the corridor, sixth
door on your left.  Sixth door.
Two threes.
(shaking her head)
Airhead.

Adam and Barbara walk through a door.


INT. TYPING POOL - DAY

A vast room of desks arranged in a grid, straight
out of ""How To Succeed In Business""... Each desk is
occupied, too, but most of the secretaries are merely
skeletons, or mouldering corpses slumped over their
typewriters.

Only one secretary, somewhere in the vast grid, is
typing slowly, with long pauses between words.

The Messenger on his return trip, parallels Barbara and
Adam as they walk along.  Barbara can't look at him.

MESSENGER
How do I look?  There're no
mirrors on this side.

ADAM
(trying to be
pleasant)
Fine, you look fine.

MESSENGER
Thanks.  I've been feeling a
little flat.


ANOTHER ANGLE

He laughs at his own joke as he goes back through the
very, very narrow slot in the wall where the line
runs.  Adam and Barbara look to the right and left.
A vast stack of files slips off a desk and spills out
onto the floor.


INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Barbara and Adam enter corridor.

Empty, like a hotel corridor, but all the doors are of
different types -- a revolving door, a dutch door,
church doors.  They walk past a waist-high window,
covered by a roll-up shade.

BARBARA
A hundred twenty-five years!
I can't believe it.  I can't
believe they didn't tell us.

She bumps into the shade and it rolls up FLAPPING.  She
stares in through the window.  Adam peers in it too.


THEIR POV

A smouldering, mist-filled room.  From the smoky plasma
floats an occasional tortured soul.  Unspeakably SAD
MUSIC wafts from within.  They get only a glimpse of
the bodies in this horrible human soup.

BARBARA
Adam, look at this.

Suddenly, floating up from below, immediately on the
other side of the window, a white-crepe face emerges.
It seems to be that of a woman, her eyes are red and
blue tears rim them.  Her pale skin is covered with a
flaking crust of salt.  She wears the saddest look
ever.  Her mouth opens plaintively but no sound comes.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Oh, Adam... what is this?

A reflection joins them on their side of the window.


A SINISTER LITTLE JANITOR

wizened and efficient, pulls the shade down firmly.

SINISTER MAN
That's the lost souls room.
A room for ghosts who have been
exorcised.  Poor devils.  That's
death for the dead.  It's all in
the handbook.  Keep moving.

The man scuttles off.  Adam and Barbara walk on sadly,
until they come to a door that looks exactly like the
swinging door between the kitchen and dining room of
their house.

ADAM
This is it... the sixth door.

Puzzled -- Barbara pushes it.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Everything is dark, quiet -- but the furniture is
obviously not theirs, and neither is the decoration.
Adam and Barbara exchange glances, and push on through
into the living room.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Quiet, dark.  Everyone's asleep.

ADAM
My God, we're back home.

BARBARA
Look at this, everything is
different down here.  All our
furniture is gone.

ADAM
How long do you suppose we were
waiting?

JUNO
Three months.


ANOTHER ANGLE

A spot comes on, revealing JUNO -- their caseworker.
She's an older woman, no nonsense about her.  Over-
dressed in an outfit that includes a blouse with
ruffled cuffs.  We will at some point catch a glimpse
of her slashed throat -- she smokes heavily.  Occa-
sionaly smoke puffs from her cut throat.

JUNO
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was
about to leave.  I do have other
clients.

BARBARA
Are you Juno, our caseworker?

JUNO
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases
and determine if help is needed,
deserved, and available.

BARBARA
We need help.  We deserve help.

ADAM
Are you available?

JUNO
No.
(beat)
What's wrong?

BARBARA
We're very unhappy.

JUNO
What do you expect?  You're dead.

ADAM
We'd like some help in getting rid
of the people who moved in here.
Barbara and I worked very hard on
this house.

BARBARA
We probably wouldn't mind sharing
the house with people who were --

JUNO
-- like you used to be?

BARBARA
Yes.

ADAM
But these people --

He indicates a particularly bad piece of Delia's sculp-
ture.  Juno walks around it shaking her head.


INT. HOUSE

The following conversation takes place as Barbara and
Adam follow Juno as she looks around the house and ends
up in their attic space.

JUNO
Things seem pretty quiet here.
You should thank God you didn't
die in Italy.
(checking the file)
The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been
studying the manual?

ADAM
We tried.

JUNO
The Intermediate Interface chapter
on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em
out yourself.  It's your house.
Haunted houses don't come easy.

BARBARA
We don't quite get it.

Juno's watch BUZZES, she stops it.

JUNO
I heard.
(refers to her file)
Tore your face right off!  Bad
news.  It obviously doesn't do
any good to pull your heads off in
front of people if they can't see
you.

ADAM
We have to start simpler, is that
it?

JUNO
Start simply.  Do what you know.
Use your talents.  Practice.  We
only help those who help
themselves.  Just do a little at a
time.  And of course, practice,
practice, practice.  It's tricky
but -- you weren't murderers by
any chance, were you?

BARBARA
No.

JUNO
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an
easy time of it.  Just look at
Amityville.
(reminiscing)
He was one of my boys.  Didn't
have to give that one any lessons.
From day one... But I must be
off... I've got a plane load of
football players crashed in the
midwest... they need a lot of
help, just with the basics.

Points at her head indicating dumbness.

BARBARA
If... we have trouble.  What about
the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...

JUNO
(quickly interrupt-
ing her)
Don't say his name, you don't want
his help.

Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Puzzled.

ADAM & BARBARA
Well... We might...


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Juno peers into the model cemetery with interest.  A
FLY BUZZES around her.  Juno blows it away.  Fly flees.

JUNO
No you don't!  He does not work
well with others.

BARBARA
What do you mean?  What's he do?

A grave look comes over Juno's face as the light
changes to suggest someone telling a ghost story around
a campfire.

JUNO
I wasn't going to bring it up --
but rather than have you stumble
into it and make another mistake,
I'll tell you --
(she nervously puffs
her cigarette)
He was my assistant, but he was a
troublemaker...
He went out on his own as a free-
lance bio-exorcist -- claims to
get rid of the living... got into
more trouble -- you remember the
Chicago Fire...

Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Juno continues.

JUNO
(continuing)
He was demoted to a Grade-6
malevolent spirit.  He's been
imprisoned on that plane ever
since... in fact, I believe he's
been sleezing around your cemetery
lately.  He can only be brought
back by saying his name three
times.

Adam and Barbara attempt to interrupt --

JUNO
(continuing)
But I strongly suggest that you
remove the Deetz's yourself.

She takes a final drag on the cigarette and smoke
billows out the hole in her throat.  Juno starts to
FADE.

ADAM
And if we need you again, how do
we...?

Juno fades.  Gone.  Barbara goes to the model, looks
at the cemetery.

BARBARA
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh,
Adam.

ADAM
(holds her shoul-
ders, calms her)
Look, she's right.  We'll just
start simple, honey, be tougher.
I feel... confident.  C'mon.

They exit.


CAMERA FOLLOWS ACTION - OVER THE MODEL

The FLY BUZZES.  It lands and crawls along into the model of
the cemetery.


THE FLY

resplendently green and iridescent, pauses and fiddles
with its hairy parts.  Starts to walk by.

VOICE
Pssstt!  Over here!

Fly stops.  Tilts its multi-eyed head.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Two hands come up from the earth of that grave holding
a candy bar.

VOICE
I can't use this.  You should have
it.  Flies get so little respect
anymore.


THE FLATTERED FLY

walks over to the grave.  In a flash, the hands grab
the struggling fly and dance it like a doll over the
grave and then pull it into the earth.

FLY
Buzzz!
(turns into)
Help me!  Help me!

A MANIACAL LAUGH grows from the grave.  WIND BLOWS as
the Fly disappears.  Ivy whips away from the grave-
stone.  We see, for the first time, the chiseled name:

BETELGEUSE

CLAP OF THUNDER.


INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT

Charles is on the phone.  He has drawings laid out in
front of him.  He is at his most urban persuasive, and
oddly relaxed -- he is finally in his own element.

CHARLES
Maxie, have I not always made you
money?  I think that is the only
real question here.


INT. MAXIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

New York office, cool design, black couch, and MAXIE
DEAN, a 55-year-old, super tan, white-haired wheeler
dealer.  Sign says:  CHAIRMAN of BOTCO INDUSTRIES.
Maxie looks rich and he looks cool as he talks to
Charles.  Behind him, Sarah, his rich-looking blonde
wife, is looking at herself in a mirror.

MAXIE
Well, Charles -- no one has made me
money like you.  Until your nerves
went, you were a demon.  It is
just that... Winter River,
Connecticut is, you'll forgive me,
no fucking where.  Why would I
invest that kind of money to buy
an old building way the hell up
there?


INTERCUT CONVERSATION

CHARLES
Not a building!  That's the beauty
of it.  I think I can buy the
whole town.  These people don't
know the value of their property!

MAXIE
Then we own a whole town full of
nowhere.

CHARLES
No, No -- C'mon, Max, you know
me.  I've got plans.  You gotta
come up here and see, then I'll
tell you about it.

Maxie isn't much interested.

MAXIE
Well, sure, Charles, but I am busy
here... you know how it was when
you were active.

This burns Charles.  But he swallows it.  He hears
something in the corridor outside -- a kind of LOW
MOANING.

CHARLES
(into telephone)
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody.

MAXIE
No listen... we'll talk about
this visiting later, I gotta go,
I gotta meeting on the Japanese
joint venture.

CHARLES
(torn between the
MOANING and Maxie)
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese
could run it for us.  Listen,
think right about it, will you?
We've almost got the house ready,
you bring Sarah with you and I'll
show you.

MAXIE
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it.
Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up
there, ya hear?

Maxie hangs up.  Shakes his head.

MAXIE
(continuing)
Putz!  Inter River?  My ass.


INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT

Charles hangs up frustrated.  MOANING INCREASES.  He
goes to the door and flings it open.

A figure is right there in the doorway -- A ghost under
a sheet.  But a ""designer"" sheet.  He wails away like a
banshee.  Eyeholes cut in sheets, Charles jumps, re-
covers.

CHARLES
Oh, Jesus, Lydia!  Is Connecticut
so boring that you have to think
up shit like this?

ON Barbara, she stands back away from the door observ-
ing skeptically.

CHARLES
(continuing)
I had Maxie Dean on the phone!
Darling, Dad's found a way to make
some money here while I relax, so
scram!

He slams the door, turns around.  Then turns around
again, and jerks the door open.  The ghost is retreat-
ing, beaten.

CHARLES
(continuing)
And your mother is going to kill
you when she sees that you cut
holes in her $300 sheets.  You
provoke her you know.  I mean she
can be an unreasonable bitch.  But
you do provoke her.

He SLAMS the door again.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Adam helps Barbara on with her sheet.

BARBARA
God, this is so corny.  Have we
been reduced to this?  Sheets?

ADAM
Think of them as death shrouds.
And the moaning is important.
Really moan!
(imitating Juno)
Practice, practice, practice.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Television still going, Delia asleep with curlers.
Adam and Barbara glide inside, go over and stand beside
the bed.

ADAM
Deep breath... and...


INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - NIGHT

She has her ever-present camera around her neck.  Sud-
denly hears MOANS from her parents' room.  Thinking it
is sexual, she cringes.  Covers her ears.

LYDIA
Gross!  How can he stand that
woman?
(louder)
Hey, cut it out!  I'm a child!
For God sakes!

The NOISE gets weirder.  Lydia gets interested.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam and Barbara moan and groan.  Delia doesn't stir.

BARBARA
I feel really stupid.

ADAM
It's not stupid.  We're ghosts.
Do you want this woman for
breakfast for 125 years?  Moan
louder!

Barbara moans louder and more weirdly.

Delia stirs, sits up, but doesn't open her eyes.

Adam and Barbara are excited then... disappointed as
Delia fumbles on the bedside table for the remote con-
trol device, and without opening her eyes, turns off
the television set.  Then she turns over, and is lost
to the world totally.

Barbara sighs.  She and Adam walk toward the door.
When they open it however, Lydia is standing there in
her pajamas -- she snaps a FLASH Polaroid -- and Adam
and Barbara jump backwards with yelps of fright.

LYDIA
Sick!  Sexual perversion!  If
you're going to do weird sexual
stuff you ought to stay in your
bedroom, okay?

Lydia starts back into her room.  Then looks at the
developing photograph.  Something catches her eye.

Lydia yelps with fear.

LYDIA
Holy cow!  No feet!

She screams.  Adam and Barbara scream.  Lydia rushes
back toward them, starts flashing pictures.

Adam and Barbara run around and are pushed into a
corner.  Polaroids fly everywhere.

Lydia runs out of film.  She stares at them, panting
with fear.  A standoff.

LYDIA
(continuing)
A... Are you the guys who're
hiding out in the attic?

ADAM
(fake terror voice)
We're ghosts.

Barbara moans.

LYDIA
(skeptical, cautious)
W... What do you look like under
there?

Adam and Barbara pull shut bedroom door, go out into
the hall -- as if to keep from waking Delia with their
conversation.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

All three stare at each other tentatively.

ADAM
Aren't you scared?

LYDIA
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren.
Those are sheets.  Are you gross
under there?  Are you ""Night of
the Living Dead"" under there?
Like all bloody veins and pus?

ADAM
What?

LYDIA
""Night of the Living Dead?""  It's
a movie.

BARBARA
(pulling off
the sheet)
If I had seen a ghost at your age,
I would have been frightened out
of my wits.

LYDIA
You're not gross.  Why were you
wearing a sheet?

BARBARA
We're practicing.

ADAM
You can actually see us?  Without
the sheets?

LYDIA
Is this like a trick question?

BARBARA
Tell the truth.

LYDIA
(offended)
Of course I can see you.

ADAM
Nobody else can.

LYDIA
I'm wearing contacts... Also I
read through the ""Handbook for the
Recently Deceased.""  It says that
live people ignore the strange and
unusual... I, myself, am strange
and unusual.

BARBARA
(tenderly)
You look like a regular girl to me.

Lydia blushes.  Barbara smiles warmly.  She is begin-
ning to like Lydia.

ADAM
You read our book?  Could you
follow it?

Lydia nods her head.

LYDIA
Why are you creeping around
Delia's bedroom?

ADAM
We were trying to scare your
mother.

LYDIA
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive
about being related to reptiles.

Barbara smiles.

LYDIA
(continuing)
You can't scare her.  She's
sleeping with Prince Valium
tonight.
(defiantly)
I stole the key to your attic, you
know.

Adam and Barbara look at each other.

BARBARA
Maybe we better talk.


INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

Adam's rigged up the moon, and stars, too.  Adam and
Barbara and Lydia stand just beyond the fringes of the
town, dimly lighted giants.

LYDIA
You did this?  You carved all
these little figures and houses
and things?

ADAM
(pleased)
I certainly did.  I'd finish it
too, but... I don't get out much.

LYDIA
And this used to be your house, I
bet.  Why do you want to scare
everybody?

ADAM
We want to frighten you away.
(a little embarrassed)
So that you'll move out.

LYDIA
You don't know the Deetz's very
well, do you?  My father bought
this place.  He never walks away
from equity.  Why don't you leave?

BARBARA
We can't.  We haven't left the
house since the funeral.

LYDIA
Funeral.  God, you guys really are
dead!
(fascinated)
What was it like?  The funeral.
Did you cry?

ADAM
We weren't there.  The handbook
says funerals aren't for the dead.

LYDIA
God, if this is true this is
amazing!  I kinda like it up
here.  Can I visit you sometimes?

ADAM
Well, I don't know... We don't get
many visitors.

BARBARA
You know you're really a pretty
girl.

Lydia flushes.

CHARLES (O.S.)
Lydia!

LYDIA
I better go...

BARBARA
Wait... I don't think it would be
a very good idea if you told your
parents that we're up here.

ADAM
Unless you think it would scare
them off.

Lydia starts to exit.

ADAM
(continuing)
You tell them that we are
desperate horrible ghoulish
creatures who will stop at nothing
to get back our house.

LYDIA
(looks him up
and down)
Wait a minute, what if this is a
dream?  Can you do any tricks to
prove I'm not dreaming?

Barbara shakes her head, a little ashamed.

LYDIA
(continuing)
Well, if you are real ghosts, you
better get another routine, those
sheets suck!

She sneaks a smile at Barbara and exits.


EXT. HOUSE - DAY

A big ugly machine is doing something unnecessary to
the yard.


INT. DARKROOM/BASEMENT - DAY

The FAST-TICKING CLOCK is a timer.  Lydia is making
Polaroid enlargements.  She's quick and expert at this.
She's examining a print with a magnifying glass.


INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY

Delia shrieks.  Going through the dirty clothes, she's
just come across the sheets with the eye holes in them.

DELIA
Lydia!  Lydia!  My hands are
shredded from doing the laundry,
and now I have to deal with your
vandalism!


INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Lydia, pounding up from the basement with the wet
print, collides with Delia, rushing down from the sec-
ond floor with the scissored sheets.

DELIA
Lydia, honest to God I'm going to
kill you.  I'm having a party
tonight.  I'm cooking, I can't get
servants.  Do I need angst?  No, I
certainly do not!

Lydia speeds by her.

DELIA
(continuing)
You owe me three-hundred bucks,
Lydia!  Don't go running to your
father, you worm.


INT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY

Lydia rushes in.  Charles is working furiously on a
word processor, amidst an array of maps and plans.

LYDIA
Dad.  Do you believe me?

CHARLES
Yes.  Except when you creep around
in your mother's --

LYDIA
Stepmother's...

CHARLES
... sheets.

LYDIA
Well this is... I mean, this is
the weirdest --

CHARLES
Lydia, I don't know what it is
with you and these pratical
jokes, but --

LYDIA
This is not a joke!  That sheet
was full of ghosts.

She hands him the photo.  He looks.  Lydia points
out...

LYDIA
(continuing)
No feet.

Charles laughs.

LYDIA
(continuing)
You don't believe me.  That sheet
was full of ghosts.  They live
here.

Charles begins to scroll through computer program.

CHARLES
(dismissing it)
Very clever, Lydia.  Now would you
please -- I'll tell you what... I
know!  You're bored, right?  You
take that camera and your bike
and photograph every building in
town.  Don't tell anyone what it's
for...
(handing her a
wad of bills)
Here, take some cash and go do
it.  How's that?  You want to
stretch, don't you?

Lydia exits, with determination.  Charles looks up on
the wall and runs his finger over a plat map of Winter
River, just like Adam's in the attic.

CHARLES
(continuing)
Look at the size of these lots...

Adam peers at the map, puzzled.

ADAM
What is this guy doing?

Barbara follows Lydia out.  Adam thinks, intrigued.
Exits.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Delia is frantically preparing for the evening's dinner
party.  Lydia is very much in her way, trying to show
her the photographs.  Delia isn't looking at them.

DELIA
I can't believe you are doing this
to me!  Ghosts.  I am giving a
dinner party for seven people
tonight.  Otho has agreed to come
back for the demolition of the
attic.  My agent, Bernard, is
bringing some woman who writes for
""Art in America.""  In fact, no one
here tonight has not been in
""Vanity Fair.""  Except you.

LYDIA
(resigned)
I told them you were too mean to
be afraid.

DELIA
Don't you dare talk to others
about me.  I'm an artist!  The
only thing that scares me is being
embarrassed in front of my
friends.  Do you know how hard it
is to get civilized people to set
foot in this part of Connecticut?
Not a solitary word of this
pubescent tripe to anyone.

Lydia exits angrily.

CAMERA HINGES.  Barbara is watching, horrified at
Delia's occupation of her (Barbara's) kitchen.  Adam
appears.

BARBARA
Lydia's trying, but they don't
believe her.

ADAM
She's got photos, Barbara.

BARBARA
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!

ADAM
This is different.  Eventually
she'll take someone to the attic.
And then what?  We've got to try
to contact this guy Betelmyer.  We
gotta get some help, hon.


INT. ATTIC ROOM - LATER - DAY

Adam looks intently through the book.

Barbara's eye is caught by something in the model
cemetery.  She moves over and sees a small gravestone
lit up by neon.

BARBARA
Adam!

Adam comes over.  Looks.

ADAM
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.

BARBARA
It's him.  Look... Betelgeuse...
Betelgeuse...

She looks at Adam, ""should I?"" Adam chews his lip
thoughtfully.

ADAM
Go ahead... third time's a charm.

BARBARA
(after a deep breath)
Betelgeuse!

ZAP!  They are transported into the model graveyard.


EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

WIND BLOWS --  With shovels and lanterns, Adam and
Barbara are unlikely gravediggers.  The mechanized
clouds move in the sky across the mechanical moon,
throwing weird shadows everywhere.  Ground fog creeps
slowly along the graves.  It is so eerie.

BARBARA
What happened?

ADAM
Three times.  Powerful number.

BARBARA
(standing in front
of grave)
Bet... el... geuse.  What an
awful name.  I thought it was like
-- you know.  The juice of
beetles.

Adam cringes too.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Where is he?  What do we do?

Adam looks down at the grave.  Knocks on the stone.
Nothing.

ADAM
Has anything been simple so far?
From the look of the shovel, we
dig.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.
My nails keep getting longer.
I'll break them.

Hands her a shovel anyway.  She digs.


EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - LATER - NIGHT

They're almost down six feet.  By now they are both
almost out of sight in the grave.  Inside the grave --
Adam suddenly hits wood.

BARBARA
It's about time.

They lean down and brush dirt off a brass plate on the
coffin.

""BETELGEUSE""

ADAM
I guess we open it.

BARBARA
Maybe we should knock first?

A slight TREMOR shakes them.  They look at each other
and try to scramble from the grave.


TOPSIDE

They just barely crawl out when a mouldering corpse
springs out of the grave and jumps on Barbara's back,
and plants a thousand-year-old kiss on her lips.  She
screams and burbles.  Adam pulls the corpse off her
back.  The corpse does a Three Stooges hammer on Adam's
head.

Adam staggers backward, unhurt but shocked.  All three
stop.


ON THE CORPSE

Something unreal about him, almost mechanical.  Then
the corpse, grinning insanely at them, flies straight
up into the air over their heads.  He CRASHES against
the tombstone...

And Adam and Barbara see the corpse is only a huge
marionette on a string and pole.  A LAUGH comes from
behind the gravestone.


PUPPETEER BETELGEUSE

steps out.  He looks like someone who just crawled out
from under a rock.  This is one slippery customer.
Betelgeuse speaks in a rapid polyglot, choosing words
and phrases from every slang in the world.  Barbara is
mighty uneasy.

BETELGEUSE
All right.  Who are you?

BARBARA
We're...

BETELGEUSE
You're the dead.

ADAM
Aren't you dead?

BETELGEUSE
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a
businessman.  I'm the man what
am.  Beeetel Jooose!  Who
do I gotta kill?

ADAM
You don't kill anyone.

BARBARA
Just get some people out of our
house.

BETELGEUSE
Bio busting.  I love it.  Who do
I gotta kill?  Family -- right?
Obnoxious, I bet.
(contorting face)
Mommie, daddy, piglets.

BARBARA
Just one daughter.

BETELGEUSE
Hey you've been on Saturn!
(brushing yellow dust
off her)
I hate those Sandworms!  Yecchhh!
I've lost a lot of buddies to
Sandworms.
(back to work)
So a daughter?  She got good legs?
God I love a young leg.

Air blows up Barbara's dress, exposing her legs.  He
leers.

BARBARA
She's only fourteen...

ADAM
... acts like she's thirty-five.

BETELGEUSE
(rubbing hands)
How does she feel about short old
men with dirty ears?

Barbara is grossed out and increasingly uneasy.  Beetle
Juice senses it and gets back to business.

BETELGEUSE
So you, the dead, want me, the
undead, to throw the live guys --
Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who
might not mind a tumble with an
older guy, out into the cold?
Even though they have paid hard
casharoonie for your dump?

ADAM
But... the Deetzes are destroying
our house.

BETELGEUSE
(scolding sarcasm)
You Maitlands are the backbone of
the afterlife.  So what's my cut?

ADAM
Can you scare them off?

Beetle Juice looks offended.

BETELGEUSE
Me, scary?  You be the judge.


ANGLE

He swirls his face and shoulders into a horrifying
image.  Pleased, he laughs at himself.

BARBARA
(decisively)
Honey.  Let's go.

ADAM
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need
help.

BARBARA
No, we don't.  We can work
something out ourselves.  We just
have to try harder.

BETELGEUSE
Hold on.  Let's not be squeamish,
missy.  You rang my bell, you
gotta lick the pump.  I'm rolling!


BARBARA

grabs Adam.  Betelgeuse is getting mad.  Not pretty.

BETELGEUSE
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at
your service.  You be the judge.
I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.

BARBARA
Home.  Home.  Home!


ZAP

They are gone.  Betelgeuse is furious.

BETELGEUSE
You fresh corpse creeps!  Who do
you think you are?... Walking
away from a professional?


BETELGEUSE

walks to a tree and kicks it hard.  The whole huge tree
falls, KABLOOM!


INT. ATTIC - DAY

A small tree falls in the model.  Adam, across the
room, walks over and straightens it.

He looks at Barbara who is poring over the handbook.
Making notes.  Counting out procedures.

ADAM
Honey, I think that was a mistake.

BARBARA
I am not going to expose that
little girl to that... pervert
down there.

ADAM
How'd you do that?

BARBARA
(proud of herself)
Just a hunch... remember things
come in threes -- three times in,
three times out... I'm getting the
hang of this stuff.

ADAM
I think we really pissed him off.

BARBARA
I don't care...

ADAM
But we let him out.

BARBARA
I've changed my mind... I feel
really confident.  We're getting
better at this stuff.  We can
scare them off ourselves --
tonight!  I've got an idea.
You're going to love it... I'm
going to hate it.


ADAM

turns to look down at the model again.  Straightens the
tree.  Turns away.  We can see a tiny light moving
through the tiny model forest towards the house.

ADAM (V.O.)
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure
seemed mad.

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
(singing)
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I
go!


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Dinner for seven, as promised.  Everything looks very
nice.  Deetzes are in control and in their element.
The element is neurotic-chic.

Some of the guests are affecting distaste for having
had to make the long drive to Connecticut.  There's a
bitchy feud going on between GRACE, the ""Art In Amer-
ica"" writer, and BERNARD, Delia's agent, that threatens
to become a full-scale war.

Otho is drunkish and engaged in his third favorite
occupation -- direct attacks on the personal weaknesses
of his friends.  He's singled out his victim, BERYL,
the editor for Ballantine, a frail-looking woman who is
dressed ""artistically.""

OTHO
(to Beryl)
Well, darling, you can only have a
hysterectomy once, so why don't you
tell us what you really went into
the hospital for last week?  Or dare
I ask, is that a nose ""nouveau?""

CHARLES
(privately; to
Otho)
Otho, you've got to help me get
Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal
that could make all of us very
comfortable.

OTHO
He's a cloven-hooved beast!

CHARLES
He's your cousin.

OTHO
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look,
nothing short of giving away free
sacks of money would get him up
here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget
it.  You can't get her out of
Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
(still on Beryl's
case)
I just hope it wasn't yet another of
your dreary suicide attempts.  You
know what they say about people who
who commit suicide.  In the afterlife,
they become civil servants.

BERNARD
Otho!  I didn't know you were into
the supernatural?

OTHO
Of course you remember!  After my
stint with the living theatre.  I
was one of New York City's leading
paranormal researchers until the
bottom dropped out of the business
in '72.

BERYL
(sick to death of
this blowhard)
Paranormal... Is that what they're
calling your kind now?

Lydia watches Otho thoughtfully.  Suddenly very cur-
ious.

Delia senses that Lydia might talk ghosts here.

DELIA
(a threat; quietly
to Lydia)
Don't you dare.

LYDIA
I saw some ghosts.

All quiet.

DELIA
(interrupting)
Lydia tried to play a most
amusing joke on me this afternoon.

LYDIA
It wasn't a joke.

DELIA
Tried to convince me that this
house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids.
Kids!  I love them.

Otho's glance sharpens at this.  Everyone else listens.

GRACE
By ghosts?

LYDIA
By what else?

DELIA
(laughing it away)
In sheets yet.  Designer sheets.
They --

Charles, seeing things aren't going well for Delia,
proposes a toast.

CHARLES
I propose a toast to our intrepid
friends.  Who braved the
expressway and fourteen toll
booths to visit us.  May your
buildings go condo.

All lift their wineglasses.  All drink.  All synchro-
nously spit out their wine.  All together now...

EVERYONE
Yechhh!

Charles lifts the wine bottle from the cooler.  Disgust
spans the room.

ON bottle -- it bears the familiar spread wings of
Thunderbird!

BERYL
Thunderbird wine?  My God, Delia,
don't you even have a Safeway up
here?

DELIA
(horrified; but
recovering)
Joke Joke!  Charles get the good
wine and I'll serve the shrimp.
It's a joke.

Delia stares a spike through Lydia.  Delia and Charles
rush into the kitchen.  Otho looks at his glass and
peers at Lydia.


INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Delia rushes to get the sushi.  Charles finds some
good wine.

DELIA
(rapidly; furious)
Lydia switched wines.  Charles --
if you do not agree right now, to
boarding school, you can forget
having what you call sex -- ever
again in your natural lifetime.

He nods reluctantly.  She rushes back to guests.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia is looking around curiously.  Delia and Charles
rush back in with sushi and good wine.  Delia pours for
Bernard, the obvious connoisseur.  He tastes the wine.
All wait.  Is it Kerosene du Pape?  He smiles.  All
smile.

Otho is more interested in Lydia's story.  He leans
toward her...

OTHO
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your
ghosts.

DELIA
No!  Do not encourage this
little... person.

OTHO
Oh, Delia, lighten up!

DELIA
She's been without therapy up here
and I will not allow her to
ruin...

But then:


DELIA

Something comes over her -- she straightens, then
crouches a little, her hand sweeps across in front of
her, almost mechanically.  And then our Delia Deetz,
unable to help herself, leaves the whitebread world
behind and possessed, sings in someone else's voice, a
rich, NEGRO TENOR.

DELIA
""If I didn't care, More than
words could say.""

Lydia's eyes widen.  MUSIC UP.  All the guests are
spellbound.

Charles, too, has the beat -- The Ink Spots in his eyes.
In a voice not his own.

CHARLES
""If my every prayer, did not
begin and end with just your
name.""

Delia is shocked.  She looks at Lydia.

DELIA
For God's sake, stop me...

She is cut short by her powerful inspiration.

DELIA
""I could not be true to you
beyond compare.""


ALL THE GUESTS

except Lydia, are possessed to become the chorus.  They
stand by their chairs, they spin in perfect Motown
choreography.

EVERYONE
(except Lydia)
""Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop.""

DELIA
""If I didn't care... for you...""

EVERYONE
""Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop.""

A look of sheer delight comes across Lydia's face,
unlike anything we have previously seen.  She dances
and claps her hands in time with the music.  She is in
teen heaven.

NOTE:  Delia and the guests are fully aware of their
singing/actions, but helpless to stop themselves.  While
it is funny, it is nevertheless just a little frighten-
ing.

Lydia excitedly looks around the room to see if she can
see the ghosts.  She can't.

Now the song pauses... Everyone tries to recover for a
shocked second.  Instead, the tempo changes.

As the tempo quickens, the guest/chorus is syncopated
like alternating pistons as they are pushed and pulled
into their chairs.  They sing throughout.


THE SONG

crashes to its end.  Bernard looks down at his shrimp
cocktail.  The shrimp draped over the rice roll
suddenly rears up like a hand and, making a tiny fist,
grabs his dangling tie and... smash --

WIDER -- All the guests are punched by the shrimp, back
over their chairs to the ground.  They are stunned.
Suddenly everyone runs frightened into the next room.


EXT./INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

Adam and Barbara with huge smiles on their faces, dance
the bugaloo then hug and kiss on the landing in front
of the attic.  Door is open.

TOGETHER
We did it!

ADAM
Let's watch 'em scatter.

They enter the attic and run to the window.  Look out
over the front yard.


YARD OF HOUSE - THEIR POV - NIGHT

filled with the cars of the guests, as well as Delia
and Charles' vehicles.

ADAM (O.S.)
Any minute now.  They'll all run
screaming.


BACK TO SCENE

They wait.  Nothing moving outside.

BARBARA
Your Ink Spots were wonderful!

Adam smiles proudly.

ADAM
And your shrimp was remarkable.

BARBARA
My shrimp?  I did the wine.
Didn't you do the sushi?

ADAM
N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Who did the?

Timid KNOCK at the door of the attic.

Barbara glances at Adam.  They don't know what to do.

LYDIA
(from outside the
door)
It's me.  Lydia.

Adam, puzzled, goes to the door and opens it.  Lydia is
standing there, sheepish.

LYDIA
(continuing)
They'd like for you to come
downstairs.  Delia says you can
pick any sheets you want.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The guests are sitting expectantly.  The photographs
are being passed around.  The wheels are turning in
Charles' mind --  he sees a gold mine.  Everyone speaks
at once.

DELIA
It does indicate a marvelously
urbane sense of humor on the part
of these ghosts -- that they
actually appear in sheets!

OTHO
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn
here, a very sophisticated pair.  We
must protect them, treat them with
respect.  Nurture them.

CHARLES
People will pay big money for
this.  Right, Grace?

GRACE
(nodding)
Charles, I want to know why you
didn't tell me about this --

DELIA
(now changing her
tune)
We were waiting for proof.
Lydia's photographs...

Charles is scheming.

BERNARD
(skeptical)
What are you all talking about?
We... we just got a little drunk,
that's all.

OTHO
No matter how drunk you get, you
cannot sound like the Ink Spots.
(to Charles)
Charles, this is it!  You can get
Maxie Dean up here now.

Charles plots and plans.

OTHO
His wife Sarah loves the
supernatural.  I did a reading for
her just last week.  Told her her
jowls would tighten soon.  I mean
she will make him sprint up here in
his helicopter if you can produce
ghosts for her.

BERYL
The ""Enquirer"" has offered fifty
thousand dollars for absolute
proof of life after death.  I'll
send them over.

BERNARD
I'm Delia's agent!  I've lost
money for years on her work.  If
anything actually happened here,
I'll handle it, thank you.  But
not until I see some real proof.

Lydia appears at the base of the stairs.  Everyone
stops squabbling, looks at her expectantly.

LYDIA
They don't want to come down.

OTHO
Why not?

Bernard shakes his head as if all this were an elaborate
hoax.  He harumphs!

LYDIA
I think the reason is they were
trying to scare you, and you
didn't get scared --

DELIA
Of course we weren't scared.
(looking around)
Just a little startled.  One of
those shrimp dropped down my
Kamali.

Bernard is now convinced this whole business was a put-
on.

BERNARD
(shaking his head)
Total collective hallucination.

BERYL
I was a little tipsie.

DELIA
This was not a hallucination,
people.  This was real, really
totally real.

GRACE
Of course, they were rather
spectacular effects -- for
Connecticut, I mean.

OTHO
All presences have a home space.  A
place where they live, so to speak.
Where do they hide out?

LYDIA
(reluctantly)
The attic.

CHARLES
The attic room is locked --

LYDIA
They're ghosts.  They do what they
want.

OTHO
Fabulous!  Otho Fenlock's ""Locked
Door"" ghosts!  Probably committed
suicide up there -- hanging like
beeves from the rafters.  I'm
totally enchanted.

Bernard gathers Grace and Beryl and walks out the door.

BERNARD
Delia, you are a flake.  You have
always been a flake.  I'm packing
up and going back to the tricks of
the city.  That I can manage.  If
you must frighten people, do it
with your sculpture.

They exit.  Delia is horrified and embarrassed.

DELIA
Wait!  I'm going to get to the
bottom of this!  Lydia, is this
some high-tech trick of yours?  I
want you to take us up there tout
sweet!


INT. LANDING OUTSIDE OF ATTIC

Delia, Charles, Otho and Lydia -- creep, creep.

DELIA
(whispering)
Shhh.  They're in there?  God,
they live like animals.  This is
where they've been hiding out?

Lydia nods.  Delia suddenly, brashly pounds on the
door.

DELIA
(shouting)
All right, you dead people!  Come
on out, or we'll break down this
door and drag you out on the ropes
you hanged yourself with!

LYDIA
Shhhh.  They didn't commit
suicide.

DELIA
It doesn't matter.
What matters is I've got a roomful
of guests down there, who think
I'm a fraud.
(to Lydia)
I am going to teach you something
here Lydia.  You've got to take
the right tone in things like
this, or people -- whether they're
dead or alive -- people will walk
all over you.
(loud)
Come on out, or I will make death
so miserable that you will wish
you had never lived!

Delia pounds on door, which opens with an eerie CREAK.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia is pushed in first.  She looks around.  Delia,
Charles and Otho come in next, carefully.  One by one
they straighten up and look around.

DELIA
(whisper)
So where are they, Lydia?

Lydia shrugs, looks around.

CHARLES
(off-handedly)
Answer your mother.

LYDIA
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts
are really nice people.  I think
we scared them off.  Let's just
leave them alone.  Okay?

Charles is suddenly transfixed.  He stares at the
model.

CHARLES
It's the whole damn town.

They gather around.  Lydia is a little sad as she looks
at the empty room and the model.

OTHO
Look at that detail!

DELIA
Look at the tiny figures.

CHARLES
Look at all that parking!

LYDIA
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.

OTHO
They're not here, Lydia?

She shakes her head.  Otho spots the handbook.  Palms
it.

DELIA
I have never been so
embarrassed... They haven't gone
for good, have they?

Delia is suddenly out the door, urging them all outside.

DELIA
(continuing)
Everyone out of there.  If they're
in there somewhere, I don't want
to scare them away.  Come on now,
stay out of there.  We've got work
to do.

Otho pockets the handbook secretly as everyone exits.
Delia carefully closes the door.


CAMERA EASES OVER TO THE WINDOW

We see two pairs of hands, white-knuckled, gripping the
window sill from the outside.


EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Barbara and Adam are hanging outside the window.
CAMERA EASES BACK to see that instead of hanging from
the house --

They are hanging from a ledge over The Inferno --


ON INFERNO

circles of rosy hell.  Several devilish Monsters slaver
up at them, hoping for new meat for the furnace.  Small
geysers spurt foul gasses.


WINDS

BLOW hard on Adam and Barbara.  They struggle to hold
on and pull themselves back up and into the window.

ADAM
Juno, help!  Juno!

After nearly falling, Adam barely saves Barbara and
they finally make it up, and disappear into the window.


INT. ATTIC LANDING - NIGHT

Delia, Charles and Otho all start down the stairs, one
by one.  All are holding the handrail.

DELIA
Lydia, I will never forgive you
for embarrassing me in front of my
social inferiors.  You help us
with these ghosts or you'll be
sorry.

LYDIA
I'm sorry already.

CHARLES
(fixing on Otho)
Now, let's get back to business.  I
I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah
up here immediately.  I can make
history here!  I'm going to turn
this sleepy little backward town
into a leading supernatural
research center... and amusement
park.

LYDIA
(disgusted)
I cannot believe this.

CHARLES
Delia will cook...

Delia glares at him.

CHARLES
(continuing)
I'll bring the wine... and the
business plan.  And Lydia --
you'll bring the ghosts.

LYDIA
(frustrated)
I can't bring the ghosts.  They're
not here!

CHARLES
... Otho, could you actually... do
something with them?

OTHO
(pats the handbook
under his coat)
Perhaps... if I were properly
motivated...

LYDIA
That's slavery and murder.  You
don't know them.  They're nice
people!

POV -- down the handrail, as they walk downstairs.
Lydia lags behind, sullen.


LOWER END OF THE HANDRAIL

lifts, and turns.  The handrail has become a long, fat,
diamond-backed snake -- unlike any we have ever seen.
It flashes terrifying steel teeth and a red-feathered
comb.  It turns and HISSES at them.


ON DELIA

She screams as she looks down at her hand on the rail
-- it grips the scaly, throbbing, dripping body of the
snake.


THE SNAKE

just gets longer and nastier as it turns back in the
air, up the stairs toward them.  Its tail circles Delia
and spins her like a top.  When she stops -- the snake
gives her a big wet snake kiss.


SNAKE

snaps Otho in the behind.  It hurts.


THE SNAKE

rears up and spreads a red-comb and HISSES loudly.


ALL THREE

of them fall over each other trying to escape.


THE SNAKE

hovers horribly over them.  Grabs Charles in its coils
and squeezes him hard -- his fearful face reddens, then
it suspends Charles over the edge of the stairs.

SNAKE
We've come for your daughter,
Chuck!


HE

leers at Lydia and drops Charles like a rock over the
bannister.  Charles screams.


THE SNAKE

Grins at a terrified Lydia.


SNAKE

rears back for a strike, when suddenly, like thunder.
One word is heard.

BARBARA
Betelgeuse!  Betelgeuse!
Betelgeuse!


THE SNAKE

looks up with familiar eyes.  At top of stairs stands
an angry Barbara.

What happens next is almost too fast for the eye to
see.


THE SNAKE

shrinks and turns back into the regular mahogany hand-
rail.


BETELGEUSE

or his outline, whips up the stairs, through the door,
and is gone like a rocket.

BETELGEUSE
RRRatt shit!


OTHO AND DELIA

rush downstairs -- Lydia is terrified.  She runs away.

LYDIA
I hate you!  I thought you were my
friends.

BARBARA
No, wait!

Lydia screams and runs down the stairs.

LYDIA
(screams)
I hate all of you!

Slowly, Barbara returns to the attic.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Adam and Barbara are exhausted.  Agitated.

ADAM
Great choice we've got here.  We
get to spend the next century
either hanging out that window or
doing parlor tricks.

Adam is working with the model town.  Barbara is pac-
ing.

ADAM
Maybe they'll leave now.  That
snake was a pretty nasty customer.

BARBARA
He might have hurt somebody.

ADAM
But he didn't.  We've got him
where we want him.


ON THE MODEL

A column of water shoots high in the air.

Adam rushes over to the model -- looks down.


INT. MODEL - DAY

Betelgeuse has run a beat-up old pickup into a fire
hydrant.  He stands nearby, hopping mad; shakes his
fist at Adam.

BETELGEUSE
You pansy-assed cretins!  How dare
you do that to me.  I coulda
finished the job!


IN THE ATTIC

Barbara and Adam, obviously disturbed, look at one
another with concern.

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
(thin and pip-
ing voice)
Why did you stop me?

BARBARA
I don't like Charles Deetz
particularly, but you could have
killed him.

BETELGEUSE
Hey, I've been bottled up for six
hundred years.  Every dog has his
day.  This is my town.  I need a
night to howl.

ADAM
This is my town.

BETELGEUSE
You wish!  I nearly scored with
that little blonde.  I need me a
short little queen.


ANGLE

Angry, Barbara reaches down into the model and plucks
Betelgeuse up.

Barbara lifts him up toward her, squeezing him
slightly.

BARBARA
You leave her alone, you horrid
little prick!


CLOSEUP - BETELGEUSE IN BARBARA'S HAND

Betelgeuse grins.  Suddenly large spikes shoot out all
over his body, piercing the skin of Barbara's palm and
fingers.  Barbara's blood is a rich pink.

She squeals and releases the evil spirit and he plum-
mets.


EXT. MODEL - DAY

Betelgeuse lands on the town common.  Betelgeuse is
defiant.

BETELGEUSE
Go ahead.  Make my millenium!


ANGLE

We hear the tinny strains of ""Honky Tonk Angel"" as if
from down the street.  He turns around to follow it.

BETELGEUSE
This burg got a cathouse?  I'm
getting anxious if you know what I
mean.  Six hundred years and all.

He turns the corner to a whorehouse, with women --
women with demon horns -- hanging out of the window,
beckoning.  Betelgeuse rubs his hands together and
swaggers inside.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara aghast, watching this from above.

BARBARA
Adam!  Why did you build a whore
house?  Have you ever been to...?

ADAM
I didn't --


ANGLE

He doesn't finish -- a strong WIND blows through the
attic, nearly knocking Barbara and Adam over.  They
close their eyes against the gale.

When they open their eyes again, they're no longer in
the attic.  They're in --


INT. JUNO'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

A cubicle in a much larger office.  Miss Argentina
swishes by.

RECEPTIONIST
God, you have got her steaming
now.

She exits.  There are other special workers.  The place
is really, really busy.  Adam and Barbara sit down to
wait.  Juno storms through with a sheaf of papers.  She
sees them.  She is steaming mad.

JUNO
The whorehouse was my idea.  I
want Betelgeuse out of the
picture!  We've got some serious
talking to do.

BARBARA
About what?

JUNO
You people have really screwed
up!  I received word that you
allowed yourselves to be
photographed.  And you let
Betelgeuse out and didn't put him
back, and you let Otho get ahold
of the handbook.

ADAM
Handbook?  When...?

JUNO
(continuing tirade)
Never trust the living!  We cannot
have a routine haunting like yours
provide incontrovertible visual
proof of existence beyond death.

ADAM
Well, we didn't know --


A BUNCH OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS

follow Juno like hungry dogs.

DUMB #1
Hey, Coach, where's the men's
room?

JUNO
(frustrated)
I'm not your coach.  He survived.

DUMB #2
You don't need a men's room.
You're not no man no more.  But
Coach, let me get this -- What's
our curfew over here?

They start squabbling.  Juno has to wrangle them into
another room.

JUNO
(frustrated)
I'll be right back.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Charles sits at the table with a small bandage on his
head.  Delia takes off her Gucci belt and whips it on a
chair absent-mindedly.

DELIA
I feel like we've been at war,
Charles.

CHARLES
At least insofar as we have our
first casualty.  Me.

DELIA
Otho'll know what to do.

CHARLES
What's he going to do?  Viciously
rearrange their environment?

DELIA
Otho knows just as much about the
supernatural as he knows about
interior design.

CHARLES
Let's hope he knows how to produce
those damn ghosts for Max and
Sarah... Because I've bought
options on property all over town.
I need Max's financing...

DELIA
Just don't tell Lydia.

CHARLES
Why not?

DELIA
I think she's in with them.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. LYDIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

It's dark.  The bedroom curtains have been closed.
DRAMATIC OPERA MUSIC builds throughout.

Lydia melodramatically dressed in a long black dress
appears carrying a candle.  She is softly crying.

She sits at her dressing table, the candlelight shows
her writing paper.  She begins a very dramatic letter.

LYDIA
I am alone.

She looks at it and crumpling the paper, starts again.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I am utterly... alone.  You have
sealed my fate with your betrayal.
I can no longer stand to be used
like a puppet between two
deceitful worlds.  By the time you
read this, I will be gone, having
jumped off...

She scratches that out.

LYDIA
(continuing)
... having plummeted off the
Winter River Bridge.  Then you
will know that I am no longer a
toy in your petty feuds.  Goodbye,
Lydia.

A tear falls on the paper as she folds it and puts it
in an envelope.  OPERA MUSIC BUILDS AND CONTINUES.


INT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY

Lydia slowly makes a copy of the suicide note.  The
green of the Xerox light falls eerily on her sad face.


INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Lydia at bottom of attic stairs.


LYDIA'S POV - STAIRS AND DOOR AT TOP

They look ominous.  She starts upward.


INT. ATTIC ROOM - DAY

The door opens and Lydia peers in.

The room is empty.  Lydia comes inside.

LYDIA
Are you here?

She hears SOMETHING.  Looks all around the room.
Nothing.

LYDIA
(continuing)
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come
for the last time?
(laying note on
table)
Where are you?  Barb...

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
They're dead.

Lydia looks around, then peers into model.

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
(continuing)
Think small.  I'm talking to you.


EXT. MODEL TOWN - BUILDING ROOF - DAY

A tiny Betelgeuse on the roof of a building, wearing a
silk dressing gown, looking like he just dragged him-
self out of bed.  One of the horned whores is nude,
sunbathing in the corner, and Betelgeuse drapes a
blanket over her.  Lydia's face looms enormous in the
sky.

BETELGEUSE
Cookie, they are dead, dead,
deadski.

LYDIA
Of course they're dead.  They're
ghosts.

BETELGEUSE
No, I mean they've gone.
Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.

LYDIA
Where'd they go?

BETELGEUSE
The happy hunting ground.  Who
cares?

LYDIA
Are you a spirit too?

BETELGEUSE
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh.
Listen, cookie, I've been trapped
in this burg for hundreds of
years.  All I want is to get out.

LYDIA
I want to get in.

BETELGEUSE
You do?  Over here?  On my side?

LYDIA
I think so.

BETELGEUSE
(scheming quickly)
Well, yes, of course.  It's great
over here.  You'll meet all the
greats.  James Dean.  Sid
Vicious...

LYDIA
Well, it can't be any worse than
my life here.

BETELGEUSE
(sinister, encouraging
her)
That's right.  They treat you like
scum, I bet?

LYDIA
Yeah.

BETELGEUSE
I can't help you from this side,
but here's how we do it.  So
simple.  Say my name three
times.  That's all.  I'll be all
yours.  Then I'll bring you over
here in style.

LYDIA
I... I don't know what your name is.

BETELGEUSE
Minor problem.  The rules.  I
can't tell it to you.  But.. do
you know how to play charades?

LYDIA
Yes.

BETELGEUSE
Of course you do.

He holds up two fingers in a V.

LYDIA
Two words.

Betelgeuse holds up one finger.

LYDIA
(continuing)
First word.

Betelgeuse puts two fingers on his arm.

LYDIA
(continuing)
Three syllables.

BETELGEUSE
No, dummy.  Two.

LYDIA
Your fingers are so small I can't
see them.  First word -- two
syllables.

He points behind her.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I don't know what that signal
means.

BETELGEUSE
It means look behind you, bimbo.


ANGLE

Lydia looks behind her.  A greet beetle the size of a
Volkswagen is crouching.  Its feathery antennae reach
out toward her menacingly.  Lydia yelps.

LYDIA
Beetle!

BETELGEUSE
Good girrrl!

POP!  The beetle disappears.  Betelgeuse holds up two
fingers.

LYDIA
(still shaken)
Second word.  Be careful.


ANGLE

Apprehensive, she jumps when a simple carton of orange
juice materializes.  Orange juice pours out into a
ghostly glass.

LYDIA
Breakfast?  Orange?

The orange juice disappears.  He shakes his head.

LYDIA
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle
fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit Battle?
Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?

BETELGEUSE
Good thing you are a beautiful
kid.  You are dumb!

Betelgeuse does the signal for ""Now Put Them Together.""

LYDIA
I am not!  Beetle... Juice?

BETELGEUSE
(jumping with delight)
That's it!

LYDIA
Your name is Beetle Juice?  Yecch!
That's as bad as Deeelia Deeetz.

BETELGEUSE
It's spelled different, but
basically... Now you said it
twice, just one more time.  And
I'll be free.
(sinister)
And then you'll be free.

Lydia, puzzled, gets the magnifying glass and peers at
him.


ON HIS UGLY FACE BIG IN THE GLASS

Betelgeuse jumps in the air, his robe parts -- we don't
see anything, but maybe Lydia does.

LYDIA
God, you're anatomically correct!

BETELGEUSE
Just say it.

LYDIA
(recognizing something
about him)
You were the snake!  Right?  I
know.  It was you.

BETELGEUSE
You've got to say it!

LYDIA
No I don't.  I don't take orders
from Smurfs.

BETELGEUSE
How'd you like to be married to...
the King...?

Lydia doesn't get it.

BETELGEUSE
(continuing)
... Elvis?...
(boasting)
You know, ever since he came over
he and I have been just like this.
(crosses his fingers)
I can arrange it.  Just say my
name one more time.

She thinks about that one.  Shakes her head.

LYDIA
No, No... I need to talk to
Barbara.

Betelgeuse smiles.

BETELGEUSE
Well, cookie, just say my name.  I
can get her.
(rubbing his horny little
hands together)
That and so much more...

Lydia walks around thinking for a moment.

LYDIA
Who else did you say is over
there?


INT. JUNO'S OFFICE - DAY

Juno staring at them, hard.

JUNO
Yes... or no?  Do you want the
Deetzes out or in?

ADAM
Out.

BARBARA
What about Betelgeuse?

JUNO
Forget him.  He'll remain with his
whores until someone calls him.
You need to worry about people like
Otho.  There are a lot of
phony trance mediums.  They
usually can't make the formulas
work, but if Otho stumbles on the
right words in that handbook... he
could hurt you.  As in --
exorcism.

They both look puzzled.

JUNO
(continuing)
In plain English -- that's death
for the dead.  I don't care what
it takes, just get them out of
there now.  It's not pretty, but
-- that's death!

Adam stands to go.

JUNO
(continuing)
Wait a minute.  Let's see what
you're going to do...

They look at Juno.

JUNO
(continuing)
... to scare her.  I want to make
sure it's not some silly parlor
trick.

Barbara looks at Adam.

ADAM
I'll do the hard part, hon.


ADAM

reluctantly pulls on his face, and contorts it into a
living, breathing, horror.  Juno is even a little
repulsed.

JUNO
Not bad.  Not bad.  Now you?  Go
ahead.


ANGLE

She reluctantly does with her face a minor version of
Adam's horror.

JUNO
(continuing)
Okay.  You look great!  Now go
clean house.  And don't forget the
photographs and the damned
handbook.


ANGLE

Barbara and Adam slowly stand and walk out the door.
Barbara/Monster looks back pleadingly.  Football
players flood into Juno's office.  One PARTICULARLY
DUMB PLAYER has a revelation.  (He's pretty grisly,
maybe sat too close to the engine.)

PARTICULARLY DUMB PLAYER
Coach!  Coach, I don't think we
survived the crash!

Barbara and Adam look at each other and continue out the
door.


OUTSIDE JUNO'S OFFICE

They enter a long dark hallway.  They suddenly find
themselves standing in front of Lydia's room.  Adam/
Monster looks at Barbara/Monster as he grabs the door-
knob.  She stops him.  Tears fall down her sad ghostly
face.

BARBARA
Adam.  I can't do it.  I like that
little girl.

ADAM/MONSTER
It's too late.  Sometimes things
just work out this way.  We have
to, honey.

BARBARA/MONSTER
No we don't.  We can rebel or
something.  We'll just stay up
there in our room.  I'll read, you
can build on the model.  Come on.

She rushes up the stairs, toward the attic.  He follows
her.

ADAM/MONSTER
Wait.  We can't, honey.  Our
house...

She gets to the door.  Grabs the handle.

BARBARA
I want to be with Lydia!

She throws open the door.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia is standing over the model, about to say
Betelgeuse's name.

LYDIA
Okay.  Beetle... J...

Barbara/Monster, horrified, screams!

BARBARA/MONSTER
!  Lydia, stop!

Adam/Monster runs to grab her.  Lydia is terrified.
Screams.

ADAM/MONSTER
No, don't say it!

BETELGEUSE
Say it!  Rat shit!

Betelgeuse slips off the roof into a patch of thorny
bushes.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Lydia screams, Adam/Monster tries to calm her.  Lydia
struggles and, thinking she is being attacked, runs out
the door.  Smack into Barbara/Monster.

Barbara catches her, frightens Lydia even more.
Barbara holds onto her as she struggles.  Barbara/
Monster slowly changes back into regular Barbara.
Lydia sees who it is and she hugs her.  Like mother and
daughter.

ON ADAM - slowly returning to himself.  He smiles
slightly at the scene.

BETELGEUSE (O.S.)
You lily-livered bleeding hearts!

BARBARA
I'm so sorry we frightened you.
What were you doing?

LYDIA
He... Beetle Jui...

Barbara quickly puts her hand over her mouth.

LYDIA
(continuing)
He said if I let him out he would
take me over to the other side to
find you.

BARBARA
No, Lydia, we're dead.

LYDIA
I want to be dead, too.

BARBARA
(shocked)
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?

LYDIA
(after a pause,
dramatically
but for real)
Life is just... unliveable...

Barbara hugs her.  She fumbles for words.  This is an
unusual situation, a dead person talking a live person
out of killing herself.  She rocks Lydia a little.
Barbara looks at Adam.

BARBARA
Lydia, believe me... we know...
all the hard stuff is the same
over here.  You're going to be who
you are... whether you're alive or
dead... and over here -- it's...
It's flat... there's no food, no
colors... you can't smell the
flowers.
(thinking)
If we knew then what we know
now... we'd have been more
careful...

ADAM
(in the style of the
dead receptionist)
... we wouldn't have had our
little accident.

Lydia looks at Barbara lovingly.

BARBARA
So never let Beetlejuice out --
never.  Besides...
(looking at Adam)
We're thinking about letting
everyone stay... you and your
father and mother can stay too.

LYDIA
(smiles and says
slowly)
Step... mother.


ADAM/MONSTER

is not sure, huffs around a little.  He is trying to
change back into Adam, except for his nose, which
remains like a beak for a minute.  Finally, it changes
too.

Lydia and Barbara laugh at him.


ANGLE

Without noticing Lydia, Otho and Charles push in
through the door and grab the model.  They take it out
the door.

Adam is beside himself.  Doesn't know what to do.

Barbara stops him from taking action.

ADAM
What is going on?

LYDIA
Really.  I don't know.

Adam looks suspiciously at her.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I really don't.  I'll go find out.

She runs out the door.

BARBARA
Be careful.


INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lydia runs through the hallway and into the dining
room.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia walks into a presentation in progress.  Sitting
around the table are Otho, Maxie, and Delia.  Sarah Dean
is there, too.  She looks around Lydia hoping for
ghosts.  Sarah is heavily made up, smells bad.

Lydia's photos of the sheeted ghosts are blown up and
standing on a nearby easel.  Charles, over the model
with a pointer, is lost in mid-sentence.

CHARLES
-- In short, I've got options to
buy enough of Main Street to
control the city council for a
hundred years.  And at the prices
I'm talking about, if it all fell
apart tomorrow, we just move out and
sell to the Arabs and we still come
out... I've talked to Ed Cornwall
about a wax museum, here... in
Thanksgiving Park... Ed's the man
who made the talking Jesse Jackson
statue.
And I've got a museum dedicated to
50 Great Moments in the Paranormal
-- and parenthetically, D-Con wants
to the right to start an insect zoo
here in the old hardware store.
(seeing Lydia)
Lydia, did you finally decide to
join us?

They all give her an oily smile.

CHARLES
Honey, I am just finishing the first
phase presentation about our little
project here.  Then we'll take a
stretch and invite our friends... to meet
your friends.

Sarah gets Maxie's attention and unable to contain her
excitement, silently urges him to get on with the
ghosts.

SARAH
Are they here yet?

MAXIE
Yes, Charles, let's cut the
bullcorn.  We're here to see
ghosts.  This whole ghost town
museum and such like follows a
train, if you've got the engine...
so let's see your goddamned engine.

Everyone looks at Lydia.

LYDIA
They're... not here anymore.

CHARLES
(smiling apologetically)
Nonsense, every time she says
that, the paint peels, and some
wild creature tries to kill us.

SARAH
(motioning)
We've got these pictures, Lydia.

LYDIA
No, really... they said they might
come back and all of us could live
in peace if you agreed not to
tease them or make them do silly
tricks.

Sarah is disappointed.  She goes to Maxie.  Delia takes
over.

DELIA
She's become a little emotional
about all this.  No counseling up
here.  But we aren't relying on
her.  No, we rely on
professionals.  We have... Otho.

The whole room turns to Otho.  Who is scribbling some-
thing and mumbling.

CHARLES
Are they still here, Otho?

Otho looks up; he missed the question.

DELIA
Are they still here, Otho?

OTHO
Oh, they're still here.  They're
just not showing up.

CHARLES
They're probably guilty about what
they did to me.

DELIA
Not these people!  They are
ruthless!

MAXIE
I don't care from guilt.  I just
want to see them.

CHARLES
Otho, can you do it?

OTHO
It's tricky, but I think I can
handle it.

He dramatically produces the handbook.

LYDIA
No!

Lydia begins to think about this scene and she shifts
to another point of view.

LYDIA
Wait a minute!  What am I worried
about?  Otho, you can't even
change a tire!

OTHO
(taking the challenge)
I'll need something personal of
theirs.

LYDIA
You'll have to go to the Goodwill.

Delia gets an idea.


EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

The moon stares down icily through gray clouds.  Wind
up.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Barbara is looking out the window.

BARBARA
(wistful)
You know, I've been thinking.  I
could teach Lydia to sew.

ADAM
Little black party dresses?

BARBARA
(punching him playfully)
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything
about little girls.  She's just...
missed out on some love, that's
all...

ADAM
(huffy)
Let's see if she can get my model
back.

BARBARA
You can build another one... with
her.

Adam isn't convinced.  Barbara motions him to sit next
to her.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Come here, I want to talk to you.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Delia carefully brings out a big plastic bag.  Lays
something out on the dining room table.

DELIA
I'm deeply sentimental about...
weddings.

Lydia stands to see:  Delia carefully lays out
Barbara's white wedding dress.  Then next to it, Adam's
wedding tux.

Lydia looks at it.  A chill runs through her.

LYDIA
(hushed realization)
Their wedding clothes.

OTHO
(dramatically)
Their wedding clothes.

Otho then holds up the handbook.

SARAH
The ""words"".

Otho nods.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia is nervous now.  Otho lights a candle and Delia
turns out the lights.

OTHO
Hands vermillion / start of five
bright cotillion / raven's dive
nightshades promise / spirit's strive,
to the living / let now the dead...
come alive.

Nothing happens.  Lydia nervously turns away.

LYDIA
(sarcastically)
Doo wah.


ANGLE

Then a SIZZLE, a TINY CRACKLE, along one side of the
square.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Barbara with her arm on his shoulder, talks to Adam.

BARBARA
We've been given a gift here,
honey.  A real live little girl.
She likes us a lot.  She needs
us.  Maybe that's why we died so
young, to keep us from getting
so... attached to things.  The
house, antiques, your model.  Look
at us.  We didn't have room for
anyone.

ADAM
(after a long thought)
What makes you think she likes me?

Barbara slowly smiles.  He does too.

He turns to Barbara.  CAMERA HINGES WITH him to see --


ON BARBARA

Her face is frightened.  She cannot speak.  She reaches
out to him -- but is disappearing.  He reaches for her
but she is suddenly -- GONE.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Varicolored lightning bolts shoot from every corner of
the square.  A gasp from everyone but Lydia.


ON LYDIA -- she is looking away.  She turns to see:


ON THE DRESS

Barbara's wedding dress floats over the table and fills
slowly, painfully, with the arms, legs and finally the
frightened face of Barbara.  A lightning bolt flares.

Lydia rises slowly to her feet, unable to resist.

More lightning bolts.

OTHO
As sudden thunder / Pierces the night;
As magic wonder / Mad affright
Rives asunder / Man's delight:
Our ghost, our corpse and we
Rise to be.

Lydia walks slowly toward Barbara.


ON BARBARA

She is in pain, she is very slowly aging.  She speaks,
but no words can be heard.  Not even by Lydia.  But we
can see she is calling for... Adam.

LYDIA
Stop it!

MAXIE
Shhhh!

Lydia screams for Adam.

LYDIA
Adam.  Adam.

OTHO
(louder)
As flies the lizard / Serpent fell;
As goblin vizard, / At the spell
Of pale wizard, / Sinks to hell;
The buried, dead, and slain...
Rise again.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

In a lightning flare we see: Adam searching for
Barbara.  He rushes out into the hallway.

ADAM
Barbara!  Barbara?  Ba...

His last plaintive call becomes mute as he too begins
slowly to disappear.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

On each of the watchers one by one, scared but
delighted too.  No one is watching Lydia.

ON LYDIA -- tears well up in her eyes.


ON BARBARA

She is slowly aging.  Now a bewildered Adam appears,
floating in his wedding suit.  Seeing his Barbara, now
older than he is, Adam reaches for her hand...

ON HANDS -- as he grasps her hand, it seems to be made
of white crepe; it wrinkles and nearly collapses.

Adam... puzzled, calls her name silently.

DELIA
What's happening to them?

OTHO
I don't know.

CHARLES
Are they suffering?

LYDIA
(screams)
They're dying.

MAXIE
They're already dead.  They can't
feel a thing.

Obviously not true.

ON BARBARA -- she looks down slowly at Lydia and with
effort makes a loving smile.  She reaches out toward
Lydia.

Completely helpless now, Lydia weeps openly and then
something comes over her.  She rushes across the room.
Stares down at the model.

LYDIA
Where are you?  Help us!  Please.
Betelgeuse!

A CRACK OF LIGHTNING.


EXT. MODEL TOWN GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Someone, or something, like the figure of death in the
Goya drawing, is perched atop the gravestone of Barbara
and Adam Maitland.  The graves beneath him are open.
The figure turns... it is Betelgeuse.  He is filing his
talons casually.

He speaks with a ghastly rasp.

BETELGEUSE
So... You're ready for me now?

LYDIA
You've got to help them.

BETELGEUSE
Can you help me?

LYDIA
(frightened)
... I will.

BETELGEUSE
Then I'll help them.  For a price.

He grins.

LYDIA
W... What is it?

BETELGEUSE
(his words echo
horribly
Be... my... queen!

LYDIA
(repulsed)
Your qu...?  But you're...

BETELGEUSE
(smiling devilishly)
I'm beeyoo-teeful.


ON LYDIA

She is chilled.  Steps back.
She turns back to the Maitlands who are continuing to
age.  Looks back to the model.

LYDIA
... All right... Betelgeuse...


ON BETELGEUSE

He doubles in size.  The tombstone crumbles beneath
him...

LYDIA (V.O.)
(louder)
Betelgeuse...


WIDER ON GRAVEYARD

He doubles in size again.


ON LYDIA

She hesitates.


ON BETELGEUSE - TIGHT

He looks up at her confidently.

LYDIA
Betelgeuse!


DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Barbara and Adam's corpses are nearly at the end of
their ropes.

CHARLES
All right, that's enough.  Can you
stop this now?

Otho doesn't answer.

CHARLES
(continuing)
Otho?

OTHO
It's too late, Charles.  I'm
sorry.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia peers at the model.  Betelgeuse is transforming.
There's a LOW RUMBLE.  The model town starts to shake.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia backs away.  Betelgeuse's head, now human-size,
rises from the center of the model town.


TIGHT ON HIS FACE

His grin is malevolent and malicious.  It's showtime,
folks!

BETELGEUSE
Attention, K-Mart shoppers!


ON DEETZES

-- who have been focused on the Maitlands now turning
around to the model.


ON MODEL

Betelgeuse begins a bright but sinister Carnival
Barker's pitch.  His shoulders now are clearing the
model.

BETELGEUSE
Welcome to Winter River!


ANGLE

Sarah rushes over to the model, thinking this is more
of the show.  Maxie follows.

BETELGEUSE
Hel LO Piggies!  Welcome to Winter
River!  See the Museum of Natural
Greed.  The Monument to Bored
Businessmen!  Come closer!


ANGLE

Suddenly Betelgeuse's arms elongate, swell and CRACKLE.


ON MAXIE AND SARAH

Their eyes grow wide.


TIGHT ON BETELGEUSE'S HANDS

They split, unfurl, and transmutate into two, shiny,
huge sledgehammers.


ON BETELGEUSE

He grins, his eyes sparkle in anticipation.  CARNEY
MUSIC UP.

BETELGEUSE
(roughly to the tune
of ""Santa Claus is
Coming to Town"")
You better not sell, you better
not buy...


ON MAXIE AND SARAH

Behind each of them, a graduated CARNIVAL BELL RINGING
GAME STANDARD erects itself.


ON BETELGEUSE

BETELGEUSE
(still singing)
Or old Uncle Beetle Claus will be
makin'... you... fly.

Betelgeuse swings his hammer/hands and sends Max and
Sarah zooming through the roof.  GONG.  GONG.


ANGLE

BETELGEUSE
(in style of game
show host)
Yowser, yowser.  Well, who do we
have here tonight?


ANGLE

He looks up at the suspended Maitlands.

BETELGEUSE
Let's have a hand for the
Maitlands, Barbara and Adam.  They
deserve a rest.


ON MAITLANDS

Wispy shadows by now, but still alive/dead.  They fall
in a heap on the floor.  NOTE:  They immediately start
to regenerate themselves.

BETELGEUSE
Well, we'll get back to them after
they recover from their flight.


ON ADAM

Filling out again, he struggles to stand, but falls.
Barbara shakes her head, trying to regain her focus.

BETELGEUSE
(looking around)
My God, what ugly wall dressing.
Who is responsible for all this
ugliness?
(spying Otho trying
to hide)
Otho, it's you!  Watch out for the
taste patrol!


ANGLE

He waves and the door opens.  A little Italian gentle-
man appears.

OTHO
No.  Noooo!  My God.  It's Giorgio
Armani!

GIORGIO
Before youa getta started herea, I
joost wanta to saya, Otho,
don'ta weara my stuff?  Okay?
Youa too fat for human-type
clothes.  Ita makes my designs
looka like aircraft covering!


ANGLE

Otho is horrified.  Suddenly he looks down and sees his
clothing has transformed into a polyester nightmare.
He runs out the door screaming.  Betelgeuese laughs
with delight then focuses on Lydia.

BETELGEUSE
Let's leave this crazy world
behind us.  I'll take you out in
style!

Sound of eerie WEDDING MARCH.  The fireplace changes
into an expressionist altar.


ANGLE

His leering horned whores walk like bridesmaids, in
step, through the door.  They rush toward Lydia.


ANGLE

Frightened, Lydia is assaulted and pulled forward by
these ugly handmaidens; she suddenly looks down and
sees she is now clothed in a blood-red wedding dress.
Lydia screams!!

BARBARA
No... No!

Adam's eyes widen.

LYDIA
(frightened, but
hurling the incan-
tation to make him
disappear)
No... Betelgeuse.  Bet...

Betelgeuse waves a hand and Lydia's mouth freezes.
Delia and Charles plead with the recovering Maitlands.

DELIA
(frantic)
Please, can't you do something!
Please!



ON BARBARA AND ADAM

Adam, not fully recovered, heroically tries to speak --
but his jaw falls off.  An exhausted Barbara tries to
help him reattach it.

Betelgeuse looks at Lydia.

BETELGEUSE
You know if we're going to get
married, we're going to need
witnesses!

Betelgeuse shifts his glare to Charles and Delia.
From Behind, Delia's horrid sculptures come to life
and attack Charles and Delia.  The sculptures twist
around them, forcing them to watch the hideous
spectacle.

Adam and Barbara are rapidly trying to recover as the
ceremony begins.


A DEATH-MASKED OLD PREACHER

slides down the fireplace, ready to perform the
service, speaks with a hissing death rattle.

PREACHER
Do you, Betel...

His mouth drops and is frozen.

BETELGEUSE
Uh-uh!  No one says the B word!

PREACHER
Do you, _____________, take this
woman to be your wedded wife?  To
honor...

BETELGEUSE
(interrupting)
You betcha!

Lydia screams and struggles.

PREACHER
And... you?  Do you, Lydia, take
this man?... er, uh... man... to
be your lawful wedded husband?...
In sickness...

Lydia struggles.  Her screams are muffled and distant.
Betelgeuse grabs her and shakes her.

BETELGEUSE
You don't have to answer him,
snookums.  I'll do it for you.
(eerily, speaking in
her voice)
I'm Lydia Deetz and I'm of sound
mind.  The man next to me is the
one I want.  You asked me... I'm
answering.  Yes.  How I love that
man of mine.

Adam, now fully regenerated, moves toward them.  He
shouts the incantation.

ADAM
Beetle...


ANGLE

Betelgeuse turns to him and with a sweep of his hand,
Adam's teeth (as if they were false), fly out of his
mouth and CLATTER to the floor.  Adam, toothless,
musters up his ghost powers and --

ON TEETH - TIGHT -- they rare back and continue
shouting...

TEETH
Beetleju...


ANGLE

Mayhem breaks out.  A furious Betelgeuse stomps at them
with his feet.  The teeth scuttle under the model.

BETELGEUSE
(angrily, to old man)
Now move it, pops!


ON ADAM

Speechless, Adam heroically charges toward Betelgeuse,
ready to strike him.  Betelgeuse spins on him and waves
his hand.  SOUND OF RUSHING WIND.


ON ADAM

He has been zapped into his model town.


ANGLE

Barbara screams and jumps at Betelgeuse.

BARBARA
Beetlegeuse...

Betelgeuse turns on her, eyes flashing.


ON BARBARA

A gag comes over her mouth.


ON MODEL

Adam is running around the streets trying to get out of
the model.  He looks up into the sky, sees a red glow
and THUNDERING WEDDING MUSIC.  He doesn't know what to
do.


ON BARBARA

She tears away her face (like tissue) and tries to say
his name again...

BARBARA
Betelgeuse...


ON BETELGEUSE

More angry, he waves his hand.


ON BARBARA

Her lips are zippered shut.


IN MODEL

Desperate, Adam gets an idea.  He runs over to the
truck Betelgeuse had crashed earlier, jumps in and
tries to start it.


ON BARBARA

She unzips her mouth and tries again.

BARBARA
Be


ON BETELGEUSE

Fire darts from his eyes....


ON BARBARA

A chromium steel plate is riveted across her mouth.
She screams wordlessly behind it.


IN MODEL

Adam finally gets the truck started.


BARBARA

Struggling with her mouth, frustrated to the breaking
point, she looks all around the room and rushes to the
window and CRASHES through into the night.


IN MODEL

Adam sees Barbara rush out.  He looks back at
Betelgeuse, floors the gas pedal and goes for one last
shot.


BETELGEUSE

BETELGEUSE
(angry)
Now, let's get rolling!

PREACHER
Then, by the authority vested in
me by...

A RUMBLE comes from outside.  Everyone notices but the
Preacher.  He stutters to finish the wedding.

BETELGEUSE
By me!  Get on with it!

LOUDER NOISE from outside.  Now nearly DEAFENING.

PREACHER
Yes... by him.  I now pronounce
you man and...


ANGLE

The truck is racing up to Betelgeuse's foot.  Adam
bails out just in time as the truck hits Betelgeuse's
foot and EXPLODES, giving him a distracting hot foot,
then --


ON WINDOW

Through it -- amidst a cloud of yellow dust -- CRASHES
the sand worm.  Barbara rides him bareback.  Barbara
struggles to control the ROARING worm.  She pulls on
his ears and looks around for Beetle Juice.  Seeing
him, she spurs the Worm after Beetle Juice.


ANGLE

Beetle Juice struggles, trying to run from the worm.
But Barbara and the worm outmaneuver him, corner him,
and when the worm reaches him, he opens his hungry
mouth and gulps Betelgeuse in one mouthful.

BETELGEUSE
Rrrrat shit!


ANGLE

Barbara leaps off, as the Sand Worm continues down
through the floorboards of the house

Betelgeuse is gone.  Adam is back to full size.
Charles and Delia are no longer held by the sculptures.
Lydia runs back to her family and Adam and Barbara.
The dust settles.


ON HOLE - JUNO

peers into the room.  She pulls the whores through the
hole.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. MAIN STREET - WINTER RIVER - A BRIGHT DAY

BIRDS SING.  Ernie polishes the lion.  Old Bill sleeps.
People stroll.


EXT. MISS SHANNON'S BOARDING SCHOOL - DAY

A lovely white boarding school with long, green lawn.
A BELL RINGS.  Girls come out the front door.  Say
goodbyes.  Lydia walks out too, carrying books.

LYDIA
'Bye, Serena.  See you later.

Lydia walks along Main Street of Winter River.


EXT. JANE BUTTERFIELD'S ANTIQUES/TRAVEL/REAL ESTATE

Jane is getting out of her car -- Little Jane follows.

JANE
Hellooo!  How's school?

LYDIA
(not particularly
interested)
It's okay.  How's the dirt
business?

JANE
Well, I'm expecting a call from
your parents.  I have some news
for them.

Jane hears PHONE RING from inside, rushes in to answer it.

LYDIA
Tell them I'll call them tonight.


EXT. MAIN STREET - WINTER RIVER - A BRIGHT DAY

Ernie polishes the lion.  Lydia passes.

LYDIA
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.

He looks around, surprised.


INT. JANE BUTTERFIELD'S ANTIQUES/TRAVEL/REAL ESTATE

Jane screams into the phone.

JANE
What do you mean no?  After all
I've done for you.  I don't do
this for my health you know.

CAMERA EXPLORES a row of photographs of houses for
sale.

ON PHOTOGRAPH -- of the old Maitland house.  It is
delapidated and haunted-looking.  A legend reads:
Fixer-Upper's Special.""

BACK TO JANE -- she is frustrated.

JANE
I have here a bona fide offer of
$250,000.00 for that dump.

Little Jane is now at the Xerox machine.  The NOISE
irritates Big Jane and she throws a wad of paper at
Little Jane.  Little Jane gets mad and throws her
papers into the air and exits.


INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY

We recognize the furniture.  It's the Deetzes'.  Delia
is on the phone to Jane.  Charles comes in with the
Wall Street Journal.  He fidgets, taps his fingers, as
he reads and pours coffee -- all at once.

DELIA
(whisper to Charles)
It's Mrs. Butterworth again.

Charles picks up the extension.

CHARLES
Listen to me, Jane.  We don't want
anyone looking at the house.  We
don't want it painted, the yard
mowed, the trees trimmed, nor do
we want it termite inspected.
It's not for sale.


INT. JANE'S STORE - DAY

Jane listens.  Silent.  Thinking.

JANE
Well.  Okay for now.  When will
you sell it?


INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY

DELIA
(smiles)
Never, honey.  Never.

She hangs up.  Looks at Charles.

DELIA
(continuing)
Some people never know when to
leave things the way they are.

Charles smiles.


INT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

SOUND OF SWEEPING -- CAMERA eases up -- Barbara is
sweeping.  Adam working on his model.

ADAM
What time is it?

Barbara smiles.

The KITCHEN DOOR SLAMS.  Barbara looks up at Adam.
They smile.

ADAM
Did you get the paint?

LYDIA'S VOICE
I got it.  And I took pictures of
the new church for you, too.

BARBARA
How'd you do on the science test?

ON LYDIA

LYDIA
(hangs her head)
It was gross.  They wanted me to
dissect a frog.  I told them no
way.  I said it was against my
religion.  I got a C.

Adam frowns a little.

BARBARA
How did you do on the math test?

Lydia looks down coyly.

ADAM
We studied all day yesterday.
Don't tell me...

LYDIA
I got an A!

They grin with pride.

LYDIA
(continuing)
So can I?

ADAM
(shaking his head)
Uh-uh.  Only if you got above a C
on science.

LYDIA
Oh, go on...

BARBARA
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You
never got an A in science in your
life!

ADAM
All right.

ON LYDIA -- she puts down her books.  Loosens her
collar, ruffles her hair and waits.

ADAM
(continuing)
Okay.

Lydia looks down.  Lydia begins to levitate.

She lifts her head and leaves the white bread world
behind!  In a voice as deep and soulful as Percy
Sledge:

LYDIA
""When a man loves a woman.
He can't keep his mind on nothin' else.""

Behind her ghostly images of the football players
appear as back-up.

FOOTBALLERS
Oooooo.  Hummm oooooo.

LYDIA
He'd change the world for the good
thing he's found.  When a main
needs a woman, He cain't keep his
mind on nothin' else.  If she's
bad, he won't see it, she can do
no wrong.

MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:


ANGLE

A great pile of sand with the whorehouse in the
middle.  An irritated Betelgeuse crawls out on the
roof.  Hating the singing he shakes his fist at the
sky -- loses his footing and tumbles into the sand.
Terrified, he scrambles to get out.


ON PILE

A moving coil under the sand sends him scurrying inside
again.  The Sandworm SNAPPING right behind him as he
runs back out on the roof.


ANGLE

CAMERA TILTS UP to see house.  It is the perfect, New
England house.  CAMERA PULLS BACK from the model -- out
the window of the real house.

Outside the real house -- we see it is dilapidated, and
undeniably, the perfect haunted house.

312,I Can't Make You Love Me,"Michael Pollan: The way we eat has changed more in the last 50 years than in the previous 10,000. But the image that’s used to sell the food, it is still the imagery of agrarian America. You go into the supermarket and you see pictures of farmers, the picket fence, the silo, the ’30s farmhouse and the green grass. It’s the spinning of this pastoral fantasy.

The modern American supermarket has on average 47,000 products. There are no seasons in the American supermarket. Now there are tomatoes all year round, grown halfway around the world, picked when it was green, and ripened with ethylene gas. Although it looks like a tomato, it’s kind of a notional tomato. I mean, it’s the idea of a tomato. In the meat aisle, there are no bones anymore. Eric Schlosser: There is this deliberate veil, this curtain, that’s dropped between us and where our food is coming from. The industry doesn’t want you to know the truth about what you’re eating, because if you knew, you might not want to eat it.

Pollan: If you follow the food chain back from those shrink-wrapped packages of meat, you find a very different reality. The reality is a factory. It’s not a farm. It’s a factory. That meat is being processed by huge multinational corporations that have very little to do with ranches and farmers.

Schlosser: Now our food is coming from enormous assembly lines where the animals and the workers are being abused. And the food has become much more dangerous in ways that are being deliberately hidden from us. Troy Roush: You’ve got a small group of multinational corporations who control the entire food system. From seed to the supermarket, they’re gaining control of food.

Schlosser: This isn’t just about what we’re eating. This is about what we’re allowed to say, what we’re allowed to know. It’s not just our health that’s at risk. Carole Morison: The companies don’t want farmers talking. They don’t want this story told. How about a nice chicken club sandwich made with fresh cooked chicken? You know, that’s a nice idea, but I think what I’d really like

Schlosser’s voice: My favorite meal to this day remains a hamburger and french fries. I had no idea that a handful of companies had changed what we eat and how we make our food. I’ve been eating this food all my life without having any idea where it comes from, any idea how powerful this industry is. And it was the idea of this world deliberately hidden from us. I think that’s one of the reasons why I became an investigative reporter, was to take the veil– lift the veil away from important subjects that are being hidden. (film projector clicking)

Schlosser: The whole industrial food system really began with fast food. In the 1930s, a new form of restaurant arose and it was called the drive-in. The McDonald brothers had a very successful drive-in, but they decided to cut costs and simplify. So they fired all their carhops, they got rid of most of the things on the menu and they created a revolutionary idea to how to run a restaurant. They basically brought the factory system to the back of the restaurant kitchen. They trained each worker to just do one thing again and again and again. By having workers who only had to do one thing, they could pay them a low wage and it was very easy to find someone to replace them. It was inexpensive food, it tasted good and this McDonald’s fast food restaurant was a huge huge success. That mentality of uniformity, conformity and cheapness applied widely and on a large scale has all kinds of unintended consequences. (mooing) When McDonald’s is the largest purchaser of ground beef in the United States and they want their hamburgers to taste, everywhere, exactly the same, they change how ground beef is produced. The McDonald’s corporation is the largest purchaser of potatoes and one of the largest purchasers of pork, chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, even apples. These big big fast food chains want big suppliers. And now there are essentially a handful of companies controlling our food system. In the 1970s, the top five beef-packers controlled only about 25% of the market. Today, the top four control more than 80% of the market. You see the same thing happening now in pork. Even if you don’t eat at a fast food restaurant, you’re now eating meat that’s being produced by this system. You look at the labels and you see Farmer this, Farmer that– it’s really just three or four companies that are controlling the meat. We’ve never had food companies this big and this powerful in our history. Tyson, for example, is the biggest meat-packing company in the history of the world. The industry changed the entire way that chicken are raised. Birds are now raised and slaughtered in half the time they were 50 years ago, but now they’re twice as big. People like to eat white meat, so they redesigned the chicken to have large breasts. – They not only changed the chicken, they changed the farmer. Today, chicken farmers no longer control their birds. (thudding) A company like Tyson owns the birds from the day they’re dropped off until the day that they’re slaughtered. (buzzes) Let me go to the top. – Man: This is the Chicken– The chicken industry has really set a model for the integration of production, processing and marketing of the products that other industries are now following because they see that we have achieved tremendous economies. In a way, we’re not producing chickens; we’re producing food. It’s all highly mechanized. So all the birds coming off those farms have to be almost exactly the same size. What the system of intensive production accomplishes is to produce a lot of food on a small amount of land at a very affordable price. Now somebody explain to me what’s wrong with that. (sniffs) Smells like money to me. (chuckles) 16 chicken houses sit here. And Chuck’s son has four over the top of this hill. The chicken industry came in here and it’s helped this whole community out. Here’s my chicken houses here. I have about 300,000 chickens. (barks) We have a contract with Tyson. They’ve been growing chickens for many many years. It’s all a science. They got it figured out. If you can grow a chicken in 49 days, why would you want one you gotta grow in three months? More money in your pocket. (chickens clucking) These chickens never see sunlight. They’re pretty much in the dark all the time. Man: So you think they just want to keep us out? I don’t know. If I knew, I’d tell you. It would be nice if y’all could see what we really do, but as far as y’all going in, we can’t let you do that. I understand why farmers don’t want to talk– because the company can do what it wants to do as far as pay goes since they control everything. But it’s just gotten to the point that it’s not right what’s going on and I’ve just made up my mind. I’m gonna say what I have to say. I understand why others don’t want to do it. And I’m just to a point that it doesn’t matter anymore. Something has to be said. (loud clucking)

It is nasty in here. There’s dust flying everywhere. There’s feces everywhere. This isn’t farming. This is just mass production, like an assembly line in a factory. (fans whirring) When they grow from a chick and in seven weeks you’ve got a five-and-a-half- pound chicken, their bones and their internal organs can’t keep up with the rapid growth. A lot of these chickens here, they can take a few steps and then they plop down. It’s because they can’t keep up all the weight that they’re carrying. (wheezes) That’s normal. There’s antibiotics that’s put into the feed and of course that passes through the chicken. The bacteria builds up a resistance, so antibiotics aren’t working anymore. I have become allergic to all antibiotics and can’t take ‘em. (clucking)

Morison: When it’s dark inside the houses, the chickens lay down. It’s less resistance when they’re being caught. Traditionally, it’s been African-American men. Now we’re seeing more and more Latino catchers– undocumented workers. From their point of view, they don’t have any rights and they’re just not gonna complain. The companies like these kind of workers. It doesn’t matter if the chickens get sick. All of the chickens will go to the plant for processing. The companies keep the farmers under their thumb because of the debt that the farmers have. To build one poultry house is anywhere from $280,000 to $300,000 per house. And once you make your initial investment, the companies constantly come back with demands of upgrades for new equipment, and the grower has no choice. They have to do it or you’re threatened with loss of a contract. This is how they keep the farmers under control. It’s how they keep them spending money, going to the bank and borrowing more money. The debt just keeps building. To have no say in your business, it’s degrading. It’s like being a slave to the company. Pollan: The idea that you would need to write a book telling people where their food came from is just a sign of how far removed we’ve become. It seems to me that we’re entitled to know about our food– “Who owns it? How are they making it? Can I have a look in the kitchen?”

When I wanted to understand the industrial food system, what I set about doing was very simple. I wanted to trace the source of my food. When you go through the supermarket, what looks like this cornucopia of variety and choice is not. There is an illusion of diversity. There are only a few companies involved and there’re only a few crops involved. What really surprised me most as I followed that food back to its source, I kept ending up in the same place, and that was a cornfield in Iowa. So much of our industrial food turns out to be clever rearrangements of corn. Corn has conquered the world in a lot of ways. It is a remarkable plant. 100 years ago, a farmer in America could grow maybe 20 bushels of corn on an acre. Today, 200 bushels is no problem. That’s an astonishing achievement for which breeders deserve credit, for which fertilizer makers deserve credit, for which pesticide makers all deserve credit.

Roush: In the United States today, 30% of our land base is being planted to corn. That’s largely driven by government policy, government policy that, in effect, allows us to produce corn below the cost of production. The truth of the matter is we’re paid to overproduce, and it was caused by these large multinational interests. The reason our government’s promoting corn– the Cargills, the ADMs, Tyson, Smithfield– they have an interest in purchasing corn below the cost of production. They use that interest and that extensive amount of money they have to lobby Congress to give us the kind of farm bills we now have.

Pollan: A “farm bill,” which should really be called a “food bill,” codifies the rules of the entire food economy. Farm policy is always focused on these commodity crops because you can store them. We encourage farmers to grow as much corn as they can grow, to get big, to consolidate. We subsidize farmers by the bushel. Roush: We produced a lot of corn and they came up with uses for it.

Larry Johnson: We are now engineering our foods. We know where to turn to for certain traits like mouth feel and flavor. And we bring all of these pieces together and engineer new foods that don’t stale in the refrigerator, don’t develop rancidity. Of course the biggest advance in recent years was high-fructose corn syrup. You know, I would venture to guess if you go and look on the supermarket shelf, I’ll bet you 90% of them would contain either a corn or soybean ingredient, and most of the time will contain both.

Pollan: Corn is the great raw material. You get that big fat kernel of starch and you can break that down and reassemble it. You can make high-fructose corn syrup. You can make maltodextrin and diglycerides and xanthan gum and ascorbic acid. All those obscure ingredients on the processed food– it’s remarkable how many of them can be made from corn. Plus, you can feed it to animals. Roush: Corn is the main component in feed ingredients whether it’s chicken, hogs, cattle– you name it.

Pollan: Increasingly, we’re feeding the corn to the fish whether we’re eating the tilapia or the farmed salmon. We’re teaching fish how to eat corn. The fact that we had so much cheap corn really allowed us to drive down the price of meat. I mean, the average American is eating over 200 lbs of meat per person per year. That wouldn’t be possible had we not fed them this diet of cheap grain. Since you’re selling corn at below the price of production, the feedlot operator can buy corn at a fraction of what it costs to grow, so that all the animals are sucked off of all the farms in the Midwest. There is a spiderweb of roads and train tracks all around the country moving corn from where it’s being grown to these CAFOs. Cows are not designed by evolution to eat corn. They’re designed by evolution to eat grass. And the only reason we feed them corn is because corn is really cheap and corn makes them fat quickly. (cow moos) Man: Where are you putting your hand? I’m actually inside the rumen– that first compartment of the stomach. And it’s– it’s not– it’s kind of hard to see. You can see the liquid part here.

Man: Wow. There’s microorganisms– bacteria in the rumen, millions of ‘em. The animals evolved on consuming grass. There’s some research that indicates that a high-corn diet results in E. coli that are acid-resistant. And these would be the more harmful E. coli.

Pollan: So you feed corn to cattle and E. coli, which is a very common bug, evolves, a certain mutation occurs and a strain called the “E. coli 0157:h7″ appears on the world stage. And it’s a product of the diet we’re feeding cattle on feedlots and it’s a product of feedlot life. The animals stand ankle deep in their manure all day long. So if one cow has it, the other cows will get it. When they get to the slaughterhouse, their hides are caked with manure. And if the slaughterhouse is slaughtering 400 animals an hour, how do you keep that manure from getting onto those carcasses? And that’s how the manure gets in the meat. And now this thing that wasn’t in the world is in the food system. A fast-food nightmare may be getting worse. A two-year-old child died today in Seattle. And the killer? Tainted meat from Jack In The Box hamburgers. A nationwide recall today for more than 140 tons of ground beef. Man: A half a million pounds of ground beef– of Con Agra ground beef.

Schlosser: E. coli isn’t just in ground beef now– it’s been found in spinach, apple juice– and this is really because of the runoff from our factory farms. 90 confirmed cases of E. coli poisoning. Central to it all– raw, bagged spinach. E. coli outbreak with leafy greens in just the last decade. Schlosser: For years during the Bush administration, the chief of staff at the USDA was the former chief lobbyist to the beef industry in Washington; the head of the F.D.A. was the former executive vice president of the National Food Processors Association. These regulatory agencies are being controlled by the very companies that they’re supposed to be scrutinizing. Woman: ConAgra, which recently recalled peanut butter contaminated with salmonella, was aware of problems in its plant two years ago.

Schlosser: There’s always been food poisoning. As more and more technology is being applied to the production of food, you would think it would be getting safer, not more contaminated. But the processing plants have gotten bigger and bigger. it’s just perfect for taking bad pathogens and spreading them far and wide. Woman: The recall of frozen hamburger now includes 22 million pounds. Enough meat to make a fast-food hamburger for every adult in America is being recalled.

Schlosser: In the 1970s, there were literally thousands of slaughterhouses in the United States. Today we have 13 slaughterhouses that process the majority of beef that is sold in the United States. The hamburger of today, it has pieces of thousands of different cattle ground up in that one hamburger patty. The odds increase exponentially that one of those animals was carrying a dangerous pathogen. It’s remarkable how toothless our regulatory agencies are when you look closely at it, and that’s how the industry wants it.

Patricia Buck: This is the USDA building up here. Did Josh say how much time he thought we’d get? Well, maybe as much as 15. Got to be on time for that meeting. – It starts a 4:00. So if I start going like that – or start shuffling papers, it’s time. – I know, it’s time. Thank you! Thank you. Kowalcyk: I’m a registered Republican. I’ve always been fairly conservative. I never thought I would be doing this and I certainly never thought I would be working so closely with my mom. Made a mistake– I think that’s the way we want to go.

Kowalcyk: My mom and I, our relationship has taken on a whole new dimension. 2421? 2421. Here we are. – I’m Pat. to establish food standards, people just got complacent. We reduced funding for the FDA. We’ve relied increasingly on self-policing for all of these industries. And now we just have, really, lost our system. You’re really one of the champions on the hill for food safety and it’s a very important cause. It’s very personal to me and my family. Our food safety advocacy work started six years ago when my two-and- a-half-year-old son Kevin was stricken with E. coli 0157:h7 and went from being a perfectly healthy beautiful little boy– and I have a small picture with me today that was taken two weeks before he got sick. He went from that to being dead in 12 days. In July 2001, our family took a vacation. Had we known what was in store for us, we would have never gone home. We ended up eating three hamburgers before he got sick. We started to see blood in Kevin’s diarrhea, so we took him to the emergency room. And they said, “We’ve gotten the culture back from Kevin’s stool, and he has hemorrhagic E. coli.” They came in and informed us that Kevin’s kidneys were starting to fail. Kevin received his first dialysis treatment. He was not allowed to really drink water. We had these little sponges and we were allowed to dip that into a cup of water and then give him that. He bit the head off of one of them. You’ve never seen someone beg. He begged for water. It was all he could talk about. They wouldn’t let anybody bring any beverage into the room because– I mean, it was all he would talk about, was… water. (waves lapping) I don’t know if he knew what was happening to him… and I hope– I don’t know. To watch this beautiful child go from being perfectly healthy to dead in 12 days– it was just unbelievable that this could happen from eating food. What was kind of adding more insult to injury– it took us almost two or three years and hiring a private attorney to actually find out that we matched a meat recall. On August 1st, my son was already in the hospital. They did an E. coli test at the plant that was positive. They didn’t end up recalling that meat until August 27th, 16 days after he died. If we have some more hearings– which I’m sure we will– I’d love to have you come and testify.

Kowalcyk: You never get over the death of your child. You find a new normal. – We’re going this way? Kowalcyk: We put faith in our government to protect us, and we’re not being protected at a most basic level. In 1998, the USDA implemented microbial testing for salmonella and E. coli 0157:h7. The idea was that if a plant repeatedly failed these tests, that the USDA would shut the plant down because they obviously had an ongoing contamination problem. The meat and poultry associations immediately took the USDA to court. The courts basically said the USDA didn’t have the authority to shut down the plants. What it meant was that you could have a pound of meat or poultry products that is a petri dish of salmonella and the USDA really can’t do anything about it. A new law was introduced in direct response and this law became known as Kevin’s Law. It seems like such a clear-cut, common sense type thing.

Kowalcyk: We’ve been working for six years and it still hasn’t passed. I sense that there may be an opportunity– an enhanced opportunity– to get this signed into law this time. I think that from the standpoint of the consumer, a lot of people would support the idea of paying a little more if they could be guaranteed a higher standard of safety. that there are other players …that tend to worry about that, because it’s gonna be seen as an add-on to their costs. I think the advantage here is–

Kowalcyk: Sometimes it does feel like industry was more protected than my son. That’s what motivated me to become an advocate. In the past year alone, there have been a multitude of food-borne illness outbreaks which have resulted in significant losses. Clearly our current approach to food oversight and protection is not meeting the needs of American families. It’s really hard for me to tell Kevin’s story. But the only way I’m going to be able to prevent it from happening to other people is to go out there and speak about it. Yeah. Six are elementary school students, one is a sibling, and there’s another one in another county in Kentucky, so…

Kowalcyk: It will be seven years since my son died. All I wanted the company to do was say “We’re sorry. We produced this defective product that killed your child, and this is what we’re going to do to make sure it doesn’t happen again.” That’s all we wanted, and they couldn’t give us that.

Pollan: The industrial food system is always looking for greater efficiency, but each new step in efficiency leads to problems. If you take feedlot cattle off of their corn diet, give them grass for five days, they will shed 80% of the E. coli in their gut. But of course that’s not what the industry does. The industry’s approach is– when it has a systematic problem like that– is not to go back and see what’s wrong with the system, it’s to come up some high-tech fixes that allow the system to survive. Man: The 5×5 product surge tank– low level. Low level. (man speaks over radio)

Eldon Roth: This is our operations center. We control all of our plants from here. Where’s Chicago? Here’s Chicago, Georgia, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, L.A., Ohio. We control all levels of the gearboxes, the speed of motors– we can change those all from here. We built something that– from a food-safety standpoint, we think we’re ahead of everybody. We think we can lessen the incidents of E. coli 0157:h7. (beeps) But I just started working with ammonia and ammonia hydroxide. Ammonia kills bacteria, so it became a processing tool. I’m really a mechanic. That’s really what I am. We design our own machinery. (whirring)

Roth: This is our finished product. Man: Is your meat in most of the hamburgers in the country?

Roth: 70%. In five years, we think we’ll be in 100%. We do have some competitors. I think we’re gonna beat them. -

Roth: Again, it’s a marriage of science and technology. (man speaking over radio) I want dollar meal– …two chicken sandwich. – Man: Two small drinks, and give me a large Dr. Pepper. – $11.48. First window. Thank you. Maria Gonzalez: We didn’t even think about healthy eating because we used to think everything was healthy. Maria: Now that I know that the food is really unhealthy for us, I feel guilty giving it to my kids. But we don’t have time to cook because we leave at 6:00. We don’t get home until 9:00, 10:00 at night. When you have only a dollar to spend and you have two kids to feed, either you go to the market and try to find something that’s cheap or just go straight through a drive-thru and get two small hamburgers for them and “Okay, here. Eat them.” This is what’s gonna fill her up, not that one single item at the market. Look at the broccoli. It’s too expensive, man. First check to see how many are there for a pound. – Uh, we’re not getting it. You’d only get two or three. – Aww! Maria: We can find candy that’s cheaper. We can find chips that are cheaper. The sodas are really cheap. Sometimes you look at a vegetable and say “Okay, we can get two hamburgers over here for the same amount of price.”

Pollan: Why is it that you can buy a double-cheeseburger at McDonald’s for 99¡é, and you can’t even get a head of broccoli for 99¡é? – We’ve skewed our food system to the bad calories and it’s not an accident. I mean, the reasons that those calories are cheaper is because those are the ones we’re heavily subsidizing. And this is directly tied to the kind of agriculture that we’re practicing and the kind of farm policies we have. All those snack-food calories are the ones that come from the commodity crops– from the wheat, from the corn and from the soybeans. By making those calories really cheap, that’s one of the reasons that the biggest predictor of obesity is income level. Over the course of human history, we were struggling to make sure we had enough food and enough calories for a sizable percentage of the human race. Now the problem is too many calories. The industry blames obesity on a crisis of personal responsibility. But when you’re engineering foods you are pressing our evolutionary buttons. The fact is we’re hardwired to go for three tastes– salt, fat and sugar. These things are very rare in nature Now sugar is available 24/7 in tremendous quantities. We’re eating hundreds of pounds of the stuff a year. This diet of high-fructose corn syrup and refined carbohydrates leads to these spikes of insulin and, gradually, a wearing down of the system by which our body metabolizes sugar. Maria: My husband’s diabetic. One of my main concerns is he could lose his sight. He does get into– sometimes he’s shaking, so I’m afraid that he’s gonna start not being able to drive, ’cause that’s what he does for a profession. We have to consider his medicine. What is it, $70? 50 pills costs me about $130. Maria: But he’s on two different types of pills. $100-and-something for one pill and then $100- and-something for another. That takes a lot of our income away. We’re really tight from either paying for his medicine to be healthy or buying vegetables to be healthy. So which one should we do? It’s hard to see my dad suffer with diabetes and stuff like that. And it’s really sad to see that my sister might have it. There’s something that’s going on in the way that we live our lives, where we play, where we buy our food and the types of food that we’re able to buy that is causing this epidemic. It’s not just our community. It’s not just Baldwin Park. It’s everywhere. How many of us know one person in our family with diabetes? How about two? Three? Keep your hand– It used to be that type 2 diabetes only affected adults. And now it’s affecting children at epidemic proportions. (kids laughing) (birds chirping) (chickens clucking)

Joel Salatin: Everything we’ve done in modern industrial agriculture is to grow it faster, fatter, bigger, cheaper. Nobody’s thinking about E. coli, type 2 diabetes and the ecological health of the whole system. We’re outsourcing autonomous farmer decision making– we’re outsourcing that to corporate boardrooms in big cities 1,000 miles away where people make decisions and don’t live with the consequences of those decisions. (cows mooing) Everything is grass based. You know, they don’t eat corn, dead cows or chicken manure like they feed right here in the valley– or dead chickens. They actually eat grass, forage– you know, clover, grass, herbs. They’re herbivores. If they were eating corn, you’re gonna have to harvest that corn, transport that corn, then you’re gonna have to haul all that manure somewhere that comes out the back end. Here… it’s– there– there is the whole thing. I mean the cow is– she’s fertilizing. She’s mowing. We don’t have to spread any manure. We don’t have to harvest it– she’s harvesting it. It’s all real time– real solar dollars. The industrial food system gradually became so noisy, smelly, not a person-friendly place, that the people who operate those plants don’t want anybody to go there, because then people would see the ugly truth. When that occurred, then we lost all the integrity and all the accountability in the food system. If we put glass walls on all the megaprocessing facilities, we would have a different food system in this country. (knife zinging)

Salatin: We have allowed ourselves to become so disconnected and ignorant – …as the food that we eat. What a difference this is to be out here in the fresh air, sunshine, birds singing in the trees, you know? But you see, according to the U.S.D.A, this is unsanitary because it’s open to the air. They tried to close us down. One of the biggest showdowns we had was when they tried to close us down because this was unsanitary. Can you imagine? So we had them cultured at a local microbiology lab. Ours averaged 133 C.F.U. and the ones from the store averaged 3600. Of course, those have been through 40 trillion baths. Ours haven’t seen any chlorine. A lot of people wonder “Is this real? I mean, can you really feed the world?” That whole thing is such a specious argument because, yes, we’re every bit as efficient, especially if you plug in all of the inefficiencies of the industrial system. I’ve had people come up at farmer’s markets and say “What? $3 a dozen for eggs?” And they’re drinking a 75¡é can of soda. Hey, pig. Hey, piggles. (snorting)

Hey, pigs. I’m always struck by how successful we have been at hitting the bull’s-eye of the wrong target. I mean we have learned– for example, in cattle we have learned how to– how to plant, fertilize and harvest corn using global positioning satellite technology, and nobody sits back and asks “But should we be feeding cows corn?” We’ve become a culture of technicians. We’re all into– we’re all into the how of it and nobody’s stepping back and saying “But why?” (laughs) I mean, a culture that just views a pig as a pile of protoplasmic inanimate structure to be manipulated by whatever creative design that humans can foist on that critter will probably view individuals within its community and other cultures in the community of nations with the same type of disdain, disrespect and controlling-type mentality. (snorting)

Eduardo Pe?a: The town where the plant is located is a small town called Tar Heel in the middle of a very economically-depressed area. Smithfield has mastered the art of picking and choosing a workforce that they can exploit, initially from the local workforce– the poor whites, the poor black. They went through that workforce very quickly. Now they have to bus their workers all the way from Dentsville, South Carolina, to Clinton, North Carolina. You have to draw a circle 100 miles in diameter, and that’s where all of your workers are coming from. (people chatting)

Man: They have the same mentality towards workers as they do towards the hogs. (squealing) Man: You know, the hog, they don’t really have to worry about their comfort because they’re temporary. They’re gonna be killed. And they have the same viewpoint to the worker. You’re not worried about the longevity of the worker because, to them, everything has an end. Man: When you’ve got 2000 hogs an hour going through employees, because they’re handling these guts so much, they get infections in their fingernails and all. All their fingernails separate from their fingers. with blood, feces, urine. It’s easy to get hurt down there. Man: You’re doing that same movement for that same piece of the hog and it’s nonstop, you know. Basically you’re treated as a human machine. You get people that can’t afford to leave from out there, and Smithfield knows this. And that’s what they hold over you.

Schlosser: 100 years ago when Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle there was a beef trust that wielded enormous power. Immigrants from Eastern Europe were being abused in the absence of any kind of government regulation There were horrible disfiguring injuries and even deaths.

Pollan: Things got better. They slowly got better.

Schlosser: Teddy Roosevelt took on the beef trust. Labor unions slowly organized meatpacking workers and turned it into one of the best industrial jobs in the United States. By the 1950s to be a meatpacking worker was like being an auto worker who has a good wage, good benefits, pension. And then what happened? Well, the meat-packing companies got bigger in order to serve the needs of the fast-food industry, which was its biggest customer. Some of the meat-packing companies like IBP borrowed the same sort of labor practices from the fast food industry– cutting wages, making sure there were no unions, speeding up production, and having the worker do the same task again and again and again. And meat-packing is now one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States. The meat-packing industry also recruited a new set of immigrants– illegal immigrants and recent immigrants from Mexico. Many of the illegal immigrants coming to America were corn farmers in Mexico. NAFTA led to a flooding of the Mexican market with cheap American corn. It’s put more than a million and a half Mexican farmers out of work. They couldn’t compete with this cheap corn coming from America. (yelling)

Pollan: So what happens to those million and a half Mexican farmers?

Schlosser: Meat packers like IBP, National Beef and Monfort began actively recruiting in Mexico. Companies advertised on the radio and in newspapers. IBP set up a bus service in Mexico to bring workers into the United States. For years the government turned a blind eye to the recruitment of immigrants by the meat-packing industry. But now, when there’s an anti-immigrant movement, they’re cracking down all of a sudden, but they’re not cracking down on these companies. The government’s cracking down on the workers. (clears throat) Pe?a: Immigration agents are arresting Smithfield workers Pe?a: This is an agreement between Smithfield and Immigrations authorities. They get rid of 15 workers per day, but you don’t see any massive raids. That way it doesn’t affect the production line. – Sir, we are trying– She is asking us questions, not you. I don’t see anybody arresting no Smithfield managers. Nobody in the plant that had anything to do with the fact that those workers were hired is being arrested. What we see today is workers who were producing for this company and working hard– those are the people who get arrested. (man yelling in Spanish) Pe?a: We want to pay the cheapest price for our food. We don’t understand that that comes at a price. These workers, they’ve been here for 10, 15 years processing your bacon, your holiday ham and now they’re getting picked up like they’re criminals. (car starts) And these companies are making billions of dollars.

Salatin: Is cheapness everything that there is? Who wants to buy the cheapest car? We’re willing to subsidize the food system to create the “mystique” of cheap food, when actually it’s very expensive food when you add up the environmental costs societal costs, health costs. The industrial food is not honest food. It’s not priced honestly. It’s not produced honestly. It’s not processed honestly. There’s nothing honest about that food. I can’t think of a better use for a Smithfield box. Man: It was about a five-hour drive maybe 300, 400 miles. So yeah. It’s worth it.

Salatin: I have no desire to scale up or get bigger. My desire is to produce the best food in the world and heal. And if in doing so more people come to our corner and want stuff, then heaven help me figure out how to meet the need without compromising the integrity. That– that’s where I am. I have absolutely no desire to be at Wal-Mart. As soon as you grasp for that growth, you’re gonna view your customer differently, you’re gonna view your product differently, you’re gonna view your business differently. You’re gonna view everything that is the most important– you’re gonna view that differently. (snorting) (people chatting) This is our new organic line of popcorn. This is Vitasoy soy milk, the best soy milk in the entire world. This entire show when it first started was the size of this column right here.

Man: Uh-huh. Several of us were sleeping in our booths. We couldn’t afford hotel rooms. Organic’s been growing over 20% annually. It’s one of the fastest-growing segments in the food industry. My God! Ah! We’re not gonna get rid of capitalism. Certainly we’re not gonna get rid of it in the time that we need to arrest global warming and reverse the toxification of our air, our food and our water. We need to be much more urgent. If we attempt to make perfect the enemy of the good and say we’re only going to buy food from the most-perfect system within 100 miles of us, we’re never gonna get there. As an environmentalist, it was pretty clear to me that business was the source of all the pollution, business was the source of basically all the things that were destroying this world. In college I came across this little institute called New Alchemy Institute, which was a group of renegade biologists. My hope is to give you–

Hirshberg: We were preaching a kind of a new religion, trying to develop food and waste-treatment alternatives, but we were preaching to the convinced. We were depending on sources of support that were dried up and we weren’t reaching the audience that really needed these messages. I realized we need to not be David up against Goliath. We need to be Goliath. (clacking)

Hirshberg: When we started out, we were a seven-cow farm. We wanted to prove that business could be part of the solution to the globe’s environmental problems. At the same time we had to prove that we could be highly profitable. Today in 2008, not only are in America, but we’re among the most profitable. See, this is the interesting thing. A little company like this is now Kraft, but you don’t have any idea that it’s Kraft. This is now Pepsi. That’s now Kellogg’s. – Man: Kashi is Kellogg’s? Yeah, this is one of those companies that started like us. – Well, it’s– Make them successful, basically. The jury is out. I have to put it that way.

Hirshberg: These large companies don’t grow organically. They grow by acquisition. Coke, Pepsi, Kellogg’s, General Mills– all of them are running, not walking, into the organic food business.

Hirshberg: For me, when a Wal-Mart enters the organic space, I’m thrilled. It’s absolutely one of the most exciting things. I have dreamed of the day when I could sit with corporate titans and have conversations about organics and sustainability. – Hi Amanda. I’m Rand. Okay, help me figure out where– – You’re with Wal-Mart. Yup. Do you know that we don’t go to Wal-Mart? – We’ve never been. – Isn’t that amazing? Yeah, we’ve never been. We just started boycotting a long time ago and we just kept riding on that.

Hirshberg: Wal-Mart is terribly sensitive to their reputation. They’ve obviously been vilified, probably more than any retailer in our current economy. Actually, it’s a pretty easy decision to try to support things like organic, or whatever it might be, based on what the customer wants. We see that and react to it. So if it’s clear the customer wants it, it’s really easy to get behind it, to push forward and try to make that happen.

Hirshberg: When I run into my old environmental friends, many are initially horrified by the kinds of company that I’m keeping these days. But when I then go on to explain what the impact of one purchase order from Wal-Mart is, in terms of not pounds but tons of pesticide, tons of herbicide, tons of chemical fertilizer, the discussion– we get away from the emotion and we get down to the facts. This is really key, though, what you guys are doing here. I have no illusions about this. I don’t believe that Wal-Mart has come here because they’ve suddenly had a moral enlightenment. It’s because of economics. I can debate with my radical friends all day long, but nobody can challenge the fact that a sale of another million dollars to Wal-Mart helps to save the world.

Pollan: Back around the turn of the last century, the average farmer could feed six or eight people. Now the average American farmer can feed 126 people, okay? These are the most productive humans that have ever lived. The changes down on the farm have been momentous and radical but invisible to most of us, ’cause who knows a farmer anymore? But their way of life has been revolutionized. Roush: 10,000 years ago, farmers started saving their best seeds and planted again in the following year. That’s how seeds have been developed. That’s how corn was developed from a useless grass for the most part to the extremely productive plant it is today.

Pollan: The idea that any corporation could own a food crop is a very new idea. It wasn’t until the 1980s that the Supreme Court said you could patent life. And that opened the floodgates– efforts to patent the most valuable parts of life, which is to say the crops on which we depend.

Roush: Monsanto is a chemical company. They produced DDT, Agent Orange in Vietnam, and then they developed a product called “Roundup.” We started hearing rumblings about genetically-engineered soybeans that could resist the application of Roundup. When the Roundup was sprayed over top of it, it killed every weed out there except for this Roundup Ready soybean.

Roush: I can remember when the first prohibition against seed saving came into being. Most farmers were just absolutely disgusted with the whole concept. It’s been interesting over the course of 11 years to watch us go from utter contempt for the notion that we can’t save our own seed to acceptance. Man: What happens if a farmer saves the seeds? (chuckles) Well, you know, really there’s only one company involved in this now and that’s Monsanto. Monsanto is… They’ve got a team of private investigators that kind of roam the country and they’ve got a little 1-800 hotline they take calls on. If they get a call and somebody alleges that somebody saved seed, they’ll send an investigator out to look into the matter. If you save your own seed, you’re gonna get a call from somebody from Monsanto. David Runyon: Two men drove in my driveway at 7:00, 7:30 at night, presented a black card to me and they never told me that they were from Monsanto. Man: They said that they had had a surveillance team, caught me cleaning beans. Moe Parr: I found it necessary to get up at 3:00 and 4:00 in the morning before the investigators are on the road following me.

Runyon: They were– I’m gonna say maybe ex-military or ex-police. They were large and they were intimidating. Man: I don’t know whether they had their surveillance team or whether it was my neighbor that turned me in. I don’t know. Now as I turned to walk in the house, one of them said– I could hear in the back– He’s guilty.

Runyon: It’s a real ingenious device designed back in the 1800s, and Monsanto’s gonna close all of them out. So how many seed cleaners are out there in the country do you think? In the state of Indiana, there may be six. Maybe. I’m not aware of– Have they all been put out of business? There’s nobody left.

Runyon: When Monsanto soybeans first came on the market, I just never really switched over. I was getting pretty good yield with the conventional soybeans I’d been using, so I thought “Well, I’ll just stay where I’m at.” My neighbors all around me are all GMOs. If the pollen goes in, if the seed moves in, I am still held accountable. Pollan: When you genetically modify a crop, you own it. We’ve never had this in agriculture.

Roush: Used to be that your land-grant universities, they developed what was called public seed. The vast majority of the plant breeding was actually done in these public institutions Pollan: Monsanto is very much like Microsoft. The same way Microsoft owns the intellectual property behind most computers in America, they set out to own the intellectual property behind most of the food in America.

Roush: Public plant breeding is a thing of the past. There virtually are no public seeds anymore. Runyon: There’s only like four or five varieties that I can actually plant. Now I have some of the last soybeans coming out of the state of Illinois– When it comes to the point that I can’t buy any more certified seed, what do I do? What are my options? I acquired this list that was mailed to me. The black list here is Monsanto’s unauthorized growers list. Wow. Either farmers that have judgments against them, or businesses, or else it’s– or it’s farmers that have not submitted their paperwork, will not turn over their records. For my case, that’s why I’m on there– ’cause I would not turn over my records. Wow. I see two of the farmers that I work for on here. This list– now it comes down to the point where I cannot buy Monsanto products, okay? Right. So it’s coming down to What can I plant? Parr: Monsanto is suing me on the basis that I’m encouraging the farmer to break the patent law by cleaning their own seed. I haven’t been in a courtroom yet and my bill is already $25,000. People that were friends of mine now are reticent to even talk with me. We’ve been friends for 50 years, and now we can hardly be seen together. Right. I don’t think I’m really guilty, but it was cheaper to pay the fine than it was to try to fight it. …because if you think you’re right at something, but yet you admit you’re wrong.

Roush: Monsanto falsely accused us of violating their patent and breach of contract. None of it was true. You go into a market, you find a dominant farmer and if you can ruin them, you scare the rest of them to following the line. My family spent $400,000 fighting the battle, pretrial. And we were told it would take another million to take the thing to trial. We settled out of court. The way the system appeared to work to me was Lady Justice had the scales and you piled cash on the scales and the one that piled the most cash on the scales, hired the most experts and was most willing to tell the biggest lies, that was the winner. That seems to be how our justice system functions now. It’s terrible. It’s terrible. How can a farmer defend himself against a multinational corporation like Monsanto? I talked to a young man just three days ago. They’d been to his farm, you know? And this poor kid, he’s just starting out. His fianc¨¦e was there. I talked to her and tried to give them the best advice I could. Unfortunately the best advice I could give them was “Try to get out of this thing with your skin intact. Don’t fight ‘em. You’ve got to roll over and give them what they want, ’cause you can’t defend yourself.” In the case of Monsanto, their control is so dominant. If you want to be in production agriculture, you’re gonna be in bed with Monsanto. They own the soybean. They are going to control that product from seed to the supermarket. They are, in effect, gaining control of food.

Pollan: There has been this revolving door between Monsanto’s corporate offices and the various regulatory and judicial bodies that have made the key decisions.

Roush: Justice Clarence Thomas was a Monsanto attorney. That wouldn’t be such a big deal if it weren’t for one court case that really decided this whole seed-saving issue. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion in a case that allowed these companies to prevent farmers from saving their own seed. Pollan: Monsanto had very close ties to the Bush administration… and the Clinton administration. This goes to why we haven’t had much political debate over this radical change to our food system.

Pollan: For the last 25 years, our government has been dominated by the industries that it was meant to be regulating.

Schlosser: The challenge is as soon as you have people with expertise in industry, they may turn out to be very good regulators. It’s really about what interests they decide to represent. You’re talking about power– centralized power and that power is being used against the people who are really producing the food like the farmers. It’s being used against the workers who work for these companies and it’s being used against consumers who are deliberately being kept in the dark about what they’re eating, where it comes from and what it’s doing to their bodies. (kids laughing)

Woman: Good afternoon, Madame Chair and members. SB-63 is a consumer right-to-know measure. It simply requires that all foods that are cloned must be labeled as cloned foods. These cloned animals are a fundamentally new thing. But I find it incredible that the FDA not only wants to allow the sale of meat from cloned animals without further research, but also wants to allow the sale of this meat without any labeling. How many witnesses in opposition, please? Noelle Cremers with California Farm Bureau. And if I can point out– the reason that we are concerned with labeling is it creates unnecessary fear in a consumer’s mind. Until the industry has an opportunity to educate why we want to use this technology and the value of the technology, we don’t feel that consumers just having a warning label will help them. (chatting)

Pollan: These companies fight tooth and nail against labeling. The fast food industry fought against giving you the calorie information. They fought against telling you if there’s trans fat in their food. The meat packing industry for years prevented country-of-origin labeling. They fought not to label genetically modified foods, and now 78% of the processed food in the supermarket has some genetically- modified ingredient. I think it’s one of the most important battles for consumers to fight– is the right to know what’s in their food and how it was grown. Not only do they not want you to know what’s in it, they have managed to make it against the law to criticize their products. Man: Can you tell me how you’ve changed how you eat? Yeah, we– you’ll probably have to talk to an attorney before you would put this in there. What? You can say this is– we’ve stopped– I know, but– I could have the meat and poultry industry coming after me and I really– Seriously? For saying– that it’s so– It depends on the context. You’re not saying Someone else don’t eat it. Yeah, I’m sorry, Robbie, but I get asked this all the time. Initially, my reaction was “I don’t care. Let them sue me. Let them try and sue the mother of a dead child and see.” It’s pretty amazing that you can’t say – how you and your family have changed– (stammers) are different. The food industry has different protections than other industries do. We have a lot of questions about this mad cow disease.

Kowalcyk: If you recall the case where Oprah was sued by the meat industry for something she said on her show. It has just stopped me cold from eating another burger. – Good morning, y’all. it’s finally winding down? Well, I think I can say that, right? I can say that, yeah. I can see the end in sight.

Schlosser: In Colorado it’s a felony if you’re convicted under a veggie libel law. So you could go to prison for criticizing the ground beef that’s being produced in the state of Colorado. There is an effort in several farm states to make it illegal to publish a photo of any industrial food operation, any feedlot operation.

Schlosser: At the same time, they’ve also gotten bills passed that are called cheeseburger bills that make it very very difficult for you to sue them. These companies have legions of attorneys and they may sue even though they know they can’t win just to send a message. Man: We are on record for the deposition of Maurice Parr in the matter of Monsanto Company and Monsanto Technology versus Maurice Parr. your bank records in this case. Do you know that? Parr: I’ll tell you, what really scared me the most today was the fact that they have every check that I have written from every bank account that I’ve used in the last 10 years. Mr. Parr? Three. this Dell computer? Which ones are soybean seed cleaning customers? Parr: These people are not just customers, they’re personal friends. It’s extremely heart-wrenching for me to know that this list is in the possession of Monsanto. Harold Sinn? Beans only. Stephen Pennell: This is the first case in which a seed company is suing the person who does the cleaning of the seed. So if Monsanto’s claims are upheld in this case, that would not only put Moe out of business, but it would prohibit every grower in the country from doing what Moe does as a precedent in future cases. Have any of these customers specifically told you that they are not going to use Parr’s voice: This essentially puts me out of business. – Parr’s voice: I’m finished. Jerry Kaufman. Bill Zeering. Robert Duvall.

Pollan: We’ve had a food system that’s been dedicated to the single virtue of efficiency, so we grow a very small number of crops, a very small number of varieties, a very small number of companies. And even though you achieve efficiencies, the system gets more and more precarious. You will have a breakdown eventually. And where the breakdown comes in the system we don’t always know.

Roush: Modern production agriculture is highly dependent on large amounts of petroleum. Our farm, we’re going to use about 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel a year.

Pollan: We eat a lot of oil without knowing it. To bring a steer to slaughter, it’s 75 gallons of oil. So what we’re seeing is that this highly-efficient machine does not have the resilience to deal with shocks such as the spike in oil prices. Food prices last month were 3.9% higher than they were a year ago. Take corn, another basic source of food, up to a 12-year high.

Pollan: For a while, we could sell grains so cheaply anywhere in the world, farmers in other countries who aren’t being subsidized could not compete with us. So their capacity to grow food for themselves was compromised.

Roush: The world’s running out of food and nobody’s talking about it. We have no reserves. Man: There have been protests around the world. The food crisis has already brought down one government.

Pollan: A month doesn’t go by where there isn’t a story in the news that peels back the curtain on how that industrial food is made. (mooing pitifully) Man: Downer cows– too ill or lame to walk– being brutalized to get them to their feet for slaughter. Woman: Millions of gallons of concentrated hog manure flushing their contents downriver. Government’s food czar reported that there are no tools in place to track the origin of the latest salmonella outbreak.

Pollan: Every time one of these stories comes out, America learns a little bit more– what’s going on in the kitchen where their food is being prepared. And every time they turn away in revulsion and start looking for alternatives.

Hirshberg: The irony is that the average consumer does not feel very powerful. They think they are the recipients of whatever industry has put out there for them to consume. Trust me, it’s the exact opposite. When we run an item past the supermarket scanner, we’re voting for local or not, organic or not. At Wal-Mart, we made a decision about a year ago to go through a process of becoming rBST-free in our milk supply. We made that decision based on customer preference.

Hirshberg: Individual consumers changed the biggest company on earth and in so doing, probably put the last nail in the coffin for synthetic growth hormone.

Pollan: To eat well in this country costs more than to eat badly. It will take more money and some people simply don’t have it. And that’s one of the reasons that we need changes at the policy level, so that the carrots are a better deal than the chips.

Schlosser: People think “These companies are so big and so powerful, how are we ever going to change things?” But look at the tobacco industry. It had huge control over public policy and that control was broken. The battle against tobacco is a perfect model of how an industry’s irresponsible behavior can be changed. (people talking)

Salatin: Imagine what it would be if, as a national policy, we said we would be only successful if we had fewer people going to the hospital next year than last year. How about that for success? The idea then would be to have such nutritionally dense unadulterated food that people who ate it actually felt better, had more energy, and weren’t sick as much. Now see, that’s a noble goal.

Kowalcyk: I can’t change the fact that Kevin’s dead. When you tell somebody you’ve lost a child, I really don’t like that look of pity that comes into their eyes, that they feel sorry for me. I can have a pity party all by myself very well, thank you. I don’t need it from other people. What I need them to do is listen and help me effect a change. Roush: You have to understand that we farmers, we’re gonna deliver to the marketplace what the marketplace demands. If you want to buy $2 milk, you’re gonna get a feedlot in the backyard. It’s that simple. People have got to start demanding good, wholesome food of us. And we’ll deliver. I promise you. We’re very ingenious people. We’ll deliver. That’s all I had to say. (“This Land is Your Land” playing) (audience cheering)

When I rode that ribbon highway

I saw above me

The endless skyway

I saw below me

The golden valley

Well, this land was made for you and me

I roamed and rambled

I followed my footsteps

Through the sparkling sands of

Her diamond deserts

And all around me

A voice was calling

It said “This land was made for you and me”

This land is your land

This land is my land

From California

To the New York island

From the redwood forests

To the Gulf Stream waters

Well, this land was made for you and me

Now the sun came shining

And I was strolling

Through wheat fields waving

And dust clouds rolling

And a voice was sounding

As the fog was lifting

It said “This land was made for you and me”

This land is your land

This land is my land

From California

To the New York islands

From the redwood forest

To the Gulf Stream waters

Oh, this land was made for you and me.

Crowded hallways are the loneliest places
For outcasts and rebels
Or anyone who just dares to be different
And you've been trying for so long
To find out where your place is
But in their narrow minds
There's no room for anyone who dares to do something different
Oh, but listen for a minute

Was sticks and stones
Those words cut deep, but they don't mean you're all alone
And you're not invisible

Someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be invisible
Oh, invisible

So your confidence is quiet
To them, quiet looks like weakness
But you don't have to fight it
'Cause you're strong enough to win without a war
Every heart has a rhythm
Let yours beat out so loudly
That everyone can hear it
Yeah, I promise you don't need to hide it anymore
Oh, and never be afraid of doing something different
Dare to be something more

And here's to anyone who's ever felt invisible

You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you’re moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 2]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin’ bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You're far from the usual, far from the usual

You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart

Remember them high school days
Friday nights, homecomin' dances

About anything and everything
Making me feel young again like ain't a damn thing changed
Ain't a damn thing changed

Makes me want to sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window

Get the butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence

I thought them feelings was long gone baby
But you take me back in time
Just like spring break in Panama City
The girl from Indiana sure was pretty
But she sure ain't got nothing on you tonight
Because you're like the summer loving don't come or go
Never had to say goodbye
I wake up in the morning feeling like the first kiss
Every time your lips touch mine

Makes me want to sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll until the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that backseat

Where it all began

It was 102

You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool

327,John Doe,"[Intro: Priscilla Renea]
Seems like your heart stops workin'
The minute they close the curtain
You take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're
Taking a smoke break, you
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doin'
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just 'cause you got somewhere to go, so
You take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've
Got a prescription, you
Got an addiction
Who do you think that you're foolin'?

Maybe you could come back home

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Ah
Errybody's addicted to somethin'
Errybody got a grip onto somethin'
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or somethin' to find
You struggle in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
The people that you work with notice the signs
When you walk in the room it gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence
You say you've been at the gym
But the way that you look, can't blame on the diet
So what you hidin'?

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah
I probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to dro...
I mean, had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up with me 'cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her ""Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slipped and fell, clumsy me!""
Well at least I admit it
'Cause the worst you could do is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it
Well I ain't no different, I love all the money, the fame and the parties with beautiful women
I spent so much time as a underground artist 'cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge you become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn, when they pivot and change your perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dyin' and wishin' to live and experience everything possible
When I told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical, now I can see it, it's optical

And she’s still here and now he’s gone

Its rusty strings across the top
It probably don’t look like much to you
But these dents and scratches in the wood

[Verse 1: Prada West]
Some people ask me why is that I smoke weed?
Whyyy, whyyy, whyyy?
I roll trees and I hold green, I'm gettin' high
Get high and I fold leafs, let's take a hit
Take hits and catch a slow lean
I move in slow motion
And this is what I tell 'em
I stay 'cause days fly and so you can always smell it
Hahaha, it's nothin' new to me
The way she makes me feel because I love what she do to me
With all games aside if it all came to pride
My need for weed is real indeed, so I cannot subside
I fiend for chronic smoke, and man I wanna talk
So stuff a bit of green in the sweet and then I bong the roach
I'm twistin' 'em up, put to reapin' the blunts and take a quick pull
Have a sip of the rum while I'm smoke a 'piff on the run I'm like a pit bull
But ridin' high on cloud nine, worked my way from ground up
But still ain't seem to find mine

[Hook: Prada West and Merkules]
If you feel like gettin' high to night
Put your blunts in the sky to night
Ride by and roll smokin', smokin'
Ride by and roll smokin', smokin', smokin'
If you feel like gettin' high to night
Put your blunts it the sky to night
Ride by and roll smokin, smokin', smokin'

[Verse 2: Merkules]
See me blowin' out smoke, playin' XBox
Eyes on the screen 'cause I'm for goin' for a headshot
On tour, still snorin' 'till the next stop
But by the pound, just chillin' in some fresh socks
Every cop is another archenemy
Still smokin' pot, layin' Free Marc Emery
Every hustler and weed-man knows me
I reup on trees like I reup on groceries
It's a hobby, homie, this shit is a life-style
I'm even smokin' on a big dutch right now
While I'm writin' this, mah life in the song
Nonetheless get stressed, so I light up the bong
Look, take a hit and just get used to the high
Find a go-go with it, you can shoot for the sky
I get high, that's how I choose to get by
It's that sherri shit, Stopmdown, Suitable Ties, ha

[Hook: Prada West and Merkules]
If you feel like gettin' high to night
Put your blunts in the sky to night
Ride by and roll smokin', smokin'
Ride by and roll smokin', smokin', smokin'
If you feel like gettin' high to night
Put your blunts it the sky to night
Ride by and roll smokin, smokin', smokin'

[Verse 3: Konfidental]
I'm so high, my eyes are barely open
Thick gray haze in the air that we smokin'
I guess it's that I'm just a deep space burn now
So give room 'cause I need space on Merk's coach

And I done seen me slidin' out my dope ride
I open up the doors, suicide
I came from the bottom, the sewer side
I made it to the top cause I do it fly
Feelin' fuckin' lucky like the fuckin' Irish
I see the whole game from my third iris
I tour the whole word like a dirty pirate
To give the whole club some Miley Cyrus

[Verse 3: Miley Cyrus]
Now everybody trippin' like they poppin' molly
Up in the club, is where you'll find me
I do it real big never do it tiny

Smoke joints till our eyes turn Indian red
Takes shots till our chests burn

The bigger the bill, the bigger you ball
The bigger the watch, the bigger the car, the bigger the star
The bigger the chain, the farther you go, you already know
The bigger the bank, that's more hoes, nigga

Coppin' them old schools and puttin' foreigns on the road

Envy is a sign of admiration
Hate: It’s the epitome of destruction

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Tal parece que mi amor crece y crece, pero tú desvaneces
Y  me ofreces tu amistad sin otra excepción
Sé que hay otro hombre que ha logrado lo que yo jamás a ti te di
Un hogar, una familia, un buen porvenir; perdón por hacerte daño

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Verso 2: Drake, Drake & Romeo Santos, Romeo Santos]
Celo sus besos sobre tu cuerpo
La envidia se apodera así de mí y te quiero aquí
Odio ese hombre porque está a tu lado
Perdí tu amor, soy un pobre diablo
Sin tu amor yo no soy nada, nada

No you, you look like Bernice and Yaris

Look don't worry about it, keep speakin' Spanish
I'll get it translated, you know you my baby

I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house, so I live with you baby

I really go crazy

Sitting on them M's like Floyd
But she lied to you if she said I paid for it
Nigga 99 broads, 99 broads
Panoramic view from the 99th floor
I'm like 'my Lord' when she down on all fours
Got a hood bitch with me, she ain't scared of taking charge
Flying by in a car, you ain't know what you saw
She adjusting her bra as I’m lighting up a cigar
They was writing me off, now I arrive like a star
I just sit back and laugh the irony of it all
Let them bands go, let them bands go
Watch a nigga throw a grand or so on that camel toe
And be like 'Damn boy, why you cuffing that whore?'
The whole team smashed her and you ain't even know

I ain't even know it, even know it

All my life has been a series of doors in my face

I fell for you, like autumn leaves

349,Brave,"[Produced by Mark Endert]

[Verse 1]
You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle ‘neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

[Verse 2]
Everybody’s been there
Everybody’s been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
Don’t run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days, you can let the light in
And show me, how big your brave is

[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

[Bridge]
And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

Destroy everything
They bring down angels like you

Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can’t do

357,Can't Raise A Man,"[Verse 1]
He got older but never grew
For his life he can't tell the truth
How to love he ain't got a clue
Playing games like he'll never lose you
Try to talk to him can't get through
Every day he's a different dude
These are the signs of a grown ass boy
Better run for the hills I'm just trying to keep it real

[Chorus]
You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
Cause you can't raise a man

[Verse 2]
Coming home any time at night
Expecting you to let it ride
How many tears are you gonna cry?
Playing games like he'll never lose you
You know that the love is changed
How many times he called you out your name?
These are the signs of a grown ass boy
Better run for the hills I'm just keeping it real

[Chorus]
You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
Cause you can't raise a man

[Bridge]
Gonna take more than a miracle
To change him just let him go
Tell me when will you decide
To do better with your life?
If his momma couldn't do it, what makes you think
You can train a boy to be a man? It's too late
Better off letting him go
No matter how hard you try, you can't raise

[Chorus]
You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody

Cause for all we know
We might be dead by tomorrow

I can't go on wasting my time
Adding scars to my heart
Cause all I hear is ""I'm not ready enough""

And I can tell that you didn't have
To face your mother losing her lover
Without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
Cause she didn't have time

I don't want to judge what's in your heart
But if you're not ready for love
How can you be ready for life?
How can you be ready for life?

So let's love fully and let's love loud
And let's love now
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die

One thing I ask of you
Lemme be the one you back that ass up to
From Malibu to Paris, boo
Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I'm just watching and waitin'
For you to salute the true big pimpin'
Not many women can refuse this pimping
I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, this pimpin'

I've been born again, I've been born again
In His spirit, and His name, I'm sanctified!
Lord I testify, he's right by my side
I believe it be, His word is so clear to me
Yeah, yeah

All I want's a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch

Plus that paper chasin', it had turned me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established

Niggas be lovin' the old Ye, they sayin' the new Ye, that nigga be spazzin'
But when Ali turn up and be Ali, you can't ever change that nigga back to Cassius
So you can gon' and make up lies, but I'm so sanctified
I don't sweat it, wipe my forehead with a handkerchief
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus (Ross grunt)
People sayin', ""Ye we need another Yeezus"" (Ross grunt)
Lames try to tell me, ""Cut the wildin' out, out""
But who the fuck is you reachin'?
Pass me 30 bottles, champagne procession
That's that Holy water, sanctified refreshments
God sent me a message, said I'm too aggressive

All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Now I want two hundred and ménage in my palace

Somewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice

But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement  just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum
I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you

Okay, now you're talkin' my language

And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'Bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze

Did you put there with a magic marker
For years I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away

The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises: we'll always win at this
I don't ever think about death
It's all right if you do, it's fine
We gladiate, but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain:
""Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?""
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means

You could try and take us
But we're the gladiators

She's been locked up inside her apartment 100 days
She says ""Yeah, he's still coming, just a little bit late
He got stuck at the laundromat washing his cape""
She's just watching the clouds roll by and they spell her name
Like Lois Lane
And she smiles, oh, the way she smiles

She's out on the corner trying to catch a glimpse
Nothing's making sense
She's been chasing an answer
A sign lost in the abyss, this Metropolis
She says ""Yeah, he's still coming, just a little bit late
He got stuck at the Five and Dime saving the day
She says, ""If life was a movie, then it wouldn't end like this
Left without a kiss""

You bite your friends like chocolate

371,Chillin' It,"[Chorus]

Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby

[Verse 1]
Little sun left to burn in the blue sky
Shinin' off the cross hangin' from the mirror of my ride
Breeze blowin' in, your hair blowin' round
You're scanning through the stations lookin' for that country sound
The good stuff iced up in the back seat
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be

[Chorus 2]
I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it

Girl you so fine, I wouldn't mind if this is all we did
You got me high on kisses
You got me missin' signs
Hard lookin' left when my world is on my right

372,Rap God,"[Intro]
""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings.""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance."" (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it."" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.""
""You are just what the doc ordered.""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

Kneel before General Zod

So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",Eminem,Eminem,2014,"[67, 58, 59, 58, 55, 53, 51, 46, 46, 33, 38]",11

Rocks, clocks, and socks, they’re awesome
Figs, and jigs, and twigs, that’s awesome
Everything you see or think or say is awesome

376,The Heart Of Dixie,"(Verse 1)
She had a dead-end job at the National Bank
And a deadbeat husband who always drank
So when he didn't come home she had the gin to thank
For the tears in her eyes
So Dixie packed up and said her goodbyes and she went

(Chorus)
Driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

(Verse 2)
It's a funny thing when your world falls down
It's got a way of showing you what you're all about
Now Dixie's got her wheels pointed south
And she ain't never looking back
Nobody knew she was brave like that and she went

(Chorus)
Driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

(Bridge)
Yeah Dixie woke up to the truth one day
Grabbed her cheap sunglasses and her lipstick case and she went

(Chorus)
Driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

(Outro)

She'll make her mind up just to change it
The kind of girl that keeps you waitin', waitin' around
She likes to get her toes done bright red
She's always reapplying her lipstick
The muddy river bank shes the first in and last out
She's got something I can't figure out
That everybody's talking about

Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night

And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want I want whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got

Tell your mind before you thought it
What you thought your plan was park it
To figure out where your heart is so twisted up
Have you spendin' every weekend
And every penny you've been keepin'
Just to figure out what she's thinkin' when you're thinkin' it's love

But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit

Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us

Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us

Just to see am I finished

Mothafucka, I done growed up

I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me

Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

387,White Walls,"[Intro: Macklemore]
I wanna be free
I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (that’s what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Can’t see me through my tints (nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain’t got 24s (nuh-uh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y’all mad
30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Man, I’m lounging
In some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking, bucking them out here
I’m looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, there’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in as I was leaving I started screaming

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Driving smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished

391,Explosions,"[Verse 1]
You trembled like you'd seen a ghost
And I gave in
I lacked the things you need the most
You said, ""Where have you been?""
You wasted all that sweetness to run and hide
I wonder why
I remind you of the days you poured your heart into
But you never tried
I've fallen from grace
Took a blow to my face
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost

[Chorus]
Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same
It will never be the same

[Verse 2]
You left my soul bleeding in the dark
So you could be king, ah
The rules you set are still untold to me
And I've lost my faith in everything
The nights you could cope
Your intentions were gold
But the mountains will shake
I need to know I can still make

[Chorus]
Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same
It will never be the same

[Bridge]
And as the floods move in
And your body starts to sink
I was the last thing on your mind
I know you better than you think
Because it's simple, darling, I gave you a warning
Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces
So watch them fall with you, in slow motion
I pray that you will find peace of mind
And I'll find you another time
I'll love you, another time

Needing somebody and you've learned

Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me

She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing, Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Truu)

Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, ""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I'm bigging up my chest, y'all keep talking 'bout who next
But I'm about as big as it gets, I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle

I'm finna do what I didn't do and still waking up like the rent's due

And to them hoes I'm everything, everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth
Load the nine, leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it, niggas still hating but it ain't working

But they'll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one

[Verse 2]
If you can't lose the weight, then you're just fat
But if you lose too much, then you're on crack
You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
So, you might as well just do whatever you want

[Chorus]
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

[Verse 3]
If you don't go to church, you'll go to Hell
If you're the first one on the front row, you're a self-righteous son of a...
Can't win for losin', you'll just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em don't mean you should join 'em

[Chorus]
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

[Bridge]
Say what you think, love who you love
'Cause you just get so many trips around the sun
Yeah, you only...
Only live once

[Chorus]
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's what you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, I would
And follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points",Kacey Musgraves,Kacey Musgraves,2014,[60],1
398,m.A.A.d City,"[Part 1: Produced by Sounwave]

[Bridge]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear

[ScHoolBoy Q]
""YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!""

[Hook]
""Man down, where you from, nigga?""
""Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?""
""Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?""
""This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga""

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine,Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's, ""Aye y'all, duck""
That's what momma said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city

[Hook]
""Man down, where you from, nigga?""
""Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?""
""Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?""

[Intro: MC Eiht]
Wake your punk ass up! It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. Real simple and plain, I'mma teach you some lessons about the street. Hood. It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. How we do

[Verse 2]
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month, and ended up leaving
In fact, I got fired
Cause I was inspired
By all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up
Gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking
The next weekend
We broke even
I made allegiance
That made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons
But still won't ever know my life
Kendrick, A.K.A. ""Compton's human sacrifice""

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed. Niggas been mixing shit since the 80's, loc. Sherm sticks, butt nakeds. Dip, make a nigga flip. Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit. One time's crooked and shit. Block a nigga in. Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of I.V.s with the fucking spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grands where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4]
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor, instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage, kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what

[Scratches]

[Skit]
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn! You ain't the one that got fucked up, what you holding it for? Niggas always acting unsensitive and shit

399,A Man Who Was Gonna Die Young,"[Verse 1]
I like fast cars and sharp dreams
Chased a lot of crazy things
Left behind my share of broken pieces
This morning I turned 36
When you just remember half of it
You wonder how you outlived Hank and Jesus

[Chorus]
I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder
But you kept me from goin' under
When that current got too heavy
I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
In a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy
Fear, I've had none
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young

[Verse 2]
In the mirror I saw my surprise
Who knew gray hairs liked to hide on a head
That didn't think he'd live past thirty
If I make it thirty more
It's the brown that you'll be looking for
As you run your fingers through it and say
""Slow down, honey.""

[Chorus]
I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder
But you kept me from goin' under
When that current got too heavy
I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
In a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy
Fear, I've had none
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young

[Verse 3]
Call it intuition, or call it crazy
Just thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies
But I'll gladly stick around if we're together
So baby, when you bow your head tonight
Could you tell the Lord I've changed my mind?
And with you I'd like to live forever",Eric Church,Eric Church,2014,[89],1
400,Don't Let Me Be Lonely,"[Verse 1]
I need a saving grace
A hiding place
I don't have forever or time to waste
So don't let me be lonely
I wanna shake this winter coat off my sleeve
Dust off a record and just be free
Oh, don't let me be lonely
No, don't let me be lonely

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're young
You can fly
But we trip on clouds 'cause we get too high
And we grow up
And then it's gone
Oh God only knows what we'll become

[Chorus]
So don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh, don't let me, let me be lonely
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, the night rolls on like a long lost friend
'Til the sunrise bleeds like the bitter end
Don't let me be lonely
Well, there's nothing to hide and nothing to prove
Give me all that you are
You've got nothing to lose
Just don't let me be lonely (Let me be lonely)
No, don't let me be lonely

[Chorus]
So don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh, don't let me, let me be lonely
No, don't let me be

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you're young
Life's a dream
It's a beautiful and a burning thing
We grow up
And then it's gone
But the memory goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
Don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh, don't let me, let me be lonely

401,El Perdedor,"Qué más quieres de mí
Si el pasado está a prueba de tu amor
Y no tengo el valor
De escapar para siempre del dolor
Demasiado pedir
Que sigamos en esta hipocresía
Cuánto tiempo más podré vivir
En la misma mentira

No, no vayas presumiendo, no
Que me has robado el corazón
Y no me queda nada más
Si, prefiero ser el perdedor
Que te lo ha dado todo
Y no me queda nada más
No me queda nada más

Ya no puedo seguir
Resistiendo esa extraña sensación
Que me hiela la piel
Como invierno fuera de estación
Tu mirada en la mía
Ignorándose en una lejanía

Todo pierde sentido
Y es mejor el vacío que el olvido

Yo prefiero dejarte partir
Que ser tu prisionero
Y no vayas por ahí
Diciendo ser la dueña de mis sentimientos

No, no vayas presumiendo, no
Que me has robado el corazón
Y no me queda nada más
Si, prefiero ser el perdedor
Que te lo ha dado todo
Y no le queda nada más

No, no vayas presumiendo, no
Que me has robado el corazón
Y no me queda nada más
Si, prefiero ser un perdedor
Que te lo ha dado todo
Y no le queda nada más
No me queda más...

Qué más quieres de mí
Si he pasado esta prueba de tu amor",Enrique Iglesias,Enrique Iglesias Featuring Marco Antonio Solis,2014,[85],1

God I miss when, you were mine

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin' bout you every time it came on

When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin' that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

403,Carolina,"Home is where my heart is still beating
I don't know when I'll see her again
I hate to see her cry when I'm leaving
But now I'm a thousand miles away again

She feels like Carolina
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
When she looks back I'm behind her
I'll always be there for her
She makes me feel like home's not so far away
She feels like Carolina

It's hard to understand the way I'm living
I know she thinks I'm never coming home (never coming home)
But I miss her pretty smile, and I'm coming back in a little while
But I'm a thousand miles away again

She feels like Carolina (feels like Carolina)

404,Radio,"[Verse 1]
Seventeen, the only way I had a car
Is after I dropped my mama off where she needed to go
Four bald tires, with the ceiling fallin' and the window stuck
But the only thing I cared about was the radio
We'd turn it on, turn it up to ten, and everybody would jump on in

[Chorus]
Riding down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio
Like a feel real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
Didn't have no money, no place to go
All we needed was a radio

[Verse 2]
I'd grab my girl, we'd look for somewhere to watch the stars
The perfect place to put it in park and take it slow
She'd sing along, to even the ones that she barely knew
She still sounded good, a little out of tune, but we didn't care
I'd look at her, she'd look at me, I'll never forget that melody

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Shhh, hey y'all be quiet
That's my favorite song
Hey man turn it up loud
Come on, come on, come on

Riding down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio
Like a feel real good song

Laying down on the bathroom floor

And I'll do everything I gotta do to get you off my mind

And you left me standing on a corner crying
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
'Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh, finally I'm through, wasting all these tears on you
Ohh, these tears on you

409,Drunk Last Night,"[Verse 1]
I got a little drunk last night
There's something 'bout a midnight rain
Staring at the ceiling fan
I couldn't get you off my brain
I guess I wasn't thinking straight
I couldn't tell wrong from right
I went ahead and called you up
I got a little drunk last night

[Pre-Chorus]
Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now?
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why

[Chorus]
Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night

[Verse 2]
I got a little too far gone
Heart was talking way too loud
I don't remember what I said
I just remember breaking down

[Pre-Chorus]
Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now?
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why

[Chorus]
Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a girl that looked like you
Might've been a fluke, might've been a full moon
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night

[Bridge]
Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a girl that looked like you

Might've been I got a little drunk

What a feeling I get when I throw up my pistols
From party, and bigger than life
50 bottles of Luminis
24 kick, pop my dollars, wake up for the night
Cameras flicking, I see me
You're fixing, I'm fixing my color
My natural height
She can get it, my whole click with it
No question, we are on the champion flight
This is how I ride, my passenger fly
We take off in London and land in the Dubai
This is a marriage, the music my ride
My life is so lavish, you don't recognize
So let's toast to a new day in Rochan
80 million they still rollercoasting
What's the recipe to this devotion?
I got the melody, sober like couches

Oh-eh-oh
Who told y'all the party's over?
Oh-eh-oh
Well, it ain't over till I told y'all
I feel my cup runnin' over
Tomorrow I  might be sober

415,Gas Pedal,"Okay, so I'm looking at the Rap Song charts for last week, trying to figure out what to review, and I gotta say, I'm kinda happy with the top 5. Holy Grail's not too bad of a song, and it's number one. And the next three slots are taken up by all three of Macklemore's singles, Same Love being number two, which is awesome. Now, what song rounds out the top five of this list? A song called ""Gas Pedal"", by Sage the Gemini, featuring… IamSu…? So, this guy's on a short list of people who thought it was a good idea to have their rap name be a short sentence. Isn't that right, Souljaboy Tell'em. *shows pic of Souljaboy* Well? Tell em! But for real, who is this Sage the Gemeni and why is his song so high on the charts? Can't be name recognition, because I don't know anyone who's heard of him before. In fact, I haven't even heard this song before, but hey, if it's this high, the guy must have a real explosive single on his hands. Lemme check it out real quick!

*2 minutes later*

Well, that was terrible. Let's make fun of it!

*video intro*

Ever get the feeling rappers are taking themselves way too serious?

*beat starts*

No, yeah, this cheesy, 4 note beat was totally worthy of that ominous intro

H-h-h-holy shit!

I guarantee you nothing in this song warrants that much enthusiasm

Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass fall off
Hella thick, I wanna smash them all, now
Speed up, gas pedal
Speed up, gas pedal [5x], now
Speed up, gas pedal [3x]

Remember when I said nothing in this song warrants that much enthusiasm. Yeah, Apparently Sage believes that, too. Really, are we still doing this ""drain the energy from your voice in order to sound cool"" thing? Because there's a difference between sounding like you're really cool, calm and in charge and sounding like you're... just really bored

I mean, dude, do you even wanna be here right now? Because, I don't need my party songs sounding like a mandatory activity that you're trying to get over with as soon as possible. At least when Tech N9ne puts on his serious voice, he still lets you know that whatever he's doing, he's liken' it

*""bout to Bubble"": We're smokin', and drinkin', and humpin', and likin' it""*

With this chorus, I just get this feeling like he's trying to sound all mature and unaffected by the very idea of fun, which sends me the wrong vibe, because the one person I don't want to hang out with at a party is the douche bag who wants to act like he's too good to show an emotion beyond, ""Maybe if I act like I don't care about anything, I can trick girls into thinking I'm interesting"". He does pick up some energy in the verses, though, but by then, the spiritless tone of the music has already taken precedent

Black money let them hoes say amen
I'm just tryna make it clear boy Ray-Bans

Sunglasses don't improve your eye sight; they actually make things dimmer. I suppose he could be talking about the branch of that company that makes eyeglasses, but that's not usually what people think of when you say Ray-bans. Also, you tried to rhyme ""amen"" with ""Ray-Bans"", so, no points for you

I'm a great man

Who are you REALLY trying to convince, Sage the Gemeni? Me, or your Dungeons and Dragons rap name?

I play a hole every night DJ amen

Huh. I figured a golf pun would be in order for that play on words

I'm S-A-G-E who would like to know?

Nobody, in about 3 months

Fee-Fi fo-fum large me in yo throat *laugh*

*Ugh...*

West-side baby do what you do
And you got tail, what that shit do

What's funny is that, the first line here just sounds like a set-up line, you know, like when someone thinks up a cool punchline, but they can't find a clever way to set it up in the lyric before it, so they just insert a throwaway line that rhymes with the funnier following punchline. Except here, it's like he somehow forgot what that punchline was, and just said another filler line in it's place, which is great, because now we have two lines that aren't interesting...

And you mad cause I spoon, but I don't give a fork
Silverware a nigga out if he actin' a poor spork

I would give this line more credit if he didn't rhyme fork with spork, used ""poor spork"" as a crappy play on words for ""poor sport""… and initially tried to justify his wordplay by awkwardly starting it with an out-of-place lyric where he brags about how dudes are mad that he ""spoons"". I mean, does ""spooning"" mean something else where this guy's from? Because as far as I can tell, he's bragging about guys being jealous of his cuddling abilities

Also, I gotta ask real quick: does anyone see a problem with the girls in this music video? Namely that they, uh… *shows girls stiff as statues* look, I'm not asking for you to show hardcore twerking or anything, but… for goodness sake's this is a music video for a song ABOUT girls shaking their asses! At least make it LOOK like somebody might want to dance to this! I mean, when you show all these girls in dark lighting, and posing like mannequins, I can't help but feel that it sends an even worse message. Like, these girls aren't allowed to have enough autonomy to at least LOOK as if they're having a good time. They can only be these sexy, expressionless trophies that he has in his collection. Say what you want about music video with girls in bikini's at backyard pools. At least it fits the mood! This, over all, is trying way too hard to be dark. You're a music video and song about girl's butts. Lighten up. No, seriously, I can barely make out what's happening in this video

Well, enough of that. Sage's verse is over, and now it's time for a boy named Su to spit his verse

She a trick for a dolla bill
And her boyfriend a bitch call him Tyler Perry... Eugh

Wow. Even YOU sound disappointed in that line. Like, Eugh… I didn't even try to rhyme that

I'm in the black bat lookin' scary
On my way to the cake no bake-ARY
Oops bakeries

Oh god, I hate when rappers do that: acknowledging that they said a word that ALMOST rhymed with the line before it, but instead of erasing it and starting again, they mispronounce it and then acknowledge their laziness with a cute little ""OOPS! I MEANT to say this, tee-hee,"" and then continue the rhyme from there. I remember Method Man used to do this sometimes

Method Man:
*""Protect Ya Neck"", ""Sub crazy""*

Oh yeah, and… some other guy did it sometimes, too…

Lil Wayne:
*""You Ain't Got Nothin'"" ""Barry Bonds"" ""Run this Town"" ""Mr. Carter""*

I mean ""bakery"", never been no fakary
Lead her to the bathroom, she askin' where you takin' me
Uh, tell her slow down baby
I'm too turned up, it's 'bout to go down, baby

Wait, why are you telling HER to slow down, she's the one trying to figure out where YOU'RE going. As well, I love how his response to her question is basically, ""Sorry, I'm too turned up, we have to have sex in this disgusting club bathroom. There ain't no other possible option!!!""

When you hit the stage the people do a 180

Are you still talking to that chick? …cause… you've given us no reason to think you're not still talking to that chick. And… it sounds like you're calling her ugly for some reason...

You niggas so fugazi got a white bitch with me call that ho slim shady

….Would… would your first name happen to be Stan? No, for real, what man refers to an attractive woman as a dude in any way, shape or form? And furthermore, why Slim Shady? Are there honestly… NO other famous white celebrities you could think of? Because, I think you're skipping a lot of details that go into people's heads when they hear someone make a comparison between two things. Because when you say that a girl reminds you of Eminem, the first thing I think is, ""What, is she some crazy chick who bashes gay people and fantasizes about killing her girlfriend? I mean, really, why him? Just because he's white, and the girl you're talking about is white? Screw it, then, why stop there? Just go all out!

My chick's white, REAL white: Adolf Hitler

Okay, I think we're done here. Overall, I'd give this song a 0 out of 5. To me, it feels like these guys are just a step below being genuinely clever. Like, they flirt with the idea of making puns that work, but there's just a fundamental misunderstanding of how their wordplay is actually effecting the listener that makes their attempts awkward and unintentionally funny as soon as you so much as take a second glance at it. And furthermore, I…

*the video shows the guy getting up, and the girl with the stocking on her face, I look confused*

*He moves her arm*

…What the hell is going on in this video?

*he lifts her face up*

Why is she wearing that thing on her face?… What IS that thing on her face?

*He moves her some more*

Didn't I say something about how it seemed like these girls were nothing more than mannequins to him?… Yeah…

*She's paused, and then starts dancing

Well, I got my wish of wanting to see some dance in this video...

* She then puts her head down again*

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem

417,Berzerk,"Hi, I'm the Rap Critic. And Eminem is BACK… again… Well, I mean, I guess he had to come back eventually. Either that or pretend to retire for couple days, like Jay-Z. Most rappers don't just stop rapping…  but the point is, he has returned with a new single

And, as you may know, Eminem's record for music has been a little… unreliable since about 2004. Encore, ironically, no one ever wanted to hear again and Relapse somehow ultimately ended up being worse, but Recovery was a welcome breath of fresh air, as his lyrics were tighter and well-thought out, especially after seeing how horribly he could fall into mediocrity. However, some people still had a problem with it. They felt that he was still complaining about his life too much and whatnot, which I don't see a problem with, because I feel like the tracks where he did go more into personal problems weren't that overbearing and properly updated us on what his life's been like, which is what he used to do on his older albums anyway! Anyone remember ""Rock Bottom"" or ""Cleaning Out My Closet"", or ""The Way I Am""? And besides, there really weren't THAT many glum, reflective songs on it anyways. I feel like people colored their perception of the album based on ""Not Afraid"", which was such a bold move in and of itself, because before then, the first single off of every one of Eminem's albums has always been a lighter, sillier song. However, the idea of Em coming back from two bad albums and then NOT giving us what we typically expect from him for the promotional single? It changed how people approached the album

However, for his new single, Berzerk, we're back to the silly lead single formula. And, to that end, although I miss old Eminem, I fear this possible regression, especially since his new album is called ""The Marshall Mathers LP 2"". Because… yeah, apparently, sequels to successful albums are a thing in rap now. Yep! Are you a rapper who's been in the game for a long time, but you don't know if the random selection of songs you've put on your new album will resonate with your audience? Just call it a sequel! Sure, the songs don't thematically relate to anything beyond the typical violence, cash, hoes anthems, and the first album… probably didn't have a main theme to begin with. But the point is, you've reminded fans and critics of your first, classic album, and now you will undoubtably have undeserved hype behind it, regardless of whether or not it's earned

Well anyways, the point is, Eminem's back with a new party single. But the question is: will it end up being a single that could be compared to the likes of ""The Real Slim Shady"" or ""Without Me"", or will he re-relapse into mediocrity once again. Well, let's see

@Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch@

Okay, well, let me say the first thing that I appreciate about this song: it has energy! I'm tired of party songs that are… well… *Gas pedal gas pedal*. This song sounds like Em is putting his heart into it, and that he wants you to feel the energy that he feels. The first lines of the song are basically, ""Man, this new stuff sucks! Let's REALLY get this party started!""

""I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag""

*looks weirded out* Was anyone else thrown off by that last part? Like, did Ad-Rock from the Beastie Boys take over his brain for a couple seconds? I mean, the lyrics were clever and whatnot, but… there was no reason why he had to say that like that...

""Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it""

Using a clever punchline on how he's about to rip the mic as a double entendre for how he's gotten over his addiction to drugs? I don't care what you say that's respectable AND badass. Although I can't help but notice that I'm starting to hear little remnants of the stupid accents coming back. I hope that stops… soon...

""Like a magician, critics I turn to CRICKETS""

Okay, I want to respect the wordplay here, but really, what's up with you over-emphasizing the punchline and putting on these vocal effects? Aren't you usually more of a quick-witted guy who's always skating from one joke to the next? Like, for a lot of Eminem songs, where he's just playing the role of a smart-ass, the jokes whiz by so quickly, sometimes, you're not even aware you just heard something supremely clever. With this song, it just feels like he's laying the punches on a little too thick, and it does a disservice to the overall presentation

""Got 'em still on the fence whether to PICK IT
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em STICK IT""

O-HO! DDI YOU SEE WHAT HE DID THERE!? ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN SO THAT THERE MAY BE NO AMBIGUITY, YOU SEE THE JOKE IS...

I can't believe I'm doing this, but I have to say, despite how bafflingly clever this is, I just feel like I'm being socked in the face by these punchlines. Maybe it's not him. Maybe he's just responding to the beat, which has a very direct, striking tone created by Rick Ruben, known for making harsher, crushing beats like his work with the Beastie Boys or his work on ""99 Problems"" by Jay-Z. But this beat feels too busy, and while I feel that Eminem's writing corresponds to the tone of the music, it feels like it doesn't trust the listener to want to hear Eminem's lyrics. But, like, it's Eminem: we're gonna hear you, dude. I dunno, maybe this is me nit-picking, and this is his new style, but it feels needlessly over-exaggerated

""So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my PIGMENT""

*act as if being blown back*

""'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to KENDRICK""

*act as if being blown back further*

""Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch""

See, right here, this is you doing what you do best: lacing lyric upon lyric with amazing wordplay, but, at the same time, every time he says ""bitch"", it feels like they were just superimposed on the track just to meet the cursing quota for every one of his songs

""[Bridge:]
Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), ALL NIGHT LONG""

*get blown back again* Are… are they still letting you sing?

""Grow your beard out""

…What?

""Grow your beard out""

Grow a beard? Was that line intended for ZZ Top over here? Because, I don't know who else that instruction would be for. I mean, I've heard party songs tell people to do some pretty outlandish things, but I gotta say ""grow a beard"" is quite possibly the most… inactive thing I've ever heard commanded of an audience. I mean, I know you're 40 tears old, but dude: I don't wanna hear the mundane things when you're bored in a party song

Grow your beard out… watch paint dry… (eat a box of oreos…) ALL NIGHT LONG
Watch home movies… maybe masturbate… fall asleep on the couch… ALL NIGHT LONG!

""So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go""

I feel like I should make fun of this joke because, I mean, who the hell cares about Kevin Federline anymore, but… *show picture of K-Fed* Dude, what the hell happened, man? Weern't you, like, a back-up dancer or something? How the hell did you develop that much of a dad belly?

""But girl your body's banging, jump me in dang, bang bang
Yes siree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang dang""

Well, this is kinda clever. I mean yeah, it doesn't do it too bad here, but in general, I'm not a fan of rappers repeating words and phrases in a verse for the sole purpose of filling up space...

""P-p-p-pow chicka pow chicka wow wow""

…like that…

""Got your gal blowin' up a val-v-v-v-val-valve""

Or that…

""Dumb it down, I don't know huh-huh, how, how""

No… no, I think ya do...

""At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid""

…ye… yes…?

""Hope so""

…Okay

""And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo""

Interesting thing about this line: some people think that this lyric is somehow dissing Ace Hood, because it's similar to the chorus of ""Bugatti""

*play ""I woke up in a new Bugatti""*

But honestly, I don't see it. This is Eminem, here, if he wanted to throw shots at someone, he'd do just that. THIS, is just making a comical parallel between Ace rapping about luxury and good fortune, and him rapping about waking up after sex in the back of a crappy old car. No, that's not a diss. THIS is a diss:

""Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records. Well I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too""

Hell, he makes an ACTUAL diss to someone in the VERY NEXT LINE

""All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low""

THAT is a diss. Why isn't anybody talking about that?!

""Far as hard drugs, are though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow""

And people think this is a diss to future, too, but I'm still sticking with my point: a play on words doesn't automatically equate to disrespect

""And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you a loan, CAR NOTE""

*get spit on my face from how intense he's saying that line*

""Girl you’re fixin' to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd, man
You bird-brained baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you’re a swallow""

Wow. I think that's the first time Birdman's been remotely involved in something you could call ""clever"". And for those of you who don't know, yes, there is a rapper named Birdman, also known as ""Baby"". And… *sigh* Look, dude, if you're a 44 year old man who shares your rap name with both a silly Adult Swim T.V. show AND a Justin Bieber song, dude… head back to the drawing board on rap names. Although, both those things came out after he chose those names. It's quite unfortunate, actually

""Word, Rick word man you heard, but don’t be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Kick your shores off, let your hair down""

I gotta say, that's a slick way of bringing it back to the bridge

Overall, I'd give this song a 4 out of 5. It's not gonna replacing any of his classic songs, any time soon, and to be real with you, I don't know if it has a lot of replay value for me, but he brought an energy and wittiness that put it miles ahead of anything in Encore or Relapse, and honestly, that's all I'm really looking for. Just knowing that he can still bring a certain flavor to Hip-Hop that puts him above the rest lyrically, despite some questionable parts concerning his delivery

But yeah, I find it to be a satisfactory piece that gave me the feeling that he was putting time and honest effort into his rhymes, and so in that sense, it succeeded for me

Well, I'm the Rap Critic, and I'm glad I can say that I'm positively looking forward to The Marshall Mathers LP 2. See ya later",Rap Critic,Eminem,2014,"[79, 67, 48, 77]",4

424,Perfume,"[Verse 1]
Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare?
Is there still longing there?
Oh, I hate myself and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale
Current girlfriend, ex girlfriend
I'm trying to be cool
I'm being paranoid, am I seeing things?
Am I just insecure?

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

[Chorus]
So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume

[Verse 2]
I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
Please, don't forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?
I know you got history
But I'm your girlfriend, now, I'm your girlfriend trying to be cool
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
That I'm just insecure

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

[Chorus]
So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory
So I, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume

Yessir...
I love the way she slow dance, she make me throw more bands
Grabbin' ass with both hands, she in love with the dope man
She wanna be my main chick, I was thinking different (different)
Clap that ass, light our blunt, baby, let’s get ig'nant (ig'nant)
She’s strips with the Gs, breaks cash like Li, she got double Ds, and ain’t shit free
Came with my goons but I’m leaving with a diva with an ass like Serena and a face like Aaliyah
Redbone in some red bottoms, she ain’t finished college, she a head doctor
Bouncing ass while I’m getting high as propellers on a helicopter
Let’s do it again, me, you and your friend
We don’t even need a room, give me head up in my Benz
Where my double cup, time to pour it up
Got a bitch so bad you can’t afford to fuck

Wale though, le'go...
Hands is on her you know what, ’cause bandz a make her you know what
And I can make a girl break fast, my pants be on that too much lust
And I’m ’bout whatever baby, take a photo, I’m looking good
And these breezies are so beneath you, understand you’re misunderstood
Premium leather goods, we pay whatever for it
All of these pussy niggas, only under influenced
Throw a block up then I back out, like that, roll a pack out, took a light hit, might nap
Got a thick bitch with a trip stick I’ma smack, and a bucket but we nothing but pack
Bald-headed scallywag, real niggas salute me
Catch me at that Memphis game, seats saved by Rudy
Or Mark Gasol, or Selby do, that’s plenty dough
That’s Juicy J, Folarin, got it then get me those
Ralph!

I’m about to throw a couple thousand

Turn up...
Juicy be trippy and paid up like Diddy, toss up that cash and she show me her kitty
Got some white girl and a white girl, doin' a tiny line off of her titty
Ain’t tryna fuck, I just found a replacement, feelin' so global, I think I need agent
Ratchet on deck and they know I’m gon’ stunt, I’m tryna get head while smoking a blunt
Take her to my hotel, beat the pussy up, I don’t know her name, but I wanna fuck
Along came Molly, then came Doobie, then codeine in a styrofoam cup
See me in the club, bands pop, they poppin', do it real good, might take you shoppin'
All these racks can’t fit in my pocket, keep that stack, hundred K in the stocking
Then it’s back to my room, she come out her dress
Slob on my knob, think you know the rest
I don’t buy these broads Nike, but I keep these girls in check
Working for that money, bitch, you gon’ have to break a sweat

426,Everybody's Got Somebody But Me,"[Verse 1: Hunter Hayes]
I wish the couple on the corner would just get a room
Seems like everyone around me's on their honeymoon
I'd love to take a pin to a heart-shaped balloon
Everybody's got somebody but me

[Verse 2: Jason Mraz]
I don't know how I landed on this movie set
It's like a casting call for 'Romeo and Juliet'
I never woulda noticed if we'd never met
But everybody got somebody but me

[Chorus: Hunter Hayes]
And I miss you
Without you, I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again

[Verse 3: Hunter Hayes & Jason Mraz]
I hear love songs playing on the radio
People slow dancing everywhere I go
Well, I'm a good slow dancer, but you'd never know
'Cause everybody's got somebody but me
Yeah, they do
Everybody's got somebody

[Chorus: Hunter Hayes & Jason Mraz]
And I miss you
Without you, I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again

[Verse 4: Hunter Hayes with Jason Mraz]
Sittin' here lonely at a table for two
Watching lovers being lovers in the corner booth
Seems like even cupid don't know what to do
Everybody's got somebody but me

[Bridge: Hunter Hayes with Jason Mraz]
Yeah, I don't know if I'll ever find another you
But everybody's got somebody but me
Everybody, got somebody
Oh everybody, everybody, everybody but me now

427,Old School Love,"Give me that old school love right now
You know that only you and me alone
As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
Give me that late 80's early 90's old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that O.G
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past, what's up
As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want it (Eh)
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past, what's up
As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If your life like Christ live your midlife like it's Christ-like
But nigga' I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school, what's up
Give me that old school love right now
I'm leaving it all up to you darling
Giving you everything you want
And give me that old school love right now
You know that only you and me alone
As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now",Old School Love,Lupe Fiasco Featuring Ed Sheeran,2014,"[97, 100, 93]",3

[INTRODUCTION]
Muggzy On The Beat Hoe

[VERSE: Muggzy Boagz]
Whistling dixie
Bitches all around, while I’m sipping on whiskey
Middle school thuggin’, had a bitch on the slide
Be your best friend, to get your sister aside
Her boyfriend’s gone, seen him leaving in the cab
Comes to me crying’,‘bout the reason that his mad
Pretend to listen for an hour, then we leaving to the pad
Roll that ass over, then I eat it from the back
VIP up in your party, with the baddest here
Bring ‘em back, acting like I’m cavalier
On my bed, setting up my camera gear
I don’t have light bulb moments, I have chandeliers
Getting high to fuck, bitches are kinky
G’s on repeat, like when I listen to Fifty
“Thats my girl!”, said I’m bringing her with me
She’ll be back in morning, breath stinking of whiskey
When these sluts around me, they know how to act
Occasionally I rap, so getting x’s in our chats
Your bea up on my lap, when she naked in my pad
She making that shit clap, when she take it from the back
Never judge a girl, by her profile pic
Just fishing for those likes, when they shows those tits
Filters all over, that photo clicked
Up in real life, you wouldn’t even know that bitch
Before I get a girl, living all my fantasies
First double check she looks the same up in reality
Thats the difference bruh, between you and I
You never come correct, I always do it right
Kissing on your girl, fuck the bro code bitch
Saying that I won’t, while she blows my dick
Shows her best parts first, like a promo clip
Fighting over bitches, is some homo shit
‘ish know my stance, won’t hold your hand
We won’t slow dance, theres no romance
Go back to ex man, go head fam
You been used & stretched out, like an old headband

Maybe it's the way she walked

She said, ""Never in your wildest dreams""

I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

441,Slow Down,"[Verse 1]
Now that I have captured your attention
I wanna steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA, I'm ready for inspection
Sh-sh-show me how you make a first impression

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
'Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
So you can't let me go

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

[Verse 2]
If you want me, I'm accepting applications
So long as we ke-keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazing

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
'Til you can't let me go

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

[Bridge]
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
The music's got me going
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
No stopping 'til the morning
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
You know I'm ready for it, for it, for it, yeah
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
The music's got me going
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
No stopping 'til the morning
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
You know I'm ready for it, for it, for it, yeah

[Interlude]
It's The Cataracts

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

442,Underneath The Tree,"[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 1]
Tonight, I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday
Alone to celebrate

[Pre-Chorus]
But then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 2]
I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Saxophone Solo]

[Bridge]
And then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree, yeah

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing (Oh, yeah, yeah)
It just wasn't the same (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight (Oh, you're all I need)
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight (Underneath the tree)
You're all that I need (Underneath the tree, yeah)
Underneath the tree, tonight
Oh, you're all I need
Underneath, underneath the tree",Kelly Clarkson,Kelly Clarkson,2014,[78],1
